Background

Born at the western edge of the
King Dragon Realm
 in a village bordering a dense forest. Her father was a hunter and taught her how to be one as well before he died due to an
Ibri Lizard
, while trying to find an Eant Flower, whose petals can cure Ibri disease. He was searching for this plant with the help of
Angelique Curenttale
's parents, who were apothecaries, to save his wife who had contracted the disease, which has a very high mortality rate after being infected for 10 days. Due to the circumstances of her parents' death, she felt guilty towards Angie, but soon grew extremely close with her and they became best friends.

Plot

Pham and Angie went on an expedition to collect the petals of an Eant Flower to cure the village chief's son,
Dochil
, who has Ibri Syndrome. As they collect the flower petals, they are attacked by the Ibri Lizard that lives near the flowers. Angie was paralyzed with fear as Pham was yelling at her to run away, and by the time Angie started fleeing the lizard had already nearly caught to Pham. It clamped down on her leg and flung her through the air, quickly moving on to Angie. However, at the last moment, Rudeus was able to fling the lizard away, and blow its head off with his Zaliff Guantlet. Rudeus walked with Angie while carrying Pham and headed back to her village. He cast multiple healing spells as he carried her to ensure she was safe and would not die, as Orsted had instructed Rudeus to save her.
