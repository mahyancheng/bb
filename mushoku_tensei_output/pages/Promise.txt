Rudeus Greyrat

Summary

When Rudeus finds Eris in his room, she apologizes for his family not coming to the party. To make up for it, she came to his room to sleep with him. Thinking it over, Rudeus concludes how it was more likely that Philip and Hilda, so he initially refuses by telling Eris that he might do something perverted to her. Eris replies that she would be fine with "a little", Rudeus's awkwardness ramps up and he mistakenly gropes her. Fearing a classic punch, Eris instead does nothing trying to be accepting. Rudeus forgets himself and continues, until Eris grows uncomfortable and beats him up repeating "no!" with each hit. She leaves his room, angrily reminding him she said a little before calling him an idiot. Hurt and on the floor, Rudeus can't help but agree with Eris, realizing he was acting like events were dating sims from his old life, ignorant to Eris's feelings after she worked so hard to celebrate his birthday. Hating himself, he prostrates as soon as Eris returns through the door and begs for her forgiveness. She forgives him since it's his birthday, but she also tells him it's too soon to be doing what he had in mind, so she promises to try again in five years when they're both adults. After she leaves, Rudeus is happy that he didn't lose his connection with Eris, and looks forward to that day in five years.
