Plot

At Ranoa Magic Academy, Rudeus spots and waves at Norn who is walking with her friends and returned the gesture then catches up to her friends. The siblings are later seen together working on a book about
Ruijerd Superdia
's life which is one of Rudeus' previous plan to help restore the
Superd Tribe
's reputation but Rudeus is struggling on how to present the story. Upon seeing that Rudeus only have Ruijerd's physical appearance in writing so far, Norn volunteered to help since Ruijerd told her about his past and Rudeus agrees as long as she can keep up with school.

That evening at the Greyrat House, after being asked by Rudeus, Aisha asks if she can be paid for her work.

At the Commerce District, Rudeus is shopping together with Aisha buys some seeds and Rudeus buys a pair of earrings for Sylphy. After seeing Aisha haggle the price of a curtain after name dropping his and
Ariel Anemoi Asura
's name, he is awed of her sister's business sense. On their way home, Aisha is told by her mother,
Lilia Greyrat
 that as a maid, she cannot own furnishings of her preference but Rudeus allows her to keep the curtains which she places in her room.

At Ranoa Magic Academy in Nanahoshi's Research Room, Nanahoshi discusses the 4 phases for her
Summoning Magic
: Summon an inorganic matter, organic matter, living organism, Summon an organism with detailed conditions and to return the summoned organism back to its original location. Nanahoshi also mentions that she needs to consult with the
authority of Summoning Magic
 sometime in the future. For assisting in the completion of the first phase of
summoning an inorganic matter
, Nanahoshi gives Rudeus a scroll containing a
Magic Circle
 to
Summon Lamplight Spirits
, a rare spell that is not known by the
Magician Guild
 which is invented by the authority of Summoning Magic and Nanahoshi intends to give Rudeus something even better when the next phase is complete.

At Zanoba's Research Room, Juliette is happy with the
Red Dragon
 figure Zanoba made for her. Ginger, who is once again serving Zanoba at her
mother
's request then brings them drinks and is also been teaching Juliette etiquette and continued her
Human Tongue
 training.

At Cliff's Research Room, Cliff shows a prototype of a
Curse Supressing Tool
 to extend the limit of effects of Elinalise's
Curse of Promiscuity
 but has 2 problems. First is its ugly appearance but with help from Zanoba and Nanahoshi, they can probably make it smaller. Second, it requires a huge amount of
Mana
 to which Rudeus agrees to provide.

Rudeus' everyday routine has been the same from working out, having meals, helping on his friends' research, help Norn on her studies and returning home until Sylphy tells Rudeus that she is pregnant which made Rudeus happy. That night, Norn congratulates the couple while Aisha informs them that she already told Rudeus' circle of friends and Elinalise will take over Sylphy's bodyguard duty to Ariel. Rudeus longed for his family to be reunited and living together in Sharia but he received a letter from
Geese Nukadia
 requesting assistance on rescuing
Zenith
.

At the Void World, Rudeus confronts Hitogami on regretting his decision on going to the Begaritt Continent but Hitogami insists that he will regret it all the same. After a couple more exchanges, Rudeus decides to stay in Sharia and wakes up from the dream where Sylphy is worried that he has been tossing and turning. Sylphy assures Rudeus not to worry about her but Rudeus tells her that he will stay.

Rudeus continues with his daily routine and reflects and the possibilities on why Geese sent him the letter. Rudeus also consults with his friends to which Elinalise agrees that he should stay but plans on going instead for her granddaughter's family's sake and will leave Cliff as he has the making of a future pope of the
Milis Religion
 and sees his love as youthful indiscretion. Zanoba advises Rudeus that he should make the decision on his own and while he is willing to join if he asks, he will slowdown Rudeus and he cannot take Juliette on such a long trip. Zanoba also advises him that children still grow when their father is not watching them but urges him to go if he is worried and he will watch over his family in his stead.

One morning, Rudeus while outside the house sees Norn packed and plans to leave in his stead. Rudeus tells her that she will not make it but Norn insists on going in tears since their mother and father are in trouble and Rudeus refuses despite being strong. Seeing Norn wanting to go badly but unable to, Rudeus decides to go and asks Norn to watch the house for him.
