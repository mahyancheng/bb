Summary

Chapter 1: Playing Dumb

''Note: This section is under construction and revision''.

Chapter 2: A Chess Problem

Rudeus, the next day, would meet with the Pope, where he explains to him about Zenith being abducted last night by the Latrias and seek help to find Zenith. The Pope, in return, would ask what Rudeus is willing to do for him. Rudeus responds, suggesting kidnapping the blessed child. Cliff tried to change Rudeus' mind, but Rudeus was angry because he couldn't let this go. The reason was that he couldn't let Zenith be treated like an object, as she couldn’t say no, and he wanted revenge against Claire. In the end, Cliff managed to change Rudeus' mind about the kidnapping and connect him with someone who could reach out to Claire. Rudeus would come to the realization that he should have contacted Therese first before approaching the pope.

Rudeus would try to meet with Therese by coming to the church garden every day, so as not to seem suspicious. The reason for this was that the Blessed Child rarely leaves the inner sanctum—only every few days is allowed to walk around the church garden. After finally meeting with Therese, she agreed to speak with Claire about the situation and even offered to talk with her father and brothers if Claire is reluctant to speak.

Extra Chapter: Therese Looks for a Husband

Therese has been visiting the Latreia mansion more often lately, and one day Claire asks her when she’s planning on getting married. Though Therese protests that the only reason she’s still single is because her mother hasn’t arranged a marriage meeting for her, Claire reminds her that Therese herself was the one who didn’t want to be caught up in a power struggle, and Claire was merely respecting her wishes. Resigned to the fact that she’ll never find a partner without her mother’s assistance, Therese agrees to go through a marriage meeting.

The candidate is Dusklight Moorkite, a 27-year-old templar. Having prepared for the worst, Therese is satisfied with his background heading into the meeting, but she freezes up upon seeing his face. It’s Therese’s coworker, Dust Box of Anastasia Keep. Anastasia Keep was formed as a group of anonymous knights to prevent foreign spies from targeting their families; thus, Therese didn’t know about Dusk’s true identity before the meeting. Although she realizes that the marriage meeting itself is jeopardizing their jobs, Therese decides to seduce Dust, pretending she doesn’t know him. Dust, sees through her act and rejects her advances, demanding an explanation. Therese says that she now has no choice but to discharge Dust from Anastasia Keep for the Miko’s safety… unless Dust gets married to her and protects her from any potential assassins. Dust says that it wouldn’t be feasible… because if he were threatened by assassins, he would slaughter all his family members so they wouldn’t become hostages. Therese, remembering that all the Anastasia Keep knights are Millis fanatics, cools her head, and the two agree to call off the marriage.

Returning to the Latreia mansion, Claire begins lecturing Therese, claiming that Dust wasn’t suited to be a Latreia family member’s husband. Therese resolves to do better next time, praying that her next candidate won’t be as poor of a match as Dust was.
