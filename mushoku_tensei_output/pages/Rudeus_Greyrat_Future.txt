"There are three things you should do. Consult with Nanahoshi. Send a letter to Eris. Doubt Hitogami, but don't oppose him. That's all."

Rudeus to his past self

Future Rudeus
 is the alternate future self of
Rudeus Greyrat
.

Appearance

He is tall, well-built and cool-looking man. He was born with brown hair, He also has slightly mismatched eyes, because he switched one of his eyes for a demon eye.

Appearing as an old man from the future to
Rudeus
 after using time travel magic. He is missing the bottom half of his body from below his stomach and is missing many organs as a result of his magic not sufficient in allowing him to make the large time jump in one go.

Personality

Future Rudeus became dejected with the death of
Roxy
 and always spent his time drinking and sleeping with different women. He was afraid to sleep with
Sylphy
 since he thought that he will just end up venting his frustration on her, which only caused to further drive her away.

After the death of Sylphy, his personality took an easy 180 and changed drastically. A person who would try his best to protect his marriage vow was lost. He would become so twisted that he's not above rape. A person who was once a pacifist and disgusted at murder, was lost. Bent on revenge, the only thing he cares for is to get revenge on
Hitogami
, and he hurts many people on his path of revenge.

Background

Future Rudeus was
Rudeus
 from the future, he came back into the past to prevent the actions that led to what happened to himself. After the events of the demon lord
Atofe
, Future Rudeus was visited by
Hitogami
 who told him to go downstairs and check if there was something off in the basement, which he did and found nothing. What happened though, a rat infected with
Petrification Syndrome
 that was roaming about in the basement was unleashed into the house and infected some leftover food, which Roxy later ate. Roxy became sick, and regular Detoxification magic wouldn't work, only God-tier Detoxification magic would work. Thus future Rudeus,
Cliff
, and
Zanoba
 snuck into the Church to learn God Detoxification magic, which ended up being a whole book, and was too long to remember, so they ended up having to steal it. However they were easily found, but they were able to make it out with the book. Cliff was poisoned during the escape, and died a few days later.

When future Rudeus returned, Roxy had already succumbed to the illness and died. This devastated future Rudeus and set him on a dark path. Around this time,
Eris
 came back after 5 years of training, but Rudeus thoughtlessly drove her away. Sylphy tried to comfort him desperately, but Rudeus refused it due to a heavy drinking habit, and ended up sleeping with a whore. Sylphy found out about this when he came home and smelled like another woman, and stopped talking to him, and eventually left him to rejoin
Ariel
, that was on her way to the
Kingdom Of Asura
, after
Hitogami
 supposedly influenced
Luke
 to propose the idea.

When Rudeus finds out
Sylphy
 left, he goes to follow her hoping to apologize and make up, but finds that
Sylphy
 followed
Ariel
 back to the kingdom, and after having a hard time at the border, he was smuggled in by
Tris
, Rudeus heard a rumor Ariel was planning a coup, which he at first chose not to believe, then he found
Sylphy
 and
Luke
 murdered by
the Water God
 and a
North Emperor
, who were royal guests at the time, while
Ariel
 was captured during the attempted coup.

Rudeus starts killing indiscriminately and changed to be bent on the revenge of
Sylphy
,
Roxy
, and all others who were killed unfairly.
Eris
 would come again and again only for him to drive her away again and again. Eventually
Zanoba
,
Julie
,
Ginger
 and
Aisha
 were murdered by the church of Milis, and future Rudeus personally massacred all templar knights in Ranoa.

Going down on this path, Rudeus hunted anything
Hitogami
 related, including the likes of Demon Kings, and it is implied that he killed a lot of people, weak or strong, in his quest to learn more, only to learn nothing. Before he knew it, he was an old man and when he finally found the information on how to defeat
Hitogami
, he learned that he would not be able to do it in his lifetime. Finally at the end of his life, he was able to learn how to time travel and traveled back to the past before
Roxy
 died, and informed his past self of all of this information.

Unfortunately the time travel trip left him missing a lot of organs and mana, thus he died to his injuries, but not before giving
his past self
 advices and a guilt-ridden diary.

Legacy





Orsted and Rudeus discussing the diary's content



After conducting an autopsy on Future Rudeus' body, Rudeus burned his remains and places the ashes in an urn to be buried in the same place with
Paul Greyrat
.

Rudeus confirms the truth in his words by going to the basement and kills the magic stone disease infected mouse that has violet crystal teeth that would have killed Roxy and the
baby
 in her womb.

After sealing the mouse's remains in a box made from Earth Magic, Rudeus sends it to the Magic Guild for study.

By heeding the advise to not oppose Hitogami, Rudeus is able to negotiate with him on the condition to kill
Orsted
 and also receive advise from him on how to make the Magic Armor described on Future Rudeus' diary.

By consulting with
Nanahoshi
 and showing her the diary, Nanahoshi agrees to cooperate with Rudeus, able to theorize the reason on why she failed on returning back to her original world and also advises Rudeus to consult with Orsted.

By sending a letter to Eris, she is able to join Rudeus on his second battle against Orsted, clear the misunderstanding between them and become his wife.

After becoming Orsted's subordinate, Rudeus shows Orsted the diary and is able to make plans on making
Ariel Anemoi Asura
 the next
Asura Kingdom
's queen and discover the fate of
Tristina Purplehorse
 after the
Teleport Incident
.

Through information from the diary, Rudeus is able to convince
Ghislaine Dedoldia
 to ally with Ariel and help uncover who is behind
Sauros Boreas Greyrat
's death.

The diary also contains information about mercenaries hired by
Darius Silva Ganius
 such as
Auber Corvette
 and
Reida Reia
 who are also Apostles of Hitogami.

Power and Abilities

『
Demon Eye: Foresight
』

It's a
Demon Eye
 that
Kishirika
 gave to Rudeus for giving her food. It allows the user to see a certain amount into the future. But it is hard to adjust the focus point, the farther he looks into future the more possibilities appear.

The
Demon Eye
 is activated using Rudeus' magic power, the more he inputs the farther he can see into future.

『Voiceless Incantation』

Rudeus is one of the few people capable of using voiceless incantation. He cannot use chantless incantation for healing magic. A normal Magician takes at least 5 seconds to cast a simple spell, and for higher level spells its 30-60 seconds. Rudeus can do it almost instantly no matter the difficulty of the spell.

『Magic』

While Rudeus is a pacifist and doesn't like fighting in general, when he does, he is a formidable opponent. Most of the spells he uses a lot, like Stone Cannon, have been stated by
Badigadi
 to have emperor level of power. Initially, during his childhood, he trained under Water Saint Magician Roxy to become a Water Saint Magician himself. However, he eventually shifted to using earth magic, relying on the easy versatility and power of spells like Stone Cannon and Quagmire. His efforts eventually landed him the epithet of "Quagmire". His total magical power has been stated by
Orsted
,
Kishirika
,
Badigadi
, and
Perugius
 to be similar to that of
Laplace
.

Future Rudeus was strong enough to look down on Demon King
Atofe
, which almost became his downfall as her retainer Moore also turned out to be formidable.

『Time Travel Magic』

Through the dragon god research, Rudeus was able to figure out a way to propel himself to the past, though ordinarily that requires an insane amount of mana. Unfortunately it was a one way trip, and he succumbed to his injuries.

『Gravity Magic』

He demonstrated the ability to use gravity magic by closing a door and lifting an inkwell. He can also fly using this magic by lowering the gravity.

『Electricity Magic』

He demonstrated the ability to use electricity magic. When his fist quivered and encircled it with cracking coiling purple lighting.

Afterward, he struck the desk and purple lighting scattered through the surrounding area with bright light and quickly faded. Leaving a burn mark on the desk.

『Electric』

Realizing that『Lightning』might be a bit overkill as a single target spell, Rudeus weakened the King-class Water magic. Rudeus was able to use Voiceless incantation to create a miniature thundercloud, compressing it, and designating a target for『Lightning』. In order to distinguish it from the normal overpowered spell, he named it『Electric』. The Electric strike is hard to avoid and can numb the nervous system, making it a very useful spell against people who can wear Touki. It is effective against the Immortal Demon Race as demonstrated in the battle against
Atofe
.

『Howling Magic』- Voice Magic

Howling is a type of magic that can locate or paralyze enemies by using sound as a medium, but dark future Rudeus can only use it to surprise or scare opponents; he name this new ability voice magic. He probably learned it from
Gustav Dedorudia
.

『Nuclear Explosion』

Rudeus created in a desperate attempt during his fight against
Orsted
. By focusing a tremendous amount of magic power at a designated area, he creates a huge explosion around his pinpointed target and leaves behind a mushroom-like cloud similar to a nuclear explosion.

『Ran Ma』- Disturb Magic

It is a unique magic that Rudeus learned from observing
Orsted
 in their first fight, it works by interfering with the magic of opponent disturbing it and preventing it from working. This is a very rare and possibly difficult technique as
Sylphiette
, a talented mage in her own right, had a lot of trouble learning it, and had not heard of it either.

『Light Spirits』

Rudeus can make a light spirit scroll to use them to summons bright light spirits as a source of light.

『Sword Techniques』

Intermediate-ranked
Sword God Style

Elementary-ranked
North God Style

Elementary-ranked
Water God Style

Since Rudeus cannot make use of Battle Aura, he cannot rise to Advanced ranked Sword Techniques.

Trivia

Although he succeeded in going back to the past, but most of him (organs) didn't make it through due to insufficient mana.
Rudeus
 mused that he could've avoided the problem by segmenting his time travel, allowing his mana to recover in between
.

He was arrogant contrary to what
Rudeus
 always says that it would cause him if he becomes arrogant.

Rudeus
 believed that Rudeus(future) was really himself because future Rudeus introduced himself with his name from his past life, and making various pop culture references that only people from modern earth could possibly know.

He and
Eris
 had a love and hate relationship where she would beat him within inches of his life but would also save him from the shadow in a pinch. In the end, they never properly made up and Future Rudeus regretted it, telling
his younger counter
 part to make a point of apologizing to
her
 first.
