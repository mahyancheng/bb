Paul Greyrats
 horse and the only horse of the family.

It didn’t have a particularly impressive pedigree or anything but Paul went through a lot over the years with the horse and loved it dearly, second only to Zenith. He tended to it every day and would occasionally take it out on long rides with a bright smile on his face.
