 anime series originally broadcasted on August 6, 2023.

Synopsis

After receiving a letter of invitation and Hitogami's advice, Rudeus decided to enter Ranoa Magic Academy accompanied by Elinalise where unique students called "
Special Students
" gather. When he arrives at the university, he faces a mock battle with one of the current students as an exam. His opponent is one of the Special Students named Fitts, who is a chantless magic user like Rudeus.

Plot

Rudeus
 arrives at the university, where his ability to silent cast is tested in a mock duel against another silent caster, Fitz, who Rudeus does not realize is
Sylphie
 in disguise. Rudeus easily defeats Fitz and is accepted as a student along with
Elinalise
.

After attending a speech by
Ariel
, who is the student council president, Rudeus attends his homeroom class. There, he reunites with
Zanoba,
 as well as meets his fellow classmates like Gyes' daughter
Linia Dedoldia
, beastgirl
Pursena
, and self-proclaimed magical genius
Cliff Grimoire
, who tells him he knows Rudues because of
Eris
, but hasn't seen her for a long time. He also learns Fitz is part of his class, but rarely attends.

After a brief encounter with Fitz, Rudeus meets
Luke
, who reveals he is also a Greyrat and Rudeus' cousin. Luke proceeds to tell him he's forgetful, indirectly mentioning that for not realizing Fitz's true identity as Sylphie, but Rudeus is oblivious to what he means by that.

Later, while Rudeus is on his way back to his dorm, Fitz accidentally drops Ariel's panties from a window, which Rudeus catches. The female students then confront Rudeus, accusing him of being a panty thief, and the dorm teacher attempts to punish him, but Fitz arrives to defend Rudeus, forcing the teacher and the mob to stand down by threatening them with violence and injury. She begrudgingly lets Rudeus go with a warning. Fitz apologizes for getting Rudeus into trouble, but Rudeus thanks Fitz for helping him, and Fitz decides to tease Rudeus by not telling him her true identity.
