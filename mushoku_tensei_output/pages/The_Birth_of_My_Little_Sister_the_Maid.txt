 anime series originally broadcasted on November 28, 2021.

Synopsis

The third prince of Shirone and Pax's brother, Zanoba, appears in front of Rudeus, who has been caught by Pax and confined in a room as bait to lure Roxy. Zanoba takes out an object and asks Rudeus a question. The situation takes an unexpected turn... On the other hand, Eris and Ruijerd hear that Rudeus has been captured and head to the rescue.

Plot

While waiting in his cell, Rudeus is met by Shirone's third prince, Zanoba, who idolizes him for making such lifelike sculptures of Roxy and Ruijerd and seeks to become his apprentice. When Rudeus explains that only Pax can undo the seal on his cell, Zanoba promises to resolve the situation. Meanwhile, Pax's guards smuggle Ruijerd, Eris, and Aisha into the palace in return for rescuing their families, who are being held hostage by Pax. Zanoba then captures Pax, with Aisha revealing Zanoba is a Blessed Child who was born with superhuman strength and is known as the Decapitator Prince. Zanoba coerces Pax into freeing Rudeus while Pax's guards refuse to help the moment they hear their families are safe. Afterwards, Lilia and Aisha are arranged to be sent home, and Lilia returns Roxy's panties to Rudeus and gives him a necklace Sylphiette made for his tenth birthday. Rudeus then gifts his forehead protector to Aisha as a keepsake. As she leaves, Aisha apologizes to Rudeus for calling him a pervert, revealing she knew his true identity all along. Meanwhile, Pax and Zanoba are exiled from the Shirone Kingdom due to the scandal under the guise of studying abroad.

A short scene where Zanoba shows the box of Lilia and its content was cut.

In the light novel, the scene where the shirone kingdom guards ask Ruijerd and Eris for help to rescue their families was off screen.

In the light novel, The description of Zanoba as a blessed child and his past was an inner monologue of Rudeus.

More detailed info of Zanoba's past and an explanation of how the Royal system of shirone work was cut.

In the light novel, when he brought Pax to Rudeus, Zanoba killed some guards in his way and also appeared two princes of Shirone following him.
