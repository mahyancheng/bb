Seven Great Powers motif in the
Anime



The
Seven Great Powers
 (
七大列強
,

Nana Dai-Rekkyō
)
 refers to the seven strongest warriors in the world, a selection of seven people that came to exist following the end of the
Second Human-Demon War
.

History

Establishment

When the Second Great Human-Demon War came to a conclusion, a person known as the
Technique God
 came up with the name. At that time, Technique God was considered to be one of the strongest people in the world. Technique God selected six more people and declared them to be the strongest in the world.

Post-Laplace War

The title of the Seven Great Powers was well known until the Laplace War. All original Seven Powers participated in the Laplace War, with the exception of Technique God. Among them, three were killed, one went missing, and another was sealed away. The Dragon God was the only one who came out of the War with a definite living-status. After hundred of years, with those at the bottom swapping spots and the top four having unknown status to the people, the title fell out of use.

Monuments

Millis Continent



In order to spread the name of the seven strongest across the world, stone monuments were scattered around the world in places where
mana
 concentration was high. The monument is of knee-height and a single character "7" is inscribed at the middle in the Fighting God language. The seven respective motifs of the Great Power surround the "7" character starting with the rank one motif being situated above the "7" character then sequentially going clockwise are the rest of the Great Power's motif. The stone automatically updates itself when a new Power enters the ranks with their respective motif.

Trivia

It was believed the Technique God created this system so that he could find people capable of defeating him.

After the
Laplace War
, people began to doubt whether the Technique God even really existed at all.

Even though the Seven Power holders are said to be the absolute strongest of the world, there is further division within the group. The first four ranks (1-4) are referred as the "upper" ranks and the remaining three ranks (5-7) are referred to as the "lower" ranks. There is a very large difference in strength between the fourth (Demon God) and the fifth (Death God).

The ranking only changes when someone on the ranking is defeated or dead. As a result, the ranks are not directly correlated to their combat prowess.

The Technique God holds the #1 position despite
Orsted
 being stronger, because he is missing and not defeated.

Randolph Marianne
 is said to be weaker than the Sword God, Water God and North God due to staying out of combat for a significant amount of time
, yet he still holds a higher rank.

Prior to Demon Dragon King Laplace being split into two different beings, the Seven Great Powers ranking system had not yet been established. As such, Laplace as the Demon Dragon King is not part of the Seven Great Powers, yet takes two separate seats as two different beings after the creation of the ranking system.

Rudeus Greyrat is the only person who does not have the title of "God".
