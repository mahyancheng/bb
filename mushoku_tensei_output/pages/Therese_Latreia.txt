)
 is the sister of
Zenith Greyrat
 and the aunt of
Rudeus Greyrat
 and
Norn Greyrat
. She is the third daughter of
Claire Latreia
 and
Carlyte Latreia
.

Appearance

Therese has a striking resemblance to her sister
Zenith
, to the point where
Rudeus
 got her confused with his mother on their first meeting but notices that Therese's hair and the position of her mole is different from Zenith.

Personality

She is a devout believer of the
Milis Religion
 and is a knight of the
Order of the Temple
. Although she is part of the
Cardinal Faction
, she does not hate the Demon Race and is relatively tolerant to them.

She is relatively easygoing and cheerful, often playing the role of a doting aunt towards
Rudeus
. She had unwavering loyalty towards Milis, not even hesitating to strike against her own family as long as the order was given.

She is strong willed and holds her own beliefs, not afraid to speak up or take a stand against those that say otherwise.

Background

She was raised under the strict upbringing by
Claire Latreia
 who was very disappointed that Zenith ran away, often expected to excel at various places. To meet her mother's expectation towards her, she had excelled in both academics and etiquette. Despite her mother's strong opposition, she went on to being a Temple Knight although her mother thought women were unfit for such roles.

Plot

She first appeared when
Eris
 go to hunt goblins in Milis Kingdom. She was saved by
Eris
 from the
Pope Faction's
 assassins.
 Later, she helped
Rudeus
,
Eris
, and
Ruijerd
 to pass the West Port.

In
Volume 21 - Young Man Period - Cliff Chapter
, she make a comeback and often advises and helps
Rudeus
 in the course of retrieving
his mother
,
Zenith Greyrat
.

She had even tried to persuade
her mother
,
Claire Latreia
 to free
Zenith Greyrat
, even to the extent of calling her brother and father to help with the matter.

During that timeframe, she was a guard to the
Miko of Memory
 and had taken part in the trial where
Rudeus
 was framed for wanting to kidnap the Miko. She had faced
Rudeus
 in a short battle with the [Defence of the Holy Sepulcher (Anastasia)] although she had showed signs of being unwilling.

She was later exiled to another place for failing to protect the Miko from the kidnapping and demoted from her rank as a Miko's guard to a sub-captain of another division. However,
Rudeus
 signs a petition formed by the rest of the Miko's guard in order to lighten her punishment. As a result she is still demoted but is allowed to continue guarding the Miko while under a new superior. This is shown when, after being requested by
Rudeus
,
Eris
 finally reunites with the Miko she saved years ago.
