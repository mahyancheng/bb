Chapter 1: Roxy's New Job

The chapter opens a couple months later after the return from the
Begaritt Continent
.
Rudeus
 and
Roxy
 wake after their night together. A flashback occurs and takes place a month after the return from the Begaritt Continent. Roxy tells Rudeus that she wants to become a teacher at
Ranoa Magic Academy
. They decide to head to the school in order for Roxy to become a teacher. When they arrive at Vice Principal
Jinas
 office, they see him at his table with piles of paperwork as usual. Upon seeing Roxy, his old student, Jinas was shocked. Roxy tells Jinas that she wants to become a teacher much to Jinas surprise. As they start talking, Rudeus leaves the room as he felt left out in the conversation. Rudeus heads to Zanoba’s research room.
Zanoba
, upon seeing Rudeus is shocked as just 6 months ago Rudeus told Zanoba he was going to come back in 2 years. Zanoba shows Rudeus what he’s been working on for the past half year. It was a glove like magic tool that can be used as a left hand for Rudeus which he had lost. Rudeus comes up with
Zariff’s Prosthetic Hand
 as a name for the hand since Zanoba and Cliff worked to make it. After a bit of talking, Roxy enters the room and tells Rudeus that she got the job. After, Rudeus goes around and introduces Roxy to his friends such as
Rinia
,
Pursena
,
Ariel
,
Luke
 and
Nanahoshi
. He didn’t go to Cliff because there were sultry sounds coming from his room and didn’t want to interfere. They leave school and head home but Rudeus realizes that’s he didn’t introduce Roxy and his wife. Rudeus says that he will eventually introduce her as his second wife.

Chapter 2: Year Three

Rudeus
 gets up and gets prepared to go to
school
 for his third year. Before anything, he takes a look at his daughter
Lucy
. Rudeus had thoughts of Lucy being someone reincarnated but quickly brushed that aside. They also hire a nurse to take care of Lucy when they’re at school. They eat breakfast and head to the school. At the entrance, they encounter
Rinia
 and
Pursena
. Upon hearing about Rudeus’s second wife, they tell
Sylphy
 to not get outclassed. Sylphy makes a expression that’s shows discomfort and Rudeus thought that she was feeling uneasy on the inside. Loudly, Rudeus announced that he loved Sylphy and the people cheered. He then said that he also loved
Roxy
 which most people booed at since most of the people were believers of Millis. Slyphy, visibly embarrassed, hurries to get to her duties. It was at this point that Rudeus remembered that in school she was Fittz. Roxy also hurries away after finding out there was a morning gathering for teacher. Rudeus then heads to homeroom. He then finds out from Rinia and Pursena that there are many rumors going around on how Rudeus lost his left hand.
Cliff
 then calls Rudeus over and asks why he hadn’t greeted him upon his return. Rudeus states that it was because he sounded really busy with
Elinalise
 so he decided not to bother. The homeroom teacher walks in with Roxy and states that Roxy will be their homeroom teacher next year as he is returning to his hometown. Roxy introduces herself as “Roxy M. Greyrat” and also says that she was Rudeus’s second wife. Cliff was visibly upset upon hearing the news however, since Rudeus wasn’t a Milis believer, he calmed down. Later, Rudeus heads home with Sylphy and Roxy. Rudeus then describes his life at home afterschool. Roxy prepares for her classes tomorrow,
Aisha
 makes dinner, Sylphy cuddles with Lucy but occasionally trains her magic and
Lilia
 took care of
Zenith
. When everyone was asleep at night, Rudeus sneaks into the basement, into a secret room to pray in front of the “holy relic”.

Chapter 3: Training with Norn

The chapter opens a month later.
Rudeus
 is seen waking up and grabbing a stone sword he had made to use as a practice sword.
Norn
, in her gym outfit goes outside to train with Rudeus. They do workouts just so that they can get Norn’s body in shape and ready to learn the sword. After the workout, Norn asks Rudeus if she could start learning the sword. Rudeus thought for a second and then agreed but warned Norn that he was going to be strict. Norn agreed. In the evening, Rudeus and Norn is seen in the third external training ground near
Ranoa Magic Academy
. Rudeus warns Norn on quitting learning the sword, which includes the fact that Rudeus won’t teach her again and that Rudeus would never allow Norn to use
Paul’s
 sword. They start by running with a sword in hand as in a battlefield, you need to know how to run fast with a sword in hand. Rudeus also discovered that Norn is reluctant to hitting someone with full force so Rudeus offers to stand still and be a dummy for Norn. Eventually, she gets rid of her reluctance to hit people. They spar at the end which Rudeus wins without even trying. As Rudeus was applying healing magic to
Norn
, he spots a bunch of onlookers. Rudeus tells Norn to leave and change. He then walks over to the onlookers and asks what they were doing. They were all scared to speak at first but one of them eventually said something. He said that Rudeus was bullying Norn as she never expressed the want to learn how to use the sword according to him. He also stated that he forced Norn to learn the sword. Rudeus quickly clears up the misconceptions telling them that she was his sister and that she’s training by her own will.
Rudeus
 discovers that this group of onlookers was like a fan club for Norn.
Rudeus
 establishes a fan club for Norn consisting of around 30 members and also making rules on contacting Norn. Three days later, Rudeus was kicked out of the fan club for bathing with Norn.

Chapter 4: Can I Keep Him?

Aisha
 was seen in the garden caring for the plants with
Zenith
. They were pulling out weeds.
Rudeus
 then remembers a time when Zenith would always spend her time pulling out weeds from her garden. Aisha then tells Rudeus to wait in her room because she wants to show him something. Later, Rudeus goes to Aisha’s room. He looks around the room and notes what’s inside. He stated that the room was perfectly clean from top to bottom. He also states how there were plants near the window and how there was a doll that’s looked like a magician on her bed. He also checked out her closet which has maid clothes, panties, shirts and other girly clothes. All of them were neatly folded or hanged. Suddenly, Rudeus hears sound coming from somewhere. He looks everywhere until he finds out that one of the plants was a
Treant
. Aisha then enters the room. They argue about whether or not to keep the Treant. Aisha threatens to tell
Sylphy
 and
Roxy
 about the hidden shrine in the basement. Just then, Roxy walks into the room. Aisha was about to tell Roxy about the shrine but was stopped by Rudeus with his hand. Roxy looks at the Treant and was amazed. Roxy states that the Treant was harmless meaning Aisha could keep it. They decided to name it
Baby Treant
 or
Beet
 for short. Rudeus established rules such as not letting Beet near
Lucy
, training it to not hurt anyone, everyone must be informed on what the plant is and it must be disposed immediately if it hurts anyone.

Chapter 5: Paternal Dignity

Three months pass and it’s the summer.
Rudeus
 is looking at
Lucy
 thinking about
Paul
. He thinks that he finally understands what it means to be a father. He also wonders if this is what Paul felt like when he had Rudeus. Suddenly, Lucy starts to cry. Rudeus tries to calm her down by making faces like his father had done.
Suzanne
, the nurse and Rudeus’s old adventure friend, walks up to them. After exchanging a couple words, Suzanne says it was time to breast feed Lucy so Rudeus goes into his room to study the
mana
 absorbing magic stone he got from when they fought the Hydra. He figured out that in order for the mana absorption to work, you need to put mana in the back of the stone. However, the amount of mana needed needs to be more or equal to the amount of mana the spell or magic circle has. It was like distortion magic but better since it can dispel completed spells. After,
Zanoba
,
Ginger
, and
Julie
 arrive at the
Greyrat
 household. Zanoba tells Rudeus about the progress he’s made on investigating the automatic doll. He says that he has finished investigating the hands and are now moving onto the feet. He also tells him that he has to make a new prosthetic hand from scratch which could take a month. Then, Julie goes up to Rudeus and gives him a doll of
Ruijerd
 she was assigned to make. Rudeus notes on how Julie had improved. They also talk about
Norn
, who seems to have a hidden talent for writing. She wrote a story on Ruijerd and Julie can’t stop asking Rudeus to read it to her. It is revealed that Rudeus wants
Roxy
 to teach him King ranked water magic.

Chapter 6: A Water King is Born

At school, lustful noises can be heard from a gym locker room.
Roxy
 runs out the the gym locker as the student council arrive on the scene.
Luke
 and
Fittz
(aka Sylphy) arrive and Luke says that
Rudeus
 was attacking a “female student”. Luke hands the situation to Fittz to deal with. Fittz sighs as she tells Roxy that many people still don’t know that Roxy is teacher. Fittz also scolds Rudeus for what happened. Fittz thought that Rudeus was trying to seduce Roxy but then realizes that Rudeus was just trying to get Roxy to teach him King ranked water magic. Roxy didn’t want to because she was scared that her student would become better than her but she agreed eventually. Later in the day, Rudeus,
Sylphy
, and Roxy head out the the outskirts to learn King ranked water magic. Roxy demonstrated the King ranked water magic [
Lightning
]. It starts as the Saint ranked water magic [
Cumulonimbus
] but after a few more
incantations
, lightning struck a tree completely disintegrating it. Roxy then fell as the spell used up all her magic. Rudeus tries to use the spell. He uses it without any problems. Sylphy also tries but failed on the last part. After this, Rudeus officially becomes a King ranked water magic user. As they were riding home, Roxy and Sylphy are both visibly exhausted. On the way home, Rudeus thinks about what had happened throughout his life. He also creates a weaker version of [Lightning] called [Electric] for numbing the nervous system of his opponents.

Chapter 7: The Wedding Ceremony

The chapter starts after they get home.
Rudeus
 decides to sleep in another room separate from
Roxy
 and
Sylphy
 as he knows they are tired and unwilling to do “things”.
Aisha
, seeing Rudeus going to sleep alone, invites him to sleep with her (NOT SEXUALLY). To Rudeus’s surprise,
Norn
 also wanted to sleep with him (ALSO NOT SEXUALLY). As he sleeps, he thinks about the relationships he has with Roxy and Sylphy. Being the pervert he is, he wants to have a threesome with them. The next morning, he goes to
Cliff
’s laboratory. When he walks in, he sees Cliff researching how to remove curses and
Elinalise
 sitting near a window. Cliff was researching the mana absorbing magic stones. Ryder’s brings up the wedding of Cliff and Elinalise and offers to help but was rejected as Cliff wanted to do it himself. Rudeus starts talking to Elinalise and she brings up the topic of a threesome with him, Roxy, and Sylphy. Rudeus denies it at first but after hearing that she could make it happen, Rudeus agrees. However, Rudeus will have to give Elinalise
Asura Kingdom
's treasured
aphrodisiac
. Rudeus agrees to give it to her as she fantasizes about a drugged Cliff on their wedding night. A month later, at Saint
Milis
 Church, Cliff and Elinalise are about to get married. A priest stands in the middle of them as he says oaths. Cliff and Elinalise say their oaths, kiss each other on the forehead, and they get married under the Milis church. As everyone looks at the newlyweds, Roxy looks at Rudeus with a red face. Rudeus has never had a wedding ceremony with Roxy before. So he kisses Roxy on the forehead. Sylphy gives an expression that she also wants one so she kisses her on the forehead as well. Norn, looking embarrassed that someone of her relation is doing this at a wedding, complains. However, Rudeus picks her up and kisses her on the forehead as well. Aisha also comes and asks for a kiss on the forehead so he gives her one. Then, he remembers a letter from Paul saying to hold a celebration once everyone is reunited. Rudeus decides to hold a big celebration for his sisters’ 10th birthday and Roxy’s wedding.

Chapter 8: A Lucky Man

Rudeus
,
Roxy
, and
Sylphy
 all go downtown to search for a present for
Norn
 and
Aisha
. The present is a secret to them. As they walked, they saw many merchants busily running by with carts full of goods. A festival was taking place that celebrates the harvests of the year. There were also many of the beast race whom have come to take the hands of
Rinia
 or
Pursena
. It’s is revealed that there is another reason for coming here. With
Elinalise
’s instructions, they would find a hotel to stay at and perform the deed. They spend the whole day searching for presents. However, what Roxy doesn’t know is that he’s also searching for a present for her as well and the celebration is both for his sisters and for Roxy. They stumble upon a clothing store and they decide to buy Norn and Aisha new clothes as a present. Norn would be getting a colored overcoat and Aisha would be getting embroidered boots. Suddenly, while browsing the store, Roxy sees something that stops her in her tracks. It was a magicians robe with a hat on it. She looks at the price tag on the hat and silently declares it too expensive. Sylphy and Rudeus notice this and then Roxy’s present was also decided. They walk around some more and as the shops start closing, they head towards a tavern that Elinalise told Rudeus to go to because it was the perfect place to do the deed. But what Rudeus didn’t expect was for Roxy and Sylphy to already know about this place. Sylphy was worried that Lucy would have no one taking care of her but Rudeus got
Lilia
 to do that. Roxy also had concerns about school but Rudeus also took care of that. Without anything to worry about, they gave themselves to Rudeus’s care. First they had dinner, then they do the deed.

Chapter 9: Birthday Party

The next morning,
Roxy
 and
Rudeus
 lead
Norn
 and
Aisha
 out of the house so that
Sylphy
 and
Lilia
 can prepare the party. Roxy, Rudeus, Norn, and Aisha all go fishing together. However Norn, Aisha, and Rudeus have no idea how to fish. Luckily, Roxy knew how to and taught all of them how to fish. They also agreed that the loser would have to obey whatever the winner says. Roxy also starts talking with Norn as they don’t have a very good relationship since she’s a second wife and Roxy wishes to fix that. Later on, Aisha is in the lead and Rudeus is dead last. Rudeus decides to activate his demon eye but still can’t catch anything while Aisha already caught 4 fish. When the sunsets, they head home. They talk about their day and how fun it was. Norn and Aisha were arguing about who had more fish and who’s were bigger. When they arrived home, Sylphy, Lilia, and
Zenith
 all surprise Norn and Aisha. Norn had no clue this was happening and was in shock. Aisha was just surprised. They head into the dining room which was decorated with flowers and Rudeus gives a speech about the family’s reunion. Rudeus then calls Sylphy to take out the presents. Aisha opens her’s and gets new boots, Norn opens her’s and gets a new jacket. Aisha goes to show Lilia and Norn goes to show Zenith. However, unexpectedly, Zenith’s usually blank face expressed a smile for a brief moment and everyone saw. Everyone was overjoyed to see Zenith express emotions at last. Finally, it was time for Roxy to open her present. She was confused at first but it was revealed to be her wedding gift. She opens it to see the hat that she had wanted from the store. Tears of happiness stream from her eyes as she thanks Rudeus and Sylphy deeply. After that, they start eating the food prepared.

Since they didn’t know if watermelons existed in this world, for now they called it a success. Everyone gathered at a tavern for a celebration. While everyone was celebrating,
Norn
 goes to Rudeus and tells him that she had joined the
Student Council
. Rudeus was worried at first because sword training on top of writing a book and now student council business might be too much pressure for her. However, Rudeus approves this anyways as he believes his little sister will find a way to make it work. Suddenly, they hear Nanahoshi yell “let’s cut the watermelon!”. So they cut it and everyone got a slice. As they did Rudeus realizes it’s seedless. There is no known method in this world to make a seedless fruit so it confirmed that the experiment was a success.
