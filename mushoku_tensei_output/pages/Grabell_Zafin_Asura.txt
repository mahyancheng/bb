Trivia

Spoilers ahead!

Despite his talents for politics, the fact that the Asura Kingdom suffers in loops where he is king implies that he ultimately is not a good ruler. This might stem from the fact that he looks down on the lower-class, which he openly admits to.

It was noted by
Orsted
 that in futures were Grabell was to become king of Asura, he would create policies that would lead to them focusing more on their military might, as opposed to magical, which would eventually lead to them being unable to overcome an obstacle hundreds of years in the future.
