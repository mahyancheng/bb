"Yeah, I know! Im not blind! And the three of us wanted to stay together to the end! But you know what? We knew death was a possibility! Any adventurer's party prepared to face that risk-young or old!"

"I'm grateful that you stepped in to save us, but it was our job to keep ourselves safe. If anyone's to blame, it's me! I'm the one who took this task and got us in over our heads!"
