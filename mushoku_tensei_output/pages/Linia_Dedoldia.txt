Lineana Dedoldia
 (
リニアーナ
・
デドルディア
)
 or
Linia
 (
リニア
)
 is a member of the Doldia Tribe. Debuting at the
Ranoa Magic Academy
 alongside
Pursena
, they were delinquents who terrorized the school until
Rudeus
 put them in check. Following their graduation, she ended up in debt and became a slave. Fortunately, Rudeus saved her by purchasing her, after which she became his maid.

Appearance

Linia has short, grey hair with a pair of cat ears and a tail of the same color. Like many females of her tribe, she has large breasts.

Personality

Linia is an arrogant, boisterous and frivolous person who likes to flaunt her authority to people beneath her. She is very impulsive and easily provoked, but is quick to submit to and flatter people who are much more powerful. She is also clumsy and tend to overestimate her abilities, which sometimes led her into trouble.

Despite appearing nonchalant, she does care about her friends, shown when she asked
Rudeus
 to take
Pursena
 as a caretaker of
Leo
.

Background

Due to the fact that the most recent two generations of the chief's family aren't bright enough, her
grandfather
 sent her to the
Ranoa Magic Academy
 along with Pursena, in hope that they would gain knowledge and wisdom in a place where their influence is less effective. However, because of her linage as a Royalty of the Beast Race, Linia was treated with great care and became pampered. Linia with
Pursena
 became arrogant and acted like delinquents, committing various offences like playing truant, bullying, and extortion. Many beast race delinquents joined their ranks, and their gang became the biggest troublemaker in the school.

In her second year,
Ariel
,
Fitts
 and
Luke
 enroll in the
Ranoa Magic Academy
 and gain greater influence than that of Linia and
Pursena
, which lead to them trying to beat the fresh-blood in order to gain back influence, but that failed miserably as
Fitts
 single-handedly defeated Linia,
Pursena
 and their gang. She and Pursena are humbled for good and shape-up to become model students after their temporary imprisonment in Rudeus's dorm. In contrast to the calm and collected Pursena, Linia is more emotional and hot-tempered.

Plot

After graduating she become a peddler selling goods from Asura to the North and vice-versa. However she gained her funds through loaning, eventually she found herself unable to pay her loans and thus she was taken into custody and turned into a slave. One day she escaped and run away, she was then found by
Eris
 and decided to help her. She was then picked up by
Eris
 to become her pet. She then later helps set up and joins the
Rude Mercenary Company
 to help pay off her debt to
Rudeus Greyrat
 after he bought her to stop her from getting sold off to an Asuran Noble.

Trivia

Linia ends her sentences with
Nya
 (ニャ), or
mew
 in English, a common trait among cat beastfolks in Japanese fantasy works.

There is a number of hints that she is fond of
Rudeus
. Whenever he sexually harasses her, she does not resist and occasionally even tempts him to do so.

Linia's (リニア) true name is Lineana (リニアーナ) and Linia is her nickname
. Her true name was first mentioned in
Light Novel Volume 4
 Chapter 9, but never seen again.

The total value of the fine alcohol that
Pilemon Notos Greyrat
 gifted to Ariel (the one Rudeus gifted to the Demon King Atoferatofe) is double the price he paid to buy Linia as a slave (300*10 Asuran Gold Coins).

Later on confirmed that's Eris's "domination" of her is simply hugging her until she bruises.
