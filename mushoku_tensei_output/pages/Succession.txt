After six months, Rudeus returns home to where Sylphy and the others are waiting for him. He talks about what happened in the

, Paul's death, Zenith's condition, and more. He also talks about Roxy... What will Norn, Aisha, and Sylphy's responses be...?

Plot

At Sharia, Rudeus, Roxy, Elinalise, Geese, Talhand, Zenith, Lilia, Shierra and Vierra are walking towards the Greyrat House where Rudeus suddenly starts running and Geese wonders if he really misses his wife that badly. While running, Rudeus realizes what Hitogami's
warning
 that he will regret going to
Begaritt Continent
 meant while concluding that
Paul
's death made him feel sad but not regret.

Rudeus enters the house and calls for Sylphy, but no one comes to greet him in the hall. He then checks the living room and the kitchen, calling their names, but no one is there. Rudeus is in disbelief about what is happening, but he hears footsteps and rushes toward them. He sees Aisha, who is surprised to see him. Rudeus asks Aisha if she is hurt; she answers him but is shocked and questions what happened to his left hand. Rudeus asks about Norn and Sylphy. Just as Aisha answers, Sylphy, who has just entered the house, calls for Rudeus. Sylphy assures Rudeus that everyone is alright, much to Rudeus' relief. As Sylphy welcomes Rudeus with an embrace, the rest of the party arrives outside the door, witnessing the scene as Roxy looks away.

Everyone is then seated at the dining table or the living room in silence until Aisha arrives with Norn from Ranoa Magic Academy who greets Rudeus upon arriving and is relieved to see Zenith. Rudeus begins to talk but Norn asks where Paul is so Rudeus tells him that he passed away while everyone is silent or looks away that leaves Norn in shock. Rudeus then places Paul's gauntlets,
Beloved Sword
,
Short Sword
 and the jar containing his ashes on the living room table. Norn questions how this has happened but Rudeus apologizes, causing Norn to further question him but stops upon seeing Rudeus lost his left hand and tries to contain herself as Aisha holds onto her shoulders. After Rudeus explains events of how
Paul died
 and Zenith has lost her memories, Norn confirms that Rudeus gave his all and begins to cry that no one could have saved Paul if Rudeus cannot as Aisha and Sylphy comforts her.

After Norn finishes crying, she asks if she can have Paul's Beloved Sword to which Rudeus agrees but tells her what it means to hold a sword like Paul told him when he gifted a sword to Rudeus on his
fifth birthday
 that surprises Lilia and Norn gratefully hold onto the sword. To everyone's surprise, Zenith suddenly pick up Paul's gauntlets and embraces it in her chest without saying a word and still having an expressionless face. Still not knowing if Zenith will recover, Rudeus tells everyone that Zenith will be staying with them and Lilia will look after her. Aisha then asks about dividing the chores of the house to which Lilia tells her that they will talk about it later then Norn tells Aisha not to hold back so she embraces Lilia in tears who also returns the gesture.

Outside the Greyrat House, Geese tells Rudeus that the rest of them will be looking for an inn but declines Rudeus' invitation to stay in the house for the night. Rudeus then thanks everyone for helping Paul all this time, to which Shierra wishes they could have been more useful, while Vierra tells him they will still be in town and to inform them where Paul's grave will be placed. Geese then cheers up Rudeus while Talhand tells him that it's Paul who should be the one thanking them, not Rudeus. Elinalise then says she plans to see Cliff but still blames herself for being unable to prevent Paul's death. Rudeus has no intention of blaming her. She then looks at Roxy, tells Sylphy that Rudeus loves her, and takes her leave with Geese, Talhand, Shierra, and Vierra. Rudeus then tells Sylphy he has something to tell her, and after glancing at Roxy, Sylphy accepts, and they go back inside.

Back at the living room, Lilia takes Zenith upstairs while everyone else stays behind. Rudeus then tells them that he wishes Roxy to be his second wife. Rudeus then explains how Roxy
saved
 him from grief after Paul's death. Rudeus then gets down to his knees, bows and apologizes to Sylphy for not keeping his promise. Norn approaches and berates Rudeus on how Sylphy is worried and misses him while he was away. Despite forgiving Rudeus on letting Paul die since he lost his left arm, Norn grabs Rudeus by his collar for his unfaithfulness. Rudeus defends Roxy's action, but Norn isn't having any of it, so Rudeus reminds him of what happened to her when she locked herself up in her
dorm room
. Although Norn is grateful for what Rudeus has done, she is a devout follower of the
Milis Religion
 that does not allow having two wives and points out how Roxy looks younger than her. Roxy tells her that she is a grown woman, but Norn continues to berate Roxy and accuses her of being shameless and taking advantage of Rudeus, causing him to get angry but manages to restrain himself. Roxy then faces Norn and agrees that she has been shameless, apologizes and begins to leave.

Rudeus tries to stop Roxy from leaving in her state, but Sylphy calls out to Roxy first and stops her. Roxy, in tears, turns to face Sylphy. Norn questions Sylphy's action and urges her to let her go, but Sylphy thanks her for worrying and states she can speak for herself. Sylphy then confirms that Roxy helped Rudeus, but Roxy admits she had ulterior motives. Sylphy acknowledges this and says she would not believe otherwise, adding that she would have done the same thing if their positions were reversed. Sylphy tells Roxy that she is aware Rudeus will eventually bring home another woman and has already realized this based on how Roxy looks at Rudeus. Roxy apologizes, but Sylphy brushes it off and tells her how Rudeus always talks about her with praise. This made Sylphy jealous, but after seeing Roxy, she sees her as another woman who loves Rudeus and welcomes her, saying that both of them will be supporting Rudeus from now on.

Outside the house, Rudeus and Norn are sparring with wooden swords. Norn still does not accept what has happened, as Rudeus tells her off for swinging too wildly. Sylphy reminds Norn that Rudeus is not a follower of Milis, and even Paul had two wives. She asks Norn if she would say the same thing to Lilia, who was Paul's second wife. Realizing this, Norn apologizes to Aisha, who had said nothing throughout the entire conversation, and because she offended her. This causes Aisha to mention how Norn does not think before speaking and runs off. Norn gets upset by that statement and chases after her, while Rudeus, Sylphy, and Roxy talk about how Norn feels while waiting for her family to return home. Sylphy then reveals that their child will be born in a month. Roxy tells her she will wait until her baby is born, then she will marry Rudeus.

A month later on a day with heavy snow, Sylphy gives birth where Lilia and Aisha handles the delivery and to her relief, the child does not have green hair, which is why she was bullied in her
childhood
 due to the animosity towards the
Superd Tribe
 who also have green hair. At Sylphy's request, Rudeus carries the baby and he sheds tears of joy after Sylphy tells him that she is their baby.

At the graveyard for nobles, Rudeus approaches Paul's gravestone and after cleaning the snow from it, he pours drinks on two glasses, tells Paul that his child is born and wishes that he could see it and after remembering how Paul protect him with his life, he tells him that their child's name is Lucy Greyrat and he married Master Roxy, like Paul he also have two wives and realizes this is what Paul was trying to tell him back in the Teleportation Labyrinth that Paul knows Rudeus loves Roxy, that Roxy also loves Rudeus and wanted to teach him how to prepare for that. Rudeus then wonders if Paul would think of marrying Elinalise or
Ghislaine Dedoldia
, but realizes that knowing Paul, he wouldn't give it much thought. After reflecting on his life so far in the
Human World
, he realizes that he is still a child with memories of his previous life and now that he has a child, he needs to grow up fast and still make mistakes on the way as he grows up and wonders if this is how Paul did it. After promising Paul he will work hard and finishing his drink, he takes his leave and promises to bring the whole family on his next visit.

As scenes of Rudeus' friends are shown, Rudeus is determined to fulfill his vow of living a life with no regrets.
