Synopsis

Plot

Rudeus, Eris and Ruijerd arrive at the city of Rikarisu. To have Ruijerd enter the city without trouble, Rudeus dyes his hair and has him pretend to be a member of the Migurdia tribe. The three brazenly call their team
Dead End
, after Ruijerd's nickname. Everyone laughs and the disguise works. However, their novice status prevent them from taking more challenging quests.
Nokopara
 is one of those who mocks them.

At the inn, a young demon walks in with friends and tries to befriend them, but due to a misunderstanding, gets beaten by Eris. Rudeus heals them and they introduce themselves as
Bachirou
,
Gablin
, and
Kurt
, as
Tokurabu Village Gang
. While on bed, Rudeus worries about expenses with the inability to accept higher quests. In a dream sequence with Human-God, he gets the advice to accept the lost kitten quest. He wakes up and found Eris awake, who is worried for
Ghislaine
 and
her grandfather
.

The next morning, they accepted the lost kitten quest, which leads them to another group of adventurers who kidnap pets to get the bounty for finding them. After the kidnappers are defeated, Rudeus attempts to interrogate them, but is hit by
one of them
, which leads Ruijerd to kill him instantly. Rudeus reprimands Ruijerd for it and forbids him from killing unless in self-defense.

Taking advantage of the kidnappers' higher rank, Rudeus and co. get the chance of taking more rewarding jobs, while improving their own party's reputation. Nokopara walks into the meeting of two parties and mocks them.
