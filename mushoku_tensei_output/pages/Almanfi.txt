 "Almanfi-san, I messed up a bit, I will call someone else."

 "Then quickly annul this contract. This Almanfi is Perugius-sama's proud servant."

Rudeus :
 "Ah. Yes."

Trivia

Rudeus
 once summoned him by mistake while trying to summon a magical beast to protect his family. He mused that this accident happened due to him trying to summon a dignified (高貴,
kouki
) being, which has the same pronunciation as Bright (光輝,
kouki
) in Almanfi's epithet
.

He is known as "eye" for Perugius because he can determine who is a reincarnation of Laplace just by observing.

His epithet, Almanfi of the Bright comes from the fact that he is the spirit that governs all light spirits.
