The
Greyrat
 bloodline is a prominent old noble family of the
Asura Kingdom
 divided into 4 Noble Houses, Notos, Boreas, Euros, Zephyrus. who protect all the sides of the kingdom and has many branch families.

Background

The Greyrat Family can be traced back to the Asura Kingdom's royal family and it is known that the men of the Greyrat bloodline are particularly infamous for their sex drive and perversion;
Luke Notos Greyrat
,
Paul Greyrat
 and
Rudeus Greyrat
 all being notable examples of this. Various branches of the Greyrat line are known for having specific preferences in women. For example, the Notos branch has a fetish for large boobs, while the Boreas branch has a fetish for beast people.

The name Greyrat is not unusual to any degree in Asura Kingdom due to the family's fondness for women and  hearing a lower noble's daughter or maid conceiving a child in order to become a mistress is a common thing to hear. Thus, it is allowed for those mistresses to also call themselves Greyrat. To distinguish the upper nobilities, they decided that the names of the protectors of Asura will be called: Notos, Boreas, Euros and Zephyrus as the four main branches of Greyrat family.

For nobles who wish to establish themselves, they need to have blood relations with one of these four main branches of the Greyrat Family which is a common practice to be working towards that end. But despite the Greyrat being an ordinary name, the talk becomes different when its a talk about a genius.

"I'm not a Boreas anymore. Its just Eris Greyrat."

There are also instances where family members of the upper nobility would sever their ties to their family and would willing be called Greyrat like Paul who severed his ties to the Notos Family and became an
Adventurer
 and Eris who severed ties with the Boreas Family after learning the death of
Sauros Boreas Greyrat
 and decides to go to the
Holy Land of Swords
 since none of the remaining Boreas would adopt her.
