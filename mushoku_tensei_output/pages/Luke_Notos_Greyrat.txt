Background

Luke was born into the Notos Greyrat family as an Asura Kingdom high noble. He was tasked at a very young age into the appointment of being the Guardian Knight of second princess Ariel Anemoi Asura alongside Derrick Redbat.

He was very fervent in his duties as a guardian despite his frivolous attitude to girls and his mediocre skills. He was so loyal that he sacrificed himself for his charge when they were attacked in the garden by a terminate boar. Sword-less, he tried to protect Ariel despite knowing that he could not win, even after he saw Derrick killed in front of him.

After being saved by Sylphy, who was teleported to them due to the metastasis event, he continued to guard Princess Ariel with Sylphy who was Silent-Fitts.

Plot

Luke Notos Greyrat does not appear many times in the first half of the volumes. However, starting with Volume 8, Luke takes a much larger role in the main cast. He serves as the primary knight to Princes Ariel, and a close friend and coworker to Sylphiette. During the earlier portions of Volumes 8 and 9, Luke primarily antagonizes Rudeaus, who he believes is a bad influence on Sylphy, and due to his status as the son of Paul Notos Greyrat, who is Luke's uncle.

During the latter half of Volume 9, Luke's opinion of Rudeaus change. Realizing the state of Sylphy's love for Rudy, he provides her with a powerful aphrodesiac in order to potentially heal his Erectile Dysfunction.

Tensions rise with Princes Ariel and her faction, and in order to potentially sway votes in her favor, Luke goes to Rudeaus to ask him to join them. Rudy had already pledged his alegience to Ariel and Luke for their assistance in both curing his illness, and allowing him to marry Sylphiette, essentially releasing her from her duty to them (Though Sylphy stays as one of Ariel's personal Bodyguards). Rudeaus accepts, and not much happens in regards to Luke until the begining of Volume 17.

During the events of Volume 17, Luke is visited by Hitogami, who tells him that he should be weary of Rudeaus's betrayal, along with general, vague, advice about keeping Ariel safe during their travels. It is heavily implied that Hitogami also tells him things about Pilemon Notos Greyrat, Luke's father, deceiving him about his father's position with Ariel's faction. This is understood as when Ariel's caravan was attacked by assassins in the second act of Volume 17, Luke is incredibly supprised and even a bit shaken by the Notos Seal being on the armor of their attackers.

In the Third Act of Volume 17, after being held hostage by the Water God, Luke watches his father being belittled by Princes Ariel. Pilemon's betrayal of her faction needed to be punished, so Ariel asked Luke for his blade to execute his father. At this, Luke snaps, going mad and taking the Princes hostage instead, holding his sword to her throat. Though it is not seen by the others in the room, he is holding the side of his blade there as to not hurt the princes. Eventually, when Rudeaus walks in, Luke tells Sylphiette that she would need to kill Rudy in order to save Ariel's life. Sylphiette refuses, and eventually, the tension lowers. Luke releases Ariel, and believes that his proper punishment is to be executed. However Ariel pardons him, and in turn, his father as well.
