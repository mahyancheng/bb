"A 『Sword God』 isn't something that you can become simply by memorizing a skill or something, you know? Even though someone special like me didn't get special treatment, why is there a need to treat Sword Saints that way?"

Sword God Gal Farion

Sword God Style
 (
剣神流
,

Kenshin-ryū
)
 is one of the three major schools of swordsmanship, and considered to be the strongest.

Characteristics

The motto of the Sword God Style is "Victory goes to he who moves first."
 This style of swordsmanship emphasizes speed and aggression, focusing on striking down the opponent first. As a result, many practitioners become short-tempered and belligerent. To react swiftly, practitioners are discouraged from wearing heavy armor and are encouraged to wear light clothing for maximum mobility.

Because the philosophy is to defeat the enemy with a single blow, this style usually leaves its users inept at defense with no counterattacks. Consequently, Sword God Style practitioners have difficulty fighting
Water God Style
 practitioners, who are adept at defense and counterattacks.
 Conversely, Sword God Style can overwhelm
North God Style
 because North God Style practitioners mostly rely on the environment to fight.

Known Techniques

Longsword of Light

Longsword of Light
 (
光の太刀
,

Hikari no Tachi
)
: The ultimate technique of the Sword God Style.
In this technique, the sword is held steady with both hands, and all the force of the sword is put into a single swing. This technique is extremely difficult to evade or defend against due to the speed of the slash, which can reach the speed of light when fully mastered, and the power to cut a heavy-armoured enemy in half.
The existence of this technique is the reason why Sword God Style is called the strongest of the three schools.

Arm Chop
 (
腕落とし
,

Ude Otoshi
)
, fully known as
Sword God Style - Initial Strike
, Arm Chop is one of the basic techniques of the Sword God Style. The user aims at their opponent's forearm to slice it off or if they are wearing armor will break the bones of their arm which in both cases loses their ability to use their weapon on that arm.

Ranks

There are seven ranks in the Sword God Style.

Sword God

The Sword God is the most powerful practitioner of the Sword God Style and leader of the school and as such he oversees training and operations of the school. Practitioners who are of Saintly level and above may call themselves a Saint, King, Emperor or God of the Sword God school. Similar to the system of
Water God Style
, there can be only one swordsman of the God rank while the there can be multiple practitioners who can assume the rank of Sword Emperor and below.

"You've gained the title Sword King, but I already have nothing to teach you. I'll give you the proof of mastery. Though it'd also be fine to jump you straight up to Sword Emperor but... you'd have to fight Ghislaine here. If you want to jump up to Sword God then you'll have to kill me."

Gal Farion to Eris

When a swordsman of the Sword God school defeats a Sword God, he can assume the title of Sword God - the strongest and the head of the school. If the Sword God dies for any other reason, the next strongest of the Sword God school will assume the title of Sword God. Therefore, a generational change of Sword God means a civil war in the Sword God school.

Sword Emperor

Sword Emperor rank is attained when two Sword Kings battle against each other with the Sword God as the witness and the winner is promoted to Sword Emperor.

Sword King

Practitioners with rank Kingly level are granted special titles by the Sword God and is given a Sword from his collection as proof of mastery.
 Judging from
Gal Farion
's sword collection, Ghislaine is the only Sword King before
Eris
,
Nina
 and
Jino
 ascended to the position
.

Sword Saint

A standard Sword Saint is being able to completely control their
Battle Aura
 and to be able to use the Longsword of Light but there are exceptions like Eris who attained this by defeating Jino and Nina despite being unable to use Longsword of Light but still granted the rank by Gal.
 When a Sword God Style practitioner reaches Saint Rank, they are given a dark leather jacket that has a white fur trim collar and a pair of white belts on each end of the sleeve similar to what Gal, Ghislaine and later Eris are wearing
.

The Holy Land of Sword was initially owned by Sword God but was claimed by Water God. The current Sword God reclaimed it back from the previous Water God.
