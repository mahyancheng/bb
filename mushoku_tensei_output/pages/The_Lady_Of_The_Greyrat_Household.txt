Summary

Back in Buena village, Zenith calls to babies Norn and Aisha to crawl to her. While Aisha gets to Zenith first, Norn starts a tantrum over it until Zenith encourages her daughter to keep going, and both babies are finally held; Zenith thinks to herself how she's come to see both as hers even if Aisha is Lilia's. When Lilia tries talking with Aisha, a sleepy Norn has them go to nap time, and Zenith looks at Paul angrily, remembering how he got Lilia pregnant despite her own pregnancy. As Aisha naps with Lilia and Norn with Zenith, Zenith recalls her following the teachings of Millis, such as monogamy. Even though the two weren't believers themselves, Zenith felt a massive betrayal when they had Aisha, she came to forgive them because of Rudeus's fear of losing his family, even though Rudi won't see them for five years. Hearing Paul's childish pleas, Zenith relents when Paul brings up Rudeus and how they should have a tight family for when he returns. When the two hug, Norn starts crying just as Paul is romancing a kiss with Zenith and she invites Paul to help change Norn's diaper, enjoying their family bonding.
