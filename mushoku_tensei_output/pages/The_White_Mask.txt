Synopsis

Rudeus and Fits investigates the
Fittoa Region

. Since their research indicates that teleportation and summoning are similar, Rudeus consults with Silent Seven Star another Special Student, who specializes in summoning magic at Ranoa Magic Academy, in order to gain knowledge about summoning magic. What is the identity of that person?

Plot

Fitz
 remains conflicted over revealing her true identity to
Rudeus
 as she's afraid that he's forgotten about her. Ariel encourages her to tell him the truth with her approval. Meanwhile, Rudeus continues to study teleportation and sees many similarities to summoning magic. Fitz suggests he consult with a summoning specialist, Silent Sevenstar, but Rudeus is shocked to discover it is
Nanahoshi
 and faints after reliving the
trauma of his death
 at
Orsted
's hands.

Fitz revives Rudeus and Nanahoshi shows Rudeus two Japanese names, Shinohara Akito and Kuroki Satoshi, and asks if either of those names belong to him. Rudeus doesn't recognize the names and comes to the realization that Nanahoshi is a person from his own world. Nanahoshi removes her mask and formally introduces herself as Nanahoshi Shizuka, and Rudeus notes she resembles the high school girl he died attempting to save. However, Nanahoshi wants to find a way back to their world while Rudeus has no intentions to go back and wants to stay in this world.

She explains that unlike Rudeus who was reincarnated as a child, she was summoned to the fantasy world as she is now five years ago though she hasn't aged since. Orsted found her and took her under his care, and she has been studying summoning magic ever since, though she lacks mana capacity and cannot cast magic herself. She makes a deal with Rudeus where he will use his mana to assist her in her experiments in return for her knowledge about teleportation.

She further explains that the mass teleportation disaster was possibly a side effect of the spell that summoned her to the fantasy world. Upon hearing this, Flitz snaps and attacks Nanahoshi, screaming about all the lives lost because of the incident, including those of her own parents. When Rudeus tries to stop Flitz, she becomes confused and asks him why he's defending Nanahoshi since she knows he also suffered during the years following the incident, but Rudeus clarifies that Nanahoshi was as much of a victim as they are since she wasn't summoned willingly. Flitz calms down and apologizes.

On the way back, Fitz is glad to hear Rudeus has no romantic feelings for Nanahoshi, but still can't decide whether or not to reveal the truth to him.
