Ghyslaine:
 "Geese."

Geese:
 "Yo, Ghyslaine, it's been a while."

Ghyslaine:
 "Yeah."

Geese:
 "I'll be headin' on first."

Ghyslaine:
 "Yeah, give my regards to Paul."

Geese:
 "Sure... maybe, when you come too, at that time, lets drink together. Paul gettin' drunk and shovin' his face in ya chest and Zenith gettin' all sullen... I'd like to see that again..."

Ghyslaine:
 "Zenith probably won't be there for a while. I'll probably come first."

Geese:
 "Heh, I get it... well, 'til we all meet again..."

 once used a hypnosis magic from Nuka tribe to put
Zanoba
 asleep, but whether Geese could use this magic or not is unknown.

adventurer
 in every loop Orsted has ever been in.
