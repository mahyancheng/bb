Quotes

After watching Norn give her entrance ceremony speech at Ranoa: "Hmph. So this is the Norn Greyrat I've heard to many rumors about. She's a C. No, if I take her potential into account, perhaps a B... Everyone said she was top-tier in this school, so I was hopeful, but... that's it, hm?... If that's all she amounts to, I bet her older brother, Rudeus, is nothing special, either"
