Rifujin na Magonote
 (
理不尽な孫の手
)
 is the pseudonym of a Japanese author best known for his original novel series -
Mushoku Tensei

and
Orc Eroica
.

Magonote rarely appears on-camera and likes to keep his privacy. When he does make an appearance, he wears a characteristic helmet to cover his face. This helmet is of the same model donned by
Orsted
 (a character in Mushoku Tensei) to keep his curse at bay.

Career

Magonote first started uploading his work on the user-generated novel publishing site,
Shosetsuka ni Naro
 in November of 2012. His first upload was the web novel "Mushoku Tensei".
The series quickly gained the support of readers, hitting number one on the site’s combined popularity ranking within 1 year of publication.
Within the next one-and-half years, Kadokawa licensed the Mushoku Tensei series under their MF Books imprint and started publishing the story as a light novel with illustrations by a Pixiv user -
Shirotaka
. The first volume was shipped on January 23 of 2014.

In 2019, he started a web novel titled "Orc Hero Tales" on Shosetsuka ni Naro, which in the subsequent year was also acquired by Kadokawa and started publishing the story in light novel format under their Fujimi Fantasia Bunko imprint. The illustrations were provided by ero-doujinshi artist -
Asanagi
. The first volume was shipped on July 17 of 2020.

Trivia

Magonote penned the story of "
The Conquest of the Dragon King
" (which was later published as an extension story of Mushoku Tensei) three years prior to starting the official main story. He scrapped the idea due to the story structure being too hard to understand.

He was inspired by works uploaded on Syosetsu. He loves fighting games and cream puffs

His favourite ramen is Chashu (braised pork-belly ramen)

Rifujin na Magonote's furigana is written as "Magonote Sodo (Sword)" (マゴノテ ソード)
