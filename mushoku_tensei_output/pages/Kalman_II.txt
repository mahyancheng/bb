Personality

Alex is an easygoing man that gets along with most people. Despite his carefree and slightly eccentric outlook, he is actually very intelligent and perceptive, capable of quickly discerning opportunities and threats.

During his younger age, he was a person that chased after fame. Even so, he is good-natured and willing to lend a hand to those in need.

Background

Being the first North God and Demon Lord Atofe’s son, Alex was told repeatedly about his father’s heroic tales. However, people did not give the North God's reputation the respect he deserved, describing him as a coward because he did not defeat any major threat directly and died to the Emperor Dragon King. Wanting to improve the reputation of the North God and to be like his father, Alex became a heroic wannabe and went on a journey to slay the Emperor Dragon King Kajakut. On the way, he saved three girls from death: young assassin “Chiki” Chiquita, the “Death God Knight” Shaina Marianne and magician Frau “Flowing Clouds” Claudia. After Shaina saved him from a fatal attack, Alex killed Kajakut. Kajakut’s remains were forged into 49 powerful swords by master blacksmith Julien Halisco. The strongest one, King Dragon Sword Kajakut, was given to Alex. Both Chiki and Shaina had feelings for Alex, and Shaina would later become
Randolph Marianne
’s grandmother.

Volume 23 - Young Man Period - Decisive Battle Chapter

He joined
Rudeus
 under the guise of Sándor, a knight from the Asura Kingdom sent by
Ariel

Doga
 to guard him during his journey to the Kingdom of Biheiril.
Orsted
 recognizes him but is asked to keep his identity a secret. After they made it to the Superd he assisted Rudeus and
Doga
 in helping the Superd people during the relapse of the plague. It was only after Rudeus came back from his near death experience at the bottom of the Earth Dragon Valley that his identity as Alex, North God Kalman II was revealed. However, he insisted of being called Sándor.

He later fought together with Rudeus,
Eris
 and
Ruijerd
 against his son
Alek
 in order to protect the Superd Village which Alek wanted to destroy. After Alek's defeat and apparent death, he accompanied Rudeus to Onigashima, where they were surprised by the sudden arrival of
Gisu
 and
Badigadi
 in the Fighting God armor. Just as Badigadi was about to start a fight with Rudeus, he formally requested a duel in order to give Rudeus some time to escape and get reinforcements. He was knocked off into the sea by the Fighting God and drifted ashore to Onigashima where he stayed to recuperate. It took him 10 days after the fight to come back.

Power and Abilities

Originally, his weapon was sword, but he tried a new fighting style using a metal rod as a method of self-discipline. He believes that staying inside the comfort zone will dull a person's skill.

He is strong enough to buy time (and survive) for Rudeus to call reinforcement by fighting Badigadi when he emerged as the Fighting god.

Immortality because of the immortal demon bloodline.

He defeats
Eris
 without much difficulty when she asks him for a duel.
