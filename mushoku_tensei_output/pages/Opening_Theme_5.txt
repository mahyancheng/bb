Tōku no komori no uta
 (遠くの子守の唄 lit. "Distant Lullaby Song") is the fifth opening theme of the
Mushoku Tensei
 anime performed by Yuiko Ōhara.

The song was first used in the anime as the opening theme song for
Episode 19
. The song does not have a special video-animation sequence for the credits as it is integrated into real-time scenes of the story, and varies for every episode.

Lyrics

Romaji
English

Ubugoe wo hibikasete

Amaneku yo ni shirase yo

Ten kara no sazukarimono

Amata no inochi no naka

Mori wo moyasu akago wa

Dakare nemuru yoru mo naku

Chikara to hikikae ni shite

Ai ni furerarezu

Nemure nemure haha no koe

Komoriuta ni takushite

Tojire tojire noroi dake

Samezu ni nemure nemure

Chiisana machi ni umareta

Kawaii akago ni mata

Ten kara no sazukarimono

Kuu ni komaranu chi

Kumo no ue kimagure ni

Ataeta chikara no

Mirai wo miteiru

Nemure nemure kami no ko yo

Wazawai wo sakeru you ni

Hito no ko no kokoro kara

Hanarenu you ni nemure

Sadame wo ukeire yo

Namida wa dare no me ni mo

Shitataru mono

Nemure nemure watashi no ko yo

Donna sugata katachi mo

Aishiteiru aishiteiru

Anshin shite nemure nemure nemure

Let the cry of a child's birth resonate

Let the whole world know

It's a gift from heaven

The amount of many lives

A baby who's burning a forest

Slept nights without being held

Received power

By giving up being able to touch love

Go to sleep, a mother's voice

Let it carry in a lullaby

Shut down, shut down the only curse

Don't wake up, go to sleep, go to sleep

A cute baby was born

In a small town

It's a gift from heaven

Equipped with knowledge

To live his life without struggle

To put food on his table

On the cloud

God's watching the future

Of power he's given randomly

Go to sleep, child of God

Separate yourself from troubles

But stay close to man's heart

Go to sleep

Accept your fate

Tears flow down everyone's eyes

Go to sleep, my child

No matter how you look

I love you, I love you

Feel safe

And go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep
