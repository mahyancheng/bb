Lyrics

Romaji
English
Kigi no zawameki iki o hisomete

Tagai no na mo shiranu mama ni kono mi o yudane

Shigemi no oku no kasukana komorebi wa

Doko ka haha no nukumori no you

Inishiebito no nokoshita saga yo

Kizamareta mune ga uzuiteiru

Koe yo kodama yo

Ima nozomu kotoba o kikasete

Kiri no mukou e to susunde

Samayoiau mae ni

Seseragi no yume kumitori abite

Konoha no fune yurasu minamo kodoku ni shizumu

Amekaze tachi to kawaranu utsurigi de

Doro ni mamireta kokoro arau

Touku nijinda tsuioku no naka

Wasurekaketa omoi o mitsuketa

Koe yo kodama yo

Ima nozomu kotoba o oshiete

Majiriau toki no nagare ga

Watashi ni naru mae ni

Omokage o tadoreba mishiru hodo ni tomadou

Kegare o himenu kawa no nagare ni sowasete

Douka koeyo kodama yo

Ima nozomu kotoba o kikasete

Kiri no mukou e to susunde

Samayoiau mae ni

Ten yo daichi yo

Ima utau kono uta o kite

Majiriau toki no nagare ga

Watashi ni naru mae ni

Nanimono demo nai mama

Kono mi o sasagemashou
Among the noises of trees

I am holding my breath quietly
Even without knowing each others' names
I entrust you
A faint streak of light from the bushes in deep
It's like the warmth of a mother

Nature left behind by ancestors
It's written on my chest and is throbbing

Voice and sprit of the tree
I wish to hear you
Before I move beyond the mist
And get lost

A little stream of a dream
I scooped some and splashed them on myself
A leaf boat created a ripple
And sank all alone
A mind changes like wind and rain
I am washing my muddy heart

In my blurred memory in the distance
I found a feeling I almost forgot

Voice and a sprit of tree
Tell me words I am looking for
Before time merges to become me

More I get to know by tracing the silhouette

More confused I get
Along the untainted river flow

Voice and sprit of the tree
I wish to hear you
Before I move beyond the mist
And get lost

Heave and earth
I sing a song now, please listen
Before time merges to become me
I'll devote myself

Before I become someone
