Trivia

Vierra wears skimpy clothing to divert male gazes away from her sister Shierra, as she suffers from PTSD from being sexually abused. After being teleported during the mana calamity, they were both captured by bandits and taken advantage of. Vierra was able to recover from the incident through sheer willpower, but her sister still suffers from extreme PTSD and cannot handle men looking at her, regardless of their intentions. Thus, Vierra started wearing revealing clothing to attract the attention to herself.
