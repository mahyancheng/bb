Plot

Were hired by
Darius Silva Ganius
 to assassinate
Ariel Anemoi Asura
 before she was able to become queen of the
Asura Kingdom
. Wii Taa and Auber took part in the first attempt, along with dozens of knights serving under
Pilemon Notos Greyrat
, but were ultimately thwarted and fled as
Eris Boreas Greyrat
 and
Sylphiette
 were easily able to defeat the mob of knights,
Ghislaine Dedoldia
 was able to overwhelm Wii Taa in their duel after
Rudeus Greyrat
 disabled Wii Taa's ability to prevent Ghislaine from fighting by blinding her using reflected sunlight, and Rudeus himself was able to react just in time to prevent Auber's sneak attack on him.

All three members were present in the second attempt, where Ghislaine once again engaged in a duel with Wii Taa, where he was nearly killed but was able to attempt to flee, and was finished off by
Orsted
, Eris defeated Nuckelgard in their duel where she suffered a major injury to her shoulder, and Auber was once again able to get away after narrowly escaping a fully powered
Stone Cannon
 from Rudeus after he figured out where Auber was hiding.

Finally, during the party Ariel hosted where she defeated Darius by exposing his crimes, and had
Perugius Dola
 show up to prove his support for her,
Reida Reia
 instructed Auber to flee with Ganius and save him, but he was chased down by Ghislaine, Eris, and Rudeus where he engaged in combat against all three of them at once and was ultimately slain, leading to all three of the party members being killed.

Trivia

All three were killed in part or whole by
Eris Boreas Greyrat
,
Ghislaine Dedoldia
, and
Rudeus Greyrat
