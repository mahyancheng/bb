Rudeus
,
Paul
 and the other members of the
Fangs of the Black Wolf
 party successfully rescues Roxy, who somehow survives alone in the Teleportation Labyrinth for a whole month so they decide to return to the city of Rapan for Roxy to recover. Although he was concerned about Roxy's occasional aloofness, Rudeus enjoyed reminiscing about the past. Three days later, they once again enter the Teleportation Labyrinth and at an increased progress in conquering each of the floors!

Plot

At the Third Floor of the Teleportation Labyrinth, Roxy continue finding an exit while marking the walls of the path she walked as she battles or avoids the
Tarantula Deathlords
 she encounters. After stepping into a Teleportation
Magic Circle
, Roxy ends up at the same place that already has multiple markings. Despite being exhausted she still wants to pursue her dreams of being a teacher and to have a family like her
father

mother
. Still considering that death is imminent, Roxy steps in the Teleportation Magic Circle once again.

After using
Frost Nova
 on the monsters that cornered Roxy, Rudeus is relieved then embraces a surprised Roxy and breathes in her scent. She pushes him back since she smells but Rudeus doesn't mind. Roxy then thanks him and introduces herself, causing Rudeus to drop his
staff
 and throw up in shock.

The party decides to head back to Rapan for Roxy to recover where Talhand carries Roxy on his back while Rudeus follows behind her reminiscing how Roxy has not after not seeing her for over
10 years
. After Rudeus explains why he threw up, Roxy explains that she did not recognize the Rudeus she knew back then to the Rudeus she sees now which relieves Rudeus but also realizes that
Sylphiette
 must have been shocked as well that he does not recognize her in their
reunion
 and plans to apologize to her when he returns.

At the inn, Lilia, Shierra, and Vierra welcome the party back, and are relieved that Roxy has returned. Rudeus later sneaks up on Roxy's room who is still asleep to check on her.

Days later, Roxy apologizes for the trouble she caused, but Paul tells her not to be bothered by it and then tells her to thank Rudeus for breaking through the walls and saving her in time. Rudeus accepts Roxy's thanks but also asks him to call him "Rudy" like she used to as he still considers her to be his master. Geese then discusses his plan to enter the Teleportation Labyrinth in 3 days so Roxy would not be affected by a curse that will prevent her from entering the labyrinth but Rudeus thinks at that it is his original world's version of trauma. Paul then gives Roxy the
"An Exploratory Account of the Teleportation Labyrinth" book
 to study and the meeting concludes for the preparation of their next attempt.

As Roxy is reading the book, Rudeus is restless and moves around causing Roxy to call him that he is distracting her but asks him to explain to which Rudeus quickly agrees. As they read through the book, Rudeus notices that Roxy seems tense but concludes that she might be conscious of how tall he has become.

Back at the Third Floor of the Teleportation Labyrinth the party now with Roxy included, they battle through the hordes of
Iron Crawlers
, Deathlord Tarantulas and
Mad Skulls
 but Rudeus notices that Roxy seems to be looking at him then looks away then the latter calls to take a break as she is out of
Mana
.

As the party is taking a break, Geese continues studying the book while trying to figure out where the Teleportation Magic Circle to the fourth floor is located. After Roxy leans on Rudeus' back to rest, she also asks that they explore a Labyrinth together sometime in the future that Rudeus immediately agrees as Roxy goes to sleep.

The party then enters the Fourth Floor that looks more like a ruin than an ant nest where Paul confirms their plan with Geese to explore the floor for a bit before returning to Rapan. As Rudeus internally complements Paul to be reliable but Paul alerts him that a pair of
Armored Warriors
 are approaching. Rudeus declares he will use
Stone Cannon
 on them but Roxy stops him since they can use
Water God Style
 to counter his spells and suggests to provide support for now. After Rudeus tells them he will use
Quagmire
, Elinalise tells Paul which target to attack as the enemies sink due to Rudeus' Quagmire. As Paul and Elinalise engage the warriors, Roxy to coordinate their magic where she uses
Icicle Edge
 then Rudeus uses Stone Cannon that defeats the Armored Warrior battling Elinalise while Paul finishes off the other. Rudeus complements Paul who seems to be stronger but the latter dismisses it and urges everyone to move forward while passing Elinalise who chuckles at how Paul looks very happy for being praised by his son.

The party leaves the Teleportation Labyrinth and upon reaching the outside, they discuss what supplies they need for to deal with the armored enemies while Rudeus is wondering if Zenith will be okay with the pace they are going but notices Roxy looks at him but immediately looks away.

At Rapan, Rudeus and Roxy are together where they purchase the talfro root while discussing what other supplies they will need. Rudeus then tests out a sword that when he thrusts it, a shockwave is produced to knock back its target that Roxy mentions it will be perfect for Elinalise but they cannot afford it.

At the Pub, Roxy details her journey that shocks Rudeus that they
missed each other
 when they were at
Wind Port
 and Rudeus is glad that she was searching for his
family
. Roxy then tells her past on her time in
Ranoa Magic Academy
 then she was hired by Paul and she has changed because of her time in
Buena Village
 and affirms that they will rescue
Zenith
.

Next day, back at the Fourth Floor, Elinalise tests out her newly purchased
Gladius
 and is satisfied with its performance after cleanly cutting through an Armored Warrior. Having easily progressed through the Fourth Floor, Geese has already charted a map for the fourth floor and confirmed that the room they are on should have the Teleportation Magic Circle to the fifth floor and the party move forward.

At the Fifth Floor, Geese burns a talfro root like incense where its smoke causes the
Devouring Devils
 to run away and Geese is pleased by its potency and accuracy of the book, prompting Paul to decide not to return to Rapan and continue exploring.

At the Sixth Floor, the party is on alert since can sense the
Guardian
 is nearby. Geese is scouting the final room that has three Teleportation Magic Circles and mentions that this is as far the author of the book have reached so Rudeus volunteers to analyze the Magic Circles. Roxy questions if he has figured it out, but Rudeus has not yet. He mentions that
Nanahoshi Shizuka
 might be able to solve it. Roxy then asks if she is his girlfriend, which Rudeus denies, much to Roxy's relief. Rudeus then details his findings that one of the circles is a trap that leaves one of the remaining two will teleport them to the seventh floor as the party concludes that its like a coin flip chance to get there. When asked, Geese details that the party always fails at coin flips unless
Ghislaine Dedoldia
, who is currently at the
Holy Land of Swords
 makes the choice. This Rudeus volunteers to conduct further investigations before they decide.

At a glance, the room looks special but Rudeus believes that the floor doesn't end here. Paul disagrees, with nothing to base it on, but still encourages Rudeus to take his time. Paul then grabs Rudeus' shoulder, planning to tell him something, but after glancing at Roxy, he decides to tell Rudeus after they return to the inn. Rudeus presses Paul, but he still refuses, concerned it might hurt the party's morale. Instead, Paul tells him the different functions of his
two

swords
 that he cannot use only one due to their different roles. As Paul returns to the rest of the party, Rudeus realizes that the room is similar to the room from the ruins that he and Elinalise entered that has the
Teleportation Magic Circle
 to Begaritt Continent.

Rudeus then asks Geese to check if there are any hidden stairs and while initially in doubt, Geese also realizes that it is possible and begins to investigate. Geese brings out his short sword and begins tapping the floor with its pommel while his ear is on the ground and finds a hollow floor. After Geese confirms there are no traps, Rudeus destroys the said hollow floor with Stone Cannon, and the stairs are uncovered. Geese announces the finding, and the party rises to their feet in astonishment and amazement. They take turns slapping Rudeus' back in praise, while Elinalise remarks that the room is indeed the same as the ruins they entered before. Roxy also follows suit with a lighter tap. After Geese scouts the stairs, the party descends together, approaching the Teleportation Magic Circle, which is glowing in deep blood red.
