Plot

Rudeus and Elinalise finally arrives at Rapan where Rudeus intends to meet with Paul's group first so Elinalise suggests to head to the Adventurer Guild Headquarters and look for Paul or Geese where the latter would establish his information network being the party's
Thief
. Upon looking around, they immediately find Geese who is trying to enlist a male
Beast Race
 but is refused then Elinalise calls out Geese who approaches them. Geese is surprised on how quickly they arrived since it was only 6 months since he sent the letter and were expecting them in another 6 months. After agreeing to delay the details of their situations, Rudeus asks Geese to takes them to his father which suprises Geese on how his "Boss" has grown up and asks to be called as he did before. The two explain their
history
 to Elinalise, Geese brings them to the Inn where Paul is staying.

Before entering the Inn, Geese tells them Paul is in a bad shape then asks Elinalise and Rudeus to avoid picking a fight with him for now to which Elinalise refuses to make any promises and Rudeus agrees. Upon entering the Inn, Paul, Vierra and Lilia are there where Lilia wakes up Paul. After confirming he is not dreaming, Paul also remarks how fast Rudeus arrives to which Rudeus mentions a "
unique method
" they used to travel. Paul hugs him and laments he is unable to rescue
Zenith
 to which Rudeus affirms it is enough reason to take the journey. Paul also remarks how Rudeus has grown but is surprised that Rudeus is about to have a
child
. Paul then approaches Elinalise and bends his knee to apologize to which Elinalise also admits she is partially at fault too and extends her hand to help Paul stand up.

Paul the mentions how Elinalise was able to last the journey due to her
Curse of Promiscuity
 that Elinalise mentions it was thanks to the
Curse Supressing Tool
 created by
Cliff
, her husband which even surprises Paul.

Paul then explains the situation that Zenith is captured in the Teleporation Labyrinth which is a day's travel north from Rapan and it is still unknown if she is still alive after 6 years according to the intel gathered by Geese. Talhand and Shierra arrives at the inn from shopping where the Talhand confirms Rudeus is Paul's son. But as Paul continues the discussion, Rudeus inquires where is Roxy that causes everyone to be tense and Paul tells him that she is missing for a month already. Rudeus is horrified and asks is she is dead but deep inside he'd rather not hear it. Paul elaborates she stepped into a Teleportation Circle and has disappeared while Geese and Talhand argues that she could still be alive despite their five attempts to look for her for the past month. After recovering from the shock with Elinalise's help, he is told that the labyrinth in question is the Teleportation Labyrinth and is considered S-rank in difficulty. Upon hearing this, brings out the "An Exploratory Account of the Teleportation Labyrinth" book he borrowed from the library of
Ranoa Magic Academy
 and after reading it, Geese is delighted that all the details they need to clear even the sixth floor are detailed in the book so Paul then proceeds to discuss their formation.

That night, Rudeus, Paul and Lilia shares the same room where Lilia mentions it is their first time sharing a room then they talk about
Aisha
 who Rudeus mentions that she is a big help and wishes that she was a little more selfish. This made Paul laugh who was also listening. Then they talk about Rudeus'
wedding
 with
Sylphiette
 which relieves Lilia upon hearing Sylphy is alive but Paul is surprised that Rudeus is not married to
Eris
. After exchanging apologies once again, Rudeus and Paul have a light talk about their past exploits to the chagrin of Lilia.

Next day, at the cave entrance of the Teleportation Labyrinth, Rudeus takes over Vierra's role of Magician and Healer, Elinalise is the Tank that was the previous role of Shierra, Paul is the secondary attacker, Talhand can be a Magician or secondary attacker and Geese is the scout. While Lilia, Shierra and Vierra are the support team will return to Rapan for supplies acquisition and other house sitting maintenance.

As they progress through the Labyrinth, Geese and Rudeus each uses
Summon Lamlight Spirit
 scrolls to light the way that Talhands praises the convenience it brings and Paul acknowledges as Rudeus is his pride and joy. As they walk, Rudeus explains how some Teleportation Circles does not glow but will transport them anyway so the party is following the footprints that has a cross-shaped mark that Geese creates with his special pair of boots for scouting until they encounter a
Tarantula Deathlord
 where Elinalise moves to position to tank it but Paul runs ahead and kills it with his
dual

swords
.

Although everyone in the party is aware that Paul showing off to Rudeus and moves on, Elinalise tells him off for being in beaking formation. Paul tries explains he is trying to loosen their nerves but Elinalise rebukes him as he is showing the same excitement when Zenith joined their
party
 in the past. When Paul mentions that Elinalise is nagging him more than usual, she responds that he is like a son to her as Paul dismisses the notion to be a joke while Rudeus watches amusingly but didn't tell Paul he is now Elinalise's son due to Rudeus' marrieage to Sylphy, her granddaughter.

They finally reach the Teleportation Circle to the second floor but are guarded by a lot of Tarantula Deathlords and before engaging to battle, Talhand reminds Rudeus not to use
Fire Magic
 due to Carbon Monoxide poisoning; not to attack the ceiling to avoid cave ins; and to also avoid water magic but instead use Ice Magic to avoid softening the ground that might cause it to collapse.

As Paul and Elinalise kills their share of Tarantula Deathlords, Rudeus uses
Blizzard Storm
 that kills a large number of Tarantula Deathlords, that Talhand praises that he is indeed Roxy's apprentice.

Looking at the Teleportation Labyrinth Book, Geese confirms the Teleportation Circle leads to the second floor and they all step in together.

After battling a few more Tarantula Deathlords at the Second Floor, Paul calls for a quick break where Paul, Geese and Rudeus checks and clean up their gear while Elinalise and Talhand are on the lookout. As they are resting, Geese mentions that the third floor's Teleportation Circles will only send people on the same floor and hopefully find Roxy there.

Upon reaching the third floor, Geese consults with Rudeus on where might Roxy be with his intuition and after a few moments, Rudeus suddenly stops causing the party to question him as he approaches a wall then shows a worried expression.

Somewhere in the third floor, armies of Tarantula Deathlords,
Iron Crawlers
 and
Mad Skulls
 are battling Roxy who casts
Earth Fortress
 that stops the advance of the Iron Crawlers but they crawl its wall. Roxy then casts
Water Splash
 to soak the monsters then follows up with
Icicle Field
 to freeze the wet monsters in place then finishes them off with Blizzard Storm. After defeating the wave of monsters, Roxy is breathing heavily but more monsters appear from the Teleportation Circle, and narrowly dodges a mud ball thrown by a Mad Skull that destroys a portion of the Earth Fortress where an Iron Crawler enter. Roxy strikes one of the Iron Crawlers with
Flame Slice
 then tries to cast another Earth Fortress but cannot do so due to exhaustion as more Iron Crawlers break the Earth Fortress. This causes Roxy to panic and tries to strike them with his staff but a Tarantula Deathlord shoots a web to knock the staff off her hand. Unable to fight back anymore, Roxy calls for help and shuts her eyes tight as the Iron Crawlers approach her.

Moments later, Roxy opens her eyes thinking she died but is surprised that she sees a world of ice where all monsters are frozen in place like white statues and the Mad Skulls at the back are frozen to their core as one of the frozen skull falls off. Roxy then sees Rudeus walking pass the frozen monsters to approach her and is relieved to see Roxy and smiles as Roxy looks on blushing.
