Trivia

The name Jirou  (ジロー,
Jirō
) is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of armadillo (アルマジロ,
arumajiro
), which is also the same pronunciation as a common Japanese name “次郎”.

The English LN translation named it "Dillo" in the same manner, despite its unfortunate resemblance with the word "dildo".

Roxy rides it to work when she is not accompanying anyone else.
