) is the Twenty-third and final episode of the
Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on December 19, 2021.

Synopsis

Suddenly, Eris disappeared, leaving behind a letter. Rudeus thought that he was able to start his life over again and change through various encounters and journeys, but the shock of losing Eris made him withdraw again like he did in his previous life. Just when he is about to give up on everything, the memory of his mother Zenith comes back to his mind. ......

Plot

Rudeus falls into a state of depression, and begins having flashbacks to his old life where severe bullying at school traumatized him into become a social recluse. Meanwhile, Eris has left on her own journey with Ghislaine so that she can grow strong enough to fight Orsted and protect Rudeus. Ruijerd rescues some travelers from beasts, earning their praise despite revealing his identity as a Superd to them. Zanoba and Geese continue on their respective journeys as they recall Rudeus fondly. Gyes and Tona continue to train together in Doldia Village. Roxy encounters Kishirika and helps pay her enormous bar tab. In gratitude, Kishirika uses her Demon Eyes to locate the whereabouts of Rudeus' family, revealing Aisha and Lilia have safely reunited with Paul and Norn, while Zenith is located in the Labyrinth City of Rapan on the Begaritt Continent. Roxy and her party immediately make preparations to leave for the Begaritt Continent to rescue her. Rudeus is still in a depressed state, but after having a dream about Zenith, he remembers he still has a duty to find her and overcomes his insecurities to continue his journey. Elsewhere, Sylphiette, who is alive and now has white hair, tries to convince an unknown group to recruit Rudeus into their ranks.
