Yes. To be able to stand in the same position as Rudy and fight together. On an equal footing, helping each other and protecting Rudy's back. I think I want that kind of relationship.

Sylphy, to
Rudeus

Sylphiette Greyrat
 (
シルフィエット
,

Shirufietto
)
 is
Rudeus
' childhood friend who is part human, elf, and beast race. Following the
Teleport Incident
,
 during which her hair turned white from
mana
 exhaustion, she became
Princess Ariel
's personal bodyguard under the alias
Fitts
.

Appearance

In her youth, she had short green hair and elfish ears. Her tomboyish appearance initially made Rudeus believe she was a boy.

After the
Teleport Incident
, her hair became white. Although she grew to have a more feminine body, her slender appearance combined with her apparel made her look more masculine. She also now wears white Gloves as her permanent accessory starting from Season 2.

Spoilers

After her marriage with Rudeus, she began to let her hair grow longer and wear more feminine clothing. Due to her elfen heritage, her body ages slower in comparison to humans.

Personality

Due to being constantly bullied, Sylphiette was very shy and meek when she was a child. She was very dependent on Rudeus and she break down crying when Rudeus tells her that he plans to leave to study. After Rudeus was forcefully sent away to act as
Eris
' home tutor, she resolved herself to learn and train in order to support Rudeus in the future.

When posing as Fitts, she put up a front as a cold knight in public, appearing silent, serious, and intimidating. She appears to be helpful, reliable and knowledgeable to Rudeus, which in turn made it easier for him to ask her for advice. However, deep down she was still very insecure, too afraid to confess her true identity to Rudeus.

After getting married, she is demure, supportive and accommodating towards Rudeus. As the story progresses, she gradually becomes more confident and assertive. She is deeply loyal towards her friends, but her utmost loyalty lies with Rudeus and the family. She is known as the 'housewife' in the Greyrat household.

Despite being gentle and accommodating towards Rudeus, she is very prone to jealousy towards other women that get close to him, even though she doesn't actively act on it. However, she would readily accept women that truly love and loved by Rudeus into the family.

Background

Childhood

Syphiette is the only child of
Laws
, a half-blood
Elf
 who works as a hunter and her mother who is part
Beast Race
 in
Buena Village
,
Fittoa Region
 in
Asura Kingdom
. When Syphiette was a child, she was always bullied for her being a hybrid and having emerald green hair that is the same hair as the
Superd Tribe
. Her parents tried to protect her such as her mother cutting her hair and making her a stitched pants for her to run away easier while her father petitioned the children's parents to stop targetting her daughter but to no avail.

Plot

Meeting Rudeus






Syphiette successfully learning Voiceless Incantation from Rudeus in the Anime



The bullies would throw mud balls or rocks at her sometimes and kick her too, causing Sylphiette to be resigned to her fate until
Rudeus
 saved her from the bullies and they became friends with Rudeus calling her Sylph. During their time together, Rudeus teaches Sylphy about math, how to read and write and most importantly the use of
magic
, voiceless incantation and everything she wanted to know. Meeting Rudeus is an upheaval of her everyday life causing the bullying to eventually stop and they would play and practice magic together. During their magic practice, it is revealed that her Fire Magic is weaker than her Wind and Water magic because she is afraid of fire unconsciously  because she accidentally burned her hands when she was 3 years old.

When Sylphy sees Rudeus unconscious and tied up by
Paul Greyrat
, she uses a voiceless intermediate ranked magic at Paul who easily avoids it but the speed, power and being a voiceless incantation surprises Paul of what Rudeus has taught Sylphy. Laws tells her the situation and she accepts that they will be apart and continues practicing her spells and training her body as Rudeus did everyday.
 Sylphy tries to get information on where Rudeus went from
Zenith Greyrat
 who refuses to tell her but teaches her
Healing Magic
 and discovers she is able to use voiceless incantation with healing and it is her strong point as well. Sylphiette then approaches
Lilia Greyrat
 to know where Rudeus was taken but like Zenith, she did not tell her anything but taught her etiquette and manners of the nobility. During Rudeus' 10th birthday, Sylphy carves a pendant made from wood to serve as a good luck charm similar to what her father wears to be delivered to Rudeus then the
Teleport Incident
 occurred.

Silent Fitz

Sylphy is teleported on the sky above the Silver Palace and struggles to break her fall with magic and somehow survives with bruises and fractured legs only to immediately battle a
Terminate Boar
 that is about to attack Princess Ariel. Sylphy seeing the boar immediately uses her strongest magic to kill the boar then uses voiceless healing magic on her fractured legs and finally collapses in exhaustion due to expending her mana. Sylphy wakes up and realizes her hair has turned white then is questioned on where she came from and who taught her magic. Despite Syphy's unbelievable story that she is from
Buena Village
 in the
Fittoa Region
 and she learned magic from Rudeus, Ariel insists on Sylphy becoming her new guardian to take the place of
Derrick Redbat
 who died protecting Ariel from the terminate boar and be always by her side to which Sylphy accepts on the condition that she pardon her crime of entering the Silver Palace without permission and help her find her family and friends. As news of the Teleport Incident spread, Sylphy's story becomes more believable and she is clearly not a noble as she only learned some etiquette of the nobility from
Lilia Greyrat
 while trying to find out where Rudeus was taken.

In addition, rumors of the
granddaughter
 of
Sauros Boreas Greyrat
, Lord of Fittoa has changed so much because a boy who tutored her have been circulating, which leads to speculations that  because they are the same age that they were the same person, but also gives doubt on her becoming Ariel's guardian since the Boreas Family supports Prince
Grabell Zafin Asura
's faction. But this doubt comes to an end after Sylphy defeats
Nights Eye Crow
, an assassin known to have slain many nobles for the past decade who attacks Ariel.  After this, her nightmares of falling from the sky after the Teleport Incident also stop. Since she rarely spoke and could use voiceless incantation, eventually Sylphy became known as "Silent Fitts" as he continues to protect Ariel from numerous assassination attempts, eventually leaving the
Asura Kingdom
 with Ariel to study at the
Ranoa Magic Academy
.

On their journey to
Sharia
, Fitts accompanies Ariel with 15 nobles that gets assassinated when one is isolated due to multiple ambushes on the way. The final ambush comprising of around 10 swordsmen, 1 magician and 1 healer at the Red Dragon's Upper Jaw was crushed by Fitts thanks to the chantless magic combat techniques that Rudeus taught her and the ambushes stop after crossing the border. By the time they reach Sharia, Ranoa Kingdom's capital, five of them remained: Fitts, Ariel,
Luke
, and the servants
Elmore Bluewolf
 and
Kleene Elrond
.

After entering
Ranoa Magic Academy
, Sylphiette defeats
Linia Dedoldia
 and
Pursena Adoldia
 then along with Ariel and Luke becomes part of the Student Council where they plan to recruit allies in helping Ariel's bid for the throne of Asura Kingdom. Years later, rumors about Quagmire Rudeus begin circulating and Sylphiette confirms that Rudeus is indeed her childhood friend from Buena Village so Ariel leaks the information to Vice Principal

Quotes

Sylphiette
: "I will follow Rudi. I do not know what the result will be. We may fall into some serious problems, and may end up being killed by
Orsted
... But even at that time, I'm going to support Rudi. That way we will remain married for life."
 Sylphiette to
Luke Notos Greyrat

Sylphiette
:
"Well I think, I wanted to be like
Eris
."

Rudeus
:
"Eris?"

Sylphiette
:
"Yes. To be able to stand in the same position as Rudy and fight together. On an equal footing, helping each other and protecting Rudy's back. I think I want that kind of relationship."

Rudeus
:
"......"

Sylphiette
:
"But Eris, and also Rudy are so far away that I can never hope to reach it. I've realized this. So, I gave up on this goal and will protect Rudy's back in another way."

Rudeus:
 "What is it Sylphy, my lovely wife?"

Sylphy:
 "Don't stare at Ariel-sama too much or I'll pull your ear."

Sylphy:
 "I know that! But Rudy is moving with the thought of protecting us! For us, to not hold our head down and appreciate his efforts is like exposing our ugly side! I do what I must do, rather than saying anything that would annoy him or cause any misdirection, I take his side because I will support him from behind!"

Luke:
 "If you want to help Ariel-sama, then kill Rudeus. If I said that, what would you do?"

Sylphy:
 "I choose Rudi. I know it's a bad choice for Ariel-sama, but if I'm forced to choose, I cannot turn my back against my husband or my child."

Trivia

Sylphiette's green hair is a result of her having the
Laplace Factor
 in her, which grants her aptitude towards all forms of magic and a large amount of magic power.

Sylphiette's originally green hair
turned white due to the stress
 caused by the Mana Calamity as well as using all of her magic power.

Sylphiette is one of the three Goddesses that Rudeus worships. The blood-stained piece of the sheets from the time when Sylphy gave her virginity to Rudeus to cure him of his ED is kept in a box and enshrined in the basement of the mansion. She is the Goddess of Love in Rudeus' religion.

Sylphy's journey after the teleportation incident greatly differs in each adaptations:

In the
Web Novel
, a long and detailed debate among nobles of Ariel's faction happened before deciding to make Sylphy pose as a male guard magician, and her bond with Ariel began to deepen after Ariel's failed sexual assault.

In the
Light Novel
, Sylphy is quickly made into a guard magician with identity concealed, in order to act as a deterrent.

In the
Manga
, Sylphy lost her memory after crash-landing into the palace, and only regained them when she fought off the assassin Nights Eye Crow.

In the original timeline where Rudeus doesn't exist, she became
Roxy
's disciple and was still discriminated due to her green hair. She became an adventurer and eventually managed to conquer several labyrinths, becoming a world-class Labyrinth Explorer.

Her nickname, Luffy: It's just a nickname using the 3 kana after the first kana in her name (シ
ルフィ
エット/shi-
ru
-
fi
-et-to). Rudy interprets it as "
Luffy
" and connects it to
One Piece
 in his head.

According to Rudeus, Sylphy is submissive in bed, she accepts everything unconditionally, even if it is something very shameful, she will do it.

Her type of Blood is A and her height is approximately 110 cm in volume 1
.

Sylphy ages slower than regular humans due to her 1/4 elven blood. At 74 years old, she looks about 40 years old.

Sylphy has very low tolerance in alcohol, and gets very clingy with Rudeus when she is drunk
.

The origin of her name as the guardian of Ariel "Fitts" (Fitz in Seven Seas version) is from the
Fitts' law
, because it was the first name that the author found when he was searching names starting with "Fi" (フィ).
