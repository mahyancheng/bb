Plot

Continuing his search for Zenith, Rudeus travels to the remote northlands, though he is still depressed over Eris leaving him. Needing to earn money to continue his travels, Rudeus reluctantly agrees to join the party Counter Arrow, consisting of frontline fighters Suzanne and Patrice, mage Timothy, healer Mimir, and archer Sara. However, Sara is mistrustful of Rudeus, and he can't help think about how similar she is to Eris. He accompanies Counter Arrow on a quest to slay
grizzlies
, but the situation escalates when the party ends up getting surrounded by them. Witnessing the Counter Arrow members fighting for their lives, Rudeus regains the will to live and helps the party fight off the grizzlies. Upon returning to town, Rudeus is accepted as a member of Counter Arrow. After realizing that he hasn't lost everything and still has friends and family like Roxy to count on, Rudeus finally comes to terms with Eris leaving him and burns the lock of her hair he had as a keepsake.
