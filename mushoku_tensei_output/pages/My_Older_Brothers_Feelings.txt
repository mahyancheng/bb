At Ranoa Magic Academy, Rudeus is visibly angry upon learning that Norn has locked herself in her room and is seen walking with Linia and Pursena who tries to reason with him while onlookers are in awe as Rudeus passes by and finally reaches Norn's classroom and enters.

Rudeus explains the situation to Norn's classmates and asks whoever is responsible to come forward and apologize. A
Beast Race
 with a raccoon dog face, timid eyes and bob hair cut raises her hand and tells Rudeus that she compared Norn with Rudeus which made angered Norn then Norn's teacher also mentions she also talked to Norn after she did poorly and to follow his brother's example and try a little harder which Norn while holding back tears nods and said she'd do her best. The rest of the class also chimes in on doing the same thing causing Rudeus to realize that Norn hates being compared to Rudeus.

At the
School Yard
, Rudeus is still hurt by recent development as Linia and Pursena looks on then Sylphiette arrives and assures Rudeus that its now his fault. Linia and Pursena also encourages Rudeus who thanks them but still doesn't now what to do since Norn has a reason not to leave her room.

Rudes is walking on the hallway still deciding on what to do but is unable to do so but Sylphy, Linia and Pursena catches up with him and Linia mentions she has a plan.

That evening, the students are spreading word that Ariel is giving a speech at the dining hall despite being so sudden and they head to the School Yard to listen while Sylphiette informs Rudeus that most students have left and he sneaks in the Girl's Dormitory and enters with
Earth Lance
 where Linia is waiting for him and carries him through the hallway with a laundry cart until they reach Norn's room at the end of the hall.

Rudeus knocks and gives his name but Norn does not respond. Upon opening the door, Rudeus remember his past self but proceeds to enter and sees Norn still seated at her bed, covered with her blanket. Rudeus recalls his past life on how he ignores his older brother who visited his room to try and reason with him but was ignored and his brother eventually gave up on him.

While Rudeus is seated next to her bed, Norn reflects on how she became afraid of Rudeus since she met Rudeus who was hitting Paul and causing Norn to push him away and begins to hate him. When she arrives at Sharia, her impression on him got even worse on how he seems happy while their father is still on the midst of rescuing
Zenith
 but she decides to be careful not to upset him and not to be kicked out of the house.

When Norn decides to live in the Dormitory, she was surprised that Rudeus allowed her and although she knows the reason, she felt sad and felt pain in her belly. Norn's situation got worse when she begins classes where she is constantly being compared to Rudeus and along with the pain in her belly leading to eventually causing Norn to stay in her room.

Norn then remembers her talks with Paul and Ruijerd where both assures him that he is not who she think he is. Norn then sees Rudeus who apologizes on what has happened and after hearing his words, Norn breaks down in tears and cries on Rudeus' chest after the latter sits beside her.
