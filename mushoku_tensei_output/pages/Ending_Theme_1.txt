Lyrics

Romaji
English
Ai no iroha wo manande mo

Te ni ireirerarenai no nan no

Tatakai tsukare hateta koronii anata ga hoshii

(If you do) Nan datte kowakunai kara

(If you will) Senaka wo makasete

Kowashitai kowashite shimaitai anata no tame nara

Fujun mo mujun mo misakai nante nai

Mamoritai mamoritai no wa subete wo

Oshiete kureta anata dake

Me ni wa me wo ha wo togatte mo

Tsutaerarenai no demo

Kanashimu kao wa makena seorii sunao de itai

(If you do) Ushinatte ii you na mirai

(If you will) Hana kara miete inai

Kowashitai kowashite shimaitai anata no tame nara

Fujun mo mujun mo misakai nante nai

Kakushitai kakushitai no wa subete wo

Seou to kimeta namida dake

Senobi shite mieru sekai

Anata no tame? jibun no tame

Mada wakaranai kanjou no uragawa

Kowashitai kowashite shimaitai

Modorenai no nara

Naosara tsuyoku dakishimete itai

Hanarenai yasashisa wo keshisatte mo

Kanashii kurai afurederu

Omoi nigenai nigetakunai kono jirenma kara

Fujun mo mujun mo misakai nante nai

Mamoritai mamoritai no wa subete wo oshiete kureta

Anata dake
Even if I learn the A B C's of love

I can't obtain it

An exhausted colony from battle, I want you

(If you do) I am not afraid of anything

(If you will) leave it up to me

I want to destroy, I want to destroy it if it's for you

Impure or paradox, I don't care at all

I want to protect it,

The only thing I want to protect is you who taught me everything

Eyes for eyes, sharpen your fangs

I can't tell you my feelings, but

If you show your sad face, you lose

I want to be honest

(If you do) the future that's ok to lose

(If you will) I don't want it from the beginning

I want to destroy, I want to destroy if it's for you

Out of orders or paradox, I don't care at all

I want to hide

The only thing I want to hide is the tears I shed when I decide to carry everything on my back

The world that seems to be stretched

Is it for you? Is it for me?

I still don't know, what's behind this feeling

I want to destroy, I want to destroy

If I can't go back

I want to keep holding you tighter even more

Even if I get rid of the kindness I can't forget

The feeling is overflowing, and it's making me sad

I won't run away, I won't run away from this dilemma

Out of order or paradox, I don't care at all

I want to protect it,

The only thing I want to protect is you who taught me everything
