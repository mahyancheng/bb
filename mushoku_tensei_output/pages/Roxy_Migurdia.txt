Roxy M. Greyrat
, born
Roxy Migurdia
 (
ロキシー
・
ミグルディア
)
, is one of the deuteragonists in the
Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation
 series. She is a talented
Migurd
 mage, and a former
magic
 tutor. Because she can't use telepathy, she leaves her village due to feeling isolated from her peers. Unable to make a stable living as an adventurer, she becomes a travelling tutor and eventually becomes
Rudeus
' teacher. In the aftermath of the
Teleport Incident
, Roxy helps
Paul
 to search the world for survivors.

Appearance

Roxy is shown as a short statured adult woman in her physical teenage appearance between 15 or 16 years old. Her complexion is like sand but paler, and has long blue hair tied in 2 braids that reach below her waist. Her eyes match the color of her hair. Her hair color sometimes appears green in sunlight, which makes people distrustful or even afraid of her because of the similarity between her and the
Superd Tribe's
 green hair. She wears a long-sleeve white and gray button-down shirt with black edges, matching her short black skirt that shows off her beautiful, well-worked legs. On top of this stood out a large light brown layer, with the edges sinking into white and being outlined by black. A black hat rests on her head. In the center, a gold line rounded the circumference of the garment while 2 other wider white lines were painted on both sides.

The tip of her hat wilts lazily downwards while the flap stood erect in the air. Easily the most telling was the staff she carried around her, the blue gem at the tip of it glistening almost unnaturally in the sun.

As a
Migurd
, she has a rather child-like body, which causes several people to mistake her as a teenager rather than a normal sized adult.

Personality

Roxy is a calm and collected person with a wise outlook on life, yet always seeking to improve herself. She is very intelligent, able to piece together information and make rational deductions.

She was a rather headstrong person in the past, running from her tribe to roam the world as an adventurer.  She also openly defied her
teacher
 in the
Ranoa Magic Academy
 after learning his greatest magic. However, various incidents that happened afterwards and the encounter with
Rudeus
 greatly humbled her.

She has a bit of a clumsy side, making her prone to mistakes during unexpected and tense situations. She also has a complex with her petite figure, often laments her figure as unattractive and tends to get annoyed when someone mistakes her as a child. After seeing the family life of Paul and his family, Roxy begins to hold an idealistic outlook in romance and dreams of having a fateful encounter with the love of her life in a labyrinth and to start a family and become a teacher.

Background

Roxy is born to
Rowin Migurdia
 and
Rokari Migurdia
 of the
Migurd Tribe
, part of the
Race
 in the
Demon Continent
. However, she was born without her race's special ability to communicate telepathically, so her parents taught her how to talk normally. Throughout her childhood, she would often always feel annoyed and isolated with her race's silent conversation and ran away from her village after being impressed by a
Magician
 who visited her village one day.

Roxy becomes an
Adventurer
 to get some money in order to leave the Demon Continent where she joins the party
Rikarisu Gang
 with
Dale
,
Nokopara
 and
Blaze
 but the party eventually disbanded after the death of Dale. She stayed with
Bloody Kant
 for a time until when Kant gives her a letter of recommendation for
Ranoa Magic Academy
 and later heads to
Sharia
 to become a student in the Academy. Upon reaching Advanced Rank Water Magic, Roxy became a student of
Jinas Halfas
 and became a Water Saint. After graduating, Roxy left the Academy without saying a word to her teacher and went to
Asura Kingdom
 to look for work but is unable to find one even when she gradually moves toward the border and is at a loss. Roxy eventually found a job request for a
Magic
 Tutor and she hired by
Paul
 and
Zenith
 to teach
Rudeus
 about magic for two years.

Quotes

Roxy:
 "I, it was love at first sight."
Rudeus:
 "With whom?"
Roxy:
 "Eh?"
Rudeus:
 "It couldn't be dad?"
Roxy:
 "No, it's Rudy, when Rudy came into the Labyrinth to save me."

"Well. I thought after meeting Rudy, marrying Rudy, now having Rudy's child, how I'm the happiest girl in the world. But, because of that... if you die, then I will become the most unfortunate girl. Well, this is a little embarrassing to say, but... Please let me be happy."

Trivia

The hat Roxy wore as an adventurer was gifted by
Bloody Kant
, the author of "
Wandering The World
" and the one who taught her magic initially. It was replaced by a gift from
Rudeus
 and
Sylphy
, and finally gifted to
Lara
 when she left the household.

Roxy is the first Goddess that Rudeus worships in his exclusive religion, being the Goddess of Wisdom. Her holy panties are currently enshrined in the basement.

If Rudeus' previous life is taken into account, Roxy and Rudeus are of the same age.

Roxy does not like the taste of alcohol since she believes that it is dry until she visited
Kurasuma Town
 where there are sweet alcoholic drinks. Then, she would often be seen drinking in everyone at any chance.

Roxy likes sweets so much that she once sworn not to return to the
Demon Continent
 again, because the Demon Continent doesn't have any sweet food.

There are three things that Roxy had difficulty dealing with since childhood: green peppers, children, and
Superds
.

When she was a child, she was so scared of Superds that she would wet herself when she heard about them. The fear still lingers on when she becomes an adult.

A running gag in the
anime
 when Roxy is communicating with Rudeus via letters is
Pax Shirone
 grabs her chest and Roxy unfazed, retaliates with a Voiceless Fire Magic leaving Pax burnt but mostly unharmed.

In all previous loops where Rudeus doesn't exist, she became
Sylphy
's teacher and never married anyone.

Roxy's fantasy of meeting her fated lover in a labyrinth was fulfilled when Rudeus rescued her in the
Teleportation Labyrinth
.

According to Rudeus, in bed Roxy is the technical type, she looks to her teacher
Elinalise
 for advice and wisdom, Roxy offers alternatives to improve her performance(positions). She is always researching and improving.
