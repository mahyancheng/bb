Pre-Rudeus

Ghislaine was born to the Dedoldia tribe responsible for protecting the Sacred Beast. Ghislaine refused the responsibility and even refused to learn proper speech or fighting. She was eventually taken away by a wandering swordsman.

Once she became a Sword Saint, she joined
Paul Greyrat
's party. She joined them for many adventures, some of them in a bed with Paul. The party eventually disbanded when Paul married
Zenith Greyrat
. She took many jobs until she became a sword king and eventually became a bodyguard/sword instructor for
Eris Boreas Greyrat
.

Juvenile Period

She's eventually asked to bring
Rudeus Greyrat
 to Boreas territory in exchange for teaching her how to read, write and do basic magic. She brings him over and later helps save Rudeus and Eris when they're 'captured' by bandits. While training Rudeus in swordplay was difficult, everything else went smoothly for her. She gets along with Rudeus for the next four years and even helps him learn Beast God. When Rudeus is targeted for a possible mana disaster, she protects him. However she's the first to get caught up in it and flung far away.

Over the next two years she makes her way back to the Boreas area to find that it's been thrown into chaos after the mana disaster. She helps with rebuilding until Eris and Rudeus return. She defends Eris only for her to be left alone. The next day she leaves on a journey with Eris.
