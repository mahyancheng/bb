Synopsis

MAGIC SCHOOL’S IN SESSION

With her old teacher’s letter of introduction in hand, Roxy enrolls at the legendary Ranoa University of Magic. It’s a whole lot of firsts: Her first time in school! Her first time in a dorm! All of it’s exciting, but there’s a small problem. Roxy doesn’t exactly have a lot of money left. Her roommate Lanletta seems all too willing to help by forking over heaps of cash, but Roxy can’t help but find this generosity just a little bit suspicious…
