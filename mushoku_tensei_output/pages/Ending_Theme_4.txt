Lyrics

Romaji
English

Omoi de no iro ni someta hoho o

Anata ni mirareta nara

Kakushiteita kono kimochi mo

Todoite shimaisou de

Okubyou na kokoro wa suteta

Hazu nanoni anata no mae ja

Ano hi kara kawaranai omoi

Watashi no mama de matteita yo

Ten to ten ga tsunagaru toki ni

Anata no mune ni isasete

Umaranai sukima o dakishimete

Aishikata wa tesaguri demo

Atatamete agerareru kara

Nandemo dekite shimau anata ni

Watashi wa kanawanakute

Sukoshi zutsu demo chikadzukeru you ni

Aruki tsudzukete itanda

Me no mae ni miete iru noni

Mada furerarenai kyori no naka

Mou dare ni mo ubawarenu you ni

Tada miteiru dake wa yameta no

Ten to ten ga tsunagaru mae ni

Anata to tsuujiaetara

Watashi wa mou doko no dare demo ii

Samui yoru o sugosu no nara

Atatamete agetai dake

Wasureru koto nante dekinai tokubetsu na

Anata o omou tabi

Sore dake de tsuyoku nareta no

Anata ni mata aeta koto de

Yokubari ni natta mitai

Hitomi no oku ni aru kawaranai

Watashi no koto mitsukete

Ten to ten ga tsunagaru toki ni

Anata no mune ni isasete

Umaranai sukima wa dakishimete

Aishikata wa tesaguri demo

Atatamete agerareru kara

Anata dake o kono saki mo

Atatamete agerareru kara

Colored by memories,

If you were to see my blushing cheeks,

Even this hidden feeling might reach you

Though I have abandoned my timid heart,

In front of you, since that day,

My feelings remain unchanged

I've been waiting just as I am

When the dots connect,

Let me stay in your heart

Embracing the unfilled gaps

Even if I fumble in love,

I can warm you up

I can't compete with you,

Who can do anything and everything

But little by little, I kept walking,

Trying to get closer to you

Though you are right in front of me,

In a distance I still can't touch,

I won't just stand by and let anyone take you away

I've stopped merely watching

Before the dots connect,

If I can truly connect with you,

It doesn't matter where or who I am

If I'm going to spend a cold night,

I just want to warm you up

Every time I think of you,

Whom I can't forget,

I gain strength just from that

By meeting you again,

I seem to have become greedy

Finding the unchanging me

Hidden deep in your eyes

When the dots connect,

Let me stay in your heart

Embracing the unfilled gaps

Even if I fumble in love,

I can warm you up

Because I can only warm you up,

Now and in the future
