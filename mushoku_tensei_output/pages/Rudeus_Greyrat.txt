It's no good to overestimate me. Victory is something that you grasp by always being modest, you know?

- Rudeus Greyrat

Rudeus Greyrat
 (
ルーデウス・グレイラット
,

Rūdeusu Gureiratto
)
 is the main protagonist of
Mushoku Tensei
. He was an overweight 34-year-old Japanese NEET who is reincarnated into another world after being hit by a truck whilst saving
some

kids
. Realizing he wasted away his previous life, he resolves to live this new one to its fullest and the series revolves around how he impacts his new world all whilst slowly growing out of his reclusive ways.

Appearance

Rudeus stands at around average height (175cm), has a muscular body despite being a magician, and his looks weren't that poor when his family members are asked. He was born with light brown hair and green eyes. However, he later has
Kishirika Kishirisu
 switch out both of his original eyes for
demon eyes
, causing them to be heterochromatic. Like his father,
Paul
, Rudeus also has a mole underneath his left eye and follows his ponytail hairstyle.

He is also always seen wearing gray robes but rarely covers his head during his time as an
adventurer
. At a young age, he is careless about the outfit he wears due to traveling the
Demon Continent
. He has worn the same gray robes when he entered
Ranoa Magic Academy
 which has many cuts and hems from his countless battles that makes him look like a delinquent. During his 20's, he begins to pay more attention to the clothes he wears that even
Perugius Dola
 mentions that he started to wear some decent clothes.

Following his second fight with
Orsted
 and later the final battle against
Hitogami's
 faction, Rudeus' hair temporarily lost its color from mana exhaustion. Fortunately, in both cases, the roots were unaffected, causing his hair to grow back to normal over time.

Personality

Because of his experience from his former life, Rudeus is careful not to get carried away and become arrogant. As a result, he is extremely self-aware and humble because he does not want to revert to his old self.
 After reincarnation he is more willing to be kind, helping his friends and protecting
his family
 whenever needed, where in the past he would have scoffed. Due to being considered a genius, who is capable in many fields at a young age, people have high expectations of him. Rudeus is also very polite to others, often making them uncomfortable especially to those who knows of his father's notorious reputation.

Having the morals of his past life, he hesitates with the thought of killing someone. He also has a calm personality who never lets go of his smile no matter how much abuse or violence he went through but he displays aggression and blood lust to anyone threatening his family. As a descendant of the Notos
Greyrat Family
 who likes pretty girls and big breasts, and also by influence from his previous secluded life, he is extremely perverted that he tends to touch his wives even in public, but he never makes a move on anyone other than his wives. He is also loyal to his friends that he always takes care of them to a great extent. As such, Rudeus is quite feared but is respected and loved by the people of
Sharia
 and to some extent even the most famous or powerful
beings
 of the Human World either fears or respect him.

Apart from carelessness in his outfit, Rudeus also loves cleanliness that he remodeled one of the rooms of his
house
 in Sharia to be a huge bathroom which is only made by the upper nobles of Human Kingdoms and he also bathes almost everyday.

Even with very high
magic
 capacity and high potential in battle, he often lacks the confidence to fight his enemy and his legs trembles when confronted in battle
 but manages to overcome this after surviving his
first battle
 against Orsted whose killing intent is significantly intense compared to what he encountered afterwards even when fighting against a
Red Dragon
.
 When facing a stronger opponent he knows he cannot defeat, he prefers to talk himself out of battles which also caused him to earn various titles related to this.

Rudeus also greatly values his family and friends that it affects him greatly when he is in bad terms with them like when he had a squabble with Paul
 and when Roxy forgotten him when they reunited at the
Teleportation Labyrinth
 that he threw up on both occasions.

Background

Rudeus was a 34-year-old NEET otaku in his previous life. As the fourth child of five children in a well-off family, he was praised as a bright student in elementary school considering his age. In junior high, he joined the computer club and and saved up his allowance to assemble his very own computer. However, he was so focused on tinkering his computer that he neglected his studies, causing him to fail the entrance exam of his preferred high school. As a result, the only school that would take him was a low-quality one, filled to the brim with delinquents.

Upon entering his new high school, he soon became a victim of severe bullying following an incident: he stood up to an upclassman who cut in front of him during lunch. However, this person then proceeded to beat him up, hang him up naked, nicknamed him "Pencil Dick", and took and distributed pictures of him in his state all whilst no one, not even the teachers, came to his aid. This event caused him to drop out of school and isolate himself at home, having developed a phobia toward the outside world as a whole. His family tried to encourage him to go back to school, but he brushed them off. There was at least one classmate whom he had a good relationship with who came by everyday to deliver homework. However, he pushed him away too when he also tried to get him to return to school. Now truly alone, he slipped futher into being a Hikikomori as time went on, taking an interest in some subjects on occassion only to quickly drop them once he saw that there was already someone better at it than him.

He continued being a shut-in, living off his family, for twenty years. However, this unhealthy lifestyle finally came to an end after both of his parents had passed away from old age and he refused to even attend their funeral. This ended up being the last straw for his siblings, prompting them to kick him out of the family home and disown him. Homeless and penniless, he wandered the streets aimlessly while reflecting on his life until he came across
three

high
-
schoolers
 arguing on a road. Seeing a truck heading toward them at high speed, he mustered all of his strength to run over and managed to push one of them away to safety. Unfortunately, this caused him to get hit instead, killing him. The next time he opened his eyes, he found himself reincarnated as the newborn Rudeus Greyrat in the
Human World
. Realizing he had been given a second chance, he declared he would live this new life to its fullest.

Quotes

Rudeus:
 "Hey, Eris."

Eris:
 "What?"

Rudeus:
 "Can I grope your tits?"

Rudeus:
 "Aisha... Norn... I'll help you anytime you need... If you are in trouble,, don't hesitate to rely on me... You might think I'm unreliable, but no matter what, I'll do everything in my power..."

Rudeus:
 "I think Pax is a jackass. But he should be able to change; I've changed. There isn't anyone who cannot change."

Rudeus:
 "Some people just prefer to see a more dramatic world. Fact is stranger than fiction. Reality is strange, helpless and disappointing."

Rudeus to Claire:
 "And what if she gets pregnant? Will you bear it? Will you consider bearing it? Even if she does give birth, what about Zenith's intention? What about my feelings? What do you think will become of the children that are left behind? What do you know about a person's mother! What do you know about your own daughter! Substantially, what's up with this function! Means of treatment? A machine to give birth? Don't joke around!"

Sylphy:
 "This time, Rudy won't be here for the birth?"

Rudeus:
 "No, I'll be here, in the house."

Sylphy:
 "But... Rudy..."

Rudeus:
 "I'll be here."

Rudeus:
 "I will protect Sieg even if the Sky Fortress falls."

Rudeus:
 'Eris, I want to go to bed with all four of us like this, is that fine?"

Trivia

Rudeus' name before reincarnation remains unknown. Even when mentioned by
Future Rudeus
, it is muted out.

Rudeus can speak multiple languages (Magic God Language, Beast God Language, Fighting God, Human Language) by the time he was 9. Which he learned when he tutored
Eris
. He wanted to learn Heaven God and Sea God languages but could not find any learning material. He managed to find a book from the sea race in volume 7.

Rudeus and his three wives have a strand of cowlick (ahoge) on top of their heads.

He named his right and left leg Tindalos and Baskerville. He also named his right arm Hulk and his left arm Hercules.

Currently, Rudeus is both founder and sole member of the religion he created which has 3 Goddesses.

Rudeus founded a fan club for his sister (
Norn
), he was eventually kicked out three days later due to him taking a bath together with her.

All of Rudeus' wives ""seem"" to get pregnant right before he goes on a journey to somewhere.

He has a tendency to always overestimate his opponent.

Incidentally, although he is Emperor Ranked in Water Magic, he has mostly used Earth Magic in combat.

After the incident where
Hitogami
 attempted to have
Roxy
 killed with an infected rat, rats are deemed top priority enemies in Rudeus' household. They must be killed on sight, corpse incinerated while wearing gloves and face masks, and have their ashes disposed outside of the city
.

Rudeus was given the title "Hero" for defeating Demon Kings.

Initially he refused to call himself a hero when
Badigadi
 mentioned it, but accepted the title later on after defeating
Atofe
.

Even though Rudeus is unable to wear
Battle Aura
, he has attained a Saint-class combat ability of a swordsman with his 『Magic Armor Mk II B 』 and God-class power with 『Magic Armor Mk I 』(The latter one was stated by Atofe).

A
Miko from the future
 who had the ability to control time revived Rudeus into his current reincarnated body.

He does not feel fear towards
Orsted
, and strangely, neither do his children.

Rudeus was born with the "
Laplace Factor
". This means that his development as a fetus was influenced for him to become a potential vessel for the Demon God
Laplace
 to be reincarnated in, resulting in his abnormally large
mana
 capacity. This is also why it was this body that he was reincarnated in, as it did not have a soul of its own and would have otherwise been
stillborn
.

His hair also turned white due to mana strain but his hair has a little bit of color left so he was able to restore his hair color than losing it like Sylphy (from the battle of Orstred)

Rudeus likes to joke he "has two wives and a husband and children," referring to
Eris
 as his "husband." He also jokes that instead of Eris being a part of his harem, he is part of hers, including
Pursena
 and
Linia
 as her "other wives".
