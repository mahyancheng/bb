 (

,

Nanahoshi Shizuka
)
, also known as
Silent Seven Stars
, is one of the people
Rudeus Greyrat
 saved from being hit by a truck in his previous life. However, in that moment, she was transported to this world some time after Rudeus, resulting in the
Teleport Incident
. Afterward, she was taken in by
Orsted
 and eventually became a successful entrepreneur whilst searching for a way back to Earth.

Appearance

Nanahoshi is a Japanese teenage girl with long black hair, described as being above average in appearance. She's more often seen wearing a white mask without any particular characteristics.

Personality

Due to her desire to go back home and her unattached attitude to the
Human World
, Nanahoshi tends to like being alone. She's serious when working and enthusiastic when it comes to things related to her old world. Before meeting
Rudeus Greyrat
, she spent all her time indoors and didn't like meeting people as she didn't want to grow attached to anyone in the world. Additionally, she maintained low contact to avoid the possibility of contracting unknown pathogens, and uses that to justify her isolation.

Background

Nanahoshi was saved by
Rudeus Greyrat
 in his former life's final moments and was teleported to the
Human World
 later known as the
Teleport Incident
 where she is transported in her original body unlike Rudeus who is reincarnated as a baby. After finding herself in the plains of Asura Kingdom, she meets
Orsted
 and with his help she learned the Human God language after a year, gained knowledge about the Asura Kingdom and was able to meet Perugius. During this time, Nanahoshi established business contacts, introduced innovations and products that are mainly for her convenience and benefits such as improving the food, clothing and soap for hair cleaning. Using Orsted's influence as the Dragon God for her backing, she is able to convince some Asuran merchants to arrange distribution routes for her products that allows her to have passive income so she could gain enough influence to search for her friends, and develop a way to return home.

Plot

Nanahoshi was first introduced in volume 6 of the LN/WN accompanying
Orsted
 when they encountered
Dead End
 on their journey to the
Fittoa Region
. After Orsted mortally wounded
Rudeus Greyrat
, she told Orsted to spare Rudeus' life, so Orsted cast healing magic on him.

Nanahoshi meets with Rudeus once again at
Ranoa Magic Academy
 where she establishes herself as a Class A Mage because of the sweeping changes she introduced in the Academy and is also a Special Student. After giving an explanation of her intentions, Nanahoshi, Rudeus and
Sylphiette
 begin researching on the cause of the
Teleport Incident
.

Nanahoshi is among the guests who attends Rudeus and Syphiette's wedding
 and for helping with her research on Summoning Magic, Nanahoshi allows Rudeus and his friends to accompany her when she goes to meet
Perugius Dola
 in his Sky Castle
.

Power and Abilities

Magic Abilities

Summon Light Spirits
 in the Anime



Nanahoshi has no magic power due to being from another world where magic didn't exist. This means she can't use magic or wear
battle aura
, though she can still use Magic Items, which work with their own Magic Power.

Summoning Magic

Due to her training from
Perugius Dola
, she has extensive knowledge in summoning and teleportation magic, having studied it as part of her research to go back to her and
Rudeus Greyrat
's original world.

Physical Abilities

For some reason, her body does not age; her hair never grows longer, and her nails keep the same length regardless of how much time passes, yet she still needs to consume food and pass waste, and could still get sick. Nanahoshi suspects that it's because she's from the future, or a different world.

Intellectual Abilities

It is shown that Nanahoshi is a very skilled negotiator and businesswoman, enabling her to setup many systems that monetize her knowledge from earth and even using the Magician Guild as a bank. As a result, she has multiple streams of income that make her very wealthy, allowing her to focus on her research. She also holds influential positions in several organizations and is Rank A among the Magic Guild because of her accomplishments and contributions that she was offered to be Rank S but she declines since her interests is to return home.

Nanahoshi is also a skilled researcher that she collaborated with Rudeus on several researches such as the development of the Magic Potion and Teleportation Magic formations which they kept in records at an Encrypted Memoir written by both of them in a cypher and most likely in Japanese Language.

Magic Rings

Unlike
Rudeus Greyrat
 who is reincarnated into the
Human World
, Nanahoshi has no Magic Powers so she uses Magic Rings to protect herself when
Orsted
 is not there. Nanahoshi possesses three magic rings that are
Magic Items
 she wears in her right hand. First worn in the index finger, through unknown means, prevents magic from working near the caster as shown when
Sylphiette
 failed to cast attack magic on her which triggers when she points the ring to a target. The second worn in the middle finger, creates an invisible barrier in front of her that prevents any physical attacks as seen when Sylphiette tried to punch her and like the first ring, it also triggers on a target she points at. The third worn on the ring finger, allows Orsted to know her location using a compass, when infused with magic.

Quotes

To
Rudeus Greyrat
: “I was probably summoned to this world in order to create a method for your descendants to kill the
Human God
 in the future. That’s why, as long as I don’t create that method, I won’t be able to return to my original world. My return magic will fail.”

Etymology

Nanahoshi
 means "seven stars" (七星).

Shizuka
 means "quiet" (静) (
shizu
) and "fragrance, fragrant" (香) (
ka
).

Trivia

Nanahoshi has a disease called Drain Syndrome. It's a condition that occurs when a human with little or no magical power naturally accumulates magical power over time, until their body begins to react negatively to it. Because of this, she must regularly drink tea made from Sokasu Grass, which will alleviate her condition by releasing the accumulated Magical Power through her waste. However this does not cure her condition, as she must continue to drink the tea from Sokasu Grass.

In the redundancy chapters,
Zanoba Shirone
 and
Rudeus Greyrat
 created an automaton modelled after Nanahoshi. It was almost identical to her except for the hair length, completed with even the naughty bits. It was created without Nanahoshi knowledge and consent, and later named
Anne
.
