Personality

Spoilers ahead

She has a tendency to run away from
Rudeus
 whenever he's at home, possibly because she doesn't see
Rudeus
 as a father since he doesn't spend much time with her, but recently the distance between the two has been shrinking. She once thought
Orsted
 was her father because he has white hair just like her mother.

Around the ages of 4-5, she fully recognizes
Rudeus
 as her father and plays with him when possible, but laments the fact that his work takes him away for months at a time.

Later when she grows up, she starts to believe that Rudeus holds no expectations from her or any of his other children due to which they start to grow apart until she has a heartfelt talk with him just before her marriage to Clive.

Background

Lucy is the first born child between Rudeus and Sylphy who are childhood friends from
Buena Village
. But the two got separated and due to the
Teleport Incident
, their circumstances greatly changed as they eventually both ended up in
Ranoa Magic Academy
,
Sharia
 where they reunited and got married
. Before Rudeus journeys to the
Teleportation Labyrinth
 in the
Begaritt Continent
 he decides that he would name their child to be Sirius if its a boy and Lucy if it is a girl but this was met with uneasiness with everyone in the family as it was considered taboo so Rudeus decides to give the name when he returns.
 When the baby was born, Rudeus finally names her Lucy taken from the first names of his name (Ru) and Sylphiette's name (Sy) (Rusy or roughly Lucy which makes more sense in Japanese) to which Rudeus is glad that his child is a girl otherwise the baby would be named after
Paul
 who died from the Teleport Labyrinth.
