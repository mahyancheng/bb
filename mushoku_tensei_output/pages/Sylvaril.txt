Sylvaril
 (
シルヴァリル
)
 or
Sylvaril of the Void
 (
空虚
の
シルヴァリル
)
 is one of the 12 servants of
Perugius
, the Armored Dragon King. A member of the Heaven Race. She is the only servant of
Perugius
 who isn't a summoned spirit.

Appearance

Sylvaril has near-white, golden hair draping down her shoulders. She wears a white mask of a bird and a gown-like white robe, while holding an expensive-looking magic staff that carries a magic stone that is opaque and dark. From her back grows a pair of jet black wings.

Personality

Sylvaril is normally uptight and proper, exuding an atmosphere of elegance. She is extremely loyal to
Perugius
, favoring those who praise her master and shows obvious hostility towards anyone who disrespects him by her accord.

Background

She was the first familiar of
Perugius
, and the only one who isn't a summoned spirit. Apparently this stems from 400 years ago when
Perugius
 was on a Laplace Campaign, he saved Sylvaril and from then, she has served him since.

Laplace
 alongside
Urupen
, while
