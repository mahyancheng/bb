Personality

Due to being teleported with only
her father
, Norn has a strong attachment to him and hates anyone that hurts him. Because of this, she initially hated
her brother
 after he got into a fight with her father. She has also shown to be quite stubborn, refusing the make up with him until years later.

Due to her father often being busy with work, she grew up to be an independent person. However, beneath her outer demeanor, Norn developed a serious inferiority complex due to constantly being compared to her outstanding siblings. Over time, this became so bad that she nearly became a shut-in, though she managed to pull through once she realized that her siblings loved her. Norn has shown herself to be a hardworking girl. It's just that she of prone to making mistakes under pressure. She is well-rounded person and prefers to separate
her family
 matters with her school life.

She is a devout believer of the
Milis Religion
 which is instilled by her mother's side of the family, and thus she strongly disapproved of Rudeus taking
Roxy
 as the second wife, since it's against that religion to have more than one wife. She later slowly accepts the fact that Rudeus has several wives. She seems to have a similar disposition toward may-december romances; having an obvious crush on
Ruijerd Superdia
, yet believing for the longest time that they could not be together due him being her peer by centuries.

,
Millis Continent

her brother
 in
Sharia
 with
her family
 and attends the
Magic University of Ranoa
.

Like Rudeus, She has
Greyrat
 Nobility and Latreia Nobility blood in her.

Alternate Timelines

Orsted Time Loop

In a world where Rudeus does not exist, Norn became an
adventurer
 where she would also sing and dance as a fighting
Classes#Bard
. She also formed a party with fellow adventurers who have similar interests and journeys toward the northern
Central Continent
 and is by standards a Rank B adventurer despite neither her Swordsmanship nor Magic are outstanding. During one of her requests, her party was annihilated by a demonic
monster
 where Norn would have died but was saved by Ruijerd. To Norn, it was love at first sight and they begin to journey together.

Power and Abilities

Unlike her parents and siblings, Norn does not have any outstanding abilities. However, she manages to rise above her peers by sheer effort which earns the respect of her family and peers alike. In a way, Norn is a "jill of all trades, but a master of none," being able to use both magic and
Battle Aura
, but not specializing in either. Also, her lack of talent means she will likely never be able to rise above the intermediate level.

Intermediate Sword God Style

Writer

Norn took interest in writing when she finds out that Rudeus is trying to make a storybook about Ruijerd who just started on the physical apperance of Ruijerd, Norn volunteers to help him since Ruijerd would tell her stories about the
Superd Tribe
 during their journey to Sharia. After her initial manuscripts, Rudeus sees Norn as a talented writer where her methods of presenting the story she is writing to be interesting.
 Through her adulthood, Norn has authored several books, that greatly affected the impression of those around her and also has been referenced by other books such as The Asura Kingdom's Dossier on Rudeus Greyrat.
