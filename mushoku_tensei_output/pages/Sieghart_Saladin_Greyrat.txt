Trivia

Sylphiette
 had three dreams involving Sieghart being chased by a shadow. He was safe in two dreams but in the last dream, Sylphy was unable to save him.

His name was originally named Sieghart Greyrat, but
Perugius
 gave him the additional name of Saladin.

He is the first child that
Rudeus
 was anxious of because of his green hair and at the time of his birth,
Almanfi
 told him that
Perugius
 wants to meet him, leading him to think that he could be the reincarnation of
Laplace
. He even doubted
Orsted
, who told him that Sieg wasn't Laplace and brought him to
Perugius
.

The doctor, who helped
Sylphiette
 deliver him, had a stiff expression after seeing his hair.
