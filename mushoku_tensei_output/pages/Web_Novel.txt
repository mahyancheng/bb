Mushoku Tensei

A 34-years-old virgin NEET with no work experience was kicked out of the house one day. While condemning himself, his life ends when he gets hit by a truck. When he woke up, he finds himself inside an infant's body; he had been reincarnated into another world.
This time, he vows he will get serious and live a new life he will not regret.

Subjugation of the Great Dragon King

The roots of the 48 Magic Swords scattered around the world and the legends of heroes who have been laughed at for years are closely linked.
This is the story of four groups of dragon slayers, their plots, ambitions and schemes, and one boy's involvement in them.

Original synopsis on Naro, translated

Subjugation of the Great Dragon King: Preface to the Final Chapter
 (王竜王討伐 - 最終章にして序章 -
Ō Ryūō Tōbatsu - Sai Shūshō ni Shite Joshō
) is story that takes place 300 years prior to the main story of Mushoku Tensei, offering insight on the slaying of the Great Dragon King from different perspectives. Though it must be noted that this story is partly non-canon; according to the author, this was one of the prototypes for Mushoku Tensei.

The story, consisting of 11 parts in total, was uploaded on a single day making it the one with the shortest serialization period out of the five stories.
