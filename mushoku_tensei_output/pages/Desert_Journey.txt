Synopsis

Upon receiving a letter from Geese saying, "Difficulty in rescuing Zenith, seeking help," Rudeus faces the tough choice of leaving behind his pregnant wife, Sylphy, along with his sisters, Norn and Aisha. Despite his inner struggle, Rudeus decides to head to the
labyrinth city of Rapan
 on the Begaritt continent with Elinalise. However, the journey turns out to be even more perilous than he imagined, putting lives at risk.

Plot

At Ranoa Magic Academy, Rudeus informs Elinalise that he is going to Begaritt who agrees to travel together after Rudeus insists on going. They then plan their trip and they first address dealing with the
Curse of Promiscuity
 of Elinalise and Rudeus suggests to use the
Curse Supressing Tool
 created by Cliff. Elinalise seems reluctant to tell Cliff that she is leaving but Rudeus tells her to talk to Cliff about it.

Rudeus then visits Nanahoshi and tells her that he will be going to Begaritt and will be gone for 2 years that surprises Nanahoshi, but quickly calms down to think. Before Rudeus leave, Nanahoshi gives him a map of Teleportation Circles of the
Human World
 and the location of the Teleportation Circle Ruins near Sharia to Begaritt. Although Nanahoshi is reluctant since Teleportation Magic is taboo in the Human World and is also sworn to secrecy, she shows Rudeus the map that upon teleporting to Begaritt he will need to travel north for a month and he should reach Rapan. Rudeus is shocked by how fast he can reach Rapan but is glad to be able to make it in time when Sylphy gives birth. Nanahoshi then reminds him to keep it a secret and she is just returning the favor and wants him to return quickly to continue her research after Rudeus thanks her.

At the Greyrat House, Rudeus announces his plans to go to Begaritt Continent that surprises Aisha while Norn remains silent. Sylphiette accepts Rudeus' decision despite promising he will not disappear on her. Sylphiette initially thought that Rudeus will be gone for 2 years but he tells her about the Teleportation Circles through Nanahoshi's help, she is worried due to her own experience with the
Teleport Incident
 but Rudeus assures her that he will come back. After talking to Aisha and Norn, Rudeus wants to name their
child
 but the girls are visibly shocked upon hearing this and Sylphy tells her that naming their child before going on journey means he will never make it back due to the legend of
Feroze Star
. Seeing Sylphy is still worried, Rudeus kisses Sylphy while Norn and Aisha looks on blushing.

At Ranoa Magic Academy, Rudeus talks to Linia and Pursena, then visits Jinas to arrange for a leave of absence for him and Elinalise then asks permission to borrow the books: "An Exploratory Account of the
Teleportation Labyrinth
" and "The Begaritt Continent and the
Fighting God Tongue
" from the Library.

At the Commerce District, Rudeus is joined by Zanoba, Juliette, and Ginger, who recommend purchasing a rather large dark horse that Rudeus names Matsukaze.

At the Greyrat House, Rudeus and Elinalise are packing up Matsukaze. Cliff then gives the Curse Supressing Tool that is smaller than the prototype and entrusts Elinalise to him. Cliff then approaches and embraces Elinalise and tells her that they will be married in a
Milis style
 ceremony when she returns. Sylphy also approaches Rudeus who once again assures her he will return soon and after giving his farewell to Norn and Aisha, Rudeus and Elinalise depart with an
adventurer
 accompanying them.

Arriving at their destination at Lumen Forest, the site of the Teleportation Circle Ruins, the adventurer leaves with Matsukaze to be returned to the Greyrat House.

Rudeus and Elinalise travels to the forest until they see a stone tablet bearing the emblem of Saint Dragon General
Szilard
. Rudeus presses his hand on the emblem and chants the incantation provided by Nanahoshi and the landscape changes to the entrance of the Teleportation Ruins, which they enter.

The two explore the ruins and descend the stairs. They see the Teleportation Circle which Rudeus confirms that it is a two-way Teleportation circle from the book he borrowed. The two then hold hands and upon stepping on the circle, they are now in Begaritt Continent. Before the leave the ruins, Elinalise volunteers to test the circle if they can return. While waiting for Elinalise to return, Rudeus explores the ruins and finds
Orsted
's extra
Coat
. Elinalise returns and Redeus deduces that the teleportation incurs a time lag.

Rudeus and Elinalise exits the Teleportation Ruins and seeing the vast desert before them, they confirm they are indeed in the Begaritt Continent. Since the night is approaching, Elinalise suggests to rest in the ruins until morning and they continue their travel.

At night, Rudeus conjures an
Earth Fortress
 for them to sleep but is exposed to a scent and begins to make a move on Elinalise who is asleep but upon hearing her utter Cliff's name, Rudeus steps outside and encounters a
Succubus
.

Rudeus approaches the Succubus but Elinalise attacks her that the monster narrowly dodges. The Succubus reveals her true form to take flight but Elinalise pummels the monster midair with her
Buckler
, causing the Succubus crash to the ground then Elinalise finishes her off by thrusting her
Estoc
 to the Succubus' heart. Rudeus, still affected by the Succubus' scent, makes a preposition to Elinalise, but she taps him on the head with her buckler and tells him to use
Detoxification Magic
.

Continuing their travel, they encounter a
Twin Death Scorpions
 where Elinalise attacks head on while Rudeus finishes it off with his
Stone Cannon
. They are then caught by a sandstorm that Rudeus nullifies with his own
Sandstorm
 spell.

A
behemoth
 accompanies them for a while. After days of travelling, Rudeus and Elinalise arrives at Bazaar, an encampment surrounding an
oasis
, where Rudeus asks for directions and have their meals.

That night, Elinalise steps out of the Earth Fortress for to pick up men while Rudeus thought that the Curse Supressing Tool still needs improvement, and they need to rescue
Zenith
 and return home as soon as possible.

Next day, Rudeus and Elinalise are in front of a cliff, causing Elinalise to suggest taking a detour but Rudeus uses
Earth Lance
 to lifts them atop the cliff but they are attacked by a
Griffon
 that Rudeus narrowly dodges. Another Griffon arrives and confronts Elinalise and the battle begins.

Seeing the Griffon attack with his
Foresight Eyes
, Rudeus responds with
Earth Hedgehog
, causing the Griffon to fly back but Rudeus follows up with
Wind Blast
, stunning the Griffon to the ground. As the Griffon lands, Rudeus follows up with a Stone Cannon and finishes it off by burning it with
Fireball
 that engulfs the Griffon in flame. Rudeus then turns his attention to Elinalise who is still fighting the second Griffon then prepares another Stone Cannon. Elinalise lands a hit on the Griffon who tried to take off. But Elinalise stabs the Griffon's front paw with her Estoc, pinning it in place as the Stone Cannon lands at the Griffon's neck and kills it.

That night, Rudeus and Elinalise are eating the drumstick of the Griffon they fought and where Elinalise talks about her adventures with Zenith who was 16, the same age of Rudeus when they first met but they decide to drop the subject when it changed to
Paul
's past.

After further travelling, Rudeus and Elinalise finally arrives at Rapan.
