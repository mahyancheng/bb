Synopsis

Rudeus finally learns that Fitz is Sylphiette. Sylphy also tells Rudeus about her feelings, and the two are united. Fitts smiles kindly at Rudeus who apologizes for not realizing that she is Sylphy for a long time. Rudeus makes up his mind and visits Ariel with Fitts.

Plot

Rudeus admits he loves Slyphie as well, but to his dismay he cannot make love to her since his impotence still isn't fully cured. Sylphie reports back to Ariel and Luke, with Luke agreeing to help Sylphie find a cure for Rudeus' impotence out of sympathy for him. Luke gifts Sylphie a rare and powerful aphrodisiac that should counter Rudeus' impotence while Ariel provides some advice on how to seduce him. Sylphie meets Rudues later that night and they both imbibe the aphrodisiac, which helps push them to make love. The next morning, after realizing that Sylphie hasn't abandoned him, Rudeus experiences an emotional catharsis and overcomes the trauma caused by Eris leaving him, and is cured of his impotence. Rudeus then thanks Ariel for her help by pledging his loyalty to her, and then asks for Sylphie's hand in marriage which she accepts. Ariel releases Sylphie from her obligation to disguise herself as Fitz and accepts Rudeus as part of her inner circle. Sylphie then thanks Ariel and Luke for everything they've done for her.
