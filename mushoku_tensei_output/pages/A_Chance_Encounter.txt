A Chance Encounter
 (邂逅
Kaigō
) is the ninth episode of the
Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on March 7, 2021.

Synopsis

Rudy and Eris find themselves stranded in the wilds of the Demon Continent. Their only chance to survive seems to lie in Ruijerd, a warrior of the infamous Superd tribe of demons, but can he be trusted?

Plot

Looking like his past self, Rudeus has a short encounter with an elusive being known as the Human-God, who instructs him to rely on and help the man who saved him. He then awakens in his current body and learns that he and Eris are stranded in the middle of the Demon Continent, and were rescued by Ruijerd Superdia, a member of the dreaded Superd race, who becomes their friend and promises to escort them back home. Ruijerd brings Rudeus and Eris to a nearby village that coincidentally is Roxy's birthplace, where they meet her parents. During their stay, Rudeus learns from Ruijerd that his tribe's ill repute comes from the cursed spears they received from the Demon-God Laplace, which turned them into mindless murderers, and that the spear in his possession belonged to his son, whose death by his hands made him recover his senses. Moved by Ruijerd's determination to clear his race's name, Rudeus decides to help him, and the two depart from the village with Eris to begin their journey back home.
