Pax Shirone

Randolph liked Pax Shirone as a person, though he acknowledged Pax's shortcomings as a ruler.

After initially meeting Pax, they periodically dined together, Randolph offering Pax advice on swordsmanship and magic.

This unlikely friendship developed because Pax and his wife, Benedict, were the only people who genuinely complimented Randolph's cooking.

Pax's appreciation for Randolph's unique culinary talents, despite his fear of being poisoned, genuinely touched Randolph.

Randolph recognized that Pax was unloved by his people and had few allies, but he still respected Pax's determination to rule well and secure a future for Shirone.

He understood Pax's frustration with his subjects' rejection and his feelings of inadequacy as a king.

When Pax decided to commit suicide, Randolph was saddened but ultimately respected his decision, recognizing Pax's desire to die with dignity as a king.

He dutifully carried out Pax's final orders to protect Benedict and educate their unborn child, imparting his own skills and offering the child the praise that Pax never received.

Benedict Kingdragon

Randolph is fiercely loyal to Benedict and committed to protecting her. Pax entrusted Benedict's care to Randolph as a dying wish, and Randolph promised to fulfill that request, even at the cost of his own life. He safely escorted her out of Shirone Castle during the rebellion and planned to return her to the King Dragon Realm. He vowed to protect her until she gave birth and then raise her child, teaching them swordsmanship, culinary skills, and academics.

He respects her as Pax's wife and the future mother of his child. Although Benedict is described as quiet and inexpressive, even being considered a "half-wit" by some, Randolph treats her with respect and deference. He addresses her as "Her Majesty" and is mindful of her presence, refusing to discuss certain topics when she is around.

He seems to view her as a simple and somewhat naive person. He notes that she was likely mimicking others when she ate properly, having never received formal instruction on etiquette. He also comments that she will likely need his help in raising her child, as she probably won't be capable of giving them enough praise.

Hitogami

Randolph Marianne had never met Hitogami and had only learned of him through stories about a relative who had interacted with the Hitogami. While Randolph does not offer a direct opinion on Hitogami, his statements about his relative's relationship with Hitogami suggest that he views the Hitogami as a dangerous and manipulative being.

Randolph states that his relative, who he later identifies as the Demon King Badigadi, had "borrowed" Hitogami's power to defeat a powerful foe to protect his fiancée. This choice of words suggests that Randolph believes Hitogami did not give his power freely but rather exacted a price for his aid.

Randolph also notes that his relative had "a rough time of it" because of his association with Hitogami. This further suggests that he believes Hitogami's involvement in people's lives often leads to negative consequences.

He warns Rudeus to avoid interacting with Hitogami, saying that "it won’t end well for you either way". This suggests that Randolph believes Hitogami is a manipulative and dangerous being who uses people to achieve his own goals, regardless of their intentions.
