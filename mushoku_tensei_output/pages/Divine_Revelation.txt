Summary

Sulking in the unknown space, Rudeus in his old form is encouraged by Eris, Rosy and Sylphie to get up as he can overcome what has happened. Only for their voices to change into a singular individual, dubbed the Man-God, granting Rudeus one word of advise before Rudeus wakes up to find he is himself. Happy he was still in his new life, he suddenly finds himself being saved from a demonic wolf pack. Hoping to find Ghislaine, he is instead met by a Superd spearman, and panics trying to find a solution to surviving. Recalling being in the unknown space, depressed at believing his life as Rudeus was a dream, the Man-God arrived to tell him that it was real and that Rudeus was caught in a mana calamity that teleported him and Eris to the demon continent. When he wakes up, Man-God advices Rudeus do one task: rely on and save the man they meet. Rudeus finds his injuries bandaged and Eris safe, believing the Superd he meets is whom Man-God meant.
