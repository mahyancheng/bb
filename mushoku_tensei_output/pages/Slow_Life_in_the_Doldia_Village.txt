Trivia

In the TV version, when Gyes explain to Minitona the past of Ghislaine, they show that both of the eyes of young Ghislaine are normal, even though it is stated that she was born with the magic eye and she didn't obtain it like Rudeus.

This was fixed in the Blu-ray version, with Ghislaine having her magic eye in that scene.
