Monsters
 are creatures that mutated from normal creatures in presence of
mana
, which pose threat to people in the world.

Overview

Monsters are the result of sudden mutations in normal animals. If they are lucky enough to grow in numbers, establish themselves as a new species, and develop intellect over the generations, they become fiends - a class of beasts that have intellect. But apparently, many creatures that possessed intelligence but still attacked humans are referred to as monsters; there are also cases of fiends growing more savage and brutal over the generations, reverting back into monsters. Due to the fact that monsters thrive on
Mana
, areas with higher mana density like the
Demon Continent
 or Labyrinths like the
Teleportation Labyrinth
 tend to have more powerful monsters.

As such, the
Adventure Guild
's Rank C and above requests are mostly subjugating a certain group of monsters or gathering parts of monsters for crafts and/or proof of kills. Adventurers usually have books on how to handle different kinds of monsters in their current region like <<
Fittoa
's Monsters, Ecology and Weaknesses>> found in the
Greyrat
 Household in
Buena Village
.

There are also plant-based monsters called Treants, which are typically ordinary plants that had sucked up too much magical energy and mutated into violent creatures. There are a considerable variety of specific monsters that fell into this broad category, but their basic patterns of behavior are very similar: they pretended to be normal trees and attack anyone who come too close. After some time, they produce seeds that grow into more of their kind

A Red Dragon attacking Orsted with its fire breath


Red Dragons are the most ferocious and dangerous among dragon species, and are regarded as the strongest monsters on the Central Continent. A single one is within lower S-rank, but they typically gather in hordes of several hundred. Of special note was their detection ability: they never miss anything that encroach on their territory, even animals as small as a dog. Since the mountain range is the place these creatures call home, it came to be known as the Red Dragon Mountains: an impassable mountain range that is a symbol of death.
While Red Dragons are formidable in combat abilities, they are terrible fliers that couldn't take flight from flat terrain. To fly, they needed to leap off tall cliffs or run down a long slope. Although the Central Continent had tall mountains, the land is mostly occupied by rolling plains and forests, thus it is rare for those living on the plains to be attacked by a Red Dragons. Granted, occasionally there would be individuals that gets caught in a turbulent wind and fall to the plains, bringing devastation to the area. When this happens, soldiers or adventurers would be called in to deal with the disturbance
. Forty A or S-ranked adventurers is the minimum recommended number of members for dragon slaying

The Luster Grizzly is one of the more common kind of monsters found in the northern region of the Central Continent. In appearance, it is basically a large bear with a white coat and a single black stripe that ran vertically down its middle. They move in sizable packs, and when winter drew near, they work together to build up huge collective stockpiles of food. At that time of year, their attacks on humans grew much more frequent.
They were comparatively mellow in the summer months, when they tended to hang around sources of water to mate. They couldn't see too well in the dark and move sluggishly at night, thus the standard method of dealing with a large pack is to find them during mating season and launch a surprise attack at night

, but are currently spread across the entire Begaritt Continent due to
Laplace
 deliberately mass producing and releasing them onto the continent to break the human defense there.
Succubus can release pheromones that smell like an intolerable stench to women and a charming sweet scent to men, which would cloud men's judgment and put them into uncontrollable lust. They would then bring a few victims back to their lair for consumption, leaving the remaining men fight each other to death, as charmed men would see other men as enemies. The only way to nullify the effect is using intermediate or higher level
detoxification magic
 or having sexual intercourse with a woman

At certain intervals, they would pause their journey to make a temporary nest, where they breed and replenish their numbers with the next generation. None of the individual ants are that powerful -- smaller ones are probably E-ranked, whereas larger ones could be D or C, but a group of thousands is a threat in high S range.

Manatite Hydra is the guardian of the Teleportation Labyrinth and is stationed at the Magic Crystal that is said to be the center of the Labyrinth where he is usually seen dormant but will attack anyone who approaches but does not pursue them and returns to being dormant near the Magic Crystal if the intruders leave or are dead. It is a nine-headed dragon approximately twice the size of a Red Dragon. Its body is covered with sharpened emerald-green scales that can nullify magic attacks and cut the victim's body upon contact. It is capable of regenerating itself when one its heads is cut, unless the wound is immediately cauterized. Each of its heads is capable of attacking independently, and each head can unleash a powerful fire breath. To defeat the monster, all its heads must be cut off or destroyed, with the wounds seared to disable its regeneration. However, like most monsters, the hydra is intelligent and can bite off the seared neck to regenerate it. When he senses that he is in danger like when it has 3 heads remaining, it would go berserk and attacks frantically until defeated.
.
The last recorded encounter with Manatite Hydras dates back to the Second Great Human-Demon War, and the species were said to be annihilated by the explosion that created the
