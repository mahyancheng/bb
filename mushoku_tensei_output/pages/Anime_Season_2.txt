Synopsis

A 34-year-old man, jobless, shut-in and NEET. On a certain day, after he got kicked out of the house, met his death in a traffic incident... or so the man thought. The instant he thought that, suddenly he was reincarnated as "
Rudeus
" in a
world of swords and magic
. With the piled regret and experience from his previous life, he swears to live his life earnestly this time around.

Meeting with various peoples, various magic training... the now developed Rudeus is setting on a really harsh and cruel journey, such as
Teleportation Incident
 involving his hometown,
Fittoa Region
, and other various tales. After prevailing many hardships and successfully coming home, Rudeus became one with her beloved
Eris
. However, the very next morning, Rudeus suffered a heavy shock after realising the sudden disappearance of Eris. He had given up on everything and reverted to his shut-in and NEET self, just like the previous world. Alas, as the only lost person in his family caused by Teleportation Incident, his mother,
Zenith
 has not been found yet. Now he is determined to find Zenith, and Rudeus is standing up on his legs once more.
