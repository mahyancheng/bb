Dead End
 (デッドエンド,
Deddo Endo
) was a party formed by
Rudeus Greyrat
 after the Teleportation incident.

History

The party was created in order for them to do adventurer jobs so that they can get some money in order for them to travel back to
Asura Kingdom
.
 It was disbanded after they reached the Fittoa Region, when Ruijerd achieved his goal of escorting the two back to their home. After the party was disbanded, Ruijerd went off to search for other surviving members of the Superd Race, Eris left to train in the Holy Land of the Sword, whereas Rudeus continued to work as an adventurer to spread his fame in hope of finding the still missing
Zenith
.

Trivia

They had the skill to obtain the S rank of the adventurer guild, but because this may limit the quest that may take, they stayed in A Rank.

Each members have their own epithet:

"Mad Dog"  Eris

"Guard Dog" Ruijerd

"Kennel Master" Rujerd (Rudeus)

In order to improve Ruijerd's and subsequently Superd's reputation, Rudeus would introduce himself as "Ruijerd of Dead End" whenever he did something amicable, and as "Rudeus" when he did something bad or got into trouble.

As a result, his name was mixed up and mistakenly spread as "Rujerd".
