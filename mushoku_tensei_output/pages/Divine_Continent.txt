Localization

Western Cliff Face

Located at the furthest north-eastern edge of the Central Continent. The cliff face is more than simple bare rock. A number of the local inhabitants believed that gods resided within this cliff, so its surface was dotted with ladders and footholds. According to
Orsted
, a shrine dedicated to the worship of these gods could be found around two hundred meters up. Further above that, there were stakes driven into the cliff face to assist with climbing. There is a road made of a series of barely walkable footholds that leads to the Demon Continent, it was a much safer bet to travel than trying to climb upwards.

Hell

One of the three greatest labyrinths in the world. This was where
Nether King Vita
 stayed to avoid
Laxus
.

Artier

A town of the Heaven Race protected by a barrier.
Perugius Dola
 has some ties with the citizens in the town, and they would guide the people who come for their child's baptism to the shrine.
