Mana
 (
魔力
,

Maryoku
, lit. "Magical Power")
 is a form of energy that exists in
Mushoku Tensei
. It is the source of all
magic
 and is comparable to energy in our world. Mana exists in almost every aspect of the
Six-Faced World
.

Background

All living beings (
humans
 and other
Races
, including
Monsters
 and plants) have mana within their bodies. However, beings like
Nanahoshi Shizuka
 are unable to hold mana within their bodies since they have tripped into the world but this mana externally accumulates over time, until their body begins to react negatively to it which is referred to as
Drain Syndrome
.

According to the
Dragon Tribe
 researchers' hypothesis: a power possessed by every living creature permeates the Six Worlds which is called
Dragon Battle Aura
 by the Dragon Tribe while the Demons call it
Mana
 or Magic Power that is said to maintain a natural equilibrium within the Six Worlds. However, the power of the Six Worlds suddenly declined, creating significant imbalances. If the power diminishes significantly in one world, it'll absorb power from another world to compensate which results to the teleport incident, causing not only trees and animals but also people to disappear.

Mana Flow

Like blood, Mana circulates throughout the body of every living being.

Because of the internal constant Mana flow (which, like
Disturb Magic
, disrupts the formation of other flows), it is impossible to materialize magic inside the body. Every living being in the Six-Faced World has a similar protection. The notable exceptions are Elinalise, who can transform the naturally accumulating mana in her body into a magic stone because of her curse, and those afflicted with Magic Stone Disease, which forcibly transforms their bodies into magic stones.

Magic

Magic is the manipulation of mana. It can be classified into the following: Attack magic (basic elements), Healing magic (buff/debuff), Summoning. Furthermore, unorthodox magic that is difficult to classify under the three main categories are referred to as unique magic (or original magic in cases of innovation, such as Electric).

It should be noted that while magic does seem to follow the law of conservation of energy, it demonstrably doesn't. Otherwise, Rudeus' mass would be equivalent to that of his body, plus the total mass that can be generated with his mana.

Mana Capacity

Mana capacity refers to the total amount of mana a person can store and use for
Magic Spells
 and
Battle Aura
. It's analogous to the concept of a reservoir holding water: the larger the reservoir, the more water it can hold, and the longer it can sustain the flow.

A person's magical power reserve, or mana, is generally believed to be inherited, and the amount one has is determined at birth. Individuals with the
Laplace Factor
, such as
Rudeus
 and
Sylphy
, have enormous amounts of aggregate mana that has increased since birth; therefore, they are considered the only exception. However, this was later proven incorrect; it is not linked to the Laplace Factor. Anyone can increase their total mana by stimulating it from a young age, as seen with
Julie
.

A person with a larger mana capacity can cast more powerful spells or a greater number of weaker spells before exhausting their reserves. This can be a significant advantage in combat situations, allowing one to sustain their attacks or unleash devastating blows.

Rudeus Greyrat
 possesses a massive mana capacity, estimated to be several times larger than the average magician. This allows him to cast powerful spells and perform feats of magic beyond the capabilities of most individuals.

Roxy Migurdia
 possesses a smaller mana capacity compared to Rudeus but excels in efficiency and control. This allows her to cast highly precise spells with minimal waste of energy.

Orsted
 possesses an immense mana capacity.

Individuals with the
Laplace Factor
, like Rudeus and
Sylphiette
, have enhanced magic aptitude and much greater mana capacity than most magicians.

Mana capacity is not the only factor that determines the effectiveness of a mage. Other aspects like talent, skill, and knowledge can also play a significant role.

The series does not provide a specific measurement unit for mana capacity, making direct comparisons between characters somewhat ambiguous.
