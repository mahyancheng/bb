Pursena Adoldia
 (
プルセナ
・
アドルディア
)
 is a member of the Doldia Tribe. Debuting at the
Ranoa Magic Academy
 alongside
Linia
, they were delinquents who terrorized the school until
Rudeus
 put them in check. Following her graduation, however, she was imprisoned by her tribe for stealing food. Fortunately, she was released by Rudeus, after which she became his maid.

Appearance

Pursena has long gray hair and red eyes, with a pair of drooping dog ears on top of her head and a fluffy tail behind indicating her Adoldia heritage. She is very well-endowed even by beast race standards, more so than Linia.

Personality

Pursena is abrasive and haughty, having the tendency to shift the blame away from herself when she gets into trouble
. Together with
Linia Dedoldia
, they are the two troublemakers in the
Ranoa Magic Academy
, but when it comes to fulfilling her dreams of becoming the Village Chief, she will do her best. In contrast to the hot-headed Linia, Pursena is more aloof and soft-spoken. Following Rudeus's victory over them in combat and subsequent imprisonment, she and Linia become more humble, no longer causing trouble and behaving as proper students.

She is a glutton when it comes to meat, constantly snacking on them wherever she goes during her school days. She is unable to learn how to control her appetite after graduation, much to her chagrin.

Background

Plot

After graduating and returned to her village, she became a warrior chief and quickly gained the trust of the other warriors with her healing magic. 10 days before
Rudeus
 arrived with
Linia
 and the
Sacred Beast
, she relieved a guard of their duty to guard the dried meat storage and her hunger got the best of her and she committed a felony by eating all of the food in the storage. She was then imprisoned until
Rudeus
 arrived and got a confession out of her. Since then she was designated as one of the
Sacred Beast
 caretakers.

Trivia

Pursena focused on learning healing magic when she was in
Ranoa Magic Academy
 because the Doldia tribe don't have many people capable of using it.

Pursena ends her sentences with -nano (なの) in the original text, and often swears in the form of "Fuck" (ファック). In the Anime this was replaced with "Nuuni", presumably the equivalent of said swear word in the Beast God tongue.

Pursena hates being called fat.

Later on confirmed that's Eris's "domination" of her and Linnia is simply hugging them until they bruise.
