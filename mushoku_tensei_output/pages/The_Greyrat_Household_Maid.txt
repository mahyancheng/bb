Summary

Back in Buena Village, Lilia serves Rudeus his afternoon tea while both see Paul fail to get on Zenith's good side. Lilia brings up her past with Paul learning sword arts and how he surpassed her, but he would goof off to have fun or chase girls. Surprising Rudeus, Lilia admits how her first time was when Paul snuck into her room and took her virginity, leading to his being expelled. The two did not see each other until she was hired as the family maid when Zenith was pregnant with Rudeus. After Rudeus apologizes for his father, Lilia apologizes for not being comfortable around Rudeus as a baby, and figured his "unusual" behavior was due to his gifted intelligence. But after getting pregnant seducing Paul, her opinion of Rudeus changed after he got Zenith to keep her in the family. With gratitude, Lilia plans to have her child also be in service to Rudeus in the years to come. Serving him more tea, Lilia is happy to be the maid and a member of the family.
