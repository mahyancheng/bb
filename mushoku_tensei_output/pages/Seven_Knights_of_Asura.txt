The
Seven Knights of Asura
 (アスラ七騎士
Asura Nana Kishi
) are seven knights who have sworn absolute allegiance to Queen of
Asura Kingdom
 -
Ariel Anemoi Asura
 herself. Even among knights they possessed a special position and independent movement was permitted to some extent. Though they have pledged their loyalty to Ariel, most of them are unrelated to the Asura Kingdom, having been gathered from outside the Royal Capital or from foreign lands.
 The Seven Knights are scouted by the Queen Ariel and the Seven Knights' leader
Luke Notos Greyrat
 themselves. Social class is not an interference in entering this order, the members range from commoners and lower ranked nobles to high ranking officials.
