Tabibito no Uta ~Kikyo~
 (旅人の唄 ~帰郷~ lit. "Traveller's Song ~Homecoming~") is the sixth opening theme of the
Mushoku Tensei
 anime performed by Yuiko Ōhara.

The song was first used in the anime as the opening theme song for
Episode 22
 and Alternative Version of
Tabibito no Uta
. The song does not have a special video-animation sequence for the credits as it is integrated into real-time scenes of the story, and varies for every episode.
