Personality

Perugius describe him as a not-great man, a coward, who hated fighting, and was always on the run.  He was bad at studying,  had not an ounce of martial talent, and was always sneaking out to the city to get drunk and ogle bar wretches.  However, Perugius respected him because even though he didn't have the ambition to become king, he had the most important factor to become one.

Background

He was the third prince of Asura, after the death of his family during the Laplace War, he became the heir to the Asuran throne and later became the king after the wars end.
