Plot

Rudeus and
Ruijerd
 are at the living room where Ruijerd informs him what he has been doing and eventually heads to East Port and together with
Ginger
, they volunteer to escort Norn and Aisha to Sharia while Sylphiette accommodates the two and currently in the bathroom. After their discussions about
Eris
, Ruijerd mentions that he will be leaving tomorrow but assures Rudeus that he will return.

Next day, Rudeus sees Ruijerd and
Badigad
i staring at each other by their gate where the latter leaves upon seeing Rudeus. When asked, Ruijerd explains that they have a history long ago that Rudeus concludes it was grudges from the
Laplace War
 and invites Ruijerd to have breakfast with them before he go.

After breakfast, Norn wants to go with Ruijerd, still resenting Rudeus for attacking Paul back at Millis, but he tells her not to think about that and to rely on Rudeus and assures Norn that they will meet again. At the living room, Rudeus formally welcomes Norn and Aisha and he is given a lockbox containing coins and valuable items from
Paul
 for funds and two letters from Paul. Following Paul's request in the letter, Rudeus decides that his sisters go to school, but Aisha declines and claim that school has nothing to teach her while Norn also refuses as well, but they both agreed to take entrance exam.

That night, Rudeus consults with Sylphiette on Aisha wishing to be his maid to which Sylphiette doesn't mind since they are neglecting the house as they are always at school and its what Aisha wants, but she is also worried about Norn.

The exam result arrives and Aisha happily shows that she got a perfect score and Rudeus agrees let Aisha help with the house and talk with Sylphiette. Norn, who scored below average, wants to live in the
dormitory
, which upsets Aisha when Rudeus permits her under the impression that Norn is getting special treatment and that she is the daughter of a concubine, but Rudeus assures her that he doesn't see her that way and sees as her as his real sister.

Days later, Norn is about to leave the Greyrat House where Rudeus give him numerous advises and also tells Norn to return to the house in 10 days.

At Ranoa Magic Academy, Rudeus is worried upon seeing Norn who seems to be alone but is approached by Linia and Pursena and gives him a bag while telling him to open it when he is alone. While wondering the contents of the bag, Rudeus meets Luke and tells him to accompany him to the Student Council Office. When they arrive, Ariel tells Rudeus the activities of Linia and Pursena of forcing new students to give up their underwear, making Rudeus realize the contents of the bag and gives it to Ariel.

With the problem sorted, Rudeus, Sylphiette, Ariel and Luke sees Norn who is apparently lost so Ariel asks Luke to guide her while Rudeus looks on still worried.

At the school grounds, Rudeus scolds Linia and Pursena for their stunt where Norn sees them and is driven away by the two to which Rudeus tells them she is his sister and further warns them they will be punished if they pull a stunt like that again.

As everyone in school goes about their everyday life, Norn is alone in her dormitory room...
