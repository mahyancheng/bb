Background

Doga was born in the Donati Province of the

After his mother's death, Doga cried for several days. When he stopped crying, he began training with the goal of protecting his sister. His weapon is an ax that was near his house. One day, a magical beast attacked the village. Doga defended his house and although his arm ended up broken, he managed to kill the beast. From then on, Doga took it upon himself to work and protect the village.

With ten years, Doga began to work worked for a time as a soldier, looking for money to take care of his sister since his father had died during the metastasis incident. He was promoted after killing some thieves and was charged with defending the city gate. During Ariel's coronation, a mysterious man tried to enter the city. The mysterious man,

Redundancy: Story of The Seven Knights of Asura

Kalman II names Doga North King and also decides that Doga and Isolte were to have a match. Doga tirelessly swings his axe against Isolte but she effortlessly countered and Doga is eventually defeated. During their battle Doga admits the Isolte is worthy of protect the King's Door in his stead and at the same time, he realizes that Isolte is graceful and a lovely flower that Doga has fallen in love with.

Doga works as Ariel's bodyguard as one of the
Seven Knights of Asura
. When Doga inspects Isolte, he leaves her sword and doesn't touch her. At that moment, he caught the attention of Isolte, who is looking for someone to marry. After the hearing, Doga offers her cold water in a very attentive way. Doga has been in love with Isolte ever since he met her in a sparring match, when Doga was not yet even a North King.

At a dinner with her brother-in-law, Hans, Doga indirectly told him about his feelings for Isolte. Hans insisted that he should go and ask Isolte to marry her right now, but Doga disagreed as he thinks he's not up to the task. After a little discussion, Doga was convinced to confess his love.

Doga went personally to the Isolte dojo dressed in formal clothes and a bouquet of flowers. He pleaded but was rejected, even after telling his whole story, as Isolte had promised Ariel to marry someone royalty. Doga decides to retire as a knight and declares himself to Isolte again. This time, Isolte realizes how much Doga loves her and decides to accept his feelings.
