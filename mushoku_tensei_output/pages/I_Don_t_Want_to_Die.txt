Plot

Rudeus
 begins to get used to school life in the university, where he studies magic he lacks experience in as well as researches the cause of the
teleportation disaster
 alongside
Fitz
. However, Rudeus begins to realize he may have a crush on Fitz, much to his confusion since he still believes Fitz is male.

Meanwhile, he also attempts to teach
Zanoba
 how to create his own sculptures, but his own lack of magic capacity and his super strength prevent him being able to sculpt. Fitz suggests that Zanoba purchase a slave who can create sculptures for him.

Rudeus, Fitz, and Zanoba then travel to the local slave market. Through Febritto, they purchase a young dwarf girl they name
Julie
. Afterwards, Rudeus begins tutoring Julie to teach her magic and general skills while she acts as Zanoba's servant.
