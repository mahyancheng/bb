Synopsis

Rudeus receives a letter from his father Paul to inform him that he sent Norn and Aisha, his younger sisters to Sharia and to take care of them. Meanwhile, Nanahoshi, who was teleported from the same world as Rudeus to the Human World, continues to research
Summoning Magic
 to return to his original world, but she is becoming increasingly impatient as she cannot complete her research...

Plot

On his way back to the Greyrat House, Rudeus receives a letter from Paul informing him that he and his party are currently in East Port at the southern part of the
Central Continent
 and are about to depart for the
Begaritt Continent
 to search for Zenith. But since Begaritt Continent is as dangerous as the
Demon Continent
, Paul has decided to send Norn and Aisha to live with Rudeus in Sharia while they rescue Zenith. Rudeus eagerly accepts Paul's request to help his family as the eldest son while wondering who is accompanying them that he knows.

At the kitchen, Sylphiette is preparing dinner and Rudeus happily tells her that her sisters are on their way to stay with them. During their dinner, Rudeus asks if there is anything he can do for Sylphy who asks him to teach him how to use
Disturb Magic
 that Rudeus used during the Entrance Exam and in return, Sylphie will teach Rudeus Advanced
Healing Magic
 which also becomes their daily routine after dinner. During the practice, Rudeus realizes that he cannot feel another's
Mana
 to interfere with his own which makes him unable to advance his Healing Magic. While Sylphy is practicing Disturb Magic, Rudeus asks if their children will have for
Magic
 too which flusters Sylphy but because she is an
Elf
, it maybe difficult expect a child soon.

At the Ranoa Magic Academy, Nanahoshi shows Rudeus a
Magic Circle
 larger than her previous creations, hoping that they can move to the next step of the Summoning Magic research. Although Rudeus is worried that they might cause another
Teleport Incident
, he begins pouring Mana to the Magic Circle to
summon an object from another world
. As Rudeus is pouring Mana to the Magic Circle, he senses that something is off and the Magic Circle short circuits. Nanahoshi is visibly shaken by this and tells Rudeus that he can leave. While Rudeus is outside Nanahoshi's room, he hears Nanahoshi snaps and begins smashing things in the room, causing Rudeus to restrain her until she calms down.

At the corridor, Rudeus is seen by other students carrying Nanahoshi where he meets Zanoba and After explaining the situation, Zanoba carries Nanahoshi to the Infirmary. Rudeus who is also shaken by what happened, explains what Nanahoshi has been doing and decides that he will bring her to his house until she recovers.

On their way to the Greyrat House, Zanoba once again carries Nanahoshi while Rudeus suddenly carries Juliette to her surprise and asks her how Zanoba is treating her. Juliette happily responds but also made Rudeus wonder how if Nanahoshi is eating properly and that he doesn't know anything about her aside from both of them are originally from Japan.

At the Greyrat House, Sylphy informs Rudeus that Nanahoshi, who is staying at a room prepared for the younger sisters is sleeping and she already perform Healing Magic on her just incase. Sylphy also gives him Nanahoshi's dagger to which Rudeus decides to keep for the time being.

At the Living Room, Rudeus tells Zanoba and Juliette of Nanahoshi's conditions to which Zanoba remarks that even Rudeus has the same expression as Nanahoshi as well. After Rudeus explains how he once felt powerless and shut himself off although Zanoba cannot understand that feeling, he assures Rudeus he will help in any way he can.

At Nanahoshi's Room, Rudeus continues watching over Nanahoshi now blankly staring at the window. After trying to console her but to no avail, Rudeus was about to leave but Nanahoshi utters how Magic Circles are like circuit boards but she is unable to connect one part of it no matter how she tried, leading her to conclude she cannot go back home and lies down.

At Ranoa Magic Academy, Rudeus shows Nanahoshi's Magic Circle to Zanoba, Juliette, Cliff and Elinalise to get their opinions on how to fix it. Cliff tries to figure out the parts where the Mana won't connect but also struggles to fix it so Zanoba suggests to try a multi layered Magic Circle, similar to the doll they
acquired
 at the Greyrat House before renovations. After studying the Magic Circles in the doll, Cliff confirms that fixing the Magic Circle is possible to the relief of Rudeus.

Rudeus brings Nanahoshi to her Research Room at Ranoa Magic Academy and at his signal, the rest presents several Magic Circles layered together. Upon seeing the multi-layered Magic Circle's potential fix, Nanahoshi recovers and begins drawing a new Magic Circle to try again with Cliff assisting her. For next few days, Nanahoshi works with everyone and the New Magic Circle is finally complete. Rudeus pours Mana on the Magic Circle once again and this time, a plastic bottle is summoned at the circle's center. Nanahoshi happily confirms that the first phase to summon an object from another world is a success and they can proceed to the next phase. After Nanahoshi apologizes for the trouble, Elinalise suggests that she treats them as a celebration to which Nanahoshi accepts but they are even after this.

At the pub, the group is joined by Syphie,
Linia
,
Pursena
 and Badigadi and the celebration begins as Rudeus recalls how different his previous life is from what he has now.

At the end of the celebration, Rudeus carries a sleeping Sylphie back to the Greyrat House, where he sees Norn and Aisha at the front door where the latter rushes him with an embrace and Ruijerd also greets him who apparently accompanied her sisters.
