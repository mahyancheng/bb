Plot

Luke
 confront
Rudeus
 about what he has done to Flitz, but he acts ignorance and has no intention of revealing Flitz's true identity to anyone else.
Ariel
 confronts Flitz about everything that has happened to her, how Rudeus approached her and Luke at the super market, that she intentionally told him that she was male and Rudeus knows she's actually a female from what Luke told her.

She tells her she was patience with Flitz taking her time, but grows tired of her indecisive and pressures her to reveal her identity to Rudeus and she shouldn't hold back because she still owes Ariel for saving her life She tells Flitz she is her friend, not her servant, and once again asks what Flitz really wants. She tells him she wants to be together with Rudeus. However, Fitz is still uncertain if Rudeus remembers her as Sylphie, so Ariel and Luke come up with a plan to help jog Rudeus' memory.

When Ariel asks if there are any strong memories she has with Rudeus, Sylphie mentions that he thought she was a boy when they were kids, and that when they bathed together and Rudeus undressed her, he found out she was actually a girl. When asked what kind of relationship she seeks with Rudeus, Fltiz tells her she’s fine having lots and lots of kids with him. With that information, Ariel supports Flitz's choice, but warns her if she fails to tell Rudeus her identity, she will use her authority as the second princess of Asura to forbid her having further contact with Rudeus.

Later, Fitz invites Rudeus to accompany her to gather a rare flower deep in the Forest of Hail despite it being the middle of winter. When he asks to bring someone with them, Flitz is against it, stating it would cause Ariel some trouble and that they should do it with just the two of them. Rudeus agrees and the pair travel into the forest. Fitz then secretly uses her ring which suddenly causes it to rain, soaking both her and Rudeus before they can reach shelter inside a cave.

Rudeus strips off his wet clothes to avoid hypothermia and advises Fitz to do the same, but Fitz insists that Rudeus strip her instead. Rudeus complies and recognizes her as Sylphie, his childhood friend from
Buena Village
, much to her relief. Now properly reunited with Rudeus, Sylphie admits that for a long time, she has loved him and wants to stay with him forever.
