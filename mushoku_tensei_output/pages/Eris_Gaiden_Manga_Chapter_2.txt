Trivia

Original chapter that narrates a small adventure of Eris rescuing a girl kidnapped by Gobling.

In volume 20 of the light novel, it is made clear that Goblin-like moustros reside on the continent of Milis, but the manga shows how some live on the continent of central, a small mistake of the Spin Off.  During the same volume Rudeus has an internal monologue about how Goblins would possibly be considered demons because of their primitive life, if they lived in the central continent.
