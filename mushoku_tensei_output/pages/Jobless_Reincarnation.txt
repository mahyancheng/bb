Plot

After being hit by a truck and dying, a hopeless and jobless Japanese man reincarnates into a fantasy-like world as
Rudeus

Paul Greyrat
 and his wife, the healer
Zenith
. Keeping his memories of his previous life, Rudeus quickly learns to read and eventually starts practicing magic. Noticing his aptitude, Rudeus' parents hire the adventurer
Roxy Migurdia
 as his magic teacher. Roxy has some doubts at first about tutoring him due to his tender age until she witnesses his unique ability to cast magic instantly and realizes his potential. As the Greyrat family gives a welcome party to Roxy, Rudeus vows to work hard to improve himself and make proper use of the second chance he was given to have a happy and fulfilling life.

Adaptation Notes

This episode adapts the following material:

Light Novel Volume 1

Chapter 1: Is This Another World?

Chapter 2: The Creeped-Out Maid

Chapter 3: A Textbook of Magic

Chapter 4: Master

Differences with the light novel:

The episode extended the Prologue Chapter by adding an original scenario where pre-reincarnation Rudeus was brought up to a hospital after the accident.

In the light novel, pre-reincarnation Rudeus dies instantly in the accident spot by receiving a second collision from the truck.

The full-length Prologue Chapter adaptation was instead included in
 Episode 2
.

While in the anime the first Intermediate spell casted by Rudeus is called
Water Splash
, in the novel it is called
Water Cannon.

Lilia can be seen eating dinner with the Greyrat family. In the light novel, she didn't join for meals and upheld her maid status until the pregnancy crisis.
