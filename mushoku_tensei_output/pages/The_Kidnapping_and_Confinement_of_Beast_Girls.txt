Synopsis

While Zanoba and Julie are progressing in their doll making, Rudeus remembered the Roxy doll that he once made and now in Zanoba's possession. He asked Zanoba where it is, but the doll was in pieces. Zanoba explains that it was destroyed in a duel between the
Beast Race
 Princesses Rinia and Pursena which causes Rudeus to tremble with anger.

Plot

As Sylphie gets used to school life with Rudeus back in her life, she begins to realize that she may have romantic feelings for him. One month after Zanoba's purchase of Julie, Rudeus has been able to teach her basic magic as well as how to cast without incantations. However, when Zanoba shows Julie Rudeus' sculpture of Rujierd, Rudeus asks about the sculpture of Roxy that he had also made. Zanoba is forced to admit that in his first year, he lost a duel to Linia and Pursena, who destroyed the sculpture. Angered at this slight against Roxy, Rudeus defeats Linia and Pursena in a fight and confines them in his room, but leaves them tied up for so long that they wet themselves, forcing him to clean them up. He then consults with Fitz on the best way to punish them without creating a grudge, and Fitz comes up with the idea to prank the beastgirls by forcing them to wear embarrassing face markings for one day. Linia and Pursena leave with a grudging respect for Rudeus after learning he trained under Ghislaine, and Rudeus spends some time alone with Fitz. Fitz considers removing her sunglasses to show Rudeus her face, but decides against it.
