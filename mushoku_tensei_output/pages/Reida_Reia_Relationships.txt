Isolde Cluel

Isolde Cluel is Reida's granddaughter and student in the Water God Style. Though she is strict with Isolde, Reida also holds Isolde in high regard as the next carrier of the Water God Style. Isolde calls her 'Master' and mutually holds her grandmother with sincere respect.

Reida brought Isolde to the
Holy Land of Swords
 after being invited by Gal Fallion to train his students. During the battle for
Asura Kingdom
, Reida wishes for Isolde to cut her down after her assassination job is complete, and excludes her from involvement in the attempt to kill Ariel and the others. Isolde lamented her death over the next few days but did not begrudge Ariel nor Rudeus and co. for it.

Auber Corvette

You think you're gonna hurt the North God Style's reputation or something? Too damn bad. I'm cleaning up your mess here, boy! Hurry up and grow a pair!

Reida and Auber are acquaintances. Reida does not view Auber positively after his repeated failure to eliminate Ariel Anemoi Asura and Rudeus Greyrat. She condescendingly calls him a coward and his ambushes half-assed, and is visibly annoyed at having to clean up his mess.

Darius Silva Ganius

The girl’s first love ended then and there… but I wouldn’t say it turned to hate, exactly. Her gratitude and disgust cancelled each other out.

Reida's first love. When Reida was young, she was saved by Darius from some nobles who wanted to cut her arms off. She meets him again years after she becoming a Water King and instructor, but by then he became a horrible human being and forgot all about her. Her gratitude and disgust cancelled each out, but she nevertheless still fell a debt towards him which the
Man-God
 takes advantage of.

Orsted

Reida has fought Orsted in the past, who left her alive for the simple fact that she was not a disciple of the Man-God at the time.
