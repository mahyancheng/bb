 (無職転生 〜異世界行ったら本気だす〜
Mushoku Tensei: Isekai Ittara Honki Dasu
, lit. "Jobless Reincarnation: I Will Seriously Try If I Go to Another World"), abbreviated as
Mushoku Tensei
 (無職転生), is a Japanese light novel series written by
Rifujin na Magonote
 with illustrations by

. The series originally started as a web-based novel series on November 22, 2012 uploaded by the author on the website
Shosetsuka ni Naro
; following its success on the site's popularity it was acquired by

SYNOPSIS

An unnamed 34-year-old Japanese NEET is evicted from his home following his parents' death. Upon some self-introspection, he concludes that his life was ultimately pointless. Walking down a street he intercepts a speeding truck heading towards a group of teenagers, in an attempt to do something meaningful for once in his life he manages to pull one of them out of harm's way before getting himself in the way of the truck and dying. Awakening in a baby's body, he realizes he has been reincarnated in a world of sword and sorcery. He resolves to become successful in his new life, discarding his past identity for his new life as Rudeus Greyrat. Due to inherited affinity and early training, Rudeus becomes highly skilled at magic with help from his previous life's intuitions. During his childhood, he becomes a student of a demon magician Roxy Migurdia, a friend to half-elf Sylphiette, and a tutor to noble heiress Eris Boreas Greyrat. Rudeus tries his best to live this new life with no regrets to leave behind.
