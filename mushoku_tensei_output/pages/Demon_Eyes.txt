Kishirika's various Demon Eyes in the Manga



Demon Eyes
 (
魔眼
,

Magan
, alt. "Magic/Mystic Eyes")
 refer to special eyes that have abilities associated with them. How one obtains these eyes may vary, but it's possible for some to be born with them, such as someone born with the
Laplace Factor
, but it's more commonly known that one can be bestowed a demon eye by
Kishirika Kishirisu
.

Mastering demon eyes require precise control of the flow of mana, and most users are unable to fully control them throughout their lives. As a result, most users would wear an eyepatch to cover their demon eyes when they're not using them
.

Known Demon Eyes

There are a number of Demon Eyes. Kishirika possesses 12 of them, but only 7 of them are described.
 It's unknown what the other eyes are possessed by Kishirika. Demon Eyes have long existed even in the era of the
Six-Faced World
 and some of its users are not even aware that they have such eye until they are told to focus their
Mana
 to their eyes.

The most common of Demon Eyes,
Magic Power Eyes
 (
魔力眼
,

Maryoku me
)
 allow the user to view the flow of mana directly. The eye appears to be a deep green color, and has a cross-like pattern, with something like 4 extra pupils appearing around the main center pupil.

Identification Eyes

When looking at something with the
Identification Eyes
 (
識別眼
,

Shikibetsu me
)
, the details of that object will be shown in texts. However, only information within Kishirika's knowledge would be provided, whereas anything that she doesn't know would be shown as "unknown".

Known Users:

Cliff Grimoire

X-ray Eyes

As the name suggests,
X-ray Eyes
 (
透視眼
,

Tōshi me
)
 allow one to see through opaque objects, including walls or clothes. However, it doesn't allow one to see through living creatures or dense magical power.

Known Users:

Kishirika Kishirisu

Clairvoyant Eyes

The
Clairvoyant Eyes
 (
千里眼
,

Senri me
, lit. "Thousand Miles Eyes")
 allow the user to see far away. However, the "Focus point" is difficult to control. Rather than acting as a scope, the Clairvoyant Eyes seem to change the perspective of one's vision, with the amount of mana determining the distance from the user.

Known Users:

Kishirika Kishirisu

Rudeus Greyrat

The
Foresight Eyes
 (
予見眼
,

Yoken me
)
 allows one to see into the future, seeing possible outcomes. However, like the Clairvoyance Eyes, it's difficult to control "focal point", which in this case means how far into the future one wants to see, and the opacity of the future imagery. The further one tries to see, the more outcomes are shown to them, but these outcomes become blurred together
. The appearance of this eye has a color similar to Rudeus' natural eyes, however the pupil takes on a swirl shape, similar to a whirlpool.

Known Users:

Kishirika Kishirisu

Rudeus Greyrat

Absorption Eyes

These Eyes absorb magic power. However, they also absorb one's own magic, so it's disadvantageous for a magician to have the
Absorption Eyes
 (
吸魔眼
,

Kyūma me
)
.

Known Users:

Kishirika Kishirisu

All-Seeing Eyes

The
All-Seeing Eyes
 (
万里眼
,

Banri me
, lit. "Ten-Thousand Miles Eyes")
 allow the user to see all things in the world, even being able to find specific people, and peer into labyrinths. However, a dense enough magical power can hinder the sight of the All-Seeing Eyes.

Known Users:

Kishirika Kishirisu

Absolute Void Eyes

The
Absolute Void Eyes
 (
空絶眼
,

Sora zemme
)
 create a barrier around a large area. It's unclear exactly how the barrier operates, but it's able to prevent a large mass of people from entering a castle.

Known Users:

Randolph Marianne

Affection Eyes

The
Affection Eyes
 (
魅了眼
,

Miryō me
)
 causes people to become infatuated with the user. Because some users can't control them, they'll usually cover the eye with bandages or an eyepatch.

Known Users:

Other

Laplace had a unnamed demon eye that allows its him to see traces of living beings in an area that can be differentiated by person and can be tracked to its owner despite the long distance from where it was initially found even if the traces were left decades ago.

Known Users:

Laplace

Trivia

The
All-Seeing Eyes
 original kanji (万里眼) literally means "Ten-Thousand Miles Eyes", likely to indicate that these eyes are on a higher level than the
Clairvoyant Eyes
 (
千里眼
, lit. "Thousand Miles Eyes")
.
