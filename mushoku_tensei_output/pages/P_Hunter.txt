P Hunter
 was a party formed by
Jalil
 and
Vizquel
 on the
Demon Continent
.

History

A former Adventurers' Guild party based in
Rikarisu City
, who would primarily take on lost pet quests, eventually leading to them capturing animals they thought to be lost pets whenever they saw one on the streets, accepting the quest to find them, and then cashing in on the reward since they found the "lost" pet. Roman caught on to their misdeeds, and forced his way into the party as their "bodyguard", but was really just blackmailing them into giving him a portion of their earnings while doing none of the work. However
Rudeus
 and the members of
Dead End
 stumbled upon this operation, and after some blackmail got them to stop the shady business and eventually forced the members to briefly join Dead End, resulting in P Hunter being disbanded.

They were able to advance to a C rank party, but did not do so for a long while as it would make them unable to accept E rank quests, which they frequently did. However, Rudeus forced them to rank up to C once they met.
