Chronology

Mushoku Tensei

He first appears after the Mana Calamity which teleported Rudeus and Eris to the Demon Continent. He advises Rudeus to trust and help Ruijerd. Rudeus immediately finds him suspicious. However over time he starts to trust him after all of the beneficial advice Hitogami has given him. However it seems that the Human God is constantly working against Rudeus, and Rudeus just has strange luck that everything works out for him. However when the future Rudeus comes back to the current time it is revealed that the Human God will cause the death of everyone Rudeus cares about. This is because the Human God sees a future where Orsted teams up with Rudeus's descendants to kill the Human God. To counter this future he tells Rudeus that he will not be left alone unless he kills Orsted. However after Rudeus and Orsted fight Rudeus joins the fight against the Human God as long as Orsted promises to defend his family. Although Hitogami cannot speak to Rudeus anymore, he still has many apostles. During the events of the Asura Kingdom Chapter, Hitogami manipulated Darius, Reida, and Luke. Hitogami manipulated Geese the entire time and had him take Zenith out of Cliff's house and deliver her to the Latreia House.

Mushoku Tensei Sequel

Hitogami's fate is one of the major story threads that remained unresolved by the end of Mushoku Tensei. However, Rudeus did see a vision where his and
Roxy's
 daughter,
Lara
, helped
Orsted
 and an unknown individual, presumably
Shinohara Akito
, reach his realm to finally kill him. This implies that Hitogami will once again be a major antagonist in the planned sequel series.
