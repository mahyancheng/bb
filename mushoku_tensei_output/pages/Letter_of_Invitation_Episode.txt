Synopsis

Rudeus, who had become impotent and let out the feelings he had been harbouring, hit it off with Soldat and later accepts his offer to
join him
 so they began to work together. While staying in the town of Pippin, Rudeus is visited by Elinalise, who was once a member of the same party as
Paul
,
Fangs of the Black Wolf
, and she as been traveling with
Roxy
. She gives Rudeus some information about
Zenith
.

Plot

Rudeus spends the next two years adventuring with Soldat's
Stepped Leader
 party, jumping from town to town, in hopes of spreading the story of Rudeus, eventually culminating in him slaying a
red dragon
 singlehandedly. He could not bring himself to go back to Rusenburg, because he knew Counter Arrow would only distract him from his main objective. Shortly after, in the city of Pippin, Elinalise finally catches up to Rudeus and informs him that Paul and Roxy had already set off to the
Maze City of Rapan
, Begaritt Continent to find
Zenith
 and takes around 1 year to travel. In the meantime, Rudeus decides to stay in the
northlands
 until winter passes before traveling to Rapan himself, and he quickly finds out about Elinalise's
sexual promiscuity
.

Some time later, Rudeus receives a letter from the Ranoa University of Magic inviting him to attend as a "special student" due to his recent exploits. Rudeus is intrigued, but wants to find Zenith first. That night, Rudeus encounters the Human-God in his dreams again, with Hitogami advising him to enroll at the University and investigate the
Teleport Incident
 there, promising that doing so will cure his erectile dysfunction. Rudeus is persuaded to accept the University's invitation and journeys to Ranoa with Elinalise. Meanwhile, it is shown that Sylphie, Ariel, and Zanoba are also students at the University.
