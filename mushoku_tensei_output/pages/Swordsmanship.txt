Due to the influence of the
Superd Tribe
, spears are said to be weapons of the devil and long-handled weapons are not favored, and bows with limited attack power cannot be used against strong people due to the existence of
Battle Aura
, so swordsmanship was emphasized and developed.

Three Major Schools

There are three schools of swordsmanship that are mainstream in the human world. Only those who have studied one of the Three Major Schools are called Swordsmen; in other schools, even if they use a sword, they are not called Swordsmen but Warriors.

All three schools have seven ranks:

Elementary Rank
 (
初級
,

Shokyū
)

Intermediate Rank
 (
中級
,

Chūkyū
)

Advanced Rank
 (
上級
,

Jōkyū
)

Holy Rank
 (
聖級
,

Sei-kyū
)

Royal Rank
 (
王級
,

Ō-kyū
)

Imperial Rank
 (
帝級
,

Tei-kyū
)

Divine Rank
 (
神級
,

Kami-kyū
)

At the
Intermediate Rank
, they have the power to compete with ordinary knights, at the
Holy Rank
, they are called geniuses, and at the
Royal Rank
 and above, they are considered to be among the most talented in the world.
