Differences with the Light Novel:

In the light novel, the design of Rudeus' prison was a cabin with Iron bars.

When Rudeus escaped with Geese, he froze the tree where his clothes and staff were in order to prevent them from being damaged by the fire, wearing only the the vest he acquired from Geese. In the anime, he retrieves them.

In the anime, Gyes replace Gimbal, another beastman.

In the light novel, Gimbal was killed in the battle against Gallus. In the anime, Gyes was injured instead by Gallus.

A short scene where Rudeus checked if Gallus was unconscious or not after the battle was cut.

In the light novel, Rudeus doesn't fall unconscious after the battle.

A short scene that explains how the holy beast was kidnapped and the smugglers plans was cut.

Sauros execution is shown in the anime. In the Light Novel, it took place off screen and was only mentioned in the
6th Volume
.
