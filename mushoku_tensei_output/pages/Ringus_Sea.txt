Notable Places

Devil's Cave
: A labyrinth that sits in the middle of the Ringus Sea. It is brutally difficult to even reach this labyrinth and due to its location, it is impossible to resupply once arrived. Given its depth and the fact that slow-paced exploration is almost impossible, it has earned the reputation as one of the toughest tests an adventurer can face.

Trivia

There are many pirates who rule these waters between the continents.
