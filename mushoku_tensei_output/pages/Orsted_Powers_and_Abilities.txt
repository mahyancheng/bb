"I shall grant my child my every technique, and to him the ability to remain concealed until he could defeat Hitogami... but that will not be enough. He must find out what happened to Human God, and how Hitogami obtained divine powers in the first place. Until then, defeat is inevitable."

Power and Abilities





Dragon God Orsted considered to be the most powerful being of the Human World



A descendant of both the
First Dragon God
 and
true Human God
, Orsted is a demi-god with potential surpassing mere mortals.
 He is the current holder of the Dragon God title, which is only given to the strongest member of the
Dragon Tribe
, who are themselves considered the strongest species. As a result of his kind's advanced lifespan and great power, along with being stuck inside a time loop, he has either mastered or has knowledge of virtually every form of swordsmanship and magic. He is also a quick learner, mastering
Rudeus'
 dual casting technique after just seeing it once.

Currently, Orsted is the strongest being in the
Human World
, having surpassed the Technique God, Demon God and
Laplace's
 original self.
 He is powerful enough to destroy the entire world according to
Hitogami
, being held back only by one weakness that forces him to be careful with how much of his power he uses at once: a slow mana-recovery. Every occasion where he does go all-out has ended in his overwhelming victory, defeating fellow God-Rank opponents like Rudeus,
Reida Reia
, and
Kalman III
 with relative ease. In one of his loops, he even managed to defeat the
Sword God
,
North God
, and a Demon Lord at once.
 It's said that if Orsted were to deliver an all out serious attack, entire continents would disappear.

Physical Abilities

Orsted's physical capabilities are unrivaled within the series, he easily defeated North God
Kalman III
 even when the latter was equipped with Dragon king sword Kajakuto, the magic blade that controlled gravity and the Fighting God armor; the same armor that withstood an attack that split a supercontinent into two.

His reaction speed is completely beyond any other character as he was able to perceive a lightning bolt from the sky and was about to run from its course; had he not been trapped by Rudeus. He was capable of casually reacting to and deflecting Water god
Reida Reia
's trump card, "Sword of Deprivation" before easily killing her.

As mentioned above, Orsted has mastered all styles of swordsmanship including the Sword God style, this allows him to use Longsword of Light, its variants and its equivalents in other sword styles perfectly. Infact, his mastery with Longsword of Light is such that he can recreate its usage without the need of a sword at all, using his own hands as swords instead.

His outstanding physical abilities has allowed him to perform feats such as killing 2 red dragons with one hit each. Defeating
Ruijerd
 in 10 seconds with just punches. Punching Rudeus several hundred meters away while he was wearing magic armor Mk. 1.

Stamina and Resilience

Orsted is never shown to be tired in his limited combat scenes. Has high pain tolerance and was not bothered by his arm getting cut off, that he even picked it up and used his own severed arm as a weapon.  He is able to withstood several of Rudeus' strongest attacks while he was donning the Mk. 1 Magic Armor that that is said to imitate the Fighting God Armor.

Also, being from the ancient dragon tribe, he can survive for about 100 days without food and go without sleep for 10 days due to their high resilience.

Combat Ability

Water God Style
 Flow against Eris



Most of Orsted's abilities and sword techniques are God ranked, the highest attainable. He tends to fight defensively to see how his opponent attacks, observes an opponent's attacks he has never seen before to learn the technique or spell himself
  otherwise he tends fight only with his bare hands and Saint Dragon Battle Aura when he knows the opponent's skill or technique they are using, giving the impression that he does not fight seriously but he gradually adjusts to using magic depending on how strong the opponent is. Orsted usually finishes off his opponent by punching a hole in their chest with his claws especially on apostles of Hitogami
 called Claw Technique, a part of the fundamental fighting style of the Dragon Tribe:
Teaching of Nail, Fangs and Wings


Saint Dragon Battle Aura

Ruijerd
1/2

The strongest unarmed fighting style that makes the least use of mana in combat. Created by the previous Dragon God
Urupen
 that protects the user from most magic spells and sword techniques. Orsted learns Saint Dragon Battle Aura from a secret note left behind by Urupen and with that information, he successfully learns his predecessor's greatest fighting style and mastered it to the highest level.
 On their first battle, Rudeus is able overcome the Saint Dragon Battle Aura to wound Orsted's hand using the intermediate rank spell Stone Cannon, which had it's power increased to a very high level with the abilities of Silent Spell-Casting.

As a testament to its toughness, Rudeus's Stone Cannon could barely break through Orsted's Battle Aura, despite being able to completely blow away strong opponents like Badigadi (who has a King Tier battle aura) and Atofe (whose battle aura should be even higher than Badigadi's).

For reference, Nina's Longsword of Light technique (when she was at the rank of Sword Saint) barely scratched Badigadi.

Intellectual Abilities

Orsted knows most if not all people in the world, at the very least those of great importance, including how and when they are born and from whom due to his multiple reincarnation time loops. Orsted would give Rudeus what seems to be odd missions on the surface (eg. rescuing an adventurer in a labyrinth, helping a merchant lost in the forest, going to the slave market to buy a slave to be sold somewhere else or even helping a young female dwarf thief called Tal Qi) but they are step-by-step preparations. Thus those people they help will be useful to Orsted in the future and making it the key to not only make sure that he is in his best condition for the [decisive battle] but also for Rudeus to establish a network of new contacts and friends.

In addition to his multiple reincarnation time loops, he knows how to battle against every kind of opponent such as crushing the lungs of a magician to prevent them from casting spells and can give advice on improving the Gattling Gun to combat Water God Style users. After
Ariel Anemoi Asura
 becomes the next Queen of
Asura Kingdom
, Orsted begins training Rudeus on different magic and tactics such as fire mage and swordsman strategies that are hard to defend against. With his knowledge of the ultimate attacks of all three sword styles and how to counter each one, Orsted also teaches Rudeus numerous techniques, especially from the
Sword God Style
, like what to be careful of and what to counter with that Rudeus made very good progress for only a year that he feels that he has been fooling around too much in the past.

Magic Abilities

Knows most
Magic Spells
 but because of his slow mana regeneration he rarely uses magic unless fighting a strong opponent.

Silent Spell-Casting

Orsted is among the few people who can use spells without the use of chants. Despite this, Orsted is puzzled that Rudeus needs to use the chant of a new spell being taught to him before he can use its voiceless incantation version.

Healing Magic

On his second battle against Rudeus and Eris, Orsted combines Silent Spell-Casting with Healing Magic that restores his severed arm and his wounds fully healed in an instant.
 After the battle, Orsted heals Rudeus' wounds that also restores the arm that was severed from the
Teleport Labyrinth
  which is classified to be at least King Rank Healing Magic. He has also healed the hole he put in Rudeus' chest. Although the rank of this healing magic is never confirmed, it wouldn't be far off to assume it is Emperor or God class.

Summoning Magic

Although the magic rank is not specified, Orsted is able to write a magic circle for Summoning Magic for a being to serve as a guardian of Rudeus' family against Hitogami. Almanfi describes the Summoning Magic to be "a complex technique" and when used with Rudeus' magic power, it is able to override the contract of Almanfi as
Perugius Dola
's familiar which Almanfi deems impossible.

Voice Magic

Magic of the Doldia tribe that uses sound. The user howls or roars to disrupt an opponent's balance like an electric shock and paralyze them. One of the only spells which cannot be replicated with a Magic Circle

Hypnosis Magic

Magic of the Nuka tribe that Orsted uses to put his opponent to sleep

Disturb Magic

Disturb Magic (Ran Ma) cancels an opponent's magic by disrupting the magic and causing it to never take shape and scatter. Ran Ma only targets one part of the body. On Orsted's first battle, Ran Ma seals the magic on Rudeus' right hand but is able to use magic with his left hand.

Dragon Gate

Orsted summons a gate engraved with dragon statues that absorbs the magic power of his opponent. When Dragon Gate is used against Rudeus, the gate cracks leaving some of the effects of Rudeus' magic to make a smaller explosion causing Orsted to remark that Rudeus' magic power is on the same level as
Laplace
.

Unnamed Presence Search Technique

Orsted can use an unnamed magic technique to search for presence of people in a certain radius(although it could be the case that the radius depends on the amount of mana he puts in). He used it in his second battle against Rudeus to search and quickly catch up to him. Also, he once used it to find Lara when she got lost in his office. Since he is quite mindful of using mana, it could be inferred that this technique uses negligible or minimal amount of mana.

Gravity magic

Reincarnation Technique

When Orsted dies while alive, or once 200 years have passed since beginning the technique, he is sent back in time to the winter of the year 330 of the Armored Dragon era, precisely to the northern forests of the
Central Continent
. He has executed this time-loop more than 100 times—but stopped counting after reaching that threshold. Technically, this is a time rewind—a loop that resets everything up to that point, erasing all prior events. What carries over between each loop are Orsted’s knowledge and skills. Physically, the first ten years of each loop are spent retraining and restoring his physique.

Effect

By falling outside the
world's natural order
, Orsted becomes undetectable by
Hitogami
, who thus cannot observe his present or future. Instead, Hitogami sees alternate, incorrect futures in which Orsted doesn’t participate.

Because the secret art remains constantly active—continuously consuming mana—Orsted’s mana recovers at a rate 1000 times slower than normal. For perspective, while
Rudeus
 can recover from a drained state in about 10 days under normal conditions, Orsted would take roughly 30 years to regenerate his mana. As a result, Orsted must conserve mana and cannot unleash his full strength freely.

Weaknesses

Slow Mana Regeneration

Due to the numerous Magic Circles placed on Orsted, he has extremely slow mana regeneration (he may not be able to replenish his mana capacity fully in 100 years) due to his unique situation of time loop reset via reincarnation slowing it down, making him reluctant to use magic as he is saving it for when he faces Hitogami.

Dragon Tribe Curse

"Ever since I was born, I was indeed shunned by all living creatures."

-Orsted

Orsted has a curse on him that makes all living creatures of the
Human World
 whether its man, beast, demon, etc., either hate him or fear him extremely. However, this is not a problem for people not of this world like Rudeus and Nanahoshi.

Although it is not directly implied to be a curse until it was mentioned by Hitogami, this effect of fear and hatred towards the Dragon Tribe is traced beginning from the
Six-Faced World
 Era where the Dragon Tribe waged war on the other worlds and after witnessing the First Dragon God kill the other Gods, and with it, the world that those Gods ruled is also destroyed and the denizens of that world to flee in fear to the Human World. Due to the final battle between the First Dragon God and Hitogami, this caused the Human World, now merged with all the terrain characteristics of the rest of the worlds to be beset with all sorts of natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes and lightning with plague all the denizens of the Human World with fear and loathing. This permeates throughout the world which resulted in all the denizens of the Human World to fear the Dragon Tribe especially the Dragon God.

Equipment

Orsted's Coat

1/2

Orsted wears a white coat that has sleeves, reaches above his feet, a black fur-like trim collar and is adorned with several belt and buckle that is strapped above his torso and waist. The coat is made from the pelt of an ancient white dragon that carries an absurd amount of magic power, possesses high physical and magical defense. It also possesses self-restoration against aging and damage over time but because Ancient White Dragons are now extinct, it is a unique item. Rudeus describes the coat to be bulky but warm and feels nice which is similar to Red Dragon's pelt.

Curse Suppressing Helmet

『Godsword』






Orsted using Godsword against Rudeus



Godsword, also known as Godblade is a katana that Orsted summons by pressing his hands together, making Godsword materialize from his left hand after separating them slowly that he uses on his second battle versus Rudeus and later against
Kalman III
. A lot of
Mana
 gets consumed just by summoning Godsword. Rudeus estimates it takes around 15% of Orsted's Mana just to summon godsword. Using godsword Orsted can cut anything within several kilometers range(except certain magical items such as Yulian's cursed swords, Paul's tantou, fighting god armor, etc.). It also has a time restriction of at least 10 minutes which is the time it took for Orsted to defeat Kalman III even though Kalman III was using the Fighting God Armor and Dragon King Sword Kajakuto.

Curses

Curse on Orsted causing even dragons to fear him
1/2

According to Hitogami, Orsted was said to have 3 curses. However he only has 1 curse, and 2 of these "curses" are the result of the
First Dragon God
's technique used on him.

The curse of being hated and feared by all living creatures in this world.

The 'curse' of being invisible from Hitogami's view. In reality this is a result of the secret technique which allows him to "reset" when he fails a loop.

The 'curse' of being unable to go all-out in combat. This is later revealed to be a side-effect from the technique that the first Dragon God used on Orsted to send him forward in time and repeat the time loop until he beats Hitogami. It causes him to have extremely slow magic power restoration, thus he can't freely use magic and several of his techniques.
