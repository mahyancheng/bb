Appearance

Cliff Grimoire
 (
クリフ
・
グリモル
)
 is the grandson of the Milis Pope. First introduced in a
side-story
 starring
Eris
, he later becomes one of the main supporting characters of the main story after he becomes
Rudeus'
 classmate at the
Ranoa Magic Academy
, where he also met and fell in love with
Elinalise
.

Appearance

He is short and has dark brown hair. He also has an eye patch to cover his
Demon Eye of Identification
 that he received.

Personality

Cliff is very prideful, so much so that he would proudly brag and proclaim himself as a genius in other people's face. During his debut, he was extremely obnoxious, looking down upon most people as beneath him and would insult them openly. However, he upholds rules and his own codes of honor very firmly, and would not break them except for the most extreme situations.

He is shown to be very diligent that he would constantly seek to improve himself. He is also very loyal to his friends and loved ones, willing to give everything he has or even risking his life for their sake.

While the grandson of the current head of the Millis Church and a devout follower of the Millis religion himself, he does not try to impose his beliefs on others and does not seem to mind if others engage in acts that would normally be seen as blasphemous unless the act involves him directly. He is also compassionate and flexible in his beliefs, understanding
Elinalise's
 curse forces her to be promiscuous or else she would die, and does not mind her engaging in sexual activity with other men as long as he is the only one she is emotionally loyal to.

Background

When Cliff was 5, Harry Grimoire, a person who held a high position in the Millis religious organization adopted him. Cliff is a gifted child that became Advanced Rank in Summoning,
Detoxification
,
Healing
, and Fire at a young age. He is also the biological grandson of the current Pope of Millis. He had a dream of becoming an adventurer which leads to him meeting with
Eris
.

Quotes

To an adventurer:
 “What does that matter?! I’m as powerful as any A-ranked magician! You should be grateful that I’m even willing to work with the likes of You!.

Cliff:
 "There is nothing this genius can't do. Leave it to me."

Trivia

In Future Rudeus's original timeline, he goes to Millis with
Rudeus
 and
Zanoba
 to get God rank Detoxification magic to cure
Roxy
, but dies on the way back to
Sharia
 after getting poisoned.

Cliff's grandmother is a
hobbit
, thus the reason of him being somewhat short in height
.

Like Rudeus
, Cliff's first meeting with
Eris
 resulted on him getting punched in the face and beaten up after angering her.
