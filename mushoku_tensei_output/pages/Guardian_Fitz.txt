) is the debut episode of the
second season

Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on July 02, 2023. Although it is technically the first episode, it is referred to as "Episode 0" on the official Twitter announcement.

Synopsis

Ariel, the second princess, was attacked by a
Terminate Boar
 that suddenly appeared in the royal garden of
Asura Kingdom
. While her bodyguards fall at the hands of the monster, the one who appears is...?

Many months later, in the Silver Palace, where the power struggle for the succession to the throne was in full swing, there was a figure known as "Silent Fitz".

Plot

In the wake of the
Teleport Incident
, Sylphie finds herself transported to the skies above the Asura Kingdom, where she inadvertently kills a Terminate Boar threatening the life of Asura's second princess, Ariel and has already mortally wounded her Magic Guardian Derrick. In the process, Sylphie's hair turns from green to white due to expending her
Mana
. Witnessing Sylphie's abilities, Ariel coerces her to become one of her bodyguards under the alias of "Fitz" under the threat of charging her with trespassing. Meanwhile, Ariel is in a secret dispute with her brother Grabel over succession to Asura's throne, her most loyal supporters being her other bodyguard Luke and his father Lord Pilemon Notos Greyrat. Later, Ariel learns that Sylphie suffers from nightmares about the Teleport Incident, and Ariel confides that she has nightmares about her own near death experience as well. The two decide to sleep together for the night, then later that night Sylphie fights off and manages to defeat Nights Eye Crow sent by Grabel and Darius to assassinate Ariel. Lord Pilemon suggests that Ariel study abroad for the time being for her own safety. Accepting the idea, Ariel releases Sylphie from her service, but Sylphie decides to continue following Ariel since she considers her a friend and they depart together.

Trivia

The international version distributed by Crunchyroll and Muse Asia censored some scenes that happened in the conversation between Grabell and Darius (Min 14:40 to Min 16:00 approx).

Even though Fitz is only a nickname for Sylphie, Ai Kayano is credited in the ending 2 times for both names.
