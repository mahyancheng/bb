Plot

Devastated with Paul's death, Rudeus recalls his parents from his previous life and regrets not having paid his respects when they died.

At their Inn at Rapan, Rudeus is yet to come to terms with
Paul
's death and as he hold on to
Paul's Beloved Sword
, he thought out loud how he should have saved anyone from their
family
 but not him and he struggles on how to move forward. Roxy then enters the room and invites him to walk around the city but Rudeus refuses. Roxy then sits beside Rudeus and she tells him that she considers her
time
 at
Buena Village
 to be the happiest time of her life and being an
Adventurer
, people close to him can die and she has gone through
it in the past
. But Rudeus tells her that
her

parents
 are both fine and she does not understand in anger. Rudeus then realizes that he thought he was getting things right after being
reincarnated
 into the
Human World
, but he neglected the clashes of his family and he is still the same. Roxy consoles him and considers her life as a bliss in Buena Village that he sees Paul and Zenith like a second family. Rudeus gets up and walks away but Roxy grabs him by the hand and pushes him to the bed that surprises Rudeus as Roxy tells him to leave everything to her and they share a kiss...

Next morning, Rudeus wakes up and sees Roxy beside him who also wakes up and after getting dressed, they resume their talk where Roxy tells him to move forward and its what Paul would have wanted.

At the hallway, Elinalise sees Rudeus and Roxy come out of their room and realizes what has happened. Roxy then tells Rudeus that she needs to talk to Elinalise and he should go ahead and talk to Lilia.

At Zenith's room, Rudeus sees Lilia is feeding Zenith who is still unresponsive and apologizes for leaving her to care for her mother but Lilia assures her that it is her job since Paul has passed away and they talk about Zenith's condition who is physically well but lost her memory. Lilia then tells him of Shierra's findings that being trapped in the
Magic Crystal
 caused a magical impairment while Elinalise told her that she is unlikely to recover. Rudeus offers to help in caring for Zenith but Lilia tells him to focus on his own duty and it is what Paul wanted so Rudeus tells her that they should go
home
.

At the Southern Desert Region, Rudeus, Roxy, Elinalise, Talhand, Geese, Shierra, and Vierra are traveling in formation around the coach, where Zenith and Lilia are riding, being pulled by Jirou.
T-Rex Lizards
 then attack them where Rudeus and Roxy uses
Fireball
 against them while Elinalise, Talhand and Shierra
tanks
 them and Vierra uses
Protection Magic
 on the cart with Geese on
lookout
. They then reach a cliff side that Rudeus uses
Earth Lance
 to lift up the party instead of needing to climb it and when it begins to get dark, Rudeus creates an
Earth Fortress
 to shelter them for the night.

That night, Rudeus and Roxy are on guard duty by the campfire outside the Earth Fortress where Rudeus reflects on how he loves both Roxy and
Sylphiette
 and tells Roxy he is already
married
 and about to have a
child
. But Roxy tells him that Elinalise already told her and it was her choice to take advantage of him when he was mourning. Rudeus asks Roxy if he can repay her in anyway so Roxy tells him that she fell in love at first sight when Rudeus
rescued
 her. She then explains that since Sylphy is not here to support him, she did what she had to do since Elinalise and Geese planned to leave him alone while Lilia is busy taking care of Zenith. With all this happening, Roxy confesses she loves Rudeus in tears who tries to console her but she tells him she does not need to do anything.

At Lumen Forest, Rudeus' group are leaving the Teleportation Circle Ruins then Rudeus tells everyone to remove their blindfold to the surprise of everyone that they are now in a snowy forest and Roxy asks where they are so Rudeus tells her that they are in a forest near
Sharia
. Talhand is surprised that they are really at the Northern
Central Continent
 while Geese now understands how Rudeus and Elinalise
travelled
 to Rapan so fast to which Rudeus tells them keep this a secret and they resume their travel.

That night, while on guard duty. Elinalise confirms to Rudeus that neither him nor Sylphiette are members of the
Milis Religion
 unlike
Cliff Grimoire
 who is a devout follower and is only allowed to have 1 wife. With this said, Elinalise urges Rudeus to marry Roxy as she can't stand seeing Roxy like this and she is her close friend since they
travelled together
. Rudeus is still struggling on what to do as he recalls how he calls Paul a scumbag and now about to do what he
did
 to their family. Elinalise then asks how are Zenith and Lilia afterwards and is told that they were happy despite a rough start so Elinalise assures him that he can love Sylphiette and Roxy equally being Paul's son. But Rudeus does not know what Sylphy and Roxy will say so Elinalise leaves to calls Roxy to hear her thoughts on the matter.

Roxy approaches the campfire where Rudeus is on guard duty who tells her how her teachings saved her in his
journey
 and after gathering his courage and would rather be called a scumbag than having regrets, he tells Roxy to change her name to "Roxy Greyrat" and he loves her. Roxy while initially calm, she realizes what he means and manages to compose herself to tell him that they need to have Sylphiette's approval and they both agreed to leave it there for now. Roxy goes back to sleep and as the sun rises, Rudeus places his hand on Paul's Sword and as if talking to him, he tells Paul that they are the same.
