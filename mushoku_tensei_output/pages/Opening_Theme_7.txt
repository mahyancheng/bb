Lyrics

Egaita chizu wa hikisaita

Sekai wa ano hi no mama

Boku wa mata

Dare ka no sei ni shita

Iya ni nac chauna

Kono mama nani ka o machitsuzukeru furi suruno

Koko kara boku wa yarinaosemasu ka

Doko made mo ikeru ki ga shita

Ano toki no boku wa dokoda

Kitto otona ni natta toka

Souiu koto janakutesa

Ato sukoshi dake no yuuki de

Kaerareta ashita wa atta

Sore sae kizukenakatta nda

Sonna shunkan wa nan do atta ndarou

Musunda ito wa toita

Sekai wa ano hi no mama

Boku wa mata

Kurikaeshite bakari

Iya ni nac chauna

Migattena yume o daite mizukara kudaite

Nani ga shitaino

Itsuka kono yami o kirisaitekurenai ka

Oh My Life

Bokutachi no seigi wa kitto

Dare ka ni wa jamana monosa

Kitto shikatanakatta toka

Souiu koto janakutesa

Ato sukoshi tsuyoku nareba

Mamorareru ashita ga atte

Subete kawatta yoru mo

Mata koko kara to

Waraetarana

Nejikureta kanjou

Detekonaidene

Kitto kaware tanda mou

Kun ni sayonara

Boku wa kimi nitotte

Dare ka nitotte

Akenai yoru no

Kienai hoshi ni

Naritakatta

Narenakatta

Bokura wa kono mama

Ato sukoshi dake no yuuki de

Kaerareta ashita wa atta

Sore sae kizukenakatta nda

Sonna hi wa mou takusanda

Itsu made mo nante nai nda

Owariyuku sono mae ni

Ichi ho fumidashitemita

Ukeirenagara

Inorinagara

I tore apart the drawn map

The world remains the same as that day

Once again

I blamed someone else

I feel disgusted

Will I keep pretending to wait for something like this?

Can I start over from here?

I felt like I could go anywhere

Where was the me from that time?

It's not about becoming an adult or anything like that

It's not about that

With just a little bit more courage

There was a tomorrow that could have changed

I couldn't even realize that

I wonder how many of those moments were there

I untied the knotted thread

The world remains as it was on that day

Once again

I just keep repeating the same things

I feel disgusted

Embracing selfish dreams and shattering them myself

What do I want to do?

Will someone someday tear apart this darkness for me?

Oh, my life

Our sense of justice is surely

Something that bothers someone else

It's not about it being unavoidable

It's not about that

If I could become a little stronger,

There would be a tomorrow to protect

Even the nights that have completely changed

I hope we can smile

Saying it starts from here again

Twisted emotions

Please don't come out

I'm sure I've already changed

Goodbye to you

For you

For someone

I wanted to become

An unending night's

Indestructible star

I couldn't become that

So we'll stay like this

With just a little bit more courage

There was a tomorrow that could have changed

I couldn't even realize that

I wonder how many of those moments were there

There's no forever

Before it all come to an end

I took a step forward

Accepting it

Praying
