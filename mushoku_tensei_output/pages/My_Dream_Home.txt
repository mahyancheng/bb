At the Special Student Classroom, the other students notices that Rudeus is different to which Rudeus announces that his condition (ED ailment) has been cured. While some of the students congratulates him, Linia and Pursena are on guard since they can sense that he is in heat. Rudeus then meets Nanahoshi who got annoyed with him for talking about her crush.

During lunch, Rudeus consults with Cliff and Zanoba about what he needs to prepare before a wedding and he is advised that he needs a house so he goes to a listing agency to look for a house he can afford. Rudeus eventually finds a house that is unusually cheap but is rumored to be cursed since its previous residents were murdered after hearing noises at night so he asks Cliff and Zanoba to help in exorcising the house.

The three begin to search each rooms and floors of the house but no one is there so they decide to spend the night there where they take turns guarding while the rest sleeps. That night, Cliff hears a noise and wakes up Rudeus and Zanoba to search the house once again. Rudeus is ambushed by the "ghost" but Zanoba protects him and when Cliff and Rudeus tries to use their magic on it, Zanoba still hold the ghost in place despite being attacked, destroying his club and damaging his clothes. The ghost turns out to be a doll that can move and the one responsible for the murders so they brought it back to Ranoa Magic Academy to be studied which Zanoba volunteers to do the research.

With the "ghost" dealt with and renovations completed, Rudeus takes Sylphy to the new house and they tour every room until they reach the Master's bedroom, currently the only room that is furnished and has a large bed.
