Summary

Rudeus informs Sylphiette, Norn and Aisha that he plans to go to the Begaritt that saddens Sylphiette but accepts Rudeus' decision. Rudeus also tells them that he will be back in 6 months since
Nanahoshi Shizuka
 provided a means of travel through Teleportation Circles that she previously uses with
Orsted
 which Rudeus assures them that it is safe. After talking to Norn and Aisha, Rudeus plans to give their
unborn child
 a name but changes his mind when the three girls looks visibly distubed by it.

Days later, Rudeus and Elinalise gave their goodbye to his family and rides Matsukaze to hire an
Adventurer
 to accompany them to Lumen Forest and tasks the Adventurer on returning Matsukaze to the Greyrat House. After seeing the monument with the Dragon God emblem, Rudeus recites a chant provided by Nanahoshi and they enter the ruins that materialized and takes the Teleportation Circle that transports them to the Begaritt Continent.
