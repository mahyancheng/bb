The Woman with the Demon Eyes
 (魔眼を持つ女
Magan o Motsu Onna
) is the twelfth episode of the
Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on October 3, 2021.

Synopsis

Rudeus and his friends arrive at Wind port, the southernmost port town of the Demon Continent. The three of them attempt to travel to the continent of Millis by boat, but they are charged a tremendous amount of money for the trip because of the presence of the Superd tribe. That night, Hitogami appears in Rudeus' dreams, that was troubled by the lack of funds, and leaves him with some advice. The next day, while Rudeus is strolling through the town, he meets a mysterious girl who is hungry.

Plot

Roxy's party disembark at the city, while Rudeus and Eris learn that due to Ruijerd being a Superd, his boat fee to travel the ocean is too high for them to pay. While looking for a solution, Rudeus is once again contacted by Human-God, who instructs him to buy some food in a specific place, where he stumbles on a hungry peddler and feeds her. The peddler reveals herself as the Demon Emperor Kishirika Kishirisu, who rewards him with a new power that allows him to see a few seconds in the future, and Rudeus uses this power to save a man from harm. After getting used to his new ability, Rudeus decides to sell his staff to get enough money for Ruijerd's ticket, but Ruijerd himself dissuades him from doing so, when Gallus Cleaner, the same man whom Rudeus saved approaches them.
