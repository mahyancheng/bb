Personality

's second wife and She also believes in superstitions like evil spirits.

Background

Lilia is the daughter of
Augusta
 and
Flute
 who owns a dojo of the
Water God Style
 in the Southern Region of Asura Kingdom. When Paul ran away from his home, he is taken in by Augusta with the intent of having him marry Lilia and take over the dojo because of his talent in the sword.

Lilia protecting Ariel from assassins



Lilia then becomes a guard-maid for the Silver Palace in
Asura Kingdom
. Usually doing a maid's job, but if there's anything that happens, they would pick a sword up to protect their master. Lilia faithfully accomplished her own duty. As a maid there were no complaints, but as a swords fighter, she only had average ability. Because of that, in a battle against the assassin who targeted
Ariel Anemoi Asura
 who was born not too long ago, from one moment of carelessness, she was slashed and injured on the leg by the opponent's short sword. Poison had been applied to the short sword. It was a poison specially made to assassinate royalty.

There was no antidote or
curing magic
 that could treat such a troublesome poison. The wound was immediately treated, thanks to the doctors trying out various methods to cure the poison, but even though her life was secured, there were side effects left from it. There were no problems in her everyday life, but she could never run or stomp with her full strength. The kingdom sacked her without hesitation. Lilia also accepted it. Losing her ability, it's a given to be sacked. Lilia left the capital. The mastermind behind the assassination attempt was not found. Lilia knew deeply of the rules in the concubine's palace and that she might become the next target. Or perhaps the kingdom purposely made Lilia leave to lure out the mastermind. She always wondered why she, who had no background, was accepted in the concubine's palace. Then she finally understood why: they only wanted to hire a maid who could be used and then discarded. Changing horse carriages, she arrived at
Fedoa
 on the far borders which had extensive agricultural lands besides the
Citadel of Roa
, the heart of this place where the ruler was living in, there were only extremely wide wheat fields, a quiet place.

Lilia intended to find work here. But being injured, she was unable to find a job based on strength. It's possible to teach sword dueling, but it's best to be hired as a maid, because the salary is higher. In that place, the number who can use and teach swordsmanship is high, but a maid who had been fully taught to handle house affairs is relatively uncommon. The salary will be higher when there is less competition. But getting hired by the ruler of Fedoa or any similar upper class noble is dangerous. The people of that level definitely had ties to the king. If they knew that she was a maid who worked for the concubine palace, there was a possibility that she would be treated as a tool for politics. And because of that, Lilia stayed far away. She didn't want to experience that kind of near-death situation again. Even though it was a little unfair to the princess, Lilia hoped to stay far away from the royals' contention for power. But if her salary was too low, there wouldn't be enough money sent to her family. Trying to find a safe job and guaranteed salary wasn't easy.

Lilia came across an advertisement note. In Fedoa's village of
Buena
, a lower class knight was hiring a maid. On the top of that, the note said it would give special priority to someone with experience in taking care of children and knowledge as a midwife.
Paul Greyrat
 employed Lilia without any fuss. It seemed that his wife
Zenith Greyrat
 was about to give birth, and he was very anxious. Lilia was fully taught in knowledge and technique for the princess's birth. Moreover, she was someone that he knew, and her birthplace was already known. Lilia was received with a warm welcome. Lilia's salary was more than what she had expected, and her wish was also achieved.
The child
 was born.

Plot

Infancy Period

After Lilia accepted the job as the maid of the
Greyrat family
 where she assists in giving birth to
Rudeus Greyrat
. But upon seeing Rudeus' face showing a perverted face, she take on an immediate dislike for Rudeus, thinking that he was a creepy child who made weird expressions especially when he was pressed against a woman's chest like he is possessed by an evil spirit. Despite getting along with Zenith, Lilia avoided Rudeus whenever she could, often turning the other way. Once, she had even found his box which had
Roxy Migurdia
's panties in it but she did not say anything about it.

Later in the volume, she had carried
Paul's child
, which was announced shortly after
Zenith Greyrat
's news that she was pregnant once more. It had come to a shock to everyone and she was willing to take the blame and get kicked out because it was she that had succumbed to temptation, and seduced Paul to bed with her but it is snowing at the time and travelling while pregnant is dangerous so Zenith was at a lost on what to do.

However, her attempt to shoulder the blame and move out was prevented by Rudeus who had made up the story that it was Paul that had taken advantage of her. It had left Paul in a precarious situation but it saved her to no longer have to move and Zenith was able accept her as a family member.

She had then felt indebted to Rudeus, the child she had always disliked, having no way to thank him because he was not obligated to do that for her, especially when he knew the truth clearer than anyone. He had saved her unconditionally and selflessly, saying that the child that was in her was still his sister.






Lilia and Aisha during the
Teleport Incident



Lilia, from that moment onwards decided to devote her life to serving him to repay her debt and also plans to raise Aisha to server Rudeus. She married Paul as the second wife as he was forced to take responsibility but she still remained the faithful maid of the Greyrats. Her child,
Aisha Greyrat
 was born a few hours after
Norn Greyrat
 healthily.

In
K417
, she was forcefully separated from the Greyrats due to the
Teleport Incident
 and was transported to the
Shirone Kingdom
 with her biological daughter.

Volume 6 - Juvenile Period - Homecoming Chapter

Lilia and
Aisha Greyrat
 officially reappeared and were declared alive and tries to get into contact with Roxy, not aware that she already left Shirone.

Approximately two and a half years after the happening of the
Teleport Incident
, it was told to
Rudeus Greyrat
 by
Hitogami
 that the mother and daughter pair were detained in the Kingdom. He immediately went to rescue them and was unfortunately captured by
Pax Shirone
.

Later, it was discovered that Lilia and Aisha had been transported right into the Royal Palace and were seen as foreign spies. They were sentenced to prison stay but by letting lose
Roxy Migurdia
's name, who had been a Royal Court Magician for a period of time in the
Shirone Kingdom
 and
Paul Greyrat
's name, they were spared and were sentenced to confinement.

When reports about the event had came in, they were to be free. However, the
7th Prince of the Shirone Kingdom
 interfered, capturing them once more and putting them into confinement. He had wanted to use Lilia and Aisha as bait to get Roxy back to the Kingdom and his attempts had not been fruitful because the news never reached Roxy.

During that time period, she had taught Aisha the ways of a maid, social etiquette and academic subjects in hopes that she would be competent to serve Rudeus, a method she thought was fitting because he had saved Aisha's life from having to live on the streets.

In the viewpoint of Rudeus, it was said that she had even taught Aisha who was only six in the arc to use her body (cuteness) to get what she wanted, saying that she did not need money to get the letter sent. Whether it was presumed that all letters or information about Paul would be paid for in advance or she was to seduce was not made clear.

When she had heard that Rudeus was captured, she had tried to save him but was only dragged away miserably by the guards. Due to her leg injury, she was less competent and could not hold against them.

She was later saved by Rudeus when Pax Shirone was arrested and when they reunited, she had presented him with the holy box that he very much treasured and received his heart-felt thanks. She had even asked if Aisha could accompany him and devote herself to him and was disappointed when he said that Aisha was better off with her parents than without.

She had reluctantly agreed to the situation, saying that Aisha needed more training before she was ready.

Lilia sparring in the Game



Lilia has attained Intermediate-ranked
Water God Style
 from training in her father,
Augusta
's dojo but it was not enough for her to be an instructor of the dojo. Because of this, Augusta has been training
Paul Greyrat
 who is talented in the sword and plans that he would marry Lilia so that they eventually inherit the dojo.

Trivia

Lilia apparently has a desire for Rudeus to show her daughter the same affection he shows to his wives.

It is later revealed in
Volume 9
 that the one Lilia protected and got injured for was princess
Ariel Anemoi Asura
.

Lilia lost her virginity to
Paul Greyrat
 when they were training at the dojo many years ago when Paul sexually assaulted her. In hindsight, however, she was glad it was to him rather than the fat nobles in the castle she worked at.

The Light novel version added the glasses for Lilia.

The names of Lilia's parents appear for the first time on a YouTube live stream about the
Mushuko Tensei

Mobile Game
