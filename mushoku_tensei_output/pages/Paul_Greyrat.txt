Paul Greyrat
 (
パウロ・グレイラット
,

Pauro Gureiratto
)
, born
Paul Notos Greyrat
 (
パウロ・ノトス・グレイラット
,

Pauro Notosu Gureiratto
)
, was the father of
Rudeus Greyrat
,
Norn Greyrat
 and
Aisha Greyrat
 who was both a talented man that became advanced in all three sword styles at a young age and a lustful man that attracted and slept with many women, but he eventually marries
Zenith Latreia
.

Following the
Teleport Incident
 and inability to find
his family
, Paul fell into depression and drowned his sorrows in alcohol until his reunion with
Rudeus
.

Appearance

Paul was a tall, muscular and handsome man with sandy light-brown hair where part of his hair is short that frames his face while the rest is gathered in a long ponytail that rests above his shoulder, green eyes and a mole near his left eye.

Personality

Paul was a confident, bold and playful man. Despite being born an Asuran noble, people who knew Paul described him to be rude and speaks like a thug which causes the same people to be surprised that
Rudeus Greyrat
 is his son. He was very caring of his loved ones and would go to great lengths to protect them.

Paul was also a lustful person drawn to women with large breasts, a trait that is seen in most of the Notos Family. He had a history of being a womanizer, bedding several women (especially comrades) before Zenith tied him down. As stated by Rudeus during his time in the
Demon Continent
, Paul wasn't a bad dad, but he wasn't a good person (in terms of fidelity, anyways).

Paul had a tendency to jump to conclusions and not hear people out, which has caused contention with other characters.

Background

Paul's birth name is
Paul Notos Greyrat
, born from a high ranking noble family in the
Asura Kingdom
. He got into a fight with his father Amarant and decided to leave his house and throw away the Notos name to become an
adventurer
. From there he formed a party called
Fangs of the Black Wolf
 consisting of six members, him included. Sometime later, he got married to one of his team members,

, who gave birth to
Rudeus Greyrat
 and they settle in
Buena Village
.

Equipment

Paul's Beloved Sword






Paul's Sword in the Light Novel



Paul used a double edge sword that has a triangular shaped cross guard with 2 triangle holes and he was always seen carrying his sword where ever he goes incase of emergencies even while sleeping, a habit he formed when he was an Adventurer
 that
Rudeus Greyrat
 calls it "Paul's Beloved Sword".

Although Paul has retired from adventuring after settling down in Buena Village, he still kept his Adventurer Card always with him at the sheathe of his sword along with some
Asura Gold Coins
.

Short Sword






Paul's unnamed Short Sword in the Light Novel



"It was my keen eyesight that helped me to identify this sword's true power."

-Paul Greyrat

Paul also used a double edge short sword that has a curved black blade with 3 holes where the middle whole is bigger to the other 2. It also have a circular crossguard with a bow knuckle that wraps arount its wielder's hand and a silver pommel that he dual wields in his offhand.
 Paul bought the short sword in
Rapan
 because of its ability [Armor Break] where the harder the opponent's armor is; the sharper the cutting edge gets which is a rare ability that the seller was not able to identify and treated it like a dull butter knife that couldn't even saw through dried meat and practically sold for a few copper coins. The Armor Break ability is also mentioned in the book of [The Legend of Perugius] in Buena Village where a warrior in the book has a weapon with the same ability and because of this, Paul's attacks could easily kill Armored Warriors despite attacking with his offhand as long as he landed a clean hit.

Trivia

Paul begged
Philip Boreas Greyrat
 to help him to get a stable job a small while before
Rudeus Greyrat
 was born.

Paul saying that "Anyone below 12 is a kid" refers to him leaving his house at 12 years old.

Despite running away from the Notos house, Paul inherited the family's preference for well-endowed women.

Among Paul's former lovers were
Ghislaine Dedoldia
 and
Elinalise Dragonroad
.

The full details of the incident that made party members of
Fangs of the Black Wolf
 resent Paul for years isn't revealed, but it was hinted by Elinalise that it involves Paul's romantic endeavor.

Toshiyuki Morikawa (Paul's anime Japanese voice actor) also voiced the main character's father in
Naruto
and
Bleach
.

Paul was the first character that obtained a new story in the
Mobile Game
.

Asuna Tomari is Paul's voice actor as a child in the Gaiden Story.

Paul carries his favorite sword all the time. According to other party members of Fangs of the Black Wolf, that sword is "the lost holy sword of Saint Millis", as it was crafted by inserting the blade of his existing sword into the hilt of the holy sword mock-up found in an ancient Millis ruin
.

The episode in which he died in the anime was shown on the same day as International Father's Day (June 16, 2024)
