Synopsis

WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS

Magical calamity has sent Rudeus to the opposite end of the world! But the journey itself is not without its own excitement. On the way to his hometown, he comes to the aid of a rather scantily-clad young girl. In return for his aid, she offers to grand him a wish, anything that he wants. The ability he receives is certainly powerful and Rudeus soon finds himself getting glimpses into the future–but even a fancy new power can’t keep him out of trouble.
