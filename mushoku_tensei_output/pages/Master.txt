Roxy Migurdia

Summary

While initially unimpressed by Rudeus's standing, Roxy begins his training to see his potential as mage. But with his agoraphobia from his old life still lingering, Rudy convinces Roxy to confine the training to the backyard instead where Rudeus using wordless magic convinces Roxy he would be worthwhile to teach. With Roxy's magic training in the morning and swordplay with Paul in the afternoon, Roxy also teaches Rudeus general knowledge of the world; Rudeus discovers that Roxy is from the magic race of the demon continent. Given her hair color, Rudeus' parents were probably afraid of her when she first arrived because her hair sometimes looks green under the sun, which would be similar to the Superd race- a dangerous and ferocious race from the last war. Despite Roxy's distaste for it, Rudeus decided to refer to Roxy as "Master" in his heart. Over the next two years, Rudeus continued his training under Roxy and improved his spells. When the family celebrates Rudeus' fifth birthday, overwhelmed by the love and celebration since his last had none of that on his birthdays. He receives an encyclopedia from Zenith, a pair of swords from Paul, and a wand from Roxy, who declares that it's time for his graduation exam outside of the House.
