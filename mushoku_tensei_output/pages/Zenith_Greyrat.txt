Zenith Greyrat
 (
ゼニス・グレイラット
,

Zenisu Gureiratto
)
,
née

Latreia
 (
ラトレイア
,

Ratoreia
)
, is the wife of
Paul Greyrat
 and the mother of
Rudeus Greyrat
 and
Norn Greyrat
.

Born a noble, she ran away from home and joined Paul's party before starting a family with him later. Following the
Teleport Incident
, however, she was transported into the
Teleportation Labyrinth
 and encased within a mana crystal. After being rescued, she awoke as a
Miko
, but was left in a constant dream-like state.

Appearance

Zenith is a very beautiful
Human
 woman who has blonde hair that she normally ties in a ponytail with chin-length hair strands hanging on either side, blue shaded eyes, she has a slender build and a voluptuous figure with large breasts (which
Norn Greyrat
 inherited) and she appears more youthful than her actual age as noted in,
 as a result of her being trapped in a magic crystal after the
Teleport Incident
.

Personality

Zenith has a very warm and loving personality, acting as a loving mother who can be strict at times. She is very conservative in morals as a
follower of Millis
, and will get angry at
Paul
 due to the fact that he is a womanizer. She will also get angry when people damage the plants in her garden.

After being freed from the
Teleport Labyrinth
, she does not express emotions actively since she sees the world around her as if she were in a trance or dream. Occasionally she will display actions that show her emotions, such as when she smiled at
Norn
 or hit
Rudeus
 when he said he was going to add
Eris
 to his family as a wife, which shows signs of her personality basically unchanged but hidden and suppressed by her dream state caused by her Miko Powers.

Background

Zenith was born in the
Holy Country of Millis
 as the second daughter of an Earl of Millis. She grew up following the Millis Church religion, never breaking the rules, getting good grades in school and had the nickname
Millis young lady standard
. However, when Zenith reached the age of 15, she rebelled against her parents and ran away from home, thus turning her back on the noble's [road] of being in an arranged marriage with another Earl's family in Millis.






Zenith and Paul settling down in Buena Village



While trying to find a job as a Healer, she was a solo adventurer for a time. However, she was frequently conned out of a large amount of money due to the little knowledge she had on how expensive healers are and being used as a human shield against monsters, but she was later saved by
Paul Greyrat
. She then joined Paul's party, the
Fangs of the Black Wolf
, as a healer. She spent a long time in the party as a healer and gradually began to fall in love with Paul and wanted to marry him. However, Paul was a womanizer who frequently slept with multiple women and she didn't want to be with someone like that, so she told him if he promised to be faithful to her then she would sleep with him, to which he agreed. However, she still thought that if Paul doesn't keep his promise, she will just give up and leave him.

Shortly after she became pregnant with
Rudeus
, Zenith was extremely uneasy and did not know what to do since she had not thought that Paul would keep his promise. However, Paul took responsibility and married her so they both retired from adventuring and settled down in the
Buena Village
 where Zenith works at the village clinic.

『Miko Power』: Telepathy

Zenith has gained the ability to read minds after being trapped in a Magic Crystal during the
Teleport Incident
. A side effect of her power is that she is in a dream like state where she is not fully awake and not able to actually speak, but thinks she is speaking due to her telepathy. Her lack of reaction to her surroundings leads others to think that she has lost all of her memories and ability to speak. She can hear the thoughts of babies and animals with this power, as she thought she was hearing
Lara Greyrat
 and
Leo
 speak, but in reality she was actually reading their minds. Additionally, she is unaffected by
Orsted
's curse of being feared and hated as noted by her remarks to everyone's reactions to him whenever he visits their home in Sharia.

Achievements

Reached S-rank as an Adventurer

Trivia

Orsted
 and was not afraid of him. It might be a result of her being in a dream like state and has not met Orsted with her full consciousness.

Teleport Incident
.

Zenith learnt how to cook from
Geese

Zenith gave birth to
Rudeus Greyrat
 when she was 17.
