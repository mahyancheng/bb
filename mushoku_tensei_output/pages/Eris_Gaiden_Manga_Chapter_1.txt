Differences from Light Novel

Eris meeting with Gal Farion and becoming his student follows the events of the Light Novel but the rest such as the journey to the Holy Land of Swords and Ghislaine and Eris' talk after the battle are original stories of the manga.

Original scene with Ghislaine and Eris talking before arriving at the sanctuary, where they explore Eris' goal of defeating Orsted and protecting Rudeus.

Original scene with Ghislaine treating Eris' wounds after her confrontation with Gal Farion, much of their conversation is seen during her internal monologue in volume 6 of the light novels before leaving Rudeus.

The remaining events on the Light Novel such as Nina trying to capture Rudeus is covered in the
Nina Farion Arc
.
