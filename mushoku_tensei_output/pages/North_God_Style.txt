“North God Kalman I used a sword, but there is no need to stick to the sword.”

North God Kalman II

North God Style
 (
北神流
,

Hokushin-ryū
)
 is one of the three major schools of swordsmanship.

Characteristics

The main focus of this style is not on techniques or developing specialties, but rather on a method for staying alive and approaching a battle with the highest chance of winning. It relies heavily on the practitioner's adaptability and use of their surroundings. Consequently, this style uses many tricks instead of refined techniques.

This utilitarian style of swordsmanship includes non-sword fighting techniques, such as first aid and tracking, as well as the ability to fight while physically disadvantaged. Because of this, different North God Style factions have different approaches to battle, resulting in very disparate fighting styles among their practitioners. Practitioners may dual-wield swords or use non-sword weapons, such as battleaxes and staves.

Due to their adaptable style and reliance on tricks, they are a hard counter for
Water God Style
 because most of their peculiar tricks are hard to parry or counter. At the same time, however, this style is weak against the
Sword God Style
 because the latter is a straightforward style that aims to finish off opponents with one attack before being overwhelmed.

Many adventurers and mercenaries learn North God Style because of its versatility, which is necessary on unpredictable battlefields.

Known Techniques

Techniques of the North God Style are unique to their user except for a number of fundamental techniques.

Sword Throwing Techniques

Sword Throwing Techniques: When a North God Style Swordsman is cornered or rendered immobile, they will throw their sword. The sword is flung at high velocity with the blade whirling violently. This technique has enough impetus to even cut magic fireballs. During
Eris
' battle against
Orsted
, she uses another variant of sword throwing technique she witnessed from Auber once. She trained to draw a sword from the scabbard with one hand as fast as possible.

Ranks

There are seven ranks in the North God Style.

North God

The North God is the most powerful practitioner of the North God Style and leader of the school. Practitioners who are of Saintly level and above may call themselves a Saint, King, Emperor or God of the North God school. However, unlike the
Sword God Style
 and
Water God Style
 systems, the title of God rank can be assumed by more than one person as long as their strength and skills are approved by most of the practitioners of their faction. There are no clear qualifications for a practitioner to become a North God since the North God ranks have only been held by immortal swordsmen of the
Kalman
 lineage.

Due to the different factions in the North God Style, Kalman III hates the techniques from outside his faction but after battling Rudeus, he changed his mind become versed in all the techniques of every faction that he now teaches his student.
