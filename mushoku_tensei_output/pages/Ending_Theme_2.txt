English
Madobe de miteita sora to kono sora wa onajina no ka

Tasogare wa kokoro o yomu yō ni irozuiteiru mitaida

Mujakina hibi o oita basho de

Kaze ga bokura o mukaeru yō ni fuiteiru

Kawaranaide machi mo hito mo yume ni made mita mama

Ano hi no you ni ichibanboshi ni negau kaeri no michi

Mezamashi kawari no akumu naite mezameta asa ni wa

Yasashiku nadetekureta haha no nukumori o omoidashita

Tadaima no nochi no kūhaku o

Natsukashisa no nokoru kono keshiki ni takushite

Kawatteiku machi mo hito mo yume mo koku ichi koku to

Dakarakoso bokura wa motto tsuyoku nareru

Michi no nai michi o koete donna iro no sora mo

Itsuka wa utsukushiku naru koto o shitta

Kaettekita me o tojireba

Aitakatta machi mo hito mo yume mo koku ichi koku to

Kawatteiku tomedo naku nagaretsuzukeru kawa no you ni

Me o tojireba koko wa itsumo itsumo itsuj datte

Kawaru koto no nai keshiki ga bokura no gawa ni iruyo

Is the sky I was lookin through the window

The same as this sky?

Twilight seems to be gaining color

To read my mind

In the place where we tuck our pure days

The wind is blowing like it's calling us

City and people

Don't let them change

Let them stay as I dreamed

On the way back home

I wish upon the first start like that day

A nightmare instead of an alarm clock

I woke up crying in the morning

Remembering the warmth of my mother

A blank space after coming home

Let it be filled with this nostalgic scene

City, people and dreams

They are changing every minute

That's why we can get stronger

Go beyond a pathless road

I learn that no matter what kind of color it is now

The sky will become beautiful someday

I came home

If I close my eyes

There are cities, people and dreams every minute

It's changing, like a river keeps flowing without stopping

When I close my eyes

The unchanging scenery is always there

Right by our side
