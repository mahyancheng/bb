 is the Twenty-second episode of the
Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on December 12, 2021.

Synopsis

Rudeus and his friends have finally returned to the Fittoa territory. However, the village of Buena, his hometown, has become a wasteland, and the town of Roa, where the Boreas family used to live, has become a refugee camp for people caught up in the teleport incident. After reuniting with the butler Alphonse and Ghislaine, and learning about the current situation in the Fittoa territory and the Boreas family, Eris visit Rudeus after thinking alone.

Plot

Rudeus dreams of everyone he knows in a happy gathering. Then the dream turns nightmarish and he gets stabbed in his old form, in his old room. He wakes up with Eris beside him. Ruijerd asks him about "Human God" and Dragon God.

Rudeus reveals the nature of the "Human-God" to Ruijerd, and the fact that the Superd curse on him is gradually fading away.

The next day, Rudeus practices
Disturb Magic
 while traveling - in case he meets
Orsted
 again. Eris looks dejected after hearing this.

The party reaches the ruins of Rudeus' hometown, where he has flashbacks to his early life there. Ruijerd then announces that since Rudeus and Eris are strong enough that they do not require his protection anymore, he will take his leave. Ruijerd thanks Rudeus for helping him grow. They bid each other farewell.

Rudeus and Eris continues on to
Roa
, which is also in ruins. There, Eris reunites with
Ghislaine
 and her servant [Minor Characters#Alphonse|Alphonse]]. However, Alphonse reveals that Eris' parents were both killed as a result of the teleportation incident while her
grandfather
 was executed by the king. Alphonse also explains that another branch of the Greyrat family has offered to allow Eris to be married to
Pilemon Notos Greyrat
 as a concubine. Ghislaine has a heated argument with Alphonse. Eris asks them to leave her alone.

Rudeus noted his
mother
 is still missing and later finds confirmation that
Sylphiette
 was not found dead, but her location remains unknown to him.

That night, Eris enters Rudeus' tent and tells him she turned fifteen a few days ago. Rudeus don't want to take advantage of her current state, but she initiates sex with him.

The next morning, however, Rudeus wakes up to find that Eris had left with Ghislaine to an unknown location, which leaves him distraught and confused.
