Volume 14 - Young Man Period - Summoning Chapter

Rudeus and Zanoba first meet Atofe when they are taken to Kishiriku Castle, where she currently resides. She enters through the main gate, prompting a reprimand from Moore, she reacts by stabbing him in the face, but he gets up unharmed. She thanks them both for bringing Kishirika and attempts to give them a reward: to be trained by her for the next 10 years and subsequently join her guard. Rudeus and Zanoba refuse, prompting her to attack her. Zanoba manages to restrain them and Rudeus uses an electricity spell to knock her out, giving them both time to escape.

She corners them as they are about to reach the portal to return home and challenges Rudeus, Cliff, Zanoba, and Elinalize to a duel. Rudeus throws a stone cannon that she easily dodges. Elinalize and Zanoba fight her and manage to restrain her. After Rudeus shook the wet ground beneath his feet, Atofe was stunned. Perugius appeared from the portal and gleefully began draining Atofe's mana, only to ultimately cut her down with a magic attack that defeated her and allowed Rudeus and company to leave .
