Elinalise Dragonroad

Summary

Visiting a market place in Wenport, Roxy reminds Elinalise that they need to gather intel but the elf is too keen on flirting, a continuous effect of her nymphomaniacal curse- handy for Elinalise with talkative men in town. Stopping for a bite to eat, Elinalise asks if Roxy likes boys, like Rudeus, earning a flustered reaction; and deflecting with a bad joke. As Roxy is enjoying her lunch, the food stall owner credits her new chef, a girl relocated by the Fittoa incident. The young girl recalls her initial fear being suddenly relocated, but how she was rescued and employed by the shop owner who knew Human language. As the shop owner and the girl hug familiarly, Elinalise awes at their love as Roxy notes her romantic side; Elinalise shares that she has a son and misses him. Seeing the girl happy, Roxy feels more encouraged that Rudeus is doing well given his studies and abilities. While Roxy wishes the girl and shop owner well, a sudden breeze blows up her skirt for the girl to gaze in awe, and runs away in shame. The crewman from the ship
(who returned Roxy to her cabin when she was seasick)
 walks by and stops long enough to meet the girl, recognizing him as her father. The two happily reunite, as Roxy continues running after her sacred panties provided another miracle.
