Tokurabu Village Toughs
 was a party formed by three young friends on the
Demon Continent
.

History

An Adventurers' Guild party based in
Rikarisu City
 created by a group of three young demons. They had big aspirations to become big shot adventurers, but had their dreams cut short when one of their members died in the Petrified Forest while fighting a group of Almond Anacondas and an Executioner, but before being completely wiped out they were saved by
Dead End
. Before Dead End left Rikarisu the two parties stayed in the same inn, and had a brief run in with Eris, where they tried to recruit her mistakenly thinking she was a mage, leading to Eris beating all three of them up since they ripped her cat-eared hood that Rudeus bought for her earlier that day.
