Volume 5 - Juvenile Period - Reunion Chapter

Randolph Marianne ran a struggling restaurant that served Nanahoshi-style dragon meat. Due to Rudeus' harsh criticism, he decided to shutter the family kitchen business and accepted the recruitment of Shagall Garantis, a general of the King Dragon Realm.

Youth Period

Randolph was originally a Dragon King Kingdom's knight, but was ordered to escort
Pax
 in his coup d’état, where he easily overpowered the nation's imperial knights. He served as Pax's personal bodyguard since then. He was present during
Zanoba's
 return but had no interest in it.

When Zanoba and
Rudeus
 came back from the front line, he had a fight with them due to being mistaken for an apostle of
Hitogami
, which ended in a draw. It's revealed, however, that he only attempted to help Pax out of personal interest, for he and his queen were the only two people to praise his cooking. He was absolutely fine with letting his assailants go.

After Pax's suicide, Randolph carried Queen
Benedict
 out of the siege, resolving to teach
Pax's son
 skill in the swords and in cutlery.

Young Man Period

Rudeus would seek Randolph's help in the final battle but having to protect Pax's son, he can't leave. However, he tells Rudeus that if he can protect Pax Jr. from being targeted by the Shirone Kingdom Royalty he would would help in other ways, as to take down Hitogami and avenge Pax. He also gives Rudeus 『The Bone Ring of Laxus』in case he needs to ask
Kishirika
 a favor.
