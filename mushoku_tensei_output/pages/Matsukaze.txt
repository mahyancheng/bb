Horses in the
Human World
 are monstrously strong in general compared to their slender counterparts at Earth especially the horses that are native in the northern

 like Matsukaze that can push their way through the constant snowy terrain.

Plot





Rudeus purchasing Matsukaze in the Anime



After Matsukaze is purchased at the recommendation of
Ginger
, Rudeus hires an
Adventurer
 to accompany Rudeus and
Elinalise
 to Lumen Forest, the location of the Teleportation Circle to Begaritt Continent that was provided by
Nanahoshi Shizuka
. Upon reaching the the forest, Rudeus tasks the adventurer to return the horse back to the
Greyrat House
 since they do not know the size of the Teleportation Circle at the time and it would be wiser to acquire another mount in Begaritt that is suited to the local climate there.

Rudeus,
Sylphiette
 and
Roxy Migurdia
 rides Matsukaze to the outskirts of
Sharia
 where Roxy plans to teach the two
Lightning
. On their way, Sylphiette compares Matsukaze to the horses of
Asura Kingdom
 knights that causes Matsukaze to sound his disapproval and causing Roxy to console him causing Rudeus to wonder if Matsukaze can understand their
Human Language
 or Roxy is a horse whisperer. Arriving at the outskirts of the city, Rudeus creates an
Earth Fortress
 for Matsukaze to ensure there will be no accidents like what happened with
Caravaggio
 and to protect Matsukaze from the rain before they begin.
