Details

Summoning Magic allows users to call forth creatures or elemental sprites with ease, requiring minimal magical control to learn. However, while it is accessible to most mages, it is difficult to wield effectively due to its reliance on the caster's mana. Summoned beings measure their master’s strength by their mana reserves, growing in power based on how much the caster can provide. These entities are also sustained by the caster's mana, meaning that mages with insufficient reserves risk quickly exhausting themselves or losing control. As a result, although Summoning Magic is easy to learn, it demands immense mana from the master.

**Summoning Magic** is divided into two types: **Fiend Summoning** and **Spirit Summoning**. Fiend Summoning involves calling forth highly intelligent monsters from other realms, offering them compensation such as mana, treasures, or services in exchange for their loyalty and labor. These fiends serve their summoner based on the terms agreed upon, and their power often reflects the summoner’s own mana capacity. On the other hand, Spirit Summoning uses raw mana to create beings called **Spirits**, which are entirely constructed from the summoner’s magical energy. Unlike fiends, spirits have no existence outside of the caster's mana and will, and their strength is directly tied to the caster’s magical reserves. Both types of summoning require minimal control to learn but place a heavy strain on mana, making them easy to access but difficult to fully master.
