Background

When Ars was a baby, he was very attached to women, especially
Aisha
, and had a strong dislike for men, crying while
Rudeus
 was holding him.

In a deleted chapter, Ars grew feelings for Aisha. He was caught being seduced by Aisha by Rudeus and
Sylphiette
. After hearing Ars admitting that he wanted to be with Aisha,
Eris
 went furious and gave him a beating.

After
Lilia
 got angry at them, Aisha proposed the idea of running away to
Millishion
 to Ars. After accepting the plan, they both decide to continue their relationship and ran away from home to live in Millishion. Their departure is witnessed by
Roxy
 who regrets the incident.

A year later, after the party finally found them, Ars decides to protect Aisha who is pregnant, blocking them from getting Aisha killed. Ars then challenges his mother in an aggressive sword fight. After seeing genuine love between Ars and Aisha, Rudeus and Eris decided to forgive them both with several conditions, one of which was that Ars had to continue his education and had to be old enough to propose to Aisha.

Since several years later, Ars finally met Aisha again. Ars seems to have grown into a handsome and mature man and now he is ready to propose to Aisha as his wife, bought a house in
Sharia
