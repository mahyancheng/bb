demon eye
.

<<
Dead End
>> disembarks onto the
Central Continent
. They travel by river. Eris tries to interest Rudeus in an
onigri
 - rice being a new food item to her. She seems puzzled at why Rudeus is not showing the same level of excitement.

The team enters the capital of Shirone Kingdom. Eris is visibly excited. Eris asks about Rudeus' master but he still seem distracted. Rudeus reveals that he learned that part of his family is held captive in the kingdom. Eris learns that he has a second sister that she was not aware of (She met
Norn
 in
Millishion
). Eris and Ruijerd agree to help.

Rudeus writes a letter to his master
Roxy
, and entrusts it to a employee of the inn. A young girl is partially shown to be gripping a letter hard as Rudeus walks away.

Rudeus wanders the market. He senses that he was being followed. A partially view of a female was shown to be running after him. He leads her into an alley. Armed men are also shown to be following the same direction. Rudeus runs around a corner and raised stone magically to seal the path behind him. There are sounds of a struggle, so he dispelled the stone wall, and sees a young girl in a tussle with two armed men - one of them holding a letter in his hands. They declare themselves soldiers from the palace. The young girl protested that they stole her letter. Rudeus sinks the two guards in
Quagmire
. The guards summon for help and Rudeus escapes with the girl with his magic.

Rudeus is aware that the young girl is his six year old Sister Aisha. He introduces himself as "Shadow Moon Knight". Aisha asks for his help in sending a letter to her father to let him know that her mother is being held in the palace. Rudeus makes vague suggestions on who can help her: a description of Roxy; a possible brother. Aisha says she has a un-dependable brother, which stings him. Her brother is a pervert. He reveals his alias to her - "Pet Owner of <<Dead End>>". He pledges to rescue her mother.

Rudeus asks his team to help with keeping his real name secret. Eris and Ruijerd end the talk by immediately embarking on an attack on the palace. Rudeus reins them back in lieu of Roxy's reply.

Morning came and someone called out to Rudeus. He quickly covers the sleeping forms of Aisha and Eris with a blanket, and answers the call. The  lady identifies herself as Ginger York, affiliated to the Guards of the
Seventh Prince
. She asks that he follows her to the palace. Supposedly Roxy wants to see him.
