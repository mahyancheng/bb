Summoning arc

Rudeus and Zanoba first meet Moore when they are taken to Kishiriku Castle. Moore advises them not to accept any rewards. When Atofe enters the room, Moore attempts to scold her, leading Atofe to stab him in the head with her sword, but he gets up seemingly fine. When Rudeus fails to refuse the reward Atofe was trying to give him and consequently knocks her unconscious, Moore tells them to run before she wakes up.

This was a trap prepared by Moore as Kishirika says Atofe like to chase her prey so Moore was preparing the perfect opportunity for her to do so.
