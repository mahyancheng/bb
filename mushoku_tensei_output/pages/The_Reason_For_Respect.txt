Roxy Migurdia

Rudeus Greyrat

Summary

Rudeus still remembers how he was in his previous life, and is afraid of leaving the house for fear that his new life will be revealed a dream. However, when Roxy takes him and they both mount Paul's Horse, Caravaggio, Rudeus finally overcomes his fear of the outside world. His social fears and insecurities melt away as passersby greet Roxy and he questions why he never left before. When Rudeus and Roxy arrive to a desolated area, Roxy tells him the chant of the Saint Level Magic, Cumulonimbus, and tells him that he must maintain the magic for an hour. Using his knowledge of climate from his previous life, Rudeus was able to easily self-sustain the magic so he need not keep his arms up. After Roxy sees this, she decides that Rudeus passed the test, causing Rudeus to feel he has finally accomplished something the first time in both lives. Upon returning home, Roxy decides that it was her time to leave to polish her magic skills. She gifts her Migurdian pendant to Rudeus that it may help him someday should he be in trouble with a demon. Roxy tells him that if he really wants to improve his magical aptitude, that he should go to Ranoa university of magic. After she left, Rudeus felt the most utmost respect for her for her getting out of the house. Ironically, he also silently apologized in his mind for still having the panties that he stole from her.
