Magic Spells
 (
詠唱
,

Eishō
, alt. "Incantations")
 are the various supernatural effects created by the art of Magic by utilizing
Mana
 residing inside a body. Magic Spells are divided into three categories, namely: Attack, Healing, and Summoning magic. Attack Magic has largest number of spells while Summoning has the least.

Melded Magic are a high-tier category where the spells are a composite of at least two or more Attack spells. Mastery of this type of spells require at least Advanced level proficiency at one school of Attack magic.

Special Magic are those type of spells which do not fit into the three main categories. This type of spell cannot be taught normally to a mage and its mastery is generally unique to a handful of persons.

Rudeus Greyrat

Summons an existing creature in the world using magic circles. The magic is bound by covenant upon founding that prohibits summon of intelligent humanoid races.

Creates a spirit out of user's mana that functions according to the user's design, similar to computer programming.

,

,
Perugius Dola

Summon radiant spirits that fly up and circle around the caster to provide light in dark areas. The light from the spirits is brighter than a torch which removes the reliance for them that is also a hindrance since one of your hands is sealed off by holding a torch. The spell also works even with little magic power applied to it that it lasts a long time even when used by
Paul Greyrat
 or
Geese Nukadia
 making it seem like the consumed magic power is almost nothing. Nanahoshi gives Rudeus a Summon Light Spirit scroll which he uses on the
Teleport Labyrinth
 and later starts drawing new magic circles for the spell when their stocks run out.
