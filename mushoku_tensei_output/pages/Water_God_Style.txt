Water God Reida Reia

Water God Style
 (
水神流
,

Suishin-ryū
)
 is one of the three major schools of swordsmanship.

Background

The origins of the Water God Style started a long time ago in a country by the sea that is frequently attacked by Water Dragon King especially the fisherman that encroached on his territory and incurred his wrath which also results to attacking the port town. The country's knight order tried to subdue the dragon but failed due to its massive size and ability to move freely through the water of the country which pushed the country to the brink of ruins. In this situation, the king declared that he would offer both his crown and daughter's hand to any who could subdued the Water Dragon King but many knights, brave men and heroes who took up the challenge were torn to pieces by the Water Dragon King.

With all the heroes and knights defeated, Reidar approaches the king and tells him that he will defeat the dragon who consents but is doubtful that a sloppy man with a vagrant visage will make a difference and like the king many thought he would give up half way. Despite his appearance, Reidar was strong and froze the surface of the ocean to stop the Water Dragon's movement but he eventually broke out of the ice and attacks Reidar. With his worn out sword, Reidar returned the Water Dragon King's unblockable strike and slicing its head off with a single slash.

With the Water Dragon King's head in hand, Reidar returns to the king who gave him a fortune great enough to play around for the rest of his life but the king refuses to give his daughter nor the crown to this dirty man. Reidar was not mad but he fell into a deep depression as he is in love with the princess that he had always watched from afar. Despite being able to become king through sheer force easily, Reidar decides to leave the country; but the princess grew angry at the king and hit him hard enough she sends him flying then left the castle.

The princess chased after Reidar who was leaving the country and clung to his legs then tells him: "I have abandoned my country. I am no longer a princess, nor do I have a last name. Even if you obtain me, you won't be able to have the country, you won't be able to become king. But if that is agreeable with you, please take me as your wife." Reidar held the princess in his arms and left the country and the two eventually married then vanished.

Decades later somewhere in the world, the Water God Style was born. And accordance with the Reidar's story a custom was born. "The spouse of the Water God Style shall abandon their household." like the princess did.

Characteristics





Paul doing a Water God Style counter attack



This style of swordsmanship specializes in defensive techniques, emphasizing parrying and counterattacking incoming attacks. Since there are only a few ways to attack, the art of provocation is also employed to make the opponent take the initiative.

A skilled practitioner can read the flow of
magic
 and use their senses to block and counter any attack, including magic and projectiles.

The weakness of Water God Style is that users cannot attack first while displaying its techniques, which makes it vulnerable to
North God Style
 due to its sudden attacks, trickery, and adaptability, all of which are difficult to anticipate. Conversely, Water God Style is well-matched with
Sword God Style
 because of their shared philosophy of taking the initiative and striking first.

Practitioners often wear heavy equipment, such as full-body armor, because they do not need to move. This sword style is mostly used by palace knights and nobles whose job is to protect someone.

Techniques

Flow

Flow
 (
流
,

Nagare
)
: The basic counter-attack technique that can be applied to all the techniques of the Water God Style.
This technique, once mastered, is said to be able to return any attack that comes in the user's way.
Although it is a basic technique and not one of the Five Secret Arts, the school considers it to be the backbone of the style and the most important technique, thus it is also regarded as a
Secret Art
 (

Ōgi
)
.

Five Secret Arts

Five Secret Arts
 (
五つの奥義
,

Itsutsu no Ōgi
)
: The collective name of the five undisclosed ultimate techniques of the Water God Style. Even just one of the Arts is extremely hard to master, and when at least three of them have been perfected the individual is qualified to be a Water God.

Deprivation Sword Kingdom

Deprivation Sword Kingdom
 (
剥奪剣界
,

Hakudatsu Ken-kai
)
: An ultimate technique created by the Water God Reida Reia by combining the two of the most difficult Five Secret Arts, also called the phantom
Sixth Secret Art
.
Upon entering stance, the user establishes a six-dimensional domain of attack, with a range "approximately the size of a party hall," encompassing all directions—front, back, left, right, up, and down. If any enemy within this range moves—even slightly, including mana—the technique automatically responds by cutting them down.

Since it is a pure counterattack technique, it cannot be used to cut a completely motionless target. It also can't counterattack faster than the user's reaction time.

Ranks

There are seven ranks in the Water God Style:

Water God

The Water God is the most powerful practitioner of the Water God Style and leader of the school. Practitioners who are of Saintly level and above may call themselves a Saint, King, Emperor or God of the Water God school. Similar to the system of
Sword God Style
, there can be only one swordsman of the God rank while the there can be multiple practitioners who can assume the rank of Water Emperor and below. To succeed to the title of Water God, one must master at least three of the
Five Secret Arts
 of the Water God Style left by the founder, the first Water God Reidar.
