Synopsis

Rudy reaches his 10th birthday, and Eris and her family plan a surprise party for him. Meanwhile, the strange orb hovering over the city remains a mystery as powerful entities across the world begin to take note of it.

Plot

Two years later, Eris and her family hold a birthday party for Rudeus, who is disappointed at first that his own family could not attend due to the increase of monster activity around the country. Rudeus is presented with a top quality magic staff and Philip expresses his will to have Rudeus marry Eris and become his successor, but Rudeus rejects the offer. Later that night, Rudeus is surprised to see Eris waiting in his room. He then attempts to have sex with her, but she pushes him away. Realizing his mistake, Rudeus apologizes to Eris, who forgives him. A few days later, a huge cloud of mana forms in the sky and the legendary hero Perugius Dola sends his aide Almanfi to investigate. Suspicious that Rudeus, who was practicing with his new staff alongside Eris and Ghislaine, could be involved with the cloud's appearance, Almanfi attacks him, but Ghislaine defends Rudeus and confirms his innocence when a massive burst of light envelops them.
