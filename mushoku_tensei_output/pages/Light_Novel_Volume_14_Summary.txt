,

,
Roxy
,
Elinalise
,
Cliff
, and
Zanoba
. They’ve been walking for half a day and finally reach a stone monument that says “Monument Of
Seven Great Major Powers
”. Nanahoshi then takes out a golden flute which looks more like a whistle cause it has no finger holes. A couple seconds later, a man appears out of no where. He looked around and saw Roxy. He said the demon race wasn’t allowed on the sky castle because Perugius disliked them. Roxy looked flattered but was cheered up by Rudeus with a kiss. He said that Perugius was going to use teleportation magic to teleport them to the sky castle. Once they were teleported, They arrive on the sky castle and are greeted by
Sylvaril
. She leads them through the castle which was laced in art and structures. Zanoba was extremely excited. Before they continued, Sylvaril stopped and looked at Rudeus and Sylphie. She asked if knew someone by the name of
Hitogami
. Rudeus hesitates as when he answered the question to
Orsted
, he almost killed him. Sylphie says that she’s never heard of anyone with such a name. So they continue walking through the castle. They reach the door which leads to where Perugius is. Ariel requests a room to put their things in and to change into formal clothes. After they change, they go back to the door. Rudeus, about to meet Perugius, has an uneasy feeling.

Chapter 2: An Audience with Perugius

The group walks into a room with
Perugius
 sitting on a throne.
Arumanfi
 on his left and
Sylvaril
 on his right. The rest of his familiars on either side of the group.
Nanahoshi
 spoke first and Perugius agreed to teach her summoning magic.
Ariel
 spoke next and Perugius saw right through her and tore down her goal of getting his aid. Then
Rudeus
 speaks up and Perugius tells him is mana resembles
Laplace
. Rudeus asks him about how to cure
Zenith
's curse and he says he doesn't know. Then he looks over at
Elinalise
 and describes saving her 200 years ago from a Labyrinth. Something that she never mentioned before. Rudues says that they can discuss it later. Next is
Zanoba
 who asks about the dollmaker's crest from the blueprints in Rudeus' basment. Perugius says that it belongs to the Maniacal Dragon King,
Chaos
. Lastly,
Sylphie
 asks her question. But before she can Perugius says that he will give a name to her son if she has one. She then asks about the Displacement Incident. He then explains that it was an accident and not manmade. After all of that, everyone proceeds to their guest rooms.

Chapter 3: The Past and a Curse, Summoning, and Jealousy

Elinalise
 finally tells
Rudeus
 about her past and how her curse came to fruition. However, she explains that she never got her memories back from before she was saved from the Labyrinth and that
Zenith
's situation is different from hers. Elinalise returns to
Cliff
 with Rudeus not learning anything new about Zenith's Curse. After breakfast, Rudeus,
Nanahoshi
, Cliff, and
Zanoba
 go to a separate room and learn about summoning magic from
Sylvaril
. Rudeus interrupts a lot with questions. He apologizes but Sylvaril compliments how passionate he is on the subject. She teaches them about the two different types of summoning magic. Fiend and Spirit summoning. She also reveals that she is not one of
Perugius
' ancient spirit familiars. Rather she is one of the skyfolk that he saved during
Laplace
's War.

Before lunchtime Sylvaril asks them what they would like to eat and whether if they wanted something specific. Cliff asks for something from
Millis
. Zanoba asks for something from Shirone. Nanahoshi says she'll go with whatever. Rudeus then asks for many different Japanese food ingredients. Sylvaril says that they don't have anything similar to what Rudeus asked for. Though she knows of something similar to soy sauce in the
Biheiril
 Kingdom.
Arumanfi
 takes an hour to go fetch the supposed item. However, he doesn't come back with soy sauce but something that looks similar to miso soup. Rudeus then asks for some white fish considering that they already had rice and miso. Nanahoshi also got a plate of what Rudeus requested. The food tasted terrible but she appreciated the gesture from Rudeus and thanked him.

After their afternoon lecture, Rudeus began to wander the halls of the fortress. He then spots Zanoba and Cliff who want to investigate some nearby stairs. However, they are unsure as to whether they are allowed to go that way. Nanahoshi pops up and says that they can go and that they would find something that they would enjoy. So, with Nanahoshi as their guide they venture below the main floors of the fortress. They go down several flights of stairs never finding anything interesting in any of the rooms with open doors. Down there they find some architechture from before the first Great Human-Demon War. They finally make it to the bottom to find a room with murals on the walls. They decipher that the murals are connected and tell a story but they can't tell any specifics about it. Then Arumanfi and Perugius pop up at the door that they came in. The group explains that they were just exploring and that's why they were down there. Perugius says he does not mind and that he was not the one who created the murals. Explaining that when he first acquired the castle that nothing was in it besides the murals. He also says that he isn't fond of the paintings.

Arumanfi guides the group back up to their rooms. While Rudeus is sitting in his room,
Sylphie
 enters and she talks about Ariel struggling with Perugius. Rudeus advises her on it. Sylphie then plays a prank on him and acts like she's super jealous of him spending so much time with Nanahoshi. They hug and Rudeus explains that she's just a friend and Sylphie gets over her slight jealousy. As Sylphie opens the door to leave, Nanahoshi is seen standing their and says she heard everything and isn't interested in Rudeus while having a massive coughing fit. Sylphie tries to help her by casting detoxification magic on her to no avail. Nanahoshi then coughs up blood and collapses onto the floor, losing consciousness. Sylphie extremely scared and shocked about the situation and denies that it had anything to do with her. Rudeus reassures her and calms her down as he had seen the whole ordeal. He then tells her to go get help from either Cliff or Perugius.

Chapter 4: Lament

Nanahoshi is now in the sickbay. The group finds out the she has Dryne Syndrome. A disease that infected humans over 7,000 years ago when they didn't have mana. Nanahoshi laments about her whole situation and how unfair it is. Rudeus sympathizes with her and promises to help her. He, Elinalise, Zanoba, and Cliff prepare a journey to the demon continent to ask
Kishirika
 for help as she is one of the few people that was alive during that time.

Chapter 10: Turning Point (Part 4)

Rudeus returns home. He explains to his family everything that occurred over the past few days, including the details regarding Zenith's curse. He falls asleep and then sees Hitogami again. Hitogami reveals what would have happened if Rudeus had followed his previous advice. Paul would still be alive, and Roxy would also somehow be alive (but Roxy and Rudeus would not be married of course). Rudeus would have been married instead to Rinia and Pursena. Hitogami then ends their encounter by requesting that Rudeus go check on his home's basement. Rudeus is more trusting of Hitogami at this point, and agrees. Rudeus then wakes up. As Rudeus is about to leave his room and check the basement, he sees an old man who introduces himself as Rudeus from the future.

Chapter 11: An End and a Beginning

The old Rudeus from the future stated that he arrived here via past teleportation magic. He warned Rudeus that if he were to go to the basement, as per Hitogami's instructions, it would trigger a chain of events that would cause a mouse to infect Roxy with magic stone disease, which causes one to slowly turn into a rock and then die. Killing Roxy is apparently part of Hitogami's plan. Old Rudeus explains that Hitogami also somehow manipulated events so that Princess Ariel returns to Asura to start her revolt. Sylphie to follows Ariel and she is killed in battle. Old Rudeus advises present Rudeus to forgive Eris and reform his connection with her, and send a letter to her in the Holy Land of Swords. Old Rudeus also advises present Rudeus to be skeptical of Hitogami, but to avoid direct confrontation. His third piece of advice was for Rudeus to "consult with Nanohoshi". After giving the above advice, Old Rudeus gives present Rudeus his diary from the future, and then dies.

After Old Rudeus dies, present Rudeus then cremates his self from the future. He then goes to the basement and confirms the mouse that would infect Roxy with magic stone disease, and kills it, with plans to send the mouses' corpse to the magic guild to be studied. Rudeus remains unable to go to sleep, and so begins writing a letter to Eris.
