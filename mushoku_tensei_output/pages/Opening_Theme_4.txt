Lyrics

Romaji
English

Yukisaki o mayou mono e

Seito no hikari o

Tagayashita tsuchi no koe

Inochi no hajimari ni

Kouya no urei mo nagasu ama o tamau

Aa Daichi no hitotsubu ni

Sasageyo kansha to inori o

Kono mi o tokoshie ni

Yudaneta utsushiyo no

Kanashimi mo nikushimi mo

Subete muda ni wa narazu

Aa Daichi no hitotsubu ni

Sasageyo kansha to inori o

Iki to shi ikeru mono yo

Mitama no isantachi yo

Wazukana kate to nozomi

Wakachiau chikai

Aa Daichi no hitotsubu ni

Sasageyo inori o

Aa Daichi no hitotsubu ni

Sasageyo kansha to inori o

To those who have lost their way,

The light of the stars

The voice of the plowed land

To the beginning of life

Bestow rain unto the sadness of the wastelands

Aah, let us grant thanks and prayers

To a single grain of the earth

Let us not make waste

Of the sadness and hatred

That eternity has entrusted

Unto this body

Aah, let us give thanks and prayers

To a single grain of the earth

Live vividly,

Oh inheritance of the departed

Swearing to share what little

Food and dreams you have

Aah, let us grant thanks and prayers

To a single grain of the earth

Aah, let us give thanks and prayers

To a single grain of the earth
