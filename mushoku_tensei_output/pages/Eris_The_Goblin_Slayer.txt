Eris The Goblin Slayer
 (エリスのゴブリン討伐
Eris no Goblin Tōbatsu
) is the first OVA of the
Mushoku Tensei
 anime series to be released on March 16, 2022 along with the Bluray version of Volume 4.

Synopsis

While Rudeus reunites with his father in
Millishion
, Eris sets out to fulfill her dream of slaying
goblins
. While at the Adventures’ Guild, however, she encounters
Cliff
, a conceited young mage who threatens to spoil her adventure.

Plot

A short scene gives clues on clues of a young boy's birth, the death of his parents, and his subsequent adoption by a powerful church figure.

In present time,
Eris
 leisurely explores Millishion while
Ruijerd
 is secretly watching over her. She sees signs of discrimination against
Demons
. In the Adventure Guild, she accepts a mission to slay goblins but also stops some adventurers from picking a fight with
Cliff
. However, when he calls her ugly, she beats him up.

Eris goes on with his mission with Cliff tagging along, but his
Exodus Flame
 damages the goblin ears needed for the mission. Eris, annoyed by this, tells Cliff to go back, but he manages to convince her to hunt more goblins at the forest.

At the forest, they get lost, and Eris uses her ability to sense nearby people. What they found was an assassination attempt by the
Pope Faction
 against a
young girl
 protected by knight of the
Order of the Temple
. Eris dispatches the assassins and Cliff is smitten. The surviving knight is
Therese
 and we learn that Cliff belongs to the Pope Faction.

Back at Millishion, Cliff confesses to Eris, but gets rejected and realizes he stands no chance against her feelings for Rudeus and goes home depressed. Eris returns to Rudeus and finds him upset after his fight with Paul. Cliff sits in his room, thinking about Rudeus.
