Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on March 7, 2021.

Synopsis

Rudy and Eris find themselves stranded in the wilds of the Demon Continent. Their only chance to survive seems to lie in Ruijerd, a warrior of the infamous Superd tribe of demons, but can he be trusted?

Plot

Looking like his past self, Rudeus has a short encounter with an elusive being known as the Human-God, who instructs him to rely on and help the man who saved him. He then awakens in his current body and learns that he and Eris are stranded in the middle of the Demon Continent, and were rescued by Ruijerd Superdia, a member of the dreaded Superd race, who becomes their friend and promises to escort them back home. Ruijerd brings Rudeus and Eris to a nearby village that coincidentally is Roxy's birthplace, where they meet her parents. During their stay, Rudeus learns from Ruijerd that his tribe's ill repute comes from the cursed spears they received from the Demon-God Laplace, which turned them into mindless murderers, and that the spear in his possession belonged to his son, whose death by his hands made him recover his senses. Moved by Ruijerd's determination to clear his race's name, Rudeus decides to help him, and the two depart from the village with Eris to begin their journey back home.

Rudeus heals Eris part way, refusing to heal her completely unless she tames herself and not draw attention. Sealing the door to plan an escape, Rudeus tries to find a way that won't teach Eris that violence is a solution. So in lying that their captors plan to kill them later, so he makes her promise to listen to him in exchange for escaping. As the kidnappers struggle to open the door, the kids escape and find they are not in Roa anymore, and Eris immediately breaks her promise of quiet following not seeing any use to doing so anymore.

As their abductors near, Eris tries to bargain for his guidance again, but Rudeus compels her to promise to be silent and listen in exchange for getting home. Once she promises, Rudeus finds a coach station and, through explaining the necessity of reading and math, plans their fares for a ride to Roa over the next two days. As they venture, they find inns for overnight stays and coaches to continue on, but Rudeus also sees Eris's worry drain her, and they finally reach Roa. Seeing Eris's stressed face, Rudeus tries reassuring her that she's safe, but finds her missing again after turning his back for a moment, with only her headband on the ground.

Afar
 (遥か
Haruka
) is the fifteenth episode of the
second season
 (39th overall)
Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on April 21, 2024 and also concludes the
Newlywed Arc
 for the Anime.

Synopsis

Rudeus receives a letter from his father Paul to inform him that he sent Norn and Aisha, his younger sisters to Sharia and to take care of them. Meanwhile, Nanahoshi, who was teleported from the same world as Rudeus to the Human World, continues to research
Summoning Magic
 to return to his original world, but she is becoming increasingly impatient as she cannot complete her research...

Plot

On his way back to the Greyrat House, Rudeus receives a letter from Paul informing him that he and his party are currently in East Port at the southern part of the
Central Continent
 and are about to depart for the
Begaritt Continent
 to search for Zenith. But since Begaritt Continent is as dangerous as the
Demon Continent
, Paul has decided to send Norn and Aisha to live with Rudeus in Sharia while they rescue Zenith. Rudeus eagerly accepts Paul's request to help his family as the eldest son while wondering who is accompanying them that he knows.

At the kitchen, Sylphiette is preparing dinner and Rudeus happily tells her that her sisters are on their way to stay with them. During their dinner, Rudeus asks if there is anything he can do for Sylphy who asks him to teach him how to use
Disturb Magic
 that Rudeus used during the Entrance Exam and in return, Sylphie will teach Rudeus Advanced
Healing Magic
 which also becomes their daily routine after dinner. During the practice, Rudeus realizes that he cannot feel another's
Mana
 to interfere with his own which makes him unable to advance his Healing Magic. While Sylphy is practicing Disturb Magic, Rudeus asks if their children will have for
Magic
 too which flusters Sylphy but because she is an
Elf
, it maybe difficult expect a child soon.

At the Ranoa Magic Academy, Nanahoshi shows Rudeus a
Magic Circle
 larger than her previous creations, hoping that they can move to the next step of the Summoning Magic research. Although Rudeus is worried that they might cause another
Teleport Incident
, he begins pouring Mana to the Magic Circle to
summon an object from another world
. As Rudeus is pouring Mana to the Magic Circle, he senses that something is off and the Magic Circle short circuits. Nanahoshi is visibly shaken by this and tells Rudeus that he can leave. While Rudeus is outside Nanahoshi's room, he hears Nanahoshi snaps and begins smashing things in the room, causing Rudeus to restrain her until she calms down.

At the corridor, Rudeus is seen by other students carrying Nanahoshi where he meets Zanoba and After explaining the situation, Zanoba carries Nanahoshi to the Infirmary. Rudeus who is also shaken by what happened, explains what Nanahoshi has been doing and decides that he will bring her to his house until she recovers.

On their way to the Greyrat House, Zanoba once again carries Nanahoshi while Rudeus suddenly carries Juliette to her surprise and asks her how Zanoba is treating her. Juliette happily responds but also made Rudeus wonder how if Nanahoshi is eating properly and that he doesn't know anything about her aside from both of them are originally from Japan.

At the Greyrat House, Sylphy informs Rudeus that Nanahoshi, who is staying at a room prepared for the younger sisters is sleeping and she already perform Healing Magic on her just incase. Sylphy also gives him Nanahoshi's dagger to which Rudeus decides to keep for the time being.

At the Living Room, Rudeus tells Zanoba and Juliette of Nanahoshi's conditions to which Zanoba remarks that even Rudeus has the same expression as Nanahoshi as well. After Rudeus explains how he once felt powerless and shut himself off although Zanoba cannot understand that feeling, he assures Rudeus he will help in any way he can.

At Nanahoshi's Room, Rudeus continues watching over Nanahoshi now blankly staring at the window. After trying to console her but to no avail, Rudeus was about to leave but Nanahoshi utters how Magic Circles are like circuit boards but she is unable to connect one part of it no matter how she tried, leading her to conclude she cannot go back home and lies down.

At Ranoa Magic Academy, Rudeus shows Nanahoshi's Magic Circle to Zanoba, Juliette, Cliff and Elinalise to get their opinions on how to fix it. Cliff tries to figure out the parts where the Mana won't connect but also struggles to fix it so Zanoba suggests to try a multi layered Magic Circle, similar to the doll they
acquired
 at the Greyrat House before renovations. After studying the Magic Circles in the doll, Cliff confirms that fixing the Magic Circle is possible to the relief of Rudeus.

Rudeus brings Nanahoshi to her Research Room at Ranoa Magic Academy and at his signal, the rest presents several Magic Circles layered together. Upon seeing the multi-layered Magic Circle's potential fix, Nanahoshi recovers and begins drawing a new Magic Circle to try again with Cliff assisting her. For next few days, Nanahoshi works with everyone and the New Magic Circle is finally complete. Rudeus pours Mana on the Magic Circle once again and this time, a plastic bottle is summoned at the circle's center. Nanahoshi happily confirms that the first phase to summon an object from another world is a success and they can proceed to the next phase. After Nanahoshi apologizes for the trouble, Elinalise suggests that she treats them as a celebration to which Nanahoshi accepts but they are even after this.

At the pub, the group is joined by Syphie,
Linia
,
Pursena
 and Badigadi and the celebration begins as Rudeus recalls how different his previous life is from what he has now.

At the end of the celebration, Rudeus carries a sleeping Sylphie back to the Greyrat House, where he sees Norn and Aisha at the front door where the latter rushes him with an embrace and Ruijerd also greets him who apparently accompanied her sisters.

, Aisha's personality is more of an adult than those of her age, able to act and speak in the manner of a maid. She is smart, manipulative, cunning, cute and without any regard for what happens to her subject. At one point she worked
Ruijerd Superdia
 to the point where he complains, manipulates
Rudeus Greyrat
 into giving her his side of the story, and escapes the castle by herself.

She has a playful personality and a major brother-complex as she sometimes makes suggestive comments towards Rudeus and has no problem being naked in front of him when taking baths together.

It is revealed that she likes gardening, and cute things but usually forbidden by
her mother
 over maid duties.

Since Aisha is technically an illegitimate daughter of
Paul Greyrat
, she has an inferiority complex and thinks that
her family
 does not love her as much as
Norn Greyrat
. This causes Aisha to be hungry for attention and very competitive with Norn. This is further reinforced by
Claire Latreia
, her step-grandmother who looks at Aisha with disdain and gets angry at her for being more talented than Norn. Due to these factors, her relationship with Norn isn't good.

Background






Aisha being cared for by Lilia in the Anime



Before Aisha was born, her mother Lilia was urgently hired by Paul who is expecting their first child and immediately got hired to be their maid since they are acquainted in their childhood and she also has experiences handling child deliveries. Due to  hearing Paul and Zenith's moans every night, Lilia eventually gave in to her desire and seduces Paul and by the time Zenith got pregnant with Norn, Lilia revealed to be pregnant as well with Paul being the father. With the affair revealed, Lilia admits her fault and initially plans leave the
Greyrat House
 and go back to her family after Zenith gives birth but since its winter, Zenith refuses but is still upset about the matter. Through Rudeus' intervention, Zenith was able to forgive Lilia and also tells her that she is now part of the family much to her joy and would feel indebted to Rudeus. As such, when Aisha was born, Lilia trains her to be a maid for Rudeus even after Rudeus is taken to the
Citadel of Roa
.

In
K417
, the
Teleport Incident
 occurs where Aisha who is age 4 at the time, is teleported alongside Lilia into the Shirone Kingdom where she was mostly raised by and looked up to Lilia. During their time in Shirone, Lilia with the servants of the palace continues training Aisha to serve
Rudeus Greyrat
 and helped her in various ways. Aisha, at the time, did not want to serve her
elder brother
 that she had never met and likewise, doubted Lilia's stories about him after discovering Rudeus' treasure that is kept by Lilia all this time.

After Rudeus saves Aisha and Lilia from Shirone Kingdom, Aisha is impressed with Rudeus and decides to serve as his maid of her own volition. It is also revealed that the reason she did not want to serve Rudeus before was because she thought he was a pervert that treasured the underwear of young girls.

Rudeus is her older half-brother. Her first encounter with him was in the Shirone Kingdom in
Light Novel Volume 6
. There she showed her intelligence, whom she figured out that the person who saved her was indeed Rudeus, who was hiding his identity from her under the alias "Knight of the Shadow Moon". Before meeting Rudeus, Aisha considers herself a genius and the rest of the people around her are idiots. They later on meet again in
Light Novel Volume 11
 where she becomes his maid, as she expressed her interest of becoming one in Volume 6 after seeing Rudeus is more of a genius than she is. Although she is a maid in their house, Rudeus chooses to see her as his little sister instead of one. She is somewhat of a bro-con, acting suggestively towards him but as she grows older, her feelings towards him dies down upon realizing he will only see her as his sister despite her affection for him is apparent and she is content to be his maid for the rest of his life.
 She also has leverage over him, as she found out about the shrine to his wives in
Light Novel Volume 14
 and proceeds to use that to push him around and get what she wants.

Norn Greyrat

Norn is her older half-sister. They were raised together in their early childhood, until the Mana Calamity Incident separated them. The two meet again in the
Millis Continent
, after Rudeus sent Aisha and Lilia to live with Paul. They went to a Millis school together, where Norn started to resent Aisha, as she was constantly compared to her, since Aisha is blatantly more talented than Norn. They constantly bicker and fight. Norn is also a source of insecurity for Aisha, as she feels that she is treated more better than her and the subject of favoritism even though she feels that she is better than her. By
Light Novel Volume 11
 though, their relationship gets better. Even though they still argue and compete, they actually enjoy it.

Lilia Greyrat

Lillia is her mother. She always had a strained relationship with her. Ever since she was born, she was set on the path of being a maid since Lilia wanted her to be Rudeus' maid as a sign of gratitude of what Rudeus has done for saving her
. This caused her to expect certain things from her and didn't give her a normal childhood. They were teleported together due to the
Teleport Incident
, but unlike Norn and Paul, they didn't become close. When Lilia started to live with Rudeus, she still criticized her for certain actions.

Paul Greyrat

Paul is her father. She was never particularly close to him. He tried to maintain his distance from his daughters in
Light Novel Volume 1
, as he wanted to become a strict father. However, after the mana calamity, he was separated from her for two years. It was stated what their relationship was like, but from her somewhat unbothered attitude when she gets news of his death in
Light Novel Volume 12
, she was never close to him unlike Norn and Rudeus.

Zenith Greyrat

Zenith is the "legitimate" wife of Paul. Although they are not related by blood, Zenith treats her as her own daughter. She is seen planting flowers with her after
Light Novel Volume 12
, seemingly socializing with her even though she wasn't able to communicate with her.

Lucy Greyrat

Lucy is her half-niece.

Lara Greyrat

Lara is her half-niece.

Ars Greyrat





Ars proposes Aisha their marriage at the near end of the light novel.



Ars is her half-nephew-turned-husband. He has always been close to her, as he always looked delighted to be around her.
Although one of the redundancy side chapters was deleted by the author following the undeniable controversy, he was not satisfied with the novel (which was violated in terms of use by the site) and allowed himself to revise some minor changes rather than scrapping the same chapter as a whole, continues to keep their relationship along with the elopement and pregnancy.

Sieghart Saladin Greyrat

Sieghart is her half-nephew.

Lily Greyrat

Lily is her half-niece.

Christina Greyrat

Christina is her half-niece.

Leroy Greyrat

Leroy is Aisha and Ars' son. After Rudeus finally finds Aisha, he finds her to be already pregnant and Aisha is ready to accept whatever punishment she deserves but asks that her son be spared.

 once summoned him by mistake while trying to summon a magical beast to protect his family. He mused that this accident happened due to him trying to summon a dignified (高貴,

.

Sylphiette

Summary

In Buena Village, Sylphie brings her father, Laws, his lunch and greets the bard before returning to magic practice. Laws details Sylphie's being bullied as a child until Rudeus saved her, and they became inseparable friends, Sylphie practically worshipping Rudeus. But both were too dependent on the other, so Paul sent Rudeus to work for nobles in Roa and Lawls had to talk Sylphie into accepting his leaving to be a stronger mage. After that, Sylphie worked hard just to be independent for herself, still struggling even as Laws tells the Bard.

On the road, Sylphie reviews her assignments for the day, and reflects on how it's been three years since Rudy left. Worrying about his safety, Sylphie also wonders if Rudeus is making friends, especially female friends. Recalling her childhood bedtime stories of a prince saving a princess, Sylphie would see Rudeus as her prince and realizes she loves him, fearful he's gotten with another girl and forgotten about her. She begins to cry again thinking of wives having to be protected by the husbands, begging for rudy to save her again. As she falls into sadness, the Bard finds her looking for a doctor, but Sylphie finds she's carrying an injured Somal. As he calls Sylphie a demon again and to keep away, she yells at Somal reminding him that she isn't a demon before ignoring him to just use chant-less healing on his injury. With the pain gone, Somal and friends quietly blush seeing Sylphie as cute, leaving Bard alone to inquire Sylphie about her chant-less casting.

Hearing how she learned chant-less magic from Rudy, Bard steers the objective of Sylphie's magic that can protect others, and bids farewell. Grateful to Bard's speech, Sylphie is happy thinking she can get stronger to protect Rudeus and that both can protect the other, Sylphie does away with the old story she once thought of as a little girl. Imagining Rudy in love with her, all red with her ears fluttering, Sylphie focuses on getting stronger and more attractive for Rudeus. Then, she is surprised to see a bright light and is caught in the mana calamity. The words in her mind as she vanishes being that she swears to Rudeus that she'll get stronger to be with him forever.

A woman who
Rudeus Greyrat
 saves from near death under
Orsted
's orders.

Appearance

Bewitchingly gorgeous, according to Rudeus.

Personality

Note: This section is under construction and revision
.

Background

Born at the western edge of the
King Dragon Realm
 in a village bordering a dense forest. Her parents both apothecaries and taught her how to be one as well before they died due to an Ibri Lizard, while trying to find an Eant Flower, whose petals can cure Ibri disease. They were searching for these plants with the help of
Pham Haindora
's father, a hunter, who wanted to save his wife who had contracted the disease, which has a very high mortality rate after being infected for 10 days. Due to the circumstances of her parents' death, she resented Pham but soon grew extremely close with her and they became best friends.

Plot

Angie and Pham went on an expedition to collect the petals of an Eant Flower to cure the village chief's son,
Dochil
, who has Ibri disease. As they collect the flower petals, they are attacked by the Ibri Lizard that lives near the flowers. At the last moment, they are saved by Rudeus. Rudeus reveals he was sent by a certain person to help her, but doesn't reveal any more details. She falls in love with Rudeus, as he was her knight in shinning armor that she always dreamed about, but after a few attempts to seduce him, Rudeus pulls out Roxy's panties and sniffs and prays to them. This resulted in her infatuation quickly turning to disgust. Before Rudeus parted ways with her, he gave her a
Superd
 race figurine along with a picture book. He tells her to read the book to her future children and to tell them that the Superd race don't need to be feared. She was initially terrified by the figurine, and only stopped herself from getting rid of it because she didn't want to ignore the wishes of the one who saved her life. And after she accidentally popped off the figurines hair, she became less scared as it simply looked like a bald warrior. A few years later, she becomes the second wife to Dochil, who is now the village chief. As requested by Rudeus, she raised her children while reading the picture book to them.

Eris
. However, the very next morning, Rudeus suffered a heavy shock after realising the sudden disappearance of Eris. He had given up on everything and reverted to his shut-in and NEET self, just like the previous world. Alas, as the only lost person in his family caused by Teleportation Incident, his mother,
Zenith
 has not been found yet. Now he is determined to find Zenith, and Rudeus is standing up on his legs once more.

Anne
====

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Anne
 officially designated as
Automaton SS-01 Anne
 is the first fully functional automaton made by
Zanoba Shirone
 and
Rudeus Greyrat
.

Appearance

Anne was built to look like
Nanahoshi
 but has shorter black hair and dark black pupils.

Personality

Anne's personality is based on the directives of the three
laws of robotics
: Ensure Human Safety, Obey Commands, and Self Preservation. To ensure Anne follows these directives, Rudeus and Zanoba uses the principle of
Perugius Dola
's
summoning magic
 for his familiars that makes a summoned magic beast loyal to its master no matter how powerful the beast is. But because of disobeying some of these commands, Rudeus believed that Anne was defective and has gone berserk.

Even
Perugius Dola
 is surprised that Anne is more human than his spirits while
Orsted
 is still troubled on how to treat Rudeus' creation and never thought this kind of automaton can be created by humans. He also believes that Anne is the most likely the existence
Chaos
 dreamed of when making dolls, and if he is alive, Chaos would love to join Rudeus and Zanoba on their doll research.

Background

"Awaken, my beloved daughter"

Zanoba saying the activation incantation of Anne

Rudeus
 and
Zanoba
 created Anne with the intent of spreading her appearance when
Shinohara Akito
 is brought into the
Human World
 so once he establishes contact, the automaton can inform him on how to contact Nanahoshi.

Before the creation of Anne, Rudeus and Zanoba has created multiple prototypes at a house in a barren plains that resulted in failures one after another such as
Prototype Unit No. 1
 which looks like a golem. They then created
Prototype Unit No. 2
 which has a body closer to a human but to make its movements close to human they need to balance the change of flesh and avoid tampering the core that could cause the activation to fail.

During their numerous failures, they repeatedly examined the memoirs of Mad Dragon King
Chaos
, asked advice from Perugius and Orsted also gave them rare magic stones and knowledge of many materials they can use as parts for the automaton. After one month of failures and learning from it, they succeeded in activating
Prototype Unit No. 3
 which had no face, so they began to work on
Prototype Unit No. 4
.

Prototype Unit No. 4
 is built with the same specs as
Prototype Unit No. 3
 that has a face with a humanoid body and core that serves as the heart located at the chest. At the suggestion of Rudeus, Zanoba activates Anne by uttering the activation chant and pouring
mana
 to the core from his hand, then Anne awakens and after a self check program, she confirms that Zanoba and Rudeus are her Master and Sub-master respectively.

She is the only automaton of the SS Series Anne with nipples.

Plot

''Note: This section is under construction and revision''.

Power and Abilities

Built with the same materials as the
Magic Armor MK II
 (power and speed potential equivalent to a
Saint Class
 swordsman), made from Rudeus' Earth magic

Equipment

The parts used by Rudeus and Zanoba to create Anne's body are made from following compounds of high class materials for their trial and error that are expensive but possessing exceptional durability and feels extremely close to
Human
 Skin:

Bones were made of material from the Magic Armor and has the same strength and durability

Artificial Flesh made from Rudeus' earth magic clay that is mixed with
Red Dragon
 Scales, Phantom Butterfly, sap of an
Elder Treant
 and
Immortal Demon Race
 Blood.

Joints made of powdered bones of
Skeleton
 Deathbreakers

Achievements

Quotes

“I do not wish to die, I will fix any problem you might have with me, I wish to be of use, so please don’t kill me, please.”

Ariel Anemoi Asura
==================

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Information

Story

Relationships

Appearance

"It's all well and good if the others don't know about this. Even if I sold my soul to the devil, it's impossible to complain if no one knew. I will do anything to win. The stronger the allies, the better."

Ariel before becoming
Orsted
's subordinate

Ariel Anemoi Asura
 (
アリエル
・
アネモイ
・
アスラ
)
 is the second princess of the
Asura Kingdom
.

Appearance

Ariel has long blonde hair with blue eyes and a very attractive face. She is of average height, has a pale complexion and moderate-sized bust. She is regarded as the most beautiful princess ever lived,
 and Rudeus noted her as "objectively the most pretty female" he knows.

Note: This section is under construction and revision
.

Personality

Ariel is a charismatic person who tries her best to create an image of a leader in order to obtain the throne. By nature she is diligent, sociable, and willing to work hard to improve herself. But due to the trauma of being the target of assassinations she became manipulative, sadistic/masochistic and also inherited the depravities of some nobles of Asura Kingdom.

In front of nobles and the connections that she needed to ascend the throne, she seldom says selfish things and always knows how to be politically correct, even when she was young.

Background






Ariel being protected by Lilia from assassins



Ariel is as the second princess of the Asura Kingdom where she inherited the lovely features and shining golden hair from her mother the queen consort, a famous beauty; from her father, the king of Asura Kingdom, she inherited a peerless beautiful voice. Since her childhood, Ariel already possess an overpowering charisma where the majority of Asura Kingdom's residents already sees her as the most beautiful princess who have ever lived and as the daughter of the queen consort, her supporters consider her the legitimate heir to the throne but also makes her the target for assassination.

As 2nd princess and 3rd in line for the throne, Ariel's childhood was flooded with assassination attempts by her older brothers, and at one point
Lilia
 managed to save her from one of those assassination attempts, Ariel started to become sadistic and tends to release those sadistic urges by beating and or torturing her subordinate. Ariel would spend her time on the "White Lily Garden" and talk about their conquest and other indulgences with Luke, her
Guardian Knight
 while
Derrick Redbat
 her
Guardian Magician
 would lecture her about kingship and persistently urge her to become queen of Asura, much to her annoyance.






Ariel and Derrick saved by Sylphiette



When a
Terminate Boar
 appears in the White Lily Garden due to the
Teleport Incident
, Derrick protects Ariel at the cost of his life. In tears, Ariel hears Derrick's final request that she become queen and resolves to fulfill his dying request, just as
Sylphiette
 falls from the sky and kills the terminate boar and after a brief talk, Sylphiette collapses in exhaustion and depleting her
Mana
.

Ariel sees to Syphiette's recovery and despite the
Princess Ariel Faction
 wanting to dispose of Sylphiette for suspicion that she might be an enemy, Ariel insists that she become her new Magic Guardian after Derrick, giving her magic items and a makeover needed for her new life as Silent Fitts for his ability to use
Voiceless Incantation
. One night, Ariel succumb to her sadistic nature and attack Fitts. Aware of the "night workings" that goes on in the Silver Palace from Lilia, Fitts retaliates in a half dazed state with her
magic
 that nearly killed Ariel. While Fitts is
healing
 her, Ariel finds being tormented to be surprisingly pleasant.

As months pass, Ariel is protected by Fitts from assassins sent by
Darius Silva Ganius
 who supports Prince
Grabell Zafin Asura
's faction and the two become friends. The assassinations persisted that
Pilemon Notos Greyrat
 advise that Ariel leave the Asura Kingdom in guise of studying abroad so Ariel dismisses Fitts from her duty as Magic Guardian but Fitts refuses to the joy of Ariel and they leave the Asura Kingdom together with
Luke
 along with 15 escorts of knights, nobles and servants. On their journey to Ranoa, they are repeatedly ambushed but Fitts fought them off and by the time they reach Ranoa's capital Sharia, only 5 of them are left: Ariel, Fitts, Luke and the servants Elmore Bluewolf and Kleene Elrond.






Ariel planning to ally with Rudeus



Ariel and her group are accepted into the
Ranoa Magic Academy
 as refugees of royalty where Fitts is accepted as a Special Student but Ariel refuses such treatment to be with the regular students and her group would eventually defeat
Pursena Adoldia
 and
Linia Dedoldia
. This enables her to become the president of the Student Council as a mere 2nd year and from there she plans her return to the Asura Kingdom to become queen. On Ariel's search for allies, she comes into the information of "Rudeus of the Quagmire" and Fitts confirm that he is her childhood friend from
Buena Village
. Although Luke scoffs at the rumors surrounding Rudeus, like killing a rogue red dragon alone, becoming a Water Saint at age 5, as being fantastically ludicrous, Fitts confirms what she knows about Rudeus, and gives him a glowing endorsement. Ariel then leaks the information to Vice Principal
Jinas Halfas
 who sends the invitation letter to Rudeus to study at the Ranoa Magic Academy.

On their journey back to the Asura Kingdom, Ariel tells
Rudeus Greyrat
 that she wants to speak with
Orsted
. Despite feeling the effects of Orsted's curse, Ariel also become Orsted's subordinate after Orsted reveals his reasons on why he wants her to become queen.

Power and Abilities

When Ariel was in her 4th year at the
Ranoa Magic Academy
 she was taking a melding magic class.
 This was considered a difficult class in Ranoa. For the sake of her charisma, she maintained good grades with the help of
Sylphy
 who tutored her and
Luke
.

========================

Story

Relationships

Appearance

Volume 7 - Young Man Period - School Entry Chapter

Her first appearance was in Volume 7, as the student council president. She had given a speech during the Opening Ceremony. For most part of the volume, she usually either has
Luke
 or
Sylphiette
 following her around.

She was seen as a charismatic person and controlled much of the student population who saw her as an 'idol'. Rudeus had noted that her voice had a quality to it that made people feel good by listening to it.

Volume 8 - Youth Period - Special Student Chapter

She was told to have become the student council president on her first year due to her influence.
Rinia Dedorudia
 and
Pursena Adorudia
 who were pretty much the head before she arrived, were unhappy and led a group of students against them.

They were however, crushed by
Sylphiette
 who was disguised as Fitts previously single-handedly.

Volume 9 - Youth Period - Sylphiette Chapter

In the chapter, it showed the beginnings the relationship between Ariel and Sylphy.

Sylphy, who fell from the sky after the Metastasis Event, saved Ariel from a Terminate Boar that was sent to assassinate her. She had wanted to thank Sylphy for saving her but Sylphy had passed out after saying her name due to the strain of using too much magic to break her fall and kill the Boar.

She wentt against her Faction who declared Sylphy dangerous or a ploy against her, saying that she refused to allow anyone to insult the person that had saved her. Due to the death of Derek in the Terminate Boar incident, the position of her Guardian Magician was open, Ariel deemed Sylphy capable and made her the next Guardian, albeit under the guise as the male "Silent Fitts".

She respects Sylphy as her savior and is shown to have a vivid imagination because she said that her 'stomach would have been torn' had she not been there.

It was revealed that she had a 'love for tormenting others', constantly playing crude pranks like asking her guards to perform their duties stark naked. It is presumed by others that she got her sadistic personality because she was constantly targetted to be killed.

She loved to target weak people like Luke while she hated to target her previous Guardian Magician Derek as she hardly got a reaction out of him. Once, she targeted Sylphy and she ended up getting attacked by her in self-defence. Sylphy had used her strongest magic against her in a half-crazed and asleep state and nearly killed her. Somehow, it awoke her masochistic side and realized she liked being tormented as much as she loved tormenting others. (this sado-masochistic trait was only slightly touched on in the Anime version, which did not include the fight between Ariel and Sylphy).

She was later forced to flee due to the growing powers of the First Prince Faction and partially because Guardian Magician Derek, who wielded quite an amount of her political power among her loyalists, had died. That had caused her to lose popularity and
Philemon Notos Greyrat
 had pleaded for her to go to Sharia to save herself and rise up once more with connections that could rival the First Prince.

She had taken a treacherous journey towards the Ronoa Kingdom where attempts to kill her happened and at the end point, only her Guardians and two ladies, Elmore Bluewolf and Kleene Elrond remained and later became her closest attendants. The journey had made Ariel, Luke and Sylphy develop a closer bond that was even harder to break, and were comrades through and through.

When she entered the Magic Academy of Ronoa in Sharia, she was offered the title of 'Special Student' but she refused. She had wanted to start as a normal student as it would gain her more loyalty from others, seeing that she was ordinary like the rest, capable of understanding their circumstance.

She had even came up with an elaborate plan. While she was [Admiration], Luke would be her [Might]. Sylphy would be their [Mystery] as opponents would be more cautious of her as they did not know her Guardian Magician's capabilities.

It was seen that when Ariel took breaks, she would be disguised as Sylphy through the usage of a magical tool that allowed one to swap appearances. She did so to ensure that no negative influence would come upon her and the public would know next to nothing about her private life.

Throughout, she had to maintain good grades and she had the help of Luke and Sylphy for that.

She had even allowed Sylphy to reveal her identity to Rudeus, understanding how much she liked him. Her help towards Sylphy did not end there. She even schemed with Sylphy to ensure that Rudeus did know she was a female and his childhood friend, which resulted in them marrying later due to her telling Sylphy devious ways to seduce a man.

Her attitude towards Rudeus was also shown. She thought of him to be a 'powerful ally' but one that she could not control due to how strong he was. He would be a volatile ally that she could not fully trust, so she decides against having him as an ally. She felt that he would greatly boost her military power but it was not worth the risk as if he turned against her while she depended on him, it would backfire on her terribly. She is also rather well informed about his powers, knowing that he was the famed 'Quagmire'.

She is now the Queen. As the queen of Ashura, she remains a reliable ally to Rudeus, going as far as sending him her very best soldiers.

Redundancy

Rudeus says that Ariel is still unmarried because she don't want that her companion get a hold of too much power, but she have various concubine and  5 children of unknown fathers, is implied that a least one of the children is from Luke.

Atoferatofe Raibaku
 (
アトーフェラトーフェ・ライバック
,

Atōferatōfe Raibaku
)
 or
Atofe
 (
アトーフェ
,

Atōfe
)
 is a Demon Lord on the
Demon Continent
. She is a part of the Immortal Demon Clan, and she is said to be the Demon Lord who grants strength.

Appearance

According to
Rudeus
, Atofe has the appearance resembling stereotypical demons the most among people he had met. She has blue skin, white hair, crimson eyes, a pair of bat wings and a large horn protruding from her forehead. Atofe is described to be of average height for a mature woman, being a little shorter than Rudeus.

Her outfit appears both stylish and battle-hardened. Her armor is covered in scratches, and any decorative elements had long been ripped off. She also carries an enormous sword with an extravagant sheath
.

Personality

Atofe's personality is similar to
Eris
', but taken to logical extreme. She is incredibly dumb and aggressive, unable to comprehend even simple statements and would start a fight in a drop of hat. Despite her critical lack of intelligence, she actually hates being called stupid or being implied so, that she would fly into rage when that happens. She's also described to be loose with time, such that having arrived to an audience a day late in her own castle is a common sight.

While described as aggressive, the fact that her soldiers are quite uninhibited and reasonable instead of strict and stiff goes to say that she's not insufferable. She would honor powerful individuals who defeat her in a fair fight and stick to her promise.

She has habit of not taking her opponents seriously as she would take any hit head on, even though she can dodge or block the attack because she would just regenerate shortly after. However when she admits defeat, she becomes calmer and more willing to listen to the person that defeated her.

It should be noted that she was quite docile when reprimanded by her son
Kalman II
.

Background

She is on bad terms with
Perugius Dola
. She was also the Wife of the first North God and the mother and teacher of the Second North God. The current Death God
Randolph
 is also one of her descendants.

Note: This section is under construction and revision

Power and Abilities

Immortality
 – She will regenerate even after losing a head or being cut into two.

She was taught by the first North God, her husband
Kalman I
, and is an incredibly powerful person. She later taught the second North God, her son
Kalman II
.

Even before being taught
North God Style
, she had already been a force to be reckoned with, taking a Dragon God or North God to subdue her. However, her lack of intelligence is baffling, truly a person of "all brawn and no brain."

She has enough reflex to block the Longsword of Light -- Eris was able to cut only half of her neck before Atofe blocked and disabled Eris by piercing through her shoulder. Later she defeated Eris in hand-to-hand combat even though she was drunk.

Trivia

Atofe has a habit of kidnapping strong people she has an interest in, and forcing them to work as her personal guards with 2 years of break after every 10 years.

Only two people have ever defeated Atofe singlehandedly and earned her respect, the first one is Kalman I and the second is
Rudeus Greyrat
.

Atofe's strength and ferocity is infamous even among Demon Lords, such that after Rudeus defeated her and was given the hero title, the other Demon Lords actually begs for his mercy upon meeting him.

Atoferatofe Rybak/Story
=======================

Volume 14 - Young Man Period - Summoning Chapter

Rudeus and Zanoba first meet Atofe when they are taken to Kishiriku Castle, where she currently resides. She enters through the main gate, prompting a reprimand from Moore, she reacts by stabbing him in the face, but he gets up unharmed. She thanks them both for bringing Kishirika and attempts to give them a reward: to be trained by her for the next 10 years and subsequently join her guard. Rudeus and Zanoba refuse, prompting her to attack her. Zanoba manages to restrain them and Rudeus uses an electricity spell to knock her out, giving them both time to escape.

She corners them as they are about to reach the portal to return home and challenges Rudeus, Cliff, Zanoba, and Elinalize to a duel. Rudeus throws a stone cannon that she easily dodges. Elinalize and Zanoba fight her and manage to restrain her. After Rudeus shook the wet ground beneath his feet, Atofe was stunned. Perugius appeared from the portal and gleefully began draining Atofe's mana, only to ultimately cut her down with a magic attack that defeated her and allowed Rudeus and company to leave .

Auber Corvette
==============

"No, It is fine. It’s easier said than done. Besides, if Auber is determined to escape, then he cannot be killed."

Orsted

Auber Corvette
 is one of the
Three Swords of the North God
, known as
"Peacock Sword" Auber
.

Appearance

Auber is an eccentric man with red eyes wearing a rainbow-colored coat, knee-length shorts, and four swords at his hip. He also seems to wear perfume with a citrusy smell. He has a peacock tattoo on his cheek and his grey hair is styled in the shape of a dish antenna.

Personality

Auber is a pragmatic swordsman that's not afraid to fight dirty. He prefers ambushing his opponent and killing them when their guard is down. He also will not hesitate to retreat when the battle is not going his way
.

In the non-canon Re:Zero collaboration short story, it is shown that he is friendly and helpful.

Background





Auber sensing Eris' bloodlust



Sword God
Gal Farion
, called him to the Holy Land of Sword to help with
Eris
' training. On their first meeting, Eris battles him and releases an enormous amount of bloodlust that Auber felt a chill on his spine and feels that he is facing a beast he needs to kill until they are stopped by Gal.

Plot





Auber using his flame attack against Eris, and Rudeus using his Water Wall spell to protect her.



Took part in three separate assassination attempts on
Ariel Anemoi Asura
, all of which were stopped by
Rudeus Greyrat
.

In the first, after patiently waiting for his chance to kill Rudeus the second he cast his magic, he rushed in to attack but was surprised to see that Rudeus turned around just in time to see him face to face. After a few words, Auber rushed towards Rudeus and with his immense speed along with Rudeus' surprise at suddenly facing Auber, Rudeus' only option to defend was to launch the
Zaliff Gauntlet
 towards Auber. With his surprise attack being ineffective, he made the quick decision to flee just as
Ghislaine Dedoldia
 was about to catch up with Rudeus. During his escape he was able to dodge a
Stone Cannon
 from behind without even looking, spit out oil on his flaming sword to create a flamethrower like effect, and use his magic cloaks to swap locations with a log wearing the matching cloak to avoid being struck down by Eris.

In the second attempt, he was hidden on the side of a wall with a cloth perfectly matching the color of the wall to allow him to be well camouflaged as long as only a minimum of light was near him. Rudeus knew to expect him to be well hidden and sent out his
lamplight spirit
 to find him, which he was eventually able to do. Immediately after finding him, Rudeus sent out a maximum powered and maximum speed Stone Cannon, which Auber was somehow able to sense and avoid instant death, but it did take a chunk out of his leg. This caused him to fall from the wall, and even with his maimed leg, he was able to roll once he landed and take no damage. Rudeus launched another Stone Cannon at him after he landed, but he was easily able to deflect it, and once Luke rushed in and was about to take a fatal strike from his blade, Auber was able to dodge out of the way of another of Rudeus' Stone Cannons. At this point Auber's companion
Nuckelgard
 was killed by Eris, and
Wii Taa
 was badly injured by Ghislaine, but was able to flee by throwing a smoke bomb that launches extremely thick black smoke everywhere. With this distraction Auber was once again able to flee from defeat and be fully healed before his final attempt on Ariel's life.

In the final attempt, Auber acted as the bodyguard of
Darius
 at the party Ariel hosted where all the major nobles and important figures for the
Asura Kingdom
's throne were assembled. There was some light banter with Rudeus where he 'apologized' for all the cowardly attempts on Ariel's life, even though he himself was the one leading all of them, and eventually the party got under way. In the middle of the party, however,
Reida Reia
 burst in, and used her secret
Water God
 art to prevent anyone from moving a single muscle. At this point Auber was instructed by Reida to kill Ariel and Rudeus, but due to some hesitation on Auber's part,
Orsted
 had enough time to rush to the scene and kill Reida, who before engaging in combat with Orsted instructed Auber to flee with Darius and guarantee Darius' safety above all else. Ariel then instructed Rudeus, Eris, and Ghislaine to go after Auber and Darius once everyone was able to move again. The three were able to catch up to Auber since he was carrying such a heavy load, and engaged in a three on one fight against him in a room near the King's residence. After initial negotiations broke down with Darius, Eris and Ghislaine launched towards Auber, who used his Crimson Ink technique to glue them to the ground. Rudeus was quickly able to destroy the adhesive but the group lost the initiative in the fight which allowed Auber to go directly towards Rudeus. After a brief engagement with Rudeus, he was able to nearly cut off Rudeus' left leg with a strike to his shin, and was able to hit Eris was a poison coated dagger hidden behind a Fireball shot by Darius. Rudeus then launched a Burst Stone Cannon towards Darius, which Auber was able to cut in half, though the unique nature of the spell allowed it to explode next to Darius and cause him some damage. This surprised Auber, and in this moment Eris launched a
Longsword of Light
 that Auber was was amazingly able to mostly block using the thick part of his blade causing only a shallow cut on his arm, thanks to the poison in Eris' system. Ghislaine followed up immediately with her own sword of light, which sliced through his flank and killed him.

Swords

Auber carries at least four different swords that he sheathe at his hip, one of which is able to burst into flames after reciting an incantation. When dual-wielding Auber uses a long sword on his main hand and a curved short sword for parrying attacks for his off-hand that he can also fight with using reverse grip style
.

Tear gas pouch, which causes opponents who get it on their face to sneeze uncontrollably and is especially effective on beastmen.

Magic cloaks that are able to swap the positions of whatever is wearing them. He uses logs as a medium for his Substitute Art to evade fatal attacks, allowing whatever is wearing the green and brown coats to instantaneously swap places.

Pouch of oil, which he places in his mouth and spits on his sword after using an incantation allowing his sword to burst into flames to create an effect similar to a short duration flamethrower.

Metallic claws that can be used to quickly scale large vertical walls made of stone. It is likely these same claws that he attaches to the end of a rope, which he can throw to allow himself to retrieve items from a distance, such as the cloak he uses to swap places after he has done so.

Small red balls that contain an extremely powerful instant adhesive made by a master apothecary that can only be created using a very complicated process. When a strong shock occurred, they would explode and spray their contents in every direction. The adhesive can be completely nullified using water.

Kunai-like daggers that are covered in poison which he is capable of throwing with extreme precision.

Non-fatal poison and the antidote to the poison. The poison causes those hit by it to have dulled movements, and causes the affected area to become bright purple. The poison is strong enough to be unaffected by beginner and intermediate
Detoxification magic
.

Badigadi
========

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Information

Chronology

Demon King of Immortality,
Badigadi
 (
バーディガーディ
,

Badigadi
)
, also known as Badigadi the Immortal is a member of the
Immortal Demon Clan
 and
Kishirika's
 fiancé as well as the former
Fighting God
. First mentioned by his fiancé, he debuts when he travels to
Ranoa Magic Academy
 to challenge
Rudeus
 after hearing tales of him, and joins the school afterward as a Special Student.

SPOILER ALERT!

This page contains
spoilers!
  Read at your own risk.

Appearance

Badigadi is described to be incredibly tall, with 6 muscular arms (where it is usually seen that the top pair is folded on his chest, the middle pair stretched out as if he is flexing, and the bottom pair is holding onto his hips) violet hair and a jet black (black-purple in the anime) skin that changes color to brown when he's drunk.

Personality






Badigadi usually seen laughing in the Anime



Badigadi is a carefree and boisterous person who likes to laugh a lot. According to him, his ideal life is one of endless wandering, dueling strong men and "holding" beautiful women without a care for anything else, including wars and power ranking. This is seen when he battled the
Beast Race
 suitors at
Ranoa Magic Academy
 but did not kill any of them. He is also whimsical and simple, but still wise enough to provide valuable wisdom to people around him. He cares about his subordinates and loved ones so much that he becomes serious when it comes to them.

He holds his own personal value firm and would repay any perceived benefits granted to him, even to someone as nefarious as Hitogami.

Background

After the generation of Demon Kings who served the First Demon God, several factions of Demon Kings have risen in the
Human World
, especially those who are warlike and aggressive. Those Demon Kings were eventually exterminated in the Laplace War. The remaining Demon King Factions were from the moderate faction where Badigadi is said to belong to.  They were peaceful or cautious by nature and mostly never got involved in conflicts.  They chose to stay in the
Demon Continent,
 ruling their own region or city.  Such has been the "basic rule" and norm since the end of the Laplace Wars.

Badigadi is the younger brother of
Atoferatofe Rybak
 and son of
Necross Lacross
 who is one of the 8 Demon Kings that served the First Demon God during the
Six-Faced World
 world era. Badigadi has lived since before the
Laplace war
, which makes him one of the oldest beings in the series. In order to protect
Kishirika
, Badigadi was tricked by
Hitogami
 into stealing the
Golden Armor
 and became the Fighting God, who fought and split second generation Dragon God
Laplace
 into the Demon God and Technique God.

Thinking that Hitogami was helping him, he agrees to help Hitogami 'once' in the future as a favor.

Plot

Badigadi took interest on Rudeus when his fiance Kishirika mentions how amazing that child is because of his
unusually high mana capacity
 and Badigadi wants to see him while openly admitting that he is jealous of Kishirika's attitude towards Rudeus. After deciding on splitting the group, Badigadi accompanies
Elinalise Dragonroad
 to inform Rudeus on the location of his mother
Zenith Greyrat
 who has been missing since the
Teleport Incident
.

Unfortunately, he later becomes one of the final antagonists of the series, after it is revealed that he is one of
Hitogami's
 apostles.

Power and Abilities

Immortality






Badigadi regenerating his body in the Anime



Being one of the Immortal Demon Clans, even if Badigadi's body is destroyed by
Rudeus
, he can regenerate it almost instantly. However, depending on how much damage he sustained, it can result in having a smaller body that grows back over time.

Battle Aura

Badigadi is able to protect his body by reinforcing it using
mana
, thus only a king or higher ranked attack can damage him. Saint-ranked
Nina
 was able to somewhat damage him using
Longsword of Light
, but ended up bending her sword in the process.

Demon Eye
 Immunity

Demon Eyes don't work against Badigadi due to him taking an unknown drug that he found in an old dragon ruin thanks to Hitogami.

Equipment

Fighting God Armor

Achievements

Defeating the Dragon God Laplace

Easily defeating a saint ranked Nina alongside multiple beastman challengers

Badigadi:
 “Indeed, and stay in good health as well, my betrothed! We’ll eventually meet again! Ahahaha!”

Kishirika:
 “Who knows how many years it will be until the next time, though! Bwaahaha!”

Sandor:
 "Great Uncle, why were you here?"

Badigadi:
 "Isn't it obvious?!" It is because the Great I, am an apostle of Hitogami!"

Badigadi:
 "Young Dragon God, I pray that someday your curse is lifted.

Badigadi:

”

Trivia

Seven Major World Powers

his fiancee
 by the suggestion of
Hitogami
.

He killed
Kishirika

Badigadi/Chronology
===================

Information

Chronology

Badigadi makes his official appearance in Web Novel Volume 6 when he decides to travel to the Central Continent with
Elinalize
 to search for Rudeus.

Later Badigadi traveled to Ranoa Magic Academy with the intention of challenging
Rudeus
, saying that after hearing about him from
Kishirika
 he got 'jealous'. When he arrived he saw Beast Men lined up outside library wanting to challenge Rudeus as well and telling him to wait for his turn. Having no desire to wait he asked if there is any way he can get further ahead, rather than standing in the long queue. Then one of them said "If you don't want to wait in order then you should try to defeat us". He took their challenge and defeated them effortlessly, when Rudeus walked out looking stunned at the scene before him. Seeing no way out of the challenge the demon lord issued out, he accepted and the two made their way to the court yard with the academy students and staff watching. Badigadi agreed to wait while Fitts retrieved Rudeus' staff. During that time Rudeus had hoped to talk his way out of the duel, but to no avail.

After Fitts gave him his staff, Rudeus mentioned that he had fought
Orsted
 and scratched him in the fight. This intrigued Badigadi so he came up with some conditions for their duel. He told Rudeus to hit him with his strongest magic and if he could injure him it would be Rudeus' win, if he could not then Badigadi would counter with just one hit. So Rudeus hit him with his strongest rock bullet and as a result the whole top half of Badigadi's body exploded, his six arms were disassembled and due to impact his lower body went flying several meters. It took few seconds for Rudeus to realize what just happened as he was afraid that he just killed him when he was supposed to be immortal. Then Badigadi began laughing excitedly as he put himself back together expressing how he thought he was going to die and declaring Rudeus the winner. Despite that he still felt like hitting Rudeus, so he punched him with 3 arms at once before Rudeus could react, knocking him out.

Later he enrolled into the academy as a special student much to the shock of everyone, but after a while, he mysteriously left without a word to unknown parts after encountering
Ruijerd Superdia
 at Rudeus's home.

He returned in volume 23 wearing the Fighting God armor and declaring himself a sworn friend and apostle of
Hitogami
. Badigadi as Fighting God was vastly powerful and was able to overpower combined efforts of Rudeus and allies but ultimately got defeated. Even though he says that he only agreed to help
Human God
 'once', it was decided that he is to be sealed in a God-Class barrier (with his consciousness still intact) until Human God is destroyed. Badigadi himself thinks that is for the best.

Battle Aura
===========

Battle Aura
 (
闘気
,

Tōki
, lit. "Fighting Spirit")
 is a technique used to amplify physical capabilities of the individual to the extreme.

Overview

Battle Aura, in essence, is a form of
Mana
 manipulation, but different from the flashy effects of
Magic
 invocation as it is invisible to the naked eye. It is specifically used as a technique to explosively boost physical power and physical defence. It involves coating the whole body or a specific body part in Mana and forming a mantle of dense energy.

It does not have a specific training regime, an individual will naturally come to understand how to wear
Touki
 the more they train their body. In the case with Rudeus, he is unable to manifest
Touki
 due to the effect of the Laplace factor he inherited. This is attributed to the Laplace factor as Laplace was also unable to use
Touki
, but some, such as
Sylphy
, are able to.

All swordsmen and fighters at or above Saint-class are able to wear Battle Aura. Some use it subconsciously as to why they cannot explain their impermanent outbursts of strength during battle.

Paul's Battle Aura applied on a Wooden Sword



Battle Aura is typically used by all swordsmen. Wearing Battle Aura is woven into the art of swordsmanship, it worked to improve one's physical prowess and strengthening the blade of the sword itself. Swordsmen whose Battle Aura has been fully developed are able to cleave boulders in a single stroke, or unleash a flash of the blade to strike a distant foe.

Other than swordsmen, Warriors, Knights, and martial arts practitioners also wear Battle Aura to enhance their weapons' durability and physical attack.

Defense

Instinctively, swordsmen and fighters sheathe themselves in a protective veil of Battle Aura around the user's body or a specific body part. When mastered, the veil of Battle Aura can become impenetrable to most physical attacks.
It also greatly elevates one's sense of the battlefield.

 were struggling in the Dragon World against the larger dragon predators which allows its user to multiply their physical abilities many-folds and harden their skin, that is strong enough to pierce the toughest dragon's hide in 1 blow. Although the power itself is possessed by other races, the Dragon Battle Aura is far superior to the others which allows the Dragon Tribe to be the most powerful in the Dragon World.

Beast Race in the Anime



Beast Race
 (兽族, Juuzoku) is a multi tribe race that originally lives in the Beast World and ruled by the Beast God until the destruction of their world where they live in the Great Forest in the Milis Continent of the Human World.

Appearance

Most of the Beast Race share similarities with the
Human
 Race in terms of having a humanoid form, 2 arms and 2 legs but they have a diagonal hairline where humans have ears while the Beast Race's ears are located on their head and a tail at their lower back. Depending on the Tribe the ears can be further at the side.

Background

Six-Faced World
 Era

The Beast Race are the main race that dwells in the
Beast World
, a world where huge rorests grow endlessly and mountains are connected during the
Six-Faced World
 Era and is ruled by the First Beast God
Pudoria Dordia
.

After the summit of the Gods, the
Beast Race
 teaches how to tame ferocious beasts to the other races and with the knowledge taught by the Human Race from words and letters to communal living and forming a social order, the Beast Race begins to thrive.

When the
First Dragon God
 invades the Beast World, he demands that the Beast Race who had an army of 10,000 troops to bring out
Lunaria
's killer to which the Beast God insists that they do not know and the fight begins. The battle against the Beast Race troops and the 5 Dragon Generals lasted for 3 days and 3 nights while the First Dragon God and Beast God battled. On the fourth day, the First Dragon God defeats the Beast God by splitting him in 2 and slamming him to the ground which causes the Beast Race to be imprinted with fear and hatred of the
Dragon Tribe
 while the destruction of the Beast World begins and at least 90% of the Beast Race died.

Age of Chaos

Around 8,000 - 10,000 years ago after the destruction of the Beast World, the surviving Beast Race were brought to the
Human World
 by the
Human God
 but the ancestors of the Human Race enters a war with the other
Races
 and after years of fighting, each race agreed to settle on their territory that closely resembles their home world thus, the Beast Race settles at the area of the Grand Continent that is full of vast trees in what will be called the Great Forest.

Second Human-Demon War





Beast God Giger in the Manga



With the humans winning the First Human-Demon Wars, they treated the demon race like slaves and grew arrogant to even go to war against anyone whether its their fellow humans, other races and even the Beast Race was no exception. In response, Beast God
Giger
 of the Doldia Tribe rallied the tribes of the Beast Race and battles the human army with a combination of power and wit to rescue the other Beast Race Tribes while defending the Great Forest and eventually defeats the Humans. For his victory, The Doldia Tribe is revered as the chief of the Beast Race who are also the guardian of the
Sacred Beast
 and even after Giger's death, this continued for generations.

When
Kishirika Kishirisu
 reincarnates and starts the second war, the Beast Race allied with the Demon Race and together with the Ocean Race, they managed to push to Humans to a corner but no decisive victory has been made until the Golden Knight
Aldebaran
 sides with the Humans and pushes the allied races that resulted in the death of 10,000 of their troops single handedly done by Aldebaran. In the final battle of the war between the
Fighting God
 and Aldebaran, this resulted in a huge explosion that caused the Grand Continent to be split into several continents which also effectively ends the second war since the continents are now separated by the
Ringus Sea
 with the Beast Race still occupying the Great Forest on the new continent now called the
Millis Continent
.

Eris Greyrat

Summary

Somewhere else in the world, a
a Superd man
 approaches two other creatures, begging for their lives.

Back in Roa, Sauros introduces Eris while Philip advises Rudeus stay silent of his Greyrat bloodline, lest he become a political bargaining chip. As Rudeus orders food for later, some guests among the party gossip as to who the unknown boy (Rudeus) is and they crowd him. When the music starts, Eris declines a dance invitation to save Rudeus and be her dance partner, but her nervousness shows until Rudeus makes a funny face to distract her into flowing to the rhythm. With gossip that he could be a Greyrat, the music changes to something Eris never practiced, so Rudeus brings her in close to match her movements. While Rudeus thinks she's unwell, she carries on and as they dance she smiles, quietly growing a crush for Rudeus.

After a magnificent performance, Sauros hoists both of them onto his shoulders in pride. Afterwards, Rudeus leads Ghislaine and Eris to another room and present them a table of food. While Eris is happy to dig in, Rudeus stops her to present her and Ghislaine their own wands. Like how Roxy gifted him, Rudeus presents their wands for mastering his Elementary magic lessons from master to student. While Eris is bluntly wanting a figurine Rudeus made, Ghislaine humbly accepts his gift and is happy to earn the title "mage"; a detail Rudeus was ignorant of as Roxy never told him. Moving on, Rudeus presents the Sylphie figurine Eris wanted, but she changes her mind and accepts her wand. As Eris eyes Ghislaine for a gift, but her culture has no such customs, so Rudeus advises she simply gift an item on her person. So, Ghislaine gifts a family ring said to ward off wolves.

With the gift-giving done, they finally get to eating. After Rudeus and Eris fall asleep, Ghislaine puts the two of them in bed and takes her leave. Rudeus wakes up and finds Eris sleeping beside him, but as he moves in for a "meal" he sees her holding the wand he gifted her and Ghislaine's ring. Commenting on how the ring does hold some effect, Rudeus gives up his intent to let Eris sleep; while Eris is mostly awake holding the gifts she got from her mentors as she rests.

Buena Village
=============

Buena Village



Buena Village
 (ブエナ村
Buena Mura
) is a small village sitting on the vast
Fittoa Region
 plains of the
Asura Kingdom
. It is located in northern Fittoa closer to the east-west corridor of the
Red Wyrm Mountains
.

Buena is a small hamlet surrounded by vast expanse of agricultural fields and prairies which comprised of approximately thirty households where most of the houses are built far apart from each other.
 Most of the villagers are engaged in the occupation of farming. The village's main produce is Asuran wheat that is used to make bread. Other than wheat, vegetables are also grown, and
Vatirus
 flowers are cultivated which is a main component of making perfume and also edible.

At the edge of the village exists a forest where mana is concentrated and monsters occasionally appear. A watchtower is also built near the edge to keep a watch on monsters and other activities concerning the forest. Once every month, a group of young men, made up of knights, hunters, and the local militia, would head into the woods and exterminate monsters which have been accumulating its species.

Chronology

Childhood arc





Paul and Zenith settling down on Buena Village



After leaving the
Adventure Guild
 and getting married,
Paul Greyrat
 and
Zenith Greyrat
 settled down at Buena Village where Zenith conceived their first child. Paul was stationed as a knight overseeing the production of the village and extermination of monsters that roamed the nearby forest
. During this time
Lilia
 arrived in the village to work as a handmaiden at the Greyrat estate after she was relieved of her guards-maid duties from the Asura Royal Palace
. Zenith took up a job that utilized her abilities as a Healer in the village clinic after their child,
Rudeus Greyrat
, was born.





Roxy arriving at the village



Three years later, to teach the magically-gifted young boy, Rudeus,
Roxy Migurdia
 arrived in Buena Village to take up the profession as Rudeus' private magic instructor
. Along her stay, Roxy was able to befriend the villagers, help out during harvest and earn their respect. After two years, her pupil already reached her level as a proficient mage, Rudeus became a Water Saint. Disheartened and also encouraged by his talent, Roxy left the village soon after in order to expand her own knowledge to become stronger.

While exploring the village outskirts, Rudeus came across a scene of bullying and decided to help out the victim. In this manner, Rudeus made his first friend
Sylphiette
, who became his playmate and first pupil in magic
. Two years later, a family crisis befell them due to Paul having an affair with Lilia while Zenith was pregnant; Lilia became part of the Greyrat family as a result. Zenith's first daughter
Norn Greyrat
 and Lilia's first child
Aisha Greyrat
 were born around the same time.

Not so long after, Paul, in order to let his son experience the outside world and earn his own money, knocked Rudeus unconscious and sent him away from the village to take up a job where he has to tutor a young girl at the
Citadel of Roa
.

Tutor arc

Due to the mana calamity known as the
Teleport Incident
 which befell the
Fittoa Region
, Buena village was engulfed in its effect and its denizens were scattered across the world. The village wholly disappeared from the map along with the Fittoa Region.

Central Continent
=================

The
Central Continent
 (中央大陸
Chūō Tairiku
) is one of the five continents in the
world
. It is the largest continent by size and is neighbored by the
Begaritt Continent
 to the south-west,
Divine Continent
 to the north-east, and the
Millis Continent
 to the south-east with the
Ringus Sea
 along its eastern coast.






Map of Central Continent



History

Second Great Human-Demon War

The Central Continent was previously part of a larger landmass known as the
Great Continent
 which the
Demon Continent
 was also part of. This giant continent, however, was split into the present-day Central and Demon Continents by the end of the
Second Great Human-Demon War
 due to a
Mana
 Calamity triggered by the dying Demon Dragon-King
Laplace
. After the war ended, the Central Continent and the Demon Continent was newly formed leaving the
Ringus Sea
 in between. The western half of the Great Continent was predominantly populated by humans and naturally, after the splitting, the Central Continent had a human-majority populace.

Laplace War

When Demon God
Laplace
 began his famous campaign from the Demon Continent, now referred to as the
Laplace War
, he put the whole Central Continent in great distress. In a short time, he had gained total control of the north and the south. Then from both directions, he pressed his assault on the western region. The whole continent was close to being dominated by the demons' force.

Laplace was eventually defeated and sealed away with the help of many heroes and the humans entered a treaty with a neutral Demon King and lifted the barricades between the ports ushering the path towards the present age.

Present Age

By the conclusion of the
Lapace War
 only the
Kingdom of Asura
 remained on on central continent
. It wasn't until about a century afterwards that the
King Dragon Realm
 established sovereignty in the south, and another century before the
Shirone Kingdom
 would join the hegemony

Geography

Red Wyrm Mountains

The Red Wyrm Mountains is an enormous chain of mountain and hills that runs across and down the continent separating the land into three parts - the North, the West and the South - with their own distinct geography. The name originates from during the Laplace War when Laplace released his dreaded wyrm dragons in the mountains to block the passage of humans.

The mountain range starts from the northwest where it is known as the
Red Wyrm's Upper Jaw
 and runs across the lands until it forks into two more ranges. One range runs across the landmass without much deviation all the way to the east, and this part has been known as the
Crying Wyrm
 mountain ranges. The other range runs down the continent almost up to the mid-point southern coastline where it abruptly ends to open a route that is mostly used by the people for traversing between the west and the south.

North

The northern continent, referred to as the the "Northern Territories", is a cold region which lies east to the
Red Wyrm's Upper Jaw
 and
Crying Wyrm
 mountain ranges which run horizontally across the continent. The region receives heavy snowfall and the soil is infertile for crops but large expanse of forests are also present. The majority of the nations in this region are poor and weak and often have skirmishes over resources. Many strong monsters appear in this region which attracts warriors-in-training and veteran adventurers.

Notable locations in the north
:

Wyrm's Whiskers
: A monster-infested forest separating the Northern Territories from the northern part of the Kingdom of Asura. It is home to many bandits and criminals who have fled from the Kingdom.

Kingdom of Ranoa
: It is one of the three Magic Nations alliance known for its
institutions
 of magical learning.

Sharia
: One of the largest cities in the Kingdom of Ranoa. Houses the
Ranoa Magic Academy
 and is the headquarters of the Magicians' Guild and Neris Magical Implements Workshop.

Caerleon: boarder town.

Forest of Hail: Forest located three days' travel north of Sharia on the boarder with the Duchy of Basherant.

Duchy of Neris
: It is one of the three Magic Nations alliance known for its manufacturing of
magical implements
.

Gyuranza: capital of Neris and headquarters of the Thunderbolt clan.

Duchy of Basherant
: It is one of the three Magic Nations alliance known for its expertise in arcane
magic
 research.

Pipin: Third largest city in the Duchy of Basherant.

Rosenburg: Nicknamed the "Gateway to the Northern Territories" is one of largest cities in Duchy of Basherant located two months journey north of the Asuran border. Exports of magical implements to the Asura Kingdom account for half of the cities revenue.

Lake Cucuru: located three days journey north from Rosenburg.

Galgua Ruins: Remains of a underground Demon Fortress from First Human-Demon War. Constructed by Demon King Largon-Hargon the Subterranean. Located two days due South from Rosenburg. Became Snow Drake nest since it fell into disuse.

Ilbron Cave: Located one days travels from Rosenburg and Galgua Ruins.

Trier Forest: Forest located half a day's journey due West from Rosenburg, Infested by Snow Treants and Icefall Treants.

Kingdom of Biheiril
: A fairly strong kingdom in the north-eastern edge of the continent surrounded by mountains and forests where the survivors of the
Superd Race
 are currently hiding.

Sword Sanctum
: A territory in the north-western edge of the continent that is covered in snow all year round. It is the headquarters of the
Sword God Style
 school of swordsmanship which attracts a number of young fighters with the hopes of learning under the Sword God himself.

Ogre Island
: An island in the archipelago that lies south of Biheilil where the Ogre God resides along with his Ogre Tribe.

Kingdom of Toile
: a small kingdom in the Northern Territories.

West

The western continent is a prosperous region that lies between the Red Wyrm's
Upper Jaw
 and the
Lower Jaw
 mountain range. It is abundant with rivers and fertile plains but not many large forests are found. Monsters that appear in this region are fairly weak and knights of the Kingdom carry out exterminations to keep the commonfolks safe, which is one of the reasons as to why it is not a popular place for adventurers despite the riches of the lands.

Notable locations in the west
:

Asura Kingdom
: A kingdom which holds autonomy over the west. Not only is it the richest kingdom in the world but its royal capital - Ars, is also the largest city in the world.

South

The southern continent is a fertile region that lies south of the Red Wyrm's
Crying Wyrm
 mountain range and east to the
Lower Jaw
. It has numerous rivers and lakes along with large expanse of plains and dense forest regions. The plains and the forests are divided by the
Dragon King
 mountain range which runs vertically down the region. Though there are numerous nations in the southern continent, a majority of them in the north of the Dragon King mountain range are small and weak regularly warring over territories and as such the region has been referred to as the
Conflict Zone
. Countries in this zone are built only to meet their demise shortly thereafter and be rebuilt once more. However, moving down the Conflict Zone the nations are more stable and have autonomous power over an area.

Notable locations in the south
:

Markien Mercenary Country
: A warmongering country in the Conflict Zone that bases its economy on dispatching mercenaries to neighbouring countries. The mercenaries dispatched are incredibly feared.

HammerPolka
: A town known for producing weapons and armor.

Dikuto Kingdom:
 A country in the Conflict Zone.

Broze Empire:
 A country in the Conflict Zone.

Gardenia Kingdom:
 A country in the Conflict Zone known for its fertile soil.

Nekrina Kingdom:
 A country in the Conflict Zone.

Bista Kingdom
: a kingdom that borders north of Shirone Kingdom.

King Dragon Realm
: a powerful kingdom that holds dominion of the southernmost regions of the continent with affluent resources. It is the third biggest country in the world with four vassal states under it.

Shirone Kingdom
: A vassal state of King Dragon Realm anointed with its own king.

Latakia: Capital city of the Shrinone Kingdom

Kikka Kingdom
: A vassal state of King Dragon Realm.

Sanakia Kingdom
: A Vassal state of the King Dragon Realm.

Monsters

The monsters on the Central Continent are generally less populous and weaker than other continents, except for a selected few areas. In the Asura Kingdom, one has to go deep into the jungle to find C-ranked monsters
, and there are no subjugation requests higher than C-rank in the capital city Ars
. Monsters are stronger and more numerous in the Northern Territories, whereas the strongest monsters are the Red Dragons residing in the Red Dragon Mountain Range, and the King Dragons in the King Dragon Mountain Range.

Chaos
=====

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Mad Dragon King
Chaos
 is one of the
First Dragon God
's Five Dragon Generals who is from the Mad Dragon Tribe and the crafter of weapons and armors used by Dragon Tribe to protect their capital Kayos and the Dragon World.

Appearance

Chaos has black-silver scales and profound eyes.

Personality

Chaos has a reputation of being stubborn and has ill feelings towards the Demon Race and as such, he has no qualms on going to war against them. He also is close to his fellow Dragon Generals who know him very well and consider his shouting when emotional to be a normal occurrence.

Background

The First Dragon God teaches the Dragon Tribe how to use
Dragon Battle Aura
 that allowed them to battle against the dragons that rule over Dragon World and eventually conquer it. Although the First Dragon God is powerful, he is not omnipotent and there are places out of reach as well. Thus, from the Dragon Tribe, he chose the 5 most powerful individuals to be the Dragon Generals whom he entrusts them to protecting the Dragon World and Chaos is one of them who are loyal to the First Dragon God.

Apart from his duty as one of the Five Dragon Generals, Chaos is also the leader of the Anti-demon faction of the Dragon World and to distinguish themselves, Chaos also has a unique emblem that resembles the Dragon God's emblem with some alterations.(see photo above)

Plot

"Blasphemy! Maybe if it was
Dora
, but you will have the mixed blooded demon be in charge of the investigation!?"

-Chaos to Szilard

Chaos attends the meeting at the Dragon God's mansion and does not hide his anger on the death of
Crystal
 and at the thought of a demon killing Crystal that is raised by
Szilard
. When
Laplace
 volunteers to investigate further, Chaos strongly opposes this but to his surprise,
Maxwell
 did not object either and calms him down by pointing out what the culprit's possible aim is and in the end, the Dragon God allows Laplace to conduct the investigation.
 Laplace later visits Chaos to question him on his whereabouts when Crystal was killed and afterwards, Chaos assures him that he will help Laplace avenge Crystal even if its in secret.

Chaos attends another meeting with the rest the Dragon Generals where Laplace reports his capture of
Necrolia Nacrolia
 then Szilard reports his interrogation that Necrolia has indeed killed Crystal. Chaos is outraged by this like the rest of the Dragon Generals and urges the Dragon God to invade the Demon World but the latter chose to negotiate with them instead. Although Chaos is willing to assist Laplace in his investigation, he still objects when the First Dragon God names Laplace to be Crystal's successor as Dragon General.

After the meeting of the Gods has concluded and an agreement for the Six Worlds for peace and cooperation, Chaos restrains his hostility towards demons.
 When the Dragon God's child is born, Chaos makes fireworks, an invention of the Human World to excite the parade and like the rest of the Dragon Generals, Chaos is also impressed by the child and left with a solemn expression.

Chaos and the rest of the Dragon Generals accompanies the First Dragon God as he battles and defeats the Gods of the Beast World, Ocean World and Sky World one after another and resulting to the destruction of each world just by the power of the First Dragon God and the Five Dragon Generals.
 But for the Demon World, which is comparable in fighting strength with the Dragon Tribe and in addition, the Eight Great Demon Kings matched strengths with the Five Dragon Generals so the full force of the Dragon World's Dragon Warriors is brought to wage war on the Demon World. The war between the Dragon World and Demon World lasted for decades. During this time every innovation and technology is focused on winning the war where Chaos forge Magic Swords from demon bones.

While the magic and technology development was at its peak during the war, it also caused the massive rise in casualties in both sides which eventually caused a problem in population decline. The
Human God
 suggests that the Five Dragon Generals lure, isolate and gang up on the Eight Demon King one by one causing the
Demon God
 to finally appear in the frontline. The First Dragon God battles and defeat the Demon God but nearly exhausts all his Dragon Battle Aura afterwards that the Dragon Generals brings him back to the Dragon World.

Chaos Breaker flying above the Red Orb in the Anime



Chaos Breaker
 is a sky castle that previously belongs to
Armored Dragon King Dora
 and later the residence of her son
Perugius Dola
.

Design

When flying above the sky, Chaos Breaker looks like a giant mass of rock covered in dragon scales originating in the
Dragon World
.
 Sitting on the rock is a gigantic castle taller than the Silver Palace home of the royal family of
Asura Kingdom
 that has a garden of similar size and a river.

Background

"It didn't have a name. Ah... if I should give it a name. "Chaos Breaker" I would call it that. Because that scene and that moment of
Kayos
' destruction was forever seared into my eyelids"

-
Laplace

Chaos Breaker is first used by
Armored Dragon King Dora
 during the battle of the Dragon Generals against the
First Dragon God
 at the final years of the
Six-Faced World
 Era. As Chaos Breaker approaches, the First Dragon God fired torrents of power to the fortress but it was protected by spirits summoned by the Dragon Generals. After withstanding a few more shots of the barrage fired by the First Dragon God, the spirits disappear after exhausting their power. The First Dragon God then draws his
GodSword
 and with a single strike everything was carved in half including Chaos Breaker which the upper part fell toward the sky while its lower half remained floating since the function of its core remained intact.

During the
Laplace Wars
, Chaos Breaker is summoned by
Perugius Dola
 and together with his 12 familiars and other heroes, they managed to seal
Laplace
, and Perugius is known as a hero of the war with the new era named
"Armored Dragon Era"
 in his honor.
After growing tired of the palace life in
Asura Kingdom
, Perugius left and to this day travels the world with Chaos Breaker, vigilantly watching over any signs of Laplace's revival to defeat him and get revenge for the death of his friends.

Entry

Elinalise Dragonroad
: "While we're still here, I have to say this. Where we're going isn't a place to joke around at. Remember to watch your mouth."
Cliff Grimoire
: "...I get it. I am not a kid anymore."

To gain entry to Chaos Breaker, you must be at a
Monument of Seven Great Powers
 then blow a golden flute with out any finger holes which is provided by Perugius so in a sense only those who Perugius knows are able to enter or if accompanied by them. The music of the flute that is not heard by
Human
 ears will be heard by
Clearnight of Thunder
, one of Perugius' familiars who will inform
Almanfi
. Almanfi will then teleport to the corresponding monument where the flute is used and he will decide if entry to Chaos Breaker will be granted which so far, demons are forbidden entry. Then Perugius will teleport those approved by Almanfi to the castle which is done by a golden baton that is provided by Almanfi where it is held by all those who wishes to enter Chaos Breaker

Notable Areas

Throne Room





Chaos Breaker's Throne Room in the Anime



"Long ago, Almanfi and
Ghislaine Dedoldia
 fought in a stalemate. In other words, the 12 of them including
Sylvaril
 have strength equal to that of a
Sword King
. I really dont' want to make enemies out of these people. I really need to be very careful with what I say from now on."

-
Rudeus Greyrat

The entrance to the Throne Room (Also known as Audience Room) is a pair of heavy doors dotted with silver and has a dragon painted on each side which took almost an hour to walk from arriving from the outside to get here. Beyond the door is an enormous hall where the tall ceilings are supported by tree-like pillars and ligh radiates from above that is of luxurious and brilliance. The walls have curtains of complex patterns that are products of
Asura Kingdom
 and the Holy Country of Millis. The floor has a red carpet and leading to the stairs of 10 steps where the famed 12 Familiars of Perugius stands at attention and above the stairs is Perugius sitting on his throne overlooking the entire hall.

''Note: This section is under construction and revision''.

Plot

"The "Armored Dragon King" isn't working for any kingdom or governing any territory, and flies around the world with the Sky Fortress "Chaos Breaker.""

-Excerpt from the Legend of Perugius Book

Chaos Breaker is seen flying above the
Citadel of Roa
 where Eris proudly narrates what she knows about the Perugius and his 12 familiars to
Ghislaine Dedoldia
. Rudeus begins to research about this and finds the Legen of Perugius Book which he also have at his home in

Christina Greyrat
=================

Christina Greyrat
 is the sixth child and fourth daughter of
Rudeus Greyrat
 and the youngest child he had with
Eris Greyrat
. She is the younger sister of
Ars Greyrat
 and the youngest half-sister of
Lucy Greyrat
,
Lara Greyrat
,
Sieghart Saladin Greyrat
 and
Lily Greyrat
.

Appearance

Christina Greyrat is identical to her mother. She has long, straight, red hair and green eyes like her father. She wears a teal, floral dress with a white, ruffled trim and long sleeves. She is wearing teal slip-ons and white  socks which reach just above her ankles. She appears to be around 10 years old during this time.

Personality

"I will protect you from now onwards!"

-Christina Greyrat

During Christina's childhood, she is considered to be an indoor type and is timid and withdrawn even when Eris would occasionally bring her out, Christina would always be stuck to her and would often start crying and return home because she was scared. Thus she refuses to go out on walks and spends most of her time at home.

Unlike Ars, she is extremely attached to Rudeus who dotes her without restraint and making his lap to be her reserved seat. The only one who can stop her from crying is Rudeus. She is resourceful as implied in planning together with Aisha the downfall of Viola Yellowsnake during graduation. She also showed pity for the girl as the latter chose to cheat to earn titles despite having the capacity to earn them with hardwork.

Chris is raised by her parents to "never bully the weak" and when she tries to stop the bullying of the higher aristocracy, she tries to convince them to stop but when they refuse or when she loses an argument, Chris would resort to using her fists, like her mother Eris would when she was younger without a regard of the nobility status. By helping those who were bullied Chris gained allies as she goes on her turbulent school life at
Asura Royal Academy
.

Background

Christina is the second child of Rudeus and Eris Greyrat who they affectionately refer to as Chris.

Citadel of Roa
==============

Citadel of Roa



The
Citadel of Roa
 (城塞都市ロア
Jōsai Toshi Roa
) is a fortress city in the Fittoa Region of the
Asura Kingdom
 lying on the
Central Continent
. Being the center of trade and commerce and the administrative headquarters of the
Fittoa Region
, Roa is the largest settlement in the Region.

History

Roa is an ancient city with noble history. Four hundred years ago, it stood as the last bastion of defense during the war against the
Demon race
. Owing to that, there stands a picturesque castle in the middle of the city.

Though, despite its mighty origin story, the nobles of the imperial capital currently saw Roa as nothing more than a crude backwater full of
adventurers
.

Description

Roa is a fortified city built inside walls. Sturdy ramparts, 7 to 8 meters in height are wrapped around the city. The walkways of the ramparts are roofed and along it, towers with conical spires are built with airy overviewing windows and balconies.

The city itself is not a perfect circle; it bent with the terrain making the dimensions hard to estimate.
 The city has a gigantic gate for the influx of merchants and townspeople. At the entrance one would be greeted with stables and inns and the waiting area for the stagecoaches. Along the main road, lines of merchant stalls are erected. Shops for different kind of customers are grouped by street junctions while residence buildings are situated in the alleyways much deeper into the city. The streets are paved and buildings are established in a grid structure with vendor shops lined tidily on the roadsides.

The city was built in such a way that the deeper you went into the city the bigger the houses became and the more luxurious the goods shops offered. The closer you lived to the center, the richer you were. All the shops near the noble district are elegant and peddled expensive wares. A castle is nestled right in the middle of the city which is used as the residence of the
 Region
's lord.

Appearance

Claire Latreia
 (
クレア
・
ラトレイア
)
 is the mother of
Zenith
 and
Therese
, as well as the grandmother of
Rudeus
 and
Norn
.

Appearance

Claire is an older woman with white hair in a bun and piercing eyes. She wears a purple dress with a darker purple crevat.

Personality

She's strict and hard headed. She was stubborn from the moment she was born, the house's education raised her to be a person strict with both herself and others; once she decides something, she will never yield and will keep the same opinion until the day she dies. However, when something happens which proves her wrong without a doubt she will revise her opinion, she will not admit to being wrong nor will she offer apologies, but she will at least not make the same mistakes in future.

She likes people that are fair and righteous and hates crimes. In conclusion, she's a genuinely good human being who is just too stubborn to hear out other people and faults frequently because of it.

Background/Story

She was just a regular noblewoman you can find anywhere and has high expectations for her children as a result, she was delighted when her oldest son and daughter turned out to be a knight and a noble young lady who married into a good house. However, when her daughter Therese became a knight, she criticized that this was not a good job for a lady. When Zenith, her most promising child, became an adventurer she felt betrayed and scornful. In both cases, she was adamant her daughters would one day realize their mistakes and come home, but Therese became a high ranking knight and guard of the Miko herself, while Zenith became a successful adventurer and did not show any intent to return. Finally, after the Metastasis event occurred and Paul came asking her for help tracking Zenith down, she aided them partially to tell her daughter "see, this happened because you disobeyed me," but these feelings died down when they failed to find her.

She loves her family quite strongly, but her expectations and stubbornness have a habit of driving them away. When Paul entered a depression, she wanted to take Norn from him by force for her own sake but was prevented from doing so by her husband. She also gained a lot of respect for Rudeus after hearing that he had beaten his father back to his senses, though she was rather disappointed that Rudeus didn't even drop in to introduce himself to her. She gains an even higher opinion of him after meeting him, due to his awareness as the head of a family and also due to the fact that he's serving someone of note, though she has no knowledge of military affairs and does not know who Dragon God Orsted actually is, she just knows the term Dragon God.

Finally, when Rudeus reported that Zenith had been saved but was in a mentally invalid state, she sent him a letter to bring Zenith over and began exploring ways to help cure her. She discovered the story of Elinalise, who went through what Zenith did and reportedly recovered from her state after lots of carnal relations (in reality, however, Elinalise recovered over time, and the rest was a result of her curse making her physically need such things). She was disgusted by her find but desperate enough to cure Zenith that it seemed worth trying.

She hates Paul such that when she met Rudeus, she recognized Paul's face in him and her worst side was on full display. This, coupled with her hinting at the plan to cure Zenith was enough to outright disgust Rudeus and cause him to leave her mansion while violently beating aside any guards unlucky enough to try and stop him. This is extremely notable as Rudeus is usually a pacifist and dislikes fighting.

After this, she tried taking matters into her own hands to cure Zenith, intentionally alienating her family to avoiding having blame placed upon them. This caused a series of massive issues which eventually leads to Rudeus kidnapping the Miko and very well could've resulted in him killing someone or destroying the entire Latreia Estate to find his mother. The issue became such that the officials of the entire Milis religion had to gather to resolve it and likely could've damaged relations between Dragon God Orsted's organization and them.

Her stubbornness finally cracks when Zenith, even in her current state, stopped Rudeus from allowing his grandmother to be imprisoned for ten years for the crime and she confesses her true intentions. After hearing Claire's motivations, Rudeus reveals to her that he knows Elinalise personally and knows that the method she hoped to use would not have worked (and would've essentially just resulted in her mentally handicapped daughter being used repeatedly for sex). Knowing full well that what she sought to do was not a forgivable act, Claire is shocked when Rudeus lets her off for her actions and asks to reconcile with her, and she willingly turns over to the Demon Race Acceptance Faction when asked by him to do so.

Story

Appearance

Cliff Grimoire
 (
クリフ
・
グリモル
)
 is the grandson of the Milis Pope. First introduced in a
side-story
 starring
Eris
, he later becomes one of the main supporting characters of the main story after he becomes
Rudeus'
 classmate at the
Ranoa Magic Academy
, where he also met and fell in love with
Elinalise
.

Appearance

He is short and has dark brown hair. He also has an eye patch to cover his
Demon Eye of Identification
 that he received.

Personality

Cliff is very prideful, so much so that he would proudly brag and proclaim himself as a genius in other people's face. During his debut, he was extremely obnoxious, looking down upon most people as beneath him and would insult them openly. However, he upholds rules and his own codes of honor very firmly, and would not break them except for the most extreme situations.

He is shown to be very diligent that he would constantly seek to improve himself. He is also very loyal to his friends and loved ones, willing to give everything he has or even risking his life for their sake.

While the grandson of the current head of the Millis Church and a devout follower of the Millis religion himself, he does not try to impose his beliefs on others and does not seem to mind if others engage in acts that would normally be seen as blasphemous unless the act involves him directly. He is also compassionate and flexible in his beliefs, understanding
Elinalise's
 curse forces her to be promiscuous or else she would die, and does not mind her engaging in sexual activity with other men as long as he is the only one she is emotionally loyal to.

Background

When Cliff was 5, Harry Grimoire, a person who held a high position in the Millis religious organization adopted him. Cliff is a gifted child that became Advanced Rank in Summoning,
Detoxification
,
Healing
, and Fire at a young age. He is also the biological grandson of the current Pope of Millis. He had a dream of becoming an adventurer which leads to him meeting with

Trivia

In Future Rudeus's original timeline, he goes to Millis with
Rudeus

Rudeus Greyrat

Summary

Rudeus searches and finds a gagged Eris with her two abductors running down an alleyway, so Rudeus uses Earth magic to create a wall and block their escape. As they see Rudeus using magic, they mistakenly think him as her bodyguard, and the kidnappers propose to pay Rudeus from profits by a
fat noble
 who wishes to buy Eris. But while Rudeus sees it is tempting, he refuses outright as he can't buy personal connections with money. Shooting a fireball into the air, the kidnappers are distracted by the firework, allowing Rudeus to free Eris from the custody of the one holding her.

However, the other thief slices an Earth Cannon attack in half, forcing Rudeus into a hasty retreat. Using a fireball as a feint, the remaining thief is caught in a mud trap, as Rudeus is racing to the street with Eris in his arms. Unable to move, the second kidnapper is forced to throw his blade in an attempt to stop Rudeus. As Rudeus sees the blade flying toward him, he flashes back to Paul's teaching him about North God Style incorporating sword throwing techniques. With no way to dodge or escape anymore, Rudeus believes himself about to die until Ghislaine arrives. Ghislaine destroys the thrown sword and kills the swordsman kidnapper. When asked, Rudy tells her that there were no other kidnappers and that it was his first time seeing someone be killed in front of him.

After Ghislaine advises Rudeus to be more careful, she escorts the children to the Boreas Manor, where the staff tend to them. Once home, Eris is finally allowed to talk having fulfilled her promise to Rudeus, and
grants
 him the
privilege
 to simply address her as Eris. Realizing he never asked her name, Rudeus believes he's finally been hired as her tutor whils Eris falls back and sleeps on the floor. Still thinking back, as that thrown sword was aimed to kill him, and regardless of his being in a fantasy world, Rudeus is afraid as he has no idea what would happen if he were to die again.

Perugius Dola

First Dragon God
 as one of his Five Dragon Generals who protect the Dragon World for years. Since the concept of familial relationship is thin among the

Curses
======

Curses
 (
呪い
,

Noroi
)
 are special abilities born from abnormalities in
Mana
. They can manifest in two forms: people whose abilities are beneficial to others are known as
Miko
 (
神子
,

Miko
, lit. "Blessed Child")
, while those whose abilities bring disadvantage or harm are known as
Cursed One
 (
呪子
,

Noroi-ko
, lit."Cursed Child")
. This distinction is made by humans and fundamentally, both are the same kind of anomalous ability. Because whether an ability is beneficial or harmful is judged by others, even a Miko’s ability can sometimes be detrimental to themselves.

Cliff Grimoire
 proposes a hypothesis that suggests a connection between curses and
magic items
. According to his theory, the effects of curses and magic items are essentially the same. After hearing that
Laplace
 transferred his curse to the
Superd Tribe
 through a
spear
, Cliff Grimoire is researching a technique to send mana from a
magic tool
 to offset the negative effects of curses and alleviate their symptoms.

Cursed Ones

Elinalise Dragonroad

Elinalise Dragonroad is afflicted with a curse inherited from being trapped in a labyrinth magic crystal. This curse causes mana to accumulate within her body, which must be crystallized through receiving a male’s sperm. If she fails to receive it, the mana bulges too dangerously within her, ultimately leading to her death. As a result, she produces a mana crystal once per month.

During pregnancy, her condition can be temporarily subsided as the mana flowed into the unborn child instead, eliminating the need for sexual intercourse to avoid death. As result, her children born inherit exceptionally high mana capacity without exception. Thanks to Cliff’s research, a magical device was devised that suppressed the curse—allowing her to go over a year without intercourse by the time Cliff graduated.

Ruijerd Superdia

Cursed after Laplace transferred his own curse to him. Makes others feel intense fear toward him. The effect has weakened over time as his physical resemblance to Laplace (green hair) faded.

Demon God
Laplace

Laplace has a curse on him that makes all living creatures of the Human World fear him extremely, which according to
Perugius
 is a curse that shakes the innermost heart of people. Laplace transferred the <Curse of Fear> to the
spears
 and passed it onto the
Superd race

Dragon God
Orsted

Orsted's curse affecting all creatures of the world
Curse on Orsted causing even dragons to fear him
1/2

Orsted is born with an innate curse that causes every living being in this world to instinctively despise and fear him—those who sense his
mana
 harbor hostility toward him. A powerful curse so intense that children cry, dogs flee, and carriages overturn merely from his presence. There are some exceptions:

Those with ancient dragon blood, like
Perugius
, are immune.

Rudeus
 and his descendants, as well as
Nanahoshi
, are not influenced by this curse.
Hitogami
 speculates that “it doesn’t affect people from other worlds,” while Orsted believes his status as a reincarnated being may also play a role.

Some individuals possess the mental fortitude to overcome the curse, such as
Eris
,
Ruijerd
 and
Ariel
.

Wearing the magical tool, Curse Suppressing Helmet, crafted by
Cliff
 can mitigate the curse’s effects.

It seems the root of the curse is linked to fear stemming from the
First Dragon God
—who annihilated all worlds except the
Dragon
 and
Human World
. From this, it's inferred that the curse doesn’t affect the Dragon Tribe who were not adversaries of the First Dragon God, nor does it affect people from other worlds who never interacted with him.

Henry Macedonia

Becomes difficult to be recognized by others. The curse can be mitigated with a curse-repelling mask. However, most humans, except for his biological mother, cannot recognize Henry, and his face cannot be remembered. Notably, the Superd Tribe with a third eye can recognize him.

Mikos

Only about ten Mikos exist whole world . Outside of royalty, most are stripped of their birth names and renamed
“Miko of [Ability]”
, with the title reflecting their innate abilities. They are typically bound to serve the kingdom of their birth.

Miko of Superhuman Strength
Zanoba Shirone





Zanoba's Miko Power in the Anime



Even at a young age, Zanoba is abnormally strong, capable of standing off against a demon king as far as raw strength goes. Any hit from Zanoba is potentially fatal even with
Battle Aura
. This power does not include stamina, however, as Zanoba is described to be unfit for long travels.

Miko of Memory

When looking into someone's eyes, the Miko of Memory is able to see one's "surface memories", memories that a person has in mind. This also extends to being able to see related memories to that subject, and the longer she stares into someone's eyes, the more of that person's memories she sees.

Miko of Rewind
 Lilia

She has the ability to alter the past, but since she cannot fully control it, her power is believed to be only the ability to rewind an object’s time by a single day.

Hitogami

He is automatically trusted by all Humans in the world and has the ability to talk to people in their dreams. When he speaks with people in their dreams, he's able to read their minds.

Zenith Greyrat

Zenith has gained the ability to read minds after being trapped in a Magic Crystal during the Teleport Incident. A side effect of her power is that she is in a dream like state where she is not fully awake and not able to actually speak, but thinks she is speaking due to her telepathy.

Nether King
Vita

He can read the memories of his enemies, predict the future that might have occurred and blend it with the desires of his opponent, putting them into an endless illusion. By splitting off part of his own body and inserting them into people, he can control many people at the same time and even halt a disease outbreak.

Kishirika Kishirisu

She's most known for her ability to produce, control and give demon eyes. She carries 12 types within her body, each with their own unique ability. She regenerates these demon eyes as she grows older after reincarnation, it may be possible that she generates new ones if she gets old enough without dying.

Trivia

There are only about 10 Mikos in the whole world.

As long as you are not royalty, your birth name will be taken away and replaced with just "Miko" (Such as in the case of
Millishion Miko
) and you will be forced to work for the kingdom.

===================

Darius Silva Ganius
 (
ダリウス

 was the Prime Minister of the
Asura Kingdom
.

Appearance

Darius is a fat and bald old man that wears wealthy clothes.

Note: This section is under construction and revision
.

Personality

A vile human who does everything he can to gain power and please his desires. He would regularly kidnap young noble women such as
Eris Boreas Greyrat
, which failed, and
Tristina Purplehorse
, which succeeded, and would use them as his sex slaves and play toys, selling them off once he was done with them. He also had no problem ordering people to kill others when he thinks it will benefit himself, such as when he ordered
Reida Reia
 to kill
Ariel Anemoi Asura
. His appearance and character may be a reference to Minister
Foss
 from Berserk.

Background

He was a big supporter of the first prince of the Asura Kingdom,
Grabel Zafin Asura
, and would do everything in his power to coerce others to his side to give Grabel the best chances of becoming King, even if he did not deserve the throne.

Vol 2

Darius is suspected to be behind the true kidnapping of Eris.

Vol 4

Darius informed Grabel about Ariel's suspicious movements and sent
Nights Eye Crow
 to kill her. Even though she fails, he continues to send assassins after her until she leaves the country.

Vol 6

He financially supported the Boreas family after the
Teleport Incident
, and helped protect them and allow them to rebuilt House Boreas when the other nobles would have crushed it, taking as much of the land they owned for themselves. However he thought
Sauros Boreas Greyrat
 was a fool for wanting to use the entire Boreas fortune on rebuilding
Fittoa
, so he persuaded
Pilemon Notos Greyrat
 into action,  and caused Sauros to be blamed for the teleport incident which led to his execution.

Vol 17

Darius would repeatedly send assassination attempts to any noble that would side themselves with Ariel, which caused some of them to switch sides to the first prince Grabel out of fear for their lives.

Darius is one of the
Hitogami
 apostles, and he was behind every attack against Ariel. After he was exposed by Tristina and Ariel his political position was greatly reduced as he was going to be punished for his crimes of kidnapping and abusing Tristina, but Reida came to his rescue and ordered
Auber Corvette
 to carry him to safety, but he was killed by ultimately chased down by
Rudeus Greyrat
,
Ghislaine Dedoldia
, and Eris. After the three defeated his guard, Auber, Ghislaine was allowed to deliver the final blow to Darius as he was the one who ordered Sauros to be executed, which was the person Ghislaine wanted to avenge.

 (デッドエンド,
Deddo Endo

Rudeus Greyrat
 after the Teleportation incident.

History

The party was created in order for them to do adventurer jobs so that they can get some money in order for them to travel back to

 It was disbanded after they reached the Fittoa Region, when Ruijerd achieved his goal of escorting the two back to their home. After the party was disbanded, Ruijerd went off to search for other surviving members of the Superd Race, Eris left to train in the Holy Land of the Sword, whereas Rudeus continued to work as an adventurer to spread his fame in hope of finding the still missing
Zenith
.

Trivia

They had the skill to obtain the S rank of the adventurer guild, but because this may limit the quest that may take, they stayed in A Rank.

Each members have their own epithet:

"Mad Dog"  Eris

"Guard Dog" Ruijerd

"Kennel Master" Rujerd (Rudeus)

In order to improve Ruijerd's and subsequently Superd's reputation, Rudeus would introduce himself as "Ruijerd of Dead End" whenever he did something amicable, and as "Rudeus" when he did something bad or got into trouble.

As a result, his name was mixed up and mistakenly spread as "Rujerd".

Demon Continent
===============

Map of Demon Continent



Demon Continent
 (魔大陸
Mā Tairiku
) lying east to the
Ringus Sea
 is the continent where the
Demon Race
 live. There are no roads but a single path is present. D-rank or above monsters roam around the continent and they have high adaptability to the techniques even if they see it only once. It is said that warriors go there to train but mostly never come back. It is an exceedingly harsh land over which is ruled by Demon lords. The monsters are said to taste bad.

Population

The Demon Race makes up the large majority of the population. The Human Race, Beast Race, and the Seafolk can be seen near port towns.

Demon God Tongue is the language spoken.

Governance

There are about 30 demon lords and each one of them has their own territory. They're demon lords in name only though, who just act bossy. There are also demon lords who have a special unit, but actually, they’re just warriors with special powers and cool names. The Special Guard in the town of Rikaris is also one of them. The people in special units are actually pretty similar to adventurers. They exterminate monsters like them, they catch criminals in town, and they also guard the town they live in. If a demon lord is determined to start a war, they would become the demon lord’s army. Most of the magic continent is a lawless area that does not have a Demon Lord ruling over the territory.

Geography

Biegoya Region

The region reigned over by the Demon King
Badigadi
.

Rikarisu

The city of
Rikarisu
, also referred to as
Old Kishirisu Castle
, is one of the three largest settlements on the Demon Continent. It served as the home base for the forces of the Demon Empress Kishirika Kishirisu during the Great Human-Demon War.

It sits in the middle of a gigantic crater.

Petrified Forest

A forest a days journey away from Rikarisu. It was a place where bone-like trees with jagged branches grew in enormous numbers. Cutting through the forest offered a shortcut to reach another nearby city, but due to the presence of multiple rank B monsters such as the Almond Anaconda and the Executioner, this shortcut is only taken by merchants in a big hurry who hire multiple skilled bodyguards beforehand. The rank A Red-Hood Cobra can also rarely be present as well.

Migurd Village

The Migurd Village is a small settlement where the Demon tribe of
Migurd
 lives.

Gaslow Region

The region reigned over by the Demon King
Atoferatofe Raibaku
.

Sokasu grass is also grown in this region in depths of caves where the sun never shines and its inhabitants have knowledge of its cultivating techniques. In addition to being used as tea due to its delicious taste by demons, Sokasu grass is also used for treatment in
Nanahoshi Shizuka
's Drain Syndrome.

Fort Necross

An impregnable fortress built by the immortal Demon King Necross Lacross. The place where Atoferatofe resides.

Babynos Region

Where the
Superd
 tribe originally lived before driven out of their homes during the Laplace war.

Southern Region

Wind Port

The only port city in the Demon Continent and is the connecting travel hub via sea to and from Zanto Port,
Millis Continent
. It's a town with a lot of hills and slopes. You can see the entire city from the entrance.

See
Interactive Map of the Demon Continent

Monsters

Due to the high mana density, the monsters occupying the Demon Continent are far greater in strength and numbers when compared to other continents. All monsters are ranked D and above, while also having high adaptability to the techniques even if they see it only once. Combined with the harsh terrain, the Demon Continent is widely regarded as the most dangerous continent in the world.

Kishirika's various Demon Eyes in the Manga



Demon Eyes
 (
魔眼
,

Magan
, alt. "Magic/Mystic Eyes")
 refer to special eyes that have abilities associated with them. How one obtains these eyes may vary, but it's possible for some to be born with them, such as someone born with the
Laplace Factor
, but it's more commonly known that one can be bestowed a demon eye by
Kishirika Kishirisu
.

Mastering demon eyes require precise control of the flow of mana, and most users are unable to fully control them throughout their lives. As a result, most users would wear an eyepatch to cover their demon eyes when they're not using them
.

Known Demon Eyes

There are a number of Demon Eyes. Kishirika possesses 12 of them, but only 7 of them are described.
 It's unknown what the other eyes are possessed by Kishirika. Demon Eyes have long existed even in the era of the
Six-Faced World
 and some of its users are not even aware that they have such eye until they are told to focus their
Mana
 to their eyes.

Magic Power Eyes

Ghislaine's Magic Power Eyes in the Manga
Ghislaine's Magic Power Eyes in the Anime
Kishirika's Magic Power Eyes in the Anime
1/3

The most common of Demon Eyes,
Magic Power Eyes
 (
魔力眼
,

Maryoku me
)
 allow the user to view the flow of mana directly. The eye appears to be a deep green color, and has a cross-like pattern, with something like 4 extra pupils appearing around the main center pupil.

Known Users:

Kishirika Kishirisu

Ghyslaine Dedoldia

Balibadom

Identification Eyes

When looking at something with the
Identification Eyes
 (
識別眼
,

Shikibetsu me
)
, the details of that object will be shown in texts. However, only information within Kishirika's knowledge would be provided, whereas anything that she doesn't know would be shown as "unknown".

Known Users:

Kishirika Kishirisu

Cliff Grimoire

X-ray Eyes

As the name suggests,
X-ray Eyes
 (
透視眼
,

Tōshi me
)
 allow one to see through opaque objects, including walls or clothes. However, it doesn't allow one to see through living creatures or dense magical power.

Known Users:

Kishirika Kishirisu

Clairvoyant Eyes

Kishirika's Clairvoyant Eye in the Light Novel
1/3

The
Clairvoyant Eyes
 (
千里眼
,

Senri me
, lit. "Thousand Miles Eyes")
 allow the user to see far away. However, the "Focus point" is difficult to control. Rather than acting as a scope, the Clairvoyant Eyes seem to change the perspective of one's vision, with the amount of mana determining the distance from the user.

Known Users:

Kishirika Kishirisu

Rudeus Greyrat

Foresight Eyes

1/3

The
Foresight Eyes
 (
予見眼
,

Yoken me
)
 allows one to see into the future, seeing possible outcomes. However, like the Clairvoyance Eyes, it's difficult to control "focal point", which in this case means how far into the future one wants to see, and the opacity of the future imagery. The further one tries to see, the more outcomes are shown to them, but these outcomes become blurred together
. The appearance of this eye has a color similar to Rudeus' natural eyes, however the pupil takes on a swirl shape, similar to a whirlpool.

Known Users:

Kishirika Kishirisu

Rudeus Greyrat

Absorption Eyes

These Eyes absorb magic power. However, they also absorb one's own magic, so it's disadvantageous for a magician to have the
Absorption Eyes
 (
吸魔眼
,

Kyūma me
)
.

Known Users:

Kishirika Kishirisu

All-Seeing Eyes

The
All-Seeing Eyes
 (
万里眼
,

Banri me
, lit. "Ten-Thousand Miles Eyes")
 allow the user to see all things in the world, even being able to find specific people, and peer into labyrinths. However, a dense enough magical power can hinder the sight of the All-Seeing Eyes.

Known Users:

Kishirika Kishirisu

Absolute Void Eyes

The
Absolute Void Eyes
 (
空絶眼
,

Sora zemme
)
 create a barrier around a large area. It's unclear exactly how the barrier operates, but it's able to prevent a large mass of people from entering a castle.

Known Users:

Randolph Marianne

Affection Eyes

The
Affection Eyes
 (
魅了眼
,

Miryō me
)
 causes people to become infatuated with the user. Because some users can't control them, they'll usually cover the eye with bandages or an eyepatch.

Known Users:

Gadalf Rangid

Other

Laplace had a unnamed demon eye that allows its him to see traces of living beings in an area that can be differentiated by person and can be tracked to its owner despite the long distance from where it was initially found even if the traces were left decades ago.

Known Users:

Laplace

Trivia

The
All-Seeing Eyes
 original kanji (万里眼) literally means "Ten-Thousand Miles Eyes", likely to indicate that these eyes are on a higher level than the
Clairvoyant Eyes
 (
千里眼
, lit. "Thousand Miles Eyes")
.

Demon Spear
===========

Demon Spears in the Manga



The Demon Spears are spears made by
Laplace
 as a gift for the
Superd Tribe
, that hold immense power with the side effect of causing its users in this case the Superd race to become insane not being able to tell friend from foe and is what caused them to gain such horrible reputations. It have a high resemblance with the Superd spear excluding his jet black color, this magic tool amplified their bearers’ physical capabilities several times over, nullified the effects of the humans’ magic, and heightened the Superds’ already sharp senses even further, but slowly erodes the mind of his user.

Derrick Redbat
==============

"He was a shrewd man, possessing a strong ambition. If the mana calamity had not happened, Ariel was fated to encounter Perugius. And the one who at that time would have persuaded Perugius was Derrick."

Orsted

Derrick Redbat
 was an advanced ranked magician and the previous guardian mage of Ariel before Fitts.

Appearance

Note: This section is under construction and revision
.

Personality

While Orsted describes Derrick to be shrewd and ambitious, he is also a man of common sense and due to hailing from a middle class noble family does not share the behavior of upper class nobles where the ability to toy with others was a status symbol especially those in the Silver Palace. Derrick also has understanding of the dangers within Asura Kingdom that has been on a standstill due to the ugly political bickering between the nobilities and would remain a drag on the kingdom's progress despite the overwhelming advantages Asura Kingdom has, it might not last even fifty years should the surrounding kingdoms invade.

Out of all the heirs, Derrick believes that Ariel is the most suitable to become queen because of her unsurpassed charisma and that she certainly would be a monarch beloved by the people, just as her ancestor
Kaunis Freean Asura
 that led humanity after the Laplace Wars was.

Background

Derrick is the third son of the famed Redbat house, an advanced ranked magician hailed from the historic Asura Magic Academy and became a guardian purely due to his exemplary grades in the Magic Academy. A noble with advance magic was of great value. The Redbat family was mere middle class noble of Asura Kingdom, thus largely disconnected from the decadence within the Silver Palace.

Derrick first meets Ariel after his graduation at a coming of age banquet hosted by the king himself where Ariel participated in the banquet as an honored guest. Although young, her congratulatory speech was brilliantly made, even outshining the valedictorian with her intellect. His father later suggested "the position of Second Princess Guardian Magician is vacant, don't put your hopes up, but want me to recommend you?" Without a moment of doubt he took the offer and gets the position and works with
Luke Notos Greyrat
.

Plot





Derrick and Ariel saved by Syphiette



Derrick would frequently lecture on kingship and persuade Ariel to become queen but Ariel would refuse because of numerous assassination attempts on her life. He sacrifices his life protecting Ariel from a terminate boar that appeared in the Silver Palace due to the
Teleport Incident
. Derrick aware his wounds are fatal sees Ariel in tears next to him and felt an unexpected happiness since he assumed that Ariel and Luke despised him for his lectures and tells Ariel his final request for her to become queen. Seeing Luke get knocked off by the boar, Derrick could only pray despite knowing that it meant little on this desperate situation but his prayer is answered when he sees an angel falling from heaven and kills the boar. Seeing this happen, Derrick shed a final tear in thanks and entrusts the angel to continue protecting Ariel.

Legacy

He is succeeded by
Fitts
 and all his equipment was given to her.

Ariel resolves to become queen because of Derrick's final request.

Rudeus Greyrat
 helps Ariel recall Derrick's lectures on kingship and successfully gains Perugius' backing to become queen.

Quotes

"Please, God, I pray to you to aid us in our current predicament. Take my life as exchange; please help Ariel, whose existence this world cannot be without."

"As long as Ariel-sama has the will to fight, I'll be more than happy to sacrifice my life against assassins, if need be."

Trivia

In
Orsted
's previous loops, Derrick is the first person needed for Ariel to become
Asura Kingdom
's queen by successfully convincing
Perugius Dola
 to support Ariel's ascent to the throne and he would become her Prime Minister but has died during the Teleport Incident despite having a strong fate.

Desert Journey
==============

Desert Journey
 (砂漠の旅
Sabaku no Tabi
) is the nineteenth episode of the
second season
 (43nd overall)
Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on May 26, 2024 and also the first episode of the
Labyrinth Arc
 for the Anime.

The episode is supposed to air on May 19, 2024 but it is postponed to May 26, 2024 and a special episode was aired featuring the seiyuu's of the series instead.

Synopsis

Upon receiving a letter from Geese saying, "Difficulty in rescuing Zenith, seeking help," Rudeus faces the tough choice of leaving behind his pregnant wife, Sylphy, along with his sisters, Norn and Aisha. Despite his inner struggle, Rudeus decides to head to the
labyrinth city of Rapan
 on the Begaritt continent with Elinalise. However, the journey turns out to be even more perilous than he imagined, putting lives at risk.

Plot

At Ranoa Magic Academy, Rudeus informs Elinalise that he is going to Begaritt who agrees to travel together after Rudeus insists on going. They then plan their trip and they first address dealing with the
Curse of Promiscuity
 of Elinalise and Rudeus suggests to use the
Curse Supressing Tool
 created by Cliff. Elinalise seems reluctant to tell Cliff that she is leaving but Rudeus tells her to talk to Cliff about it.

Rudeus then visits Nanahoshi and tells her that he will be going to Begaritt and will be gone for 2 years that surprises Nanahoshi, but quickly calms down to think. Before Rudeus leave, Nanahoshi gives him a map of Teleportation Circles of the
Human World
 and the location of the Teleportation Circle Ruins near Sharia to Begaritt. Although Nanahoshi is reluctant since Teleportation Magic is taboo in the Human World and is also sworn to secrecy, she shows Rudeus the map that upon teleporting to Begaritt he will need to travel north for a month and he should reach Rapan. Rudeus is shocked by how fast he can reach Rapan but is glad to be able to make it in time when Sylphy gives birth. Nanahoshi then reminds him to keep it a secret and she is just returning the favor and wants him to return quickly to continue her research after Rudeus thanks her.

At the Greyrat House, Rudeus announces his plans to go to Begaritt Continent that surprises Aisha while Norn remains silent. Sylphiette accepts Rudeus' decision despite promising he will not disappear on her. Sylphiette initially thought that Rudeus will be gone for 2 years but he tells her about the Teleportation Circles through Nanahoshi's help, she is worried due to her own experience with the
Teleport Incident
 but Rudeus assures her that he will come back. After talking to Aisha and Norn, Rudeus wants to name their
child
 but the girls are visibly shocked upon hearing this and Sylphy tells her that naming their child before going on journey means he will never make it back due to the legend of
Feroze Star
. Seeing Sylphy is still worried, Rudeus kisses Sylphy while Norn and Aisha looks on blushing.

At Ranoa Magic Academy, Rudeus talks to Linia and Pursena, then visits Jinas to arrange for a leave of absence for him and Elinalise then asks permission to borrow the books: "An Exploratory Account of the
Teleportation Labyrinth
" and "The Begaritt Continent and the
Fighting God Tongue
" from the Library.

At the Commerce District, Rudeus is joined by Zanoba, Juliette, and Ginger, who recommend purchasing a rather large dark horse that Rudeus names Matsukaze.

At the Greyrat House, Rudeus and Elinalise are packing up Matsukaze. Cliff then gives the Curse Supressing Tool that is smaller than the prototype and entrusts Elinalise to him. Cliff then approaches and embraces Elinalise and tells her that they will be married in a
Milis style
 ceremony when she returns. Sylphy also approaches Rudeus who once again assures her he will return soon and after giving his farewell to Norn and Aisha, Rudeus and Elinalise depart with an
adventurer
 accompanying them.

Arriving at their destination at Lumen Forest, the site of the Teleportation Circle Ruins, the adventurer leaves with Matsukaze to be returned to the Greyrat House.

Rudeus and Elinalise travels to the forest until they see a stone tablet bearing the emblem of Saint Dragon General
Szilard
. Rudeus presses his hand on the emblem and chants the incantation provided by Nanahoshi and the landscape changes to the entrance of the Teleportation Ruins, which they enter.

The two explore the ruins and descend the stairs. They see the Teleportation Circle which Rudeus confirms that it is a two-way Teleportation circle from the book he borrowed. The two then hold hands and upon stepping on the circle, they are now in Begaritt Continent. Before the leave the ruins, Elinalise volunteers to test the circle if they can return. While waiting for Elinalise to return, Rudeus explores the ruins and finds
Orsted
's extra
Coat
. Elinalise returns and Redeus deduces that the teleportation incurs a time lag.

Rudeus and Elinalise exits the Teleportation Ruins and seeing the vast desert before them, they confirm they are indeed in the Begaritt Continent. Since the night is approaching, Elinalise suggests to rest in the ruins until morning and they continue their travel.

At night, Rudeus conjures an
Earth Fortress
 for them to sleep but is exposed to a scent and begins to make a move on Elinalise who is asleep but upon hearing her utter Cliff's name, Rudeus steps outside and encounters a
Succubus
.

Rudeus approaches the Succubus but Elinalise attacks her that the monster narrowly dodges. The Succubus reveals her true form to take flight but Elinalise pummels the monster midair with her
Buckler
, causing the Succubus crash to the ground then Elinalise finishes her off by thrusting her
Estoc
 to the Succubus' heart. Rudeus, still affected by the Succubus' scent, makes a preposition to Elinalise, but she taps him on the head with her buckler and tells him to use
Detoxification Magic
.

Continuing their travel, they encounter a
Twin Death Scorpions
 where Elinalise attacks head on while Rudeus finishes it off with his
Stone Cannon
. They are then caught by a sandstorm that Rudeus nullifies with his own
Sandstorm
 spell.

A
behemoth
 accompanies them for a while. After days of travelling, Rudeus and Elinalise arrives at Bazaar, an encampment surrounding an
oasis
, where Rudeus asks for directions and have their meals.

That night, Elinalise steps out of the Earth Fortress for to pick up men while Rudeus thought that the Curse Supressing Tool still needs improvement, and they need to rescue
Zenith
 and return home as soon as possible.

Next day, Rudeus and Elinalise are in front of a cliff, causing Elinalise to suggest taking a detour but Rudeus uses
Earth Lance
 to lifts them atop the cliff but they are attacked by a
Griffon
 that Rudeus narrowly dodges. Another Griffon arrives and confronts Elinalise and the battle begins.

Seeing the Griffon attack with his
Foresight Eyes
, Rudeus responds with
Earth Hedgehog
, causing the Griffon to fly back but Rudeus follows up with
Wind Blast
, stunning the Griffon to the ground. As the Griffon lands, Rudeus follows up with a Stone Cannon and finishes it off by burning it with
Fireball
 that engulfs the Griffon in flame. Rudeus then turns his attention to Elinalise who is still fighting the second Griffon then prepares another Stone Cannon. Elinalise lands a hit on the Griffon who tried to take off. But Elinalise stabs the Griffon's front paw with her Estoc, pinning it in place as the Stone Cannon lands at the Griffon's neck and kills it.

That night, Rudeus and Elinalise are eating the drumstick of the Griffon they fought and where Elinalise talks about her adventures with Zenith who was 16, the same age of Rudeus when they first met but they decide to drop the subject when it changed to
Paul
's past.

After further travelling, Rudeus and Elinalise finally arrives at Rapan.

Detoxification Magic
====================

Detoxification Magic
 is one of the four systems of
Healing Magic
 (magic category), focused on curing poison or sickness. At higher stages, Detoxification Magic even be used to create poison or medicine to cure poisons. Status-affliction related Detoxification Magic is said to be
Saint-ranked
 and above, and very difficult to learn.

With Detoxification Magic, the large majority of conditions can be cured using just Elementary-level. However, particular illnesses, poisons produced by powerful monsters, or diseases that have reached an advanced stage will need a pinpoint incantation and a massive amount of magic power which required higher level Detoxification Magic.

The God-class Detoxification Magic is a single magic that cures『Magic Stone Disease』. However, its incantation is carefully guarded in the storage of the
Great Church of Milishion
.

Trivia

Detoxification magic has also been shown to enable sobriety caused from drinking alcohol, but it can't remove the intoxication or fix hangovers from overdrinking.

Disturb Magic
=============

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Disturb Magic
 (
乱魔

,

Ran Ma

)
 is a
Unique/Unclassified

Magic
 that disrupts and cancels an opponent's spell during the activation phase, before it fully manifests.

Background

Disturb Magic is devised by the Dragon God
Urupen
[
Citation needed
]
 and is also first seen to be used by
Orsted
 during his
first battle against Rudeus
.





Rudeus practicing Disturb Magic in the Anime



Rudeus: "Since there is a number of cases where my magic has been sealed and I've been unable to do anything recently, I'm researching it after all."
Eris: "Hey, why is Rudeus that strong?"

Rudeus learned the technique through analysis and combat experience during his first near-fatal battle with Orsted, in which Orsted used it against him. Later, while training with Sylphiette, Rudeus developed a method to counter Disturb Magic itself, enabling him to cast spells despite its interference.

Details

Rudeus' right hand sealed by Disturb Magic.
1/3

Disturb Magic works by sending magic designed to counteract the target spell. This interference causes the opponent's magic to scatter harmlessly before it can form.

It's an extremely rare and difficult technique to learn and master. Even highly talented mages like
Sylphiette
 struggle with it significantly.

Secrecy





Rudeus and Sylphy practicing Disturb Magic in the Anime



Fitz: "H-How did you do that?"
Rudeus: "Its a spell called Disturb Magic. Haven't you heard of it?"

Aside from Orsted and Rudeus, Disturb Magic's existence is not known even in prominent schools like
Ranoa Magic Academy
 that upon seeing it for the first time, that it is speculated that it is a Unique Magic of a certain
race
.
 At Sylphy's request to learn Disturb Magic, they develop a method to practice Disturb Magic where Rudeus would try to keep a
Waterball
 active while Sylphy tries to use Disturb Magic to neutralize it.

Counter

1/1

"Hmm... you managed to cancel Disturb Magic? No, its different... its a form of multiple incantations. Being able to do it with voiceless incantations, what a skillful guy you are."

-Orsted to Rudeus

Disturb Magic is only effective against magic cast from within a certain distance. Spells cast from beyond the range of the interfering magic are unaffected. It typically targets the magic activation at one specific part of the opponent's body (e.g., a hand). However, magic can still be cast using other body parts that are not currently targeted. During
Rudeus
's first battle with
Orsted
, Orsted used Disturb Magic to seal the magic in Rudeus's right hand. However, since it only targeted one body part, Rudeus could still cast magic with his left hand.

Divine Continent
 (
天大陸

 is a small continent located in the north connected to the
Central Continent
. You could even walk from it to the
Demon Continent
 during the low tide.
 It is where the
Heaven Race
 lives. The continent sits on a 3000-meter cliff with no proper connecting roads.

The Continent lies far north of the
Ringus Sea
.

Population

The
Heaven Race
 is the only major race that is known to live on this continent.

The language spoken is Sky God Tongue.

Localization

Western Cliff Face

Located at the furthest north-eastern edge of the Central Continent. The cliff face is more than simple bare rock. A number of the local inhabitants believed that gods resided within this cliff, so its surface was dotted with ladders and footholds. According to
Orsted
, a shrine dedicated to the worship of these gods could be found around two hundred meters up. Further above that, there were stakes driven into the cliff face to assist with climbing. There is a road made of a series of barely walkable footholds that leads to the Demon Continent, it was a much safer bet to travel than trying to climb upwards.

Hell

One of the three greatest labyrinths in the world. This was where
Nether King Vita
 stayed to avoid
Laxus

Artier

A town of the Heaven Race protected by a barrier.
Perugius Dola
 has some ties with the citizens in the town, and they would guide the people who come for their child's baptism to the shrine.

Trivia

It is the only continent on which Rudeus doesn't travel in the WN.

Even though is connected by a cliff with the Central Continent and Demon Continent, is considered a separate Continent because is really hard to climb.

After the hearing, Doga offers her cold water in a very attentive way. Doga has been in love with Isolte ever since he met her in a sparring match, when Doga was not yet even a North King.

At a dinner with her brother-in-law, Hans, Doga indirectly told him about his feelings for Isolte. Hans insisted that he should go and ask Isolte to marry her right now, but Doga disagreed as he thinks he's not up to the task. After a little discussion, Doga was convinced to confess his love.

Doga went personally to the Isolte dojo dressed in formal clothes and a bouquet of flowers. He pleaded but was rejected, even after telling his whole story, as Isolte had promised Ariel to marry someone royalty. Doga decides to retire as a knight and declares himself to Isolte again. This time, Isolte realizes how much Doga loves her and decides to accept his feelings.

Dora
====

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

"Dragon God-sama had his own considerations. He always thinks about us, the Dragon Race. Even when he does something we don't understand, it's done for the future of our race, so I don't need an explanation."

Armored Dragon King Dora

Dora
 is from the Armored Dragon Tribe and a member of the Five Dragon Generals who oversees the training of dragons and Dragon Warriors. She is also the mate of
Crystal
 and the mother of
Perugius Dola
.

Appearance

Dora has exceptionally large wings and beautiful white scales.

Personality

Among the Five Dragon Generals, Dora is particularly loyal to the
First Dragon God
, that she takes as a great point of pride. During
Laplace
's training, Dora  would resort to provocations and physical harm which is long been an effective method for teaching hierarchy.

Despite possessing personal pride for the training methods she has refined for millenia, she is willing to put those aside as long as it benefits the First Dragon God.

Background

Show respect and submit to me. I don't tell lies. Be true and trust me with all your heart. No whimpering or saying I can't. It's a waste of time. If you don't give up, I will surely raise you into a fine dragon warrior

-Dora to Laplace

Dora immediately provokes Laplace to a fight upon meeting and after she tells
Lunaria
 that the First Dragon God's order to educate Laplace, Lunaria bids Laplace to learn well and leaves with the servants. For the next five years, Dora teaches Laplace how to speak, history, geography, status relationship, etiquette, industry and various other common knowledge of the Dragon Tribe. Dora then trains Laplace on classroom training and combat during the morning and leaves Laplace alone to learn to fly from afternoon to night.

After Laplace completes his Dragon Warrior training, he becomes Dora's subordinate and she assigns him to train a red dragon. One year later, Dora is surprised to find that Laplace is able to tame the dragon that he names
Saleyakt
 and upon hearing the method Laplace has used which is different Dora's method of beating them to submission, she assigns him to tame dragons that are deemed untrainable through out the Dragon World which eventually decreased the number individuals killed and the number of high quality dragons increased.

Dora and Crystal's spawning season happened to overlap and like the rest of the Dragon Race of breeding age, they were obligated to prioritize making the next generation where Dora already had some children that are all fully grown Dragon Warriors or Dragon Trainers but a child of 2 Dragon Generals are met with high expectations. So before that time, Dora names Laplace to be her substitute to supervise all dragon training grounds in the Dragon World during the spawning season which Laplace feels honored to be selected to carry out Dora's duty for around 30 years.

"For a long time, I had watched him develop... While he still lacks the strength to be worthy of the title Dragon General... we were once inadequate as well. Dragon God-sama's battle banner needs new blood if we're to grow our battle strength. Laplace. It's an honor. Work harder now, more than ever."

-Dora

When Crystal died, Dora was unable to attend the meeting with the First Dragon God and the rest of the Dragon Generals due to her pregnancy but Laplace, who was her substitute on the meeting informs her that he is assigned to look for Crystal's killer to which Dora asks her to bring the head of the criminal.

Laplace visits Dora after capturing Crystal's killer and apologizes for the delay of the report and that he did not bring his head but Dora doesn't mind then asks him to name hers and Crystal's child to which Laplace names him
Perugius
.

Dora attends the meeting at the Dragon God's mansion where Laplace and
Szilard
 give their reports, and confirm that the criminal Laplace has captured is
Necrolia Nacrolia
, and his reasons for killing Crystal. Although Dora looks calm, the rest of the Dragon Generals knows that Dora is enraged and they all urge the Dragon God to declare war on the Demon World but the Dragon God choose to negotiate with them. When the Dragon God bestows Laplace with the title Demon Dragon King and Crystal's successor as Dragon General, Dora is shocked but welcomes Laplace like the most of the Dragon Generals.

When the Dragon God's child is born, even the dragons that are ongoing training with Dora is treated well that lasted for decades and like the rest of the Dragon Generals, Dora is also impressed by the child and left with a solemn expression.

After Lunaria's death and funeral, Dora gives her list of suspects which is the same as the rest of the Dragon General and is also present when the
Human God
 reveals the plot of the other worlds against the Dragon God. Dora and the rest of the Dragon Generals accompanies the First Dragon God who goes to war against the Beast God, Sea God and  Sky God resulting to their deaths then the destruction of their respective worlds.

Drain Syndrome
==============

Drain Syndrome
is an ancient disease that affects those with too little mana capacity, which
Nanahoshi
 had due to the nature of her body.

Background

"Drain Syndrome eh? That name sure is nostalgic. People still getting sick from that, now that's shocking!"

-Kishirika Kishirisu

Drain Syndrome had existed in the
Human World
 ever since its early ages especially on children. Drain Syndrome was eventually eradicated around 7,000 years ago during the first
Human-Demon Wars
 at the reign of Demon Empress
Kishirika Kishirisu
. The war caused all kinds of advancements for
Humans
 such as increase in their mana capacity, which in turn made them immune to Drain Syndrome. As such, information and written records about the illness is very scarce during the present day, and some consider finding the disease's name to be a miracle in ancient libraries such as in
Perugius Dola
's Flying Fortress
.

Cause

Drain Syndrome is a disease that occurs when a human with little or no
Mana
 capacity externally accumulates mana over time, until their body begins to react negatively to it. It usually takes around 10 years to happen for children. In other words, it's a disease that results from having mana within body that is incapable of holding mana. Despite the Humans that are born in the Human World are already immune to it for the past 7000 years, Drain Syndrome still affects those that have drifted to the Human World like Nanahoshi.

When the patient's body is no longer able to handle the mana absorbed, they exhibit symptoms of frequent coughing that gets more severe over time, to the point of coughing blood, collapsing and losing consciousness. The affected patient would have a pale complexion and dark circles under their eyes while bedridden, and would eventually die unless treated
.

Treatment

"Don't be mistaken. As guests of my castle, I'll offer some minimum assistance. But don't expect everything. My ultimate purpose is to find and destroy Laplace."

-Perugius





Recovering Nanahoshi with Sokasu Tea



Drain Syndrome has no permanent cure and it does not work even with the use of Healing Magic or Detoxification Magic. Otherwise, Drain Syndrome's sickness can temporarily be cured by drinking tea made from Sokasu Grass, which removes the Mana that accumulated in their body through their waste.

The unique power of Perugius' familiars can also be used as a temporary treatment such as Yuruzu of Atonement's power of transfer the health and vitality from one person to the patient. Sukeakoto of Time's power to stop time can also be used but because the patient's time is stopped no further research on the cure can be done and ultimately Sokasu Tea is the best treatment.

Talhand, a male Dwarf in the Anime

1/2

Dwarves
 (
炭鉱族
,
Dowaafu
, lit. "Coal Mine Tribe") are a race of people who currently live at the foot of the Blue Dragon Mountain Range in the
Millis Continent
.

Background

Due to the Dwarves being created during the
Age of Chaos
, they are sometimes classified as a
Demon Race
.
 When the
Human World
 change from a world of endless grass lands to a world that has the terrain features of the rest of the
Six-Faced World
 due to the war of the
First Dragon God
 with the rest of the world, the Dwarves chose to settle at the foot of the Blue Dragon Mountain Range in the Millis Continent like other
Races
 who settled in the terrain that is close to their previous world while the Humans and Demons are at a ceaseless conflict for dominance of the Human World.

Trait

Dwarves are shorter in height compared to Humans

Male Dwarves have a stout body constitution while female dwarves are similar to young female humans

Dwarves have a longer lifespan compared to humans where some of them have lived since the
Laplace War
 from 400 to 500 years ago

As a race of craftsmen and blacksmiths by birth, dwarves have naturally dexterous hands and high affinity towards earth and fire magic

Known Dwarves

Talhand

Juliette

Godbard

Balda

Pyi Ku

--To be added

Culture

Depending on the settlement, dwarves vary culture wise. Like in the Dwarf Village in the Millis Continent, dwarves would raise all children of the same generation together like a school, and they would treat each other as siblings.

Dwarves especially the adults, consider Water and Wind Magic worthless and refuses to acknowledge it due to tradition and formality which Talhand begins to practice and eventually becoming an outcast and leaving the Dwarf Village.

Dwarf Children don't get an official name until they are seven years old, and when they do, they receive a name that's fashioned after something they're good at, something they're attracted to, or something they like(eg. Balda the Hammer for his tendency to use his hammer to fix things or use it on his underling for making a mistake). Until then they are referred to as "child of (Father's name) and (Mother's Name).

Edward Anemoi Asura
===================

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Edward Anemoi Asura
 is the son of
Ariel Anemoi Asura
 and a Prince of the Asura Kingdom.

Appearance

Edward is an unquestionably handsome guy from every angle. He has a well defined nose, with slightly drooping eyes and unique platinum blonde hair that one can never get tired of looking.

Personality

Edward is callous and has a cold personality in general. He is playfully teasing of people he's genuinely interested in, such as
Christina Greyrat
, and will go out of his way to help them despite some sarcasm. He cannot be bothered to care about people he is not interested in.
 He is a straightforward and honest person when it comes to his beloved, as he was upfront with Rudeus Greyrat when confronted about Edward's relationship with his daughter.

Plot

Redundancy

Edward is a friend of
Christina Greyrat
. After berating his ex-fiancee Viola Yellowsnake and disowning her, Edward takes on the position as the next valedictorian of the Asura Royal Academy graduation ceremony. However, he relegates the position to Christina who is more deserving of it. Edward plans to become a diplomat for the Royal Family in the Northern Lands, the direction of the Three Great Magical Nations.

Later, Edward tries to pester Christina to introduce him to her father,
Rudeus Greyrat
. After telling Rudeus what Christina told him about Rudeus' habits at home, Rudeus questions what is his relationship with Christina, to which he asks for his permission to date Christina with intent of marriage. Rudeus, finding no excuse to refuse, invites him to talk alone for a while, albeit somewhat reluctant. In the end, Edward receives Rudeus' permission to date Christina.

Achievements

De-factor valedictorian behind his Asura Royal Academy graduation ceremony

Diplomat for Asura Royal Family in the Northern Lands, in the direction of the Three Great Magical Nations

Quotes

"In the future, I will be involved in diplomacy. I cannot marry someone who calls a foreign dignitary a country bumpkin in public! I am breaking off our engagement!"

"Yes! However, Mother, there is someone more suitable to be our representative than I am. That person is someone who has saved many students and even turned former enemies into allies... a person who embodies the ideals of the Asura Royal Academy."

Rudeus:
"Okay, so what's your relationship with Chris like?"

Edward:
"I would like to have a relationship with Chris with the intention of getting married."

Trivia

It is implied that
Luke Greyrat
 may be Edward's biological father, as his physical description is similar to that of Luke's when he was introduced to Rudeus.

Edward dating and possibly marrying Christina Greyrat fulfills Rudeus' and Ariel's former agreement of a consensual arranged marriage between their families. Previously, Ariel tried to do this with Sariel and
Sieg Greyrat
, to no avail.

If you find a good man, you better not let him get away. You have to use your upper lips as well as your lower lips so he doesn't get away.

Elinalise, to
Roxy Migurdia
 and previously to
Zenith Greyrat

Elinalise Dragonroad
 (
エリナリーゼ・ドラゴンロード
,

Erinarīze Doragonrōdo
)
 is a former member of
Paul
's party, cursed with an affliction that forces her to regularly have sexual intercourse. Following the
Teleport Incident
, she helped
Roxy
 search for
Rudeus
' family and later joined him at the
Ranoa Magic Academy
, where she fell in love with
Cliff
 after he found a remedy for her
curse
.

Appearance






Elinalise in Volume 5



Like many of her race, Elinalise is shown to be a beautiful and youthful-looking elf of 200+ years. She often sports white-blonde hair in heavily defined ringlets. In body, she has a curvy figure with small breasts, wide hips and shapely legs. Her eyes are a light reddish-brown and she sported the signature pointy ears, customary of all elf kind. She sported black shorts and frilled stockings that ran up to the mid-thigh. In addition to this, she wore gold-colored bands around her forearms and her top was of a small red and white corset and is always seen in her battle attire with her Estoc and Buckler.

Personality

Elinalise is erotic, lustful, and carefree. She does however possess somewhat of a maiden's heart. She is aware of the reputation her promiscuity creates and is conscientious of it regarding the children and grandchildren she has - for example, she tended to be aloof towards her granddaughter Sylphiette as to keep her granddaughter from being affected by her reputation. After
Cliff
 says that he will try his hardest to remove her curse, she falls in love with him and tries to remain faithful to him as much as possible. Though he allows her to continue sleeping with other men until he creates a garment to help surpass it; afterwards, Elinalise convinces him to finally consummate their romance (having starving for him in her heart, rather than carnally like other men).

She notably never tried to seduce
Rudeus
 when they traveled; largely because of the erectile dysfunction caused by his
Eris
 trauma and hating the idea of becoming family with
Paul
. Though she did
beg
 him to stop at towns, so she could sleep around to sate her curse.

Background

She was found over 200 years ago in a Magic Crystal inside of a Labyrinth by
Perugius
. She had no memory of who she was. She was taken to a Elf town where she would eventually recover and get married. As a side effect of being in a Magic Crystal, she became cursed to need sex. The sperm of the men would fertilize the Magic Crystals inside of her. She would then give those crystals to her husband to sell. One day, while leaving the village to sell the crystals, he was robbed and killed. Five days later, she started attacking men who didn't mind having sex with her. After doing this a few times, the women of the village kicked her out. She worked as a prostitute for a while until then she became an adventurer.

She joined Paul's party
Fangs of the Black Wolf
 as a warrior. Following the departure of Paul and
Zenith
 from the party, the group was then disbanded.

Plot






Elinalise with Roxy and Tallhand heading to the Demon Continent



After the
Teleport Incident
, Elinalise accepted
Paul's
 request of finding his family without him knowing. Together with
Roxy
 and
Talhand
, they began a journey throughout the
Demon Continent
 in search of Paul's family.

After Roxy learns the location of Zenith, they part ways where Roxy and Tallhand heads to
Millishion
 to inform Paul while Elinalise finds
Rudeus
 and informs him as well. She also urges him to live his own life and joins him on his travels to the
Magic Academy
. She sees the Academy as a great place to meet men. She eventually meets and falls in love with
Cliff
.

During the wedding reception of Rudeus and
Sylphiette
, Elinalise congratulated them but she suddenly fell in tears. Sylphiette asks her if she is her grandmother which shocks Rudeus and Cliff while Elinalise tried to denies it initially, she eventually admits it and would also take turns on fulfilling Sylphiette's bodyguard duties.

After saving
Zenith
 with Rudeus, she eventually marries Cliff and has a child with him.

Power and Abilities






Elinalise tanking Tarantula Deathlords in the Anime



An experienced adventurer who was able to naturally avoid monster swarms on the way to
Begaritto
. Although her power is described as a bit low by Rudeus and
Atofe
, that's only in comparison to people like
Ghislaine
 or
Zanoba
. She is also described by Rudeus after his first quest with her as first class, suiting her S-class rank. Rudeus also thought she could "go solo" as an adventurer if she wanted. She is a skillful
Tank
 and has good aggro ability and compensates for her lack of power with magic items like her estoc that releases vacuum blades or the gladius she picked up in Lapan that releases shock-waves. She is also very agile as even Atofe compliments her on her footwork after she manages to block her counterattack.

Magic






Elinalise using Ice Smash against Manatite Hydra



Elinalise had to repeat her 3rd year because the Begaritt Labyrinth incident took her away for 6 months. She drops out after getting pregnant. Since the first two years of the
Ranoa's
 curriculum teach elementary magic in the four types of offensive magic plus detoxification and healing, it can be presumed that she is able to do at least that. She is also shown to be able to cast elementary Water Magic against Manatite Hydra.

Curse

Elinalise is afflicted with a curse inherited from being trapped in a labyrinth magic crystal. This curse causes mana to accumulate within her body, which must be crystallized through receiving a male’s sperm. If she fails to receive it, the mana bulges too dangerously within her, ultimately leading to her death. As a result, she produces a mana crystal once per month.

During pregnancy, her condition can be temporarily subsided as the mana flowed into the unborn child instead, eliminating the need for sexual intercourse to avoid death. As result, her children born inherit exceptionally high mana capacity without exception. Thanks to Cliff’s research, a magical device was devised that suppressed the curse—allowing her to go over a year without intercourse by the time Cliff graduated. Because the device requires a high amount of magic power,
Rudeus
 has to charge it himself.

Equipment

Estoc






Elinalise's equipment in the Game



Elinalise wields a thorn-like Estoc, a silver double edge straight sword with a thin blade that she uses elegant techniques matching her extravagant appearance. An Estoc is not a weapon an adventurer normally carries since it is used in duels between nobles of the
Asura Kingdom
 or used with armor in the sword city in the far north. But the Estoc that Elinalise uses is a
Magic Item
 that was found deep within a maze which is far sturdier than normal swords and with a single swing, it can fire off a vacuum that can cut down a tree several meters ahead.

Buckler






Elinalise using her Buckler to bash Manatite Hydra's head



Elinalise also uses a brown buckler with a silver cross which is also a magic item that holds the ability to soften the impact of blows it receives which makes Elinalise a formidable frontliner of her party to distract enemies.

Gladius

Rudeus using the Gladius to release a Shock Wave upon piercing
1/2

Because of her Estoc being inconvenient against armored monsters in the
Teleportation Labyrinth
, Elinalise purchased a one handed Gladius, another Magic Item that releases a Shock Wave when it pierces something. Although the damage is not high, it can be used in an instant to send an opponent flying backwards to make some distance. Because of the ability's practical use it has a high purchase price that Elinalise paid with several magic crystals.

Trivia

In the alternate reality where Roxy is killed by the
Human God
, after Cliff is killed, she leaves Rudeus and is never seen again, presumably to go back to being an adventurer.

It was previously observed that she carries a lot of magic crystals and by trading and selling them, she seems to never run into any financial problems. This is probably due to her curse by which she transforms sperm into magic crystals.

She laments about her past as a prostitute and promiscuousness as she believes that this may affect the opinion of others about her descendants (
Sylphy
) and that's why she tries to hide any relationship with them.

She becomes Roxy's teacher in sexual techniques, something that bothered Sylphy since Elinalise never wanted to teach her anything.

Despite the fact that Cliff managed to create an artifact (panties) that stops the curse for up to a year, her libido doesn't drop, requesting that Cliff fulfill his marital duties daily. Possibly due to her body having grown used to being carnally hungry for so many years.

It is implied that her true identity might be Laplace's servant Rostelina, who was sealed in a magic crystal to condition her into a vessel that could resupply
Orsted
 with mana
.

Even if I learn the A B C's of love

I can't obtain it

An exhausted colony from battle, I want you

(If you do) I am not afraid of anything

(If you will) leave it up to me

I want to destroy, I want to destroy it if it's for you

Impure or paradox, I don't care at all

I want to protect it,

The only thing I want to protect is you who taught me everything

Eyes for eyes, sharpen your fangs

I can't tell you my feelings, but

If you show your sad face, you lose

I want to be honest

(If you do) the future that's ok to lose

(If you will) I don't want it from the beginning

I want to destroy, I want to destroy if it's for you

Out of orders or paradox, I don't care at all

I want to hide

The only thing I want to hide is the tears I shed when I decide to carry everything on my back

The world that seems to be stretched

Is it for you? Is it for me?

I still don't know, what's behind this feeling

I want to destroy, I want to destroy

If I can't go back

I want to keep holding you tighter even more

Even if I get rid of the kindness I can't forget

The feeling is overflowing, and it's making me sad

I won't run away, I won't run away from this dilemma

Out of order or paradox, I don't care at all

I want to protect it,

The only thing I want to protect is you who taught me everything

Madobe de miteita sora to kono sora wa onajina no ka

Is the sky I was lookin through the window

The same as this sky?

Twilight seems to be gaining color

To read my mind

In the place where we tuck our pure days

The wind is blowing like it's calling us

City and people

Don't let them change

Let them stay as I dreamed

On the way back home

I wish upon the first start like that day

A nightmare instead of an alarm clock

I woke up crying in the morning

Remembering the warmth of my mother

A blank space after coming home

Let it be filled with this nostalgic scene

City, people and dreams

They are changing every minute

That's why we can get stronger

Go beyond a pathless road

I learn that no matter what kind of color it is now

The sky will become beautiful someday

I came home

If I close my eyes

There are cities, people and dreams every minute

It's changing, like a river keeps flowing without stopping

When I close my eyes

The unchanging scenery is always there

Right by our side

Colored by memories,

If you were to see my blushing cheeks,

Even this hidden feeling might reach you

Though I have abandoned my timid heart,

In front of you, since that day,

My feelings remain unchanged

I've been waiting just as I am

When the dots connect,

Let me stay in your heart

Embracing the unfilled gaps

Even if I fumble in love,

I can warm you up

I can't compete with you,

Who can do anything and everything

But little by little, I kept walking,

Trying to get closer to you

Though you are right in front of me,

In a distance I still can't touch,

I won't just stand by and let anyone take you away

I've stopped merely watching

Before the dots connect,

If I can truly connect with you,

It doesn't matter where or who I am

If I'm going to spend a cold night,

I just want to warm you up

Every time I think of you,

Whom I can't forget,

I gain strength just from that

By meeting you again,

I seem to have become greedy

Finding the unchanging me

Hidden deep in your eyes

When the dots connect,

Let me stay in your heart

Embracing the unfilled gaps

Even if I fumble in love,

I can warm you up

Because I can only warm you up,

Now and in the future

manga adaptation

Cover Characters

Rudeus Greyrat

Ghislaine Dedoldia

Summary

After Rudeus informs Ghislaine of his idea for a day off from studies, the two escort Eris on a shopping spree in town the next day. Still needing to explain the need for reprieve, Ghislaine still can't understand Eris was just gaining stress from continuous studies. While Rudeus also advises Ghislaine take a break, he's happy that he too can have a day off. Later, Rudeus was planning to do some independent reading, but saw Eris running off during an etiquette lesson with Miss Edna, which lead to her pleading Rudeus to encourage Eris take in her studies.

Finding her in a stable, she kicks him in the head and tells him she refuses to continue being forced into scenarios she doesn't feel comfortable with. Hearing her words, and remembering his brothers in his old life, Rudeus shares how he once gave up on things midway and regretted the choice. So he advises that she continue, so that she'll feel a sense of accomplishment having done so in hindsight. Once she sees his point, Rudeus asks she return to her dance lessons- while positioned directly atop her. Kicking him off her, she agrees to go back to her dance lessons and demands Rudeus accompany her.

There, while Rudeus does superb, he figures out a trick to help her step to the rhythm of the dancing. With a blindfold and using claps, he has her mimic feint maneuvers like her lessons with Ghislaine, saying go as the "feint" and the claps being the "attacks". With that, Eris flawlessly danced, and Rudeus reminds her that she can incorporate lessons from subject into another. When Edna inquires how Rudeus reached his solution, his explanation of sword arts using dance astounds her and Rudeus discovers this world has no sword dancing arts. Earning praise from Edna, Eris also voices her amazement at Rudeus's ability, with them looking forward to Eris dancing at her 10th birthday celebration. At the celebration, Rudeus is among the crowd and is impressed by Eris's arrival,

As expected of Rudeus.

— Eris, on several occasions

Eris Greyrat
 (
エリス・グレイラット
,

Erisu Gureiratto
)
, born
Eris Boreas Greyrat
 (
エリス・ボレアス・グレイラット
,

Erisu Boreasu Gureiratto
)
, is a noble girl and second cousin of
Rudeus
. She is a Character with a short temper but has potential in the
Sword God Style
.
 During her journey to return home following the
Teleport Incident
, she grows to love Rudeus.

Appearance

She is pointed to be beautiful with long red hair, red eyes and nice figure. She also has swords around her waist on both the left and right sides.

At the end of the Decisive Battle Chapter, she has streaks of white in her hair due to
mana
 strain.

Personality

Upon meeting Rudeus, Eris was contemptuous, impulsive, defiant, and condescending; she is also short tempered and prone to violent outbursts. It's implied that her attitude is a direct influence of her grandfather,
Sauros
.

During her time with Rudeus, she still maintains her violent tendencies but has greatly changed after her tenth birthday and will resort to violence to anyone who holds negative emotions and/or intentions against Rudeus. However, despite the outer aggressiveness, Eris also has a high level of shyness, often hitting Rudeus for touching her suddenly even though she does the same to him. She and Rudeus have a mutual inferiority complex where both would assume the other is more wonderful than themselves, easily leading to misunderstandings which also causes her to leave Rudeus to go train in the Holy Land of Swords to be on equal standing with Rudeus.

During her time on the Holy Land of Swords, Eris became taciturn and uncaring as she obsessively trains to become stronger while recalling the memories of her defeat from
Orsted
 and the sight of Rudeus in a near dead state. She also does not interact nor talk with with almost anyone unless its a topic about Rudeus until she trains together with
Nina
 and
Isolte Cruel
.

Eris gets excited easily on seeing things she have never seen before like the Migurd Village houses that uses giant turtle shells as roof tops in the
Demon Continent
.
 When Eris enters the Chaos Breaker, she raises her voice in amazement upon seeing how small the village is from the sky causing
Sylvaril
 to take an immediate liking to her upon seeing Eris' carefree smile and offers to guide her around the castle.

Originally, she had a tendency to constantly release blood lust, but she later controls it after years of training at the Holy Land of Swords. She is named the 'Mad Dog' or Mad Sword King due to her personality of bearing fangs at anyone for a period of time and is noted to be 'free'. She also has a high libido (she beat Rudeus in bed), often attacking Rudeus but it was later toned down after aging.

Background

Her full name is Eris Boreas Greyrat. The Boreas was one of the great noble families in the
Asura Kingdom
 who rules the
Fittoa Region
. Her behavior prior to meeting Rudeus was uncontrollable and violent. She was considered a failure as a noble. After the Teleport Incident, she was accompanied by Rudeus and
Ruijerd
 on her way to the
Central Continent
. Sometime after starting her training in the Holy Land of Swords she relinquished her Boreas name.

Back then, her biggest influences were
Sauros Boreas Greyrat
 and
Ghislaine Dedoldia
. Her family was also known to have a beast race fetish.






Eris meeting Gal in the Holy Land of Swords



When Eris arrives at the Holy Land of Swords,
Gal
 took interest in her potential in the sword to cut down Orsted, a dream he also shares despite Eris calling him a small fry that Gal laughs off in amusement. After defeating
Jino Britts
 and Nina, Eris fights Gal and gets immediately knocked back by Gal's
Battle Aura
 causing her body to fly outside, smashing
down the gate in the process, and smacked into a pile of snow. Gal then tells Ghislaine to tend to Eris' wounds and bestows her with Saint Rank of the
Sword God Style
 and personally foresee her training.






Eris training in the Manga



For the next six months, Eris trains and swings her sword on a peninsula located north of the dojo that she found after an hour of walking to avoid interference from other students. During this time, Gal's instructs her to keep swing her sword until she gets tired, sit and think while resting and when she is tired of resting go back to swing her sword. Otherwise she eats when she's hungry and go back to her room to sleep when she is sleepy.






Eris releasing her bloodlust and attacks Auber



One day after returning from her sword practice,
Auber Corvette
 is standing in her way to the dojo and she tells him to move before Auber can finish his sentence eventually causing Eris to release a huge amount of bloodlust and a fight ensues. Despite losing her sword during their fight, Eris continues to attack causing Auber to get a chill on his spine and realizes he needs to kill this beast to stop her, but Gal stops the fight. Eris collapses on the snow breathing heavily and frustrated, and then Auber mentions to Gal that it is his first time meeting such a serious swordsman and realizes she is the Mad Dog that Gal mentioned. Eris stands up swaying like a ghost causing Auber to ready his sword upon seeing this, but Eris just glares at him and returns to her room to rest. One year later, Eris becomes a North Saint with Auber's training.

This is the current achievement that Eris gained through her adventure, action, and training:

Quotes

Orsted:
 "Eris Boreas Greyrat, huh? Is he that important to you? Someone who isn't Luke."

Eris:
 ".....Luke?"

Orsted:
 "The man fated to become your husband."

Eris:
 "I don't know anything about that."

Orsted:
 "It seems so."

Eris:
 "I'm fine with waiting. I'll attack together with Rudeus."

Orsted:
 "... That's surprising. Eris Boreas Greyrat will fight together with her companions. Is this also a part of your madness? Certainly, if Eris Boreas Greyrat held a little more judgement, if she were to study under a suitable master, I see... So this is what happens?"

Eris:
 "I'm no longer a part of Boreas. It's just Eris Greyrat."

Orsted:
 "The Eris I know, is a different person, is she..."

Aisha:
 "Huh, but, Eris-ane is the one wearing red."

Eris:
 "What, you don't want to match with me?!"

Aisha:
 "No, that's not it. I shouldn't attract that much attention because I'm an assistant. Shouldn't Eris-ane stand out more?"

Eris:
 "You're not an assistant! As my younger sister, wear something good!"

Eris to Atofe:
 "Get away."

Atofe:
 "Who the hell are you?"

Eris:
 "Eris Greyrat."

Eris:
 "Fight me! Demon Lord Atofe, get down here!"

Eris:
 "Rudeus, catch Lucy for me. She hates baths. Even though earlier she said that she needs to take a bath since she was sweating during sword practice." I caught Lucy. Sorry, Lucy. However, you need to take a bath after exercising.

Lucy:
 "I don't wanna! Red-mama's violent!"

Rudeus:
 "Violent? Eris… Hitting me is one thing, but you shouldn't hit children."

Eris:
 "How rude, I don't hit her! I'm just a little… bad at washing hair." So that's it. When I look at Lucy, she puffed out her cheeks and grumbled,

Lucy:
 "Yeah, when Red-mama washes my hair, stuff gets in my eyes and it hurts."

Trivia

Eris is the Goddess of War in the religion Rudeus has created. A wooden sword is currently taking the place as her symbol and is enshrined in the basement.

Eris name possibly comes from Greek mythology that is the Greek
goddess of chaos, strife, and discord
. Her name is the equivalent of Latin
Discordia
, which means "discord". Eris's Greek opposite is
Harmonia
, whose Latin counterpart is
Concordia
. Homer equated her with the war-goddess
Enyo
, whose Roman counterpart is
Bellona
. The dwarf planet Eris is named after the goddess, as is the religion Discordianism. Other names also come from Greek mythology like Anemoi, Boreas, Zephyrus.

When Eris left Rudeus after their first time together, she left her panties and stole a pair of Rudeus' underwear. While in his depression-like state, Rudeus threw Eris' panties into a heating stove.

In some previous loops where Rudeus didn't exist,
Luke
 courts Eris and eventually the pair get married. In that timeline, Eris only has the potential of Sword Saint.

In Orsted's previous loops, Eris is known as Red Lion instead of Mad Dog/Mad Sword King who also the second person needed for
Ariel Anemoi Asura
 to become queen and along with Luke as her bodyguard would fight off numerous assassination attempts on Ariel and paving the way for Ariel's ascent to the
Asura Kingdom
's queen.

Like
Paul Greyrat
, Eris is the second character in the story to relinquish her name and nobility status.

Rudeus once referred to her as his Husband when he thought
Zanoba
 might be confessing to him because in their relationship, Eris is the more sexually aggressive one and she made him feel like a maiden in love. While he gives arm pillows to his other wives, he would get one from Eris.

Eris became the husband after she defeated Rudeus in bed on their first wedding night. Rudeus dominated the battle until his physique allowed it but Eris' stamina overcame him and he accepted his defeat happily at the end.

Eris considers that she is only good at 2 things: with the sword and at sex.

While Rudeus has a Harem consisting of his wives, Rudeus considers himself a part of Eris' Harem, which consists of himself along with
Linia
 and
Pursena
.

Even though Eris is quite wild in bed she is very shy about showing this to other people. Rudeus suffered a lot to convince her to do a foursome.

Like all who have descended from the Boreas Greyrat Household, Eris has inherited a love for Beast Girls. In addition, she also is fond of dogs and cats, possibly an extension to the inherited trait.

Despite being very jealous even with Rudeus' other wives, she has no problem with Rudeus sleeping with a slave (Linia), due to the teachings of her family although Rudeus refused Eris' offer to sleep with Linia since he considers it a betrayal of his wives.

Even though she learned language, math, science, and etiquette in her childhood, she forgot all of them later on and can only read easier words.

Out of all of Rudeus's wives, Eris is the only one with large breasts. Because his other wives all had very small breasts, she and many others mistakenly assumed he only liked small breasts.

Eris dies at the age of 74. Despite her age, she was still training very energetically, one day after her morning run and after practicing with her sword, she returned home tired and collapsed in bed, then passed away from old age.

They were kidnapped by men who were planning to sell them off, but Rudeus was able to thwart their plans and save both of them.

Seeing Rudeus' magic, Eris was inspired to learn and accept him as her tutor. Later under the guidance of Rudeus, she manages to somehow control herself a bit, and she was able to pick up many different skills and improve her magic.

Physical Abilities





Eris battling assassins in the Anime



Rudeus considers Eris a prodigy in terms of raw talent. Through out her life, Eris is trained by prominent people in the sword, mainly in the Sword God Style by
Ghislaine
 in her youth, by
Ruijerd Superdia
 after the
Teleport Incident
 and in North God and Water God Styles during her time at the Holy Land of Swords. Because of this, Eris possess physical prowess, speed and endurance capable of fighting multiple enemies regardless of their swordsmanship rank. Eris is also very nimble and agile, being able to do acrobatic moves and jump at heights twice or more then her height which makes her an unpredictable enemy on where she can attack.

Sword God Style





Longsword of Silence



Sword God Gal Farion took interest in training Eris after hearing her intent to cut down the Dragon God, a dream that they both share. After completing her training in the Holy Land of Swords, Eris has attained Sword King rank. When she became Sword King, Gal Farion offered her the chance to challenge him to become Sword God, an opportunity that not even Ghislaine was given when she first became Sword King. Eris' talent was so greatly recognized by Gal Farion that if Eris actually wished to, Gal Farion would have allowed her to become Sword Emperor by fighting Ghislaine who was also a Sword King. Eris declined, but in recognition of her skill, she was awarded "Sword Mastery" -- a title that had never been bestowed to the current Sword Emperors and Sword Kings.

North God Style

On her first few years in the Holy Land of Swords, Eris is trained by
Auber Corvette
 the North Emperor in the North God Style. After one year, Eris reached the rank of North Saint.

Superd Bloodlust Technique






Eris releasing Bloodlust in the Manga



Ruijerd taught Eris a high-level
Superd
 technique to unleash her bloodlust (also known as killing intent) like using her gaze to provoke her opponents. This release of bloodlust caused her opponent to sense violent emotions as if they are encountering a monster on the roadside when they see Eris, which causes even
Reida Reia
 to have goosebumps on their first meeting and almost reflexively draw her sword which is unusual for a Water God Style user to attack first.

Presence Search






Eris searching for the presence of other adventurers



Ruijerd also taught Eris how to search for the presence of others by staying still which allows her to perceive sound, her surroundings and even the flow of
Mana
. Eris practices this everyday that she is able to sense even the faintly audible sound of weapons clashing from afar.

Sauros Boreas Greyrat

When Rudeus first meets Eris, Sauros is among the few people Eris likes and obeys while Sauros in turn spoils her and grants her requests no matter how unreasonable it is. After seeing how Eris has changed under Rudeus' guidance, Sauros grants Eris' request who has not made any unreasonable request in a while to have the

Rudeus is Eris' childhood teacher and later husband. In
Volume 2
, he taught her arithmetic, beginner level fire magic, and reading and writing. Eris is initially hostile to Rudeus and would also be violent towards him but throughout the duration of their time spent together in the
Citadel of Roa
, Eris would become less feral and warm up to
Rudeus
. After Eris' 10th birthday, Eris is able to successfully complete dancing through Rudeus' method and would openly praise him and also imitate his manners which also noticed by Eris' family that
Philip Boreas Greyrat
, sends a letter to
Paul Greyrat
 for an arranged marriage between them
 and Eris would later arrange a party for Rudeus' 10th birthday.

After the
Teleport Incident
, Rudeus and Eris are teleported to the
Demon Continent
 and begins to travel with
Ruijerd
 where they established the
Dead End
 party but deep down inside, she is afraid that Rudeus might abandon her so she strives to become stronger and the two get closer but this fear still lingers throughout their journey. Around this time, she developed a close bond with Rudeus and even developed romantic feelings for him and believes that as long as she is with Rudeus, they can do anything and everything will be alright.

But after
Orsted defeats their party effortlessly
, and witnessing Rudeus nearly die before her, she developed an inferiority complex from feeling helpless until they return to Roa where she learns that Sauros, Philip and Hilda have died and the remaining Boreas Family refuses to adopt her. Feeling Rudeus is all she have left, she spent the night with Rudeus and lost her virginity but realizes afterwards that she must become strong wants to stand beside Rudeus as equals and asks Ghislaine to bring her to the
Holy Land of Swords
 to train in the Sword God Style while the memory of feeling helpless as Rudeus nearly died still in her mind as she trains to cut down Orsted and hopes that she will meet Rudeus again. Her sudden departure caused a big misunderstanding between the two in which he thought that Eris left him due to his subpar bed skills. It led to his severe depression and impotence until he was cured by to
Sylphiette
's "comforting" actions.

Eventually, Rudeus met his
future self
, who warned him about the murderous tragedy that would befall on everyone he cared about, including his families and Eris. Future Rudeus gave his diary to Rudeus, which allowed Rudeus to send Eris a letter in this timeline. Future Rudeus advised Rudeus to be careful and to not expose
Hitogami
's true intentions to his allies. Rudeus sent Eris a letter expressing that he was receptive with accepting Eris into his family, and that he was going to challenge Orsted. The result was that Orsted joined Rudeus's side to fight against Hitogami in the future. Eris would eventually get the letter and come to his aid. After the battle, in which Rudeus lost: they would get married and Eris would have two children,
Ars Greyrat
 and
Christina Greyrat.

After getting married, Eris continues to accompany Rudeus as his bodyguard while doing missions for Orsted except when she is pregnant. When Rudeus fondles her breasts, she would occasionally punch him in the face and when it comes to raising children, Eris would usually discipline them while Rudeus will simply talk to them when they misbehave.

Eris angry at Paul in the Anime



Paul:"What's this Rudi, hiding behind a woman, you've become quite the lady-killer haven't you?"
Eris:"Rudeus isn't hiding behind me! I'm hiding Rudeus! From a worthless father!"

After the reunion of Rudeus and Paul at
Millishion
 resulting with Rudeus being depressed, Eris is angry at Paul when she is told what happened. When Paul visits Rudeus again, Eris stops him from approaching and is about to attack Paul until Ruijerd stops her and brings her out of the inn.
 Paul later gives the money of 20 Royal Notes (1 million Yen) to Rudeus given by the
Boreas Family
 to search for missing members like Eris so he can bring Eris back to the
Citadel of Roa
. Paul also reveals that Philip plans that Rudeus will be married into the Boreas Family with Eris as his wife prior to the Teleport Incident.

In volume 20 of the light novel, it is made clear that Goblin-like moustros reside on the continent of Milis, but the manga shows how some live on the continent of central, a small mistake of the Spin Off.  During the same volume Rudeus has an internal monologue about how Goblins would possibly be considered demons because of their primitive life, if they lived in the central continent.

Eris The Goblin Slayer
======================

Eris The Goblin Slayer
 (エリスのゴブリン討伐
Eris no Goblin Tōbatsu
) is the first OVA of the
Mushoku Tensei
 anime series to be released on March 16, 2022 along with the Bluray version of Volume 4.

Synopsis

While Rudeus reunites with his father in
Millishion
, Eris sets out to fulfill her dream of slaying
goblins
. While at the Adventures’ Guild, however, she encounters
Cliff
, a conceited young mage who threatens to spoil her adventure.

Plot

A short scene gives clues on clues of a young boy's birth, the death of his parents, and his subsequent adoption by a powerful church figure.

In present time,
Eris
 leisurely explores Millishion while
Ruijerd
 is secretly watching over her. She sees signs of discrimination against
Demons
. In the Adventure Guild, she accepts a mission to slay goblins but also stops some adventurers from picking a fight with
Cliff
. However, when he calls her ugly, she beats him up.

Eris goes on with his mission with Cliff tagging along, but his
Exodus Flame
 damages the goblin ears needed for the mission. Eris, annoyed by this, tells Cliff to go back, but he manages to convince her to hunt more goblins at the forest.

At the forest, they get lost, and Eris uses her ability to sense nearby people. What they found was an assassination attempt by the
Pope Faction
 against a
young girl
 protected by knight of the
Order of the Temple
. Eris dispatches the assassins and Cliff is smitten. The surviving knight is
Therese
 and we learn that Cliff belongs to the Pope Faction.

Back at Millishion, Cliff confesses to Eris, but gets rejected and realizes he stands no chance against her feelings for Rudeus and goes home depressed. Eris returns to Rudeus and finds him upset after his fight with Paul. Cliff sits in his room, thinking about Rudeus.

Cover Characters

Rudeus Greyrat

Sylphiette

Summary

After Rudeus discovers that Sylph is a girl and her full name is Sylphiette, he acts rather awkwardly with her until she tells him that he only need act normal. Given his definition of "normal", Rudeus tones it down further just in case. After that event, Paul mocks Rudeus for confusing Sylphie with a boy. When he tries to give tips of how to get cute girl, a gardening Zenith reprimands him until Lilia appears to stop her due to her two-months along pregnancy. As everyone is happy with the news, Lilia suddenly vomits in front of them. Lilia announced that she is also pregnant, Rudeus unsurprisingly looks to Paul, who confesses to the family that he may be the father, to which Zenith slaps him. In a family meeting, Zenith asks of Lilia's plans after having her baby, and Lilia aims to help Zenith's childbirth before leaving after having her own baby. With Zenith unconfortable with this, Rudeus forms a plan knowing that Paul was at fault, as well as how Zenith and Lilia already have a long friendship for over six years. Acting innocent, Rudeus asks why everyone is upset when he's going to be having two sisters, and leads to a conclusion that Paul threatened Lilia because he knew "her weakness". He draws a conclusion that all fault lay with Paul, exonerating Lilia of blame. Thus Zenith, moved by her son's words, decides to let Lilia stay; much to the maid's surprised joy.

Around Rudeus' seventh birthday, his sisters Norn and Aisha are born healthy, while his mentoring Sylphy has her really progress in the past couple of years compared to himself, finding he has stagnated since Roxy's leave. When Paul arrives and delivers Rudeus a letter from his teacher, he reads that she tells him of her position as a court mage of the Kingdom of Shirone and she was promoted to King Class Water Magic. Further into the letter, she writes of the expectations that she had for his growth was more impressive. Rudeus starts feeling that he has peaked with his sword and magic skills, he makes up his mind up that he's ready to go to the school. While he would want to leave Buena Village, Sylphy clings to him begging him not to leave her, so Rudeus promises that he'll stay by her side. Paul eavesdrops on the children from behind the wall, and silently hearing the conversation gives him an idea.

At lunch, Rudeus informs Paul how his magic studies are stagnant and how he would like to attend the Ranoa University of Magic. However, because Sylphy doesn't want him to leave nor can she afford it, he requests that Paul pay both their tuitions. Paul immediately refuses his request because his sword training is not complete, while also that they don't have the money for both and that he is too young to leave. Undeterred, Rudeus asks if he can find him a job as tutor or magician to earn himself the tuition for Sylphy. With Paul confirming Rudeus' determination, he asks his son to come to the garden, where he asks what Rudeus would think if he ordered him to leave Sylphy behind. When Rudeus immediately answered that he will not like the idea, Paul finds the answer predictable and takes a practice sword to quickly attack Rudeus. As he does, a catwoman approaches the house and finds Paul and Rudeus' fight commence.

 is the rough history of the path an individual takes in their life.

Background

Laplace
: "May the fortunes of war be with you."
First Dragon God
: "everything shall be left to fate"

-The First Dragon God and Laplace's final farewells to each other

Like
Mana
, Fate is possessed by all beings in the universe of
Mushoku Tensei
 even during the
Six-Faced World
 Era but very few beings are able to see fate and try to influence it.

Due to Orsted being in a timeloop made by the
First Dragon God
, Orsted has seen the past and knows the future of nearly everyone in the
Human World
, as such he refers to the original timeline history to be pre-ordained by Fate and he acts to ensure that original timeline is followed as much as possible against his upcoming battle against Hitogami.

Strong Fate

The path of history of individuals who are protected by a strong fate's cannot be altered easily and despite multiple attempts to alter it, not even by
Gods
. But the strength of fate can also be ambiguous especially during pregnancy of the individual. Another exception is when a massive calamity occurs like the
Teleport Incident
 which could also cause the death even those protected by a strong fate.

Notable Individuals with Strong Fate

Rudeus Greyrat

"With each person he encounters, the world greatly changes"

-
Orsted

Rudeus is protected by an unusually strong fate that when
Hitogami
 tries to influence the course of events involving him, it rarely works out. This strong fate also causes the fate of his family and future wive's fate to also greatly change and in turn, his strong fate is also inherited by his children and descendants.
.

Orsted who has knowledge on the supposed fate of most people of the
Human World
 in his numerous time loops believe that it was because of their encounter with Rudeus has caused massive changes in their fate, like
Isolte Cruel
 and
Doga
 getting married which has a very small chance to occur in his other time loops because of their circumstances. As such, Osted's plans for the next hundred years to defeat Hitogami has been thrown off the rails that he wonders where to begin on the next loop since his writings to record the many changes on the current time loop with Rudeus could not keep up. This leads him to also think if there is even a point of writing the changes since the chance Rudeus existing on the next loop is quite small, making the notes pointless otherwise, if Rudeus exist on the next loop, his recording will prove to be a powerful weapon.

Sylphiette

Sylphiette: "Anyway, I think thats the whole reason its fun to think about how things might have turned out. Because I'm really happy with how they did."
Eris: "...I wonder if I'll feel the same once I have a child too."

In the timeline that Rudeus does not exist, Sylphiette became the apprentice of Roxy and later becomes an
Adventurer
. Due to her green hair, she is still hated by people but in the end, she conquered several notable labyrinths and made a name for herself as one of the world's most prominent dungeon explorer and to Orsted's knowledge she never got married.

While in the timeline where Sylphiette meets Rudeus, she learns
Chantless casting
 even for her
Healing Magic
 that not even Rudeus can do and eventually marries Rudeus. Due to her strong fate, she became
Ariel Anemoi Asura
's
Guardian Magician
 and protected her from all assassinations until they made it to
Sharia
.

Roxy Migurdia

Rudeus: "Huh. Okay. So Roxy and I were destined to get married then? That makes me kinda happy."
Hitogami: "Can't say I feel the same."

In the timeline that Rudeus does not exist, Roxy trains Sylphiette as her apprentice and like Sylphiette she never marries.

But in another timeline with Rudeus, they did get married but Roxy and her supposed
child
 dies due to
Magic Stone Disease
 causing Rudeus to fall into depression and death of most of his friends and family. When Rudeus discovers what caused Roxy's death, he is already
old
 but he manages to
travel back in time
 to warn his younger self to prevent the disease from happening before passing away.

Heeding the warning of his future self, Rudeus manages to prevent Roxy's death but Hitogami angrily confronts him in his dream on how his plan to kill Roxy has failed. Rudeus several proposal but Hitogami refuses as fate cannot be easily changed by his initial proposals. In the end, a compromise is made where Rudeus must kill Orsted and in return, Hitogami will leave him and his family alone.

Eris Boreas Greyrat

Orsted: "Eris Boreas Greyrat... is Rudeus so precious to you? what of Luke?"
Eris: "Luke?"
Orsted: "The man who was destined to be your husband."
Eris:"That's news to me."

In the timeline that Rudeus does not exist, Eris is skilled with a sword that she eventually becomes a
Sword Saint
 and despite her beautiful appearance and impressive status, her fiery personality earned her the title "Red Lion". The Asuran Guard selects her for her sword skills to be part of their ranks and that is how she met
Luke Notos Greyrat
 which is love at first sight for him. Despite being punched numerous times, Luke continues to pursue Eris and that softened her heart and the two eventually gets married and were extremely affectionate with each other. As such, the
Boreas Family
 headed by
Philip Boreas Greyrat
 and
Sauros Boreas Greyrat
 joins the
Princess Ariel Faction
 while Eris and Luke works together to protect Ariel from assassination attempts numerous times, securing Ariel's path to kinghood.

Ariel Anemoi Asura

Orsted:"To turn Asura Kingdom's second princess, Ariel Anemoi Asurra, into the Asura Kingdom's queen."
Rudeus:"Ooh"
Orsted:"If it is necessary, we will manipulate her like a puppet."

In Orsted's original history, Ariel becomes queen of Asura Kingdom and is protected by a considerably powerful fate. In order for Ariel to become queen, the power of 3 people are needed: Derrick Redbat, Eris Boreas Greyrat,
Tristina Purplehorse
 who will testify to cause the downfall of Prime Minister
Darius Silva Ganius
.

Derrick Redbat

"I supposedly had fate on my side protecting me from death as well, but if Derrick's bloody end was any indication, I'd better not let it go to my head."

-Rudeus Greyrat

In Orsted's original history, Derrick Redbat is the
Guardian Magician
 of Princess Ariel and during her fated meeting with
Perugius Dola
, Derrick successfully persuades him to back Ariel on becoming queen of Asura Kingdom. Derrick would continue to be Ariel's advisor and eventually become the prime minister.

But despite being protected by a strong fate, Derrick is killed during the Teleport Incident so the plan of Rudeus and Orsted to make Ariel queen has changed since coming to
Sharia
 and her connections to numerous talented personnel has been established.

Leo





Leo watching over Lara in the Light Novel



"The Human God cannot manipulate inhuman beings. Furthermore, he cannot manipulate a great number of people at the same time. As long as we move, he will have his hands full with our interference. Based on his personality, that will be more than enough prevention."

-Orsted

Leo is the sacred beast of the
Beast Race
 who is protected by a strong fate who is born once every several hundred years. Since ancient times, the appearance of Leo means that the world will be in crisis. After becoming an adult, Leo is fated to set out on a journey together with a
hero
 and save the world.

In order to protect Rudeus' family from Hitogami's manipulation, Orsted instructs Rudeus to use a guardian beast protect his family by
Summoning Magic
 which in turn, Hitogami won't be able to make a move against them.
 Thus, Leo is summoned by Rudeus and since then, Leo has been watching over Roxy until Lara is born
 and they are always seen together.

Weak Fate

Notable Individuals with Weak Fate

Miko of Memory

Despite her power, the Miko of Memory has a weak fate that regardless of the time loop Orsted remembers, she would die around the age of 10 and would never live to see age 30. Thus, the chance of the Miko of Memory being an apostle of Hitogami is close to zero.
 In order to protect her and as thanks for revealing the memories of
Zenith
 with her power, Rudeus lets her join the
ORSTED Corporation
 as a subordinate of Orsted and as additional protections, Rudeus gives her an emblem of the Dragon God and also summons a guardian beast to protect her, similar to how Leo protects his family.

Luke Notos Greyrat

Rudeus: "The Human God may have considered that we'd discover his connection with Luke. Perhaps his entire aim is to goad us into killing him."
Orsted: "That's perfectly possible. The Ariel that I knew valued Luke greatly. Without him, she may not succeed on the path towards kingship."

Despite having a weak Fate. Hitogami turned Luke into his disciple to monitor Rudeus. Throughout their journey back to Asura Kingdom, Luke has been suspicious of Rudeus despite Luke asking first to help Ariel become Queen.

Fighting God Armor
==================

Fighting God's Golden Armor is a
magic tool
 created by Demon-Dragon God
Laplace
. The person who wears it is considered the "
Fighting God
".

Backround





Golden Armor worn by Badigadi



Dragon  God Laplace created the Golden Armor sometime before the
Second Great Human-Demon War
. Laplace used the armor during the early stages of the war, but soon realized the armor had become sentient and was trying to take him over, which caused Laplace to seal away the dangerous tool he had created. It was later stolen by
Badigadi
 at the behest of
Hitogami
, and used to defeat and split Dragon God Laplace into two different entities, breaking the world in the process.

Many  Years later, the armor was once again used by Badigadi to fight Rudeus and his allies and later briefly by
Aleksander Ryback
 to fight against
Orsted
.

Characteristics and Abilities





Golden Armor design



Characteristics

Sentient
 - The armor is infused with such a monumental amount of mana that it developed its own consciousness.

Shape Change
  - The armor will change its shape to fit the size and body type of whoever wears it.

Self Repair
 -  If part of the armor is destroyed it will reform itself.

Abilities

Great Power Boost
 - Whoever wears the Golden Armor will feel neither pain, or fatigue and will have their power increased across the board substantially.

Magic Resistance Aura
 - The golden light radiating from the armor will render most magic ineffective, however there is a limit and some high level spells might be able to get through.

Battle Master
 - Regardless of the wearers knowledge when it comes to battle, the armor itself is a battle master. It knows how to use, counter and adapt to countless weapons it has trained with and can imitate many martial arts. The armor could analyze the flow of battle and has a repertoire of over 1000 secret techniques (including one that was used to disrupt Laplace's reincarnation technique)

Drawbacks

Life Force powered
 - The Golden Armor is powered by the wearer's life-force and will eventually kill the wearer, with even
Orsted
 dying from it when he tried to wear it in one timeline. The only known exception are members of the immortal demon clan, since they cannot die at all.

Heal Seal
 - Since the armor cancels magic cast on the wearer, it also prevents healing magic from being used on them. However, races with innate regenerative abilities, like members of the immortal demon clan, can bypass this.

Frenzy Inducement
 - The Golden Armor is cursed; the longer one wears the armor, the more the armor suppresses the wearers will, replacing it with its own, causing the wearer to become insane and battle hungry.

Trivia

At some point,
Orsted
 attempted to wear the Golden Armor, but he did not know how to take it off so it eventually killed him.

"I'll send my child ten-thousand years into the future. In the meantime, I want you to find Hitogami's true identity, his whereabouts, his weaknesses... Find a way to defeat him and convey that to my child!"

First Dragon God giving Laplace's mission

The
First Dragon God
 is the first generation Dragon God whose name is not revealed. Under his leadership,
Dragon Tribe
 became the most powerful beings in the Dragon World and through this, he is recognized as the ruler of the Dragon World. He is also the husband of
Lunaria
 and the father of
Orsted
.

Appearance

At a glance, the First Dragon God is easily seen as the leader of the Dragon Tribe to anyone who sees him for the first time and his most outstanding features were his golden eyes, he has a silver beard and skin covered in silver scales with long fangs and claws. He is a little bigger than the rest of the Dragon Tribe and his gaze is sharp, but filled with unfathomable warmness.

Personality

The First Dragon God was a wise and benevolent figure. Like Lunaria, he deeply cared for his people. After personally saving
Laplace
 from the verge of death, The First Dragon God was willing to raise him as his own son despite him being a dragon and demon hybrid. As such, he was worshipped and trusted by his people that was seen in their gesture of giving a salute of the highest honor for the Dragon Tribe and they addressed him as "Dragon God-sama"
.

After Lunaria was killed, his personality took a dark turn and became consumed by his fury, leading to him destroying four out of six worlds in the
Six-Faced World
.

Background

Like most of the First Generation Gods, the First Dragon God originated from the
Creator God
 who created the Six-Faced World where he is tasked with managing the dangerous balances of the Dragon World. Because of this divine origin, they became known as Gods and the First Dragon God worked diligently with the Dragon Tribe to make the world prosper.

But despite the Dragon Tribe having a long lifespan and powerful, their civilization was unable to thrive and their civilization remained primitive for a long time. Perhaps out of pity or frustration, the Human God meets with the other Gods and suggests that the Gods meet on a regular basis of information exchange to help each of their world prosper. In exchange, the Dragon Tribe taught the use of Battle Aura and thanks to this, the Dragon Tribe learns the use of words and letters to communcal living and forming a social order that gave the light of civilization to the Dragon Tribe.

The First Dragon God changed the life of the Dragon Tribe who were hiding in caverns by the hillside, living only where they could not be caught by large dragons in the Dragon World. He taught them how to use
Dragon Battle Aura
 and by grouping together, finding strength in numbers, and preying on the dragons, the Dragon Tribe stood as the strongest in the Dragon World. The Dragon Tribe would eventually conquer the largest mountain in the Dragon World, Dragon Roar Mountain and from there, they built their capital city Kayos from its hollowed out center with the First Dragon God's home at its center and later expanded to an additional 122 towns.

To protect the Dragon World, the First Dragon God appoints the five most powerful individuals among the Dragon Tribe and they are called the Five Dragon Generals. On one of their meetings, the Human God introduces her daughter to the First Dragon God for an experiment if its possible for Gods to have children with other races and what power will they have, although the First Dragon God initially did not love Lunaria, he grew to love her when she gave him a child and he makes plans to prepare the Dragon World for his birth.

Plot

On his travels to the Demon World, the First Dragon God found Laplace who lives at the edge of the world and at the brink of death after being attacked by a hydra and brings him to the Dragon World and is welcomed by him and Lunaria as their own son despite having blood of both demons and dragons and their child is about to be born.
 After a few years, he asks
Dora
 to train Laplace to become a Dragon Warrior and would receive reports from Dora and Laplace of his progress where Laplace would become a renowned dragon trainer through out the Dragon World.

When
Crystal
 died in what looks like a dragon attack, the First Dragon God held a meeting with the remaining Dragon Generals where Laplace serves as a stand-in for Dora who was on pregnancy leave at the time. They concluded that Crystal's death has a possibility that it was done by a demon and when the suggestion that Laplace be assigned to investigate, the other Dragon Generals strongly objected but in the end they agreed to let Laplace investigate since.

Another meeting was held after
Necrolia Nacrolia
 the culprit who killed Crystal was captured where Laplace gives his report on his investigation, the Human God giving counsel and his battle and capture of Necrolia. Although the Dragon Generals are urging to go to war against the Demon World, the First Dragon God chose to negotiate with them instead and at the suggestion of
Szilard
, the First Dragon God grants Laplace the title Demon Dragon King and successor of Crystal as Dragon General and becomes his assistant to negotiate with the Demon God.

"Rather than that, look, Demon God, at this man... He's now an important figure in the Dragon World, a living proof that the Dragon Race felt no hostility towards the Demons."

-First Dragon God to Demon God

The First Dragon God attends a meeting with other five
Gods
 at Demon God's castle Gaileck located at its capital city Daileck in the Demon World where they normally trade insults with each other and only the Dragon God and
Human God
 wants peace. The First Dragon God then introduces Laplace to the
Demon God
 and tells him how Laplace has become an important part of the Dragon Tribe and is now a Dragon General despite having blood of Demons and Dragons to dispell the rumor that the Dragon Tribe has no hatred towards Demons. After some further inquiry particularly the death of his son Necrolia which the First Dragon God already told everyone who has knowledge to never expose the truth before the meeting, the Demon God also admits he does not want a war and agrees to have peace between him and the Dragon God and despite the tense situation, the other Gods also does not want a war and agrees to work for peace.

With the Gods agreeing to cooperate with each other, the Dragon World welcome engineers from the other worlds to assist in the technological advancement which is slow for the Dragon Tribe and in return, Dragon Warriors are sent to other worlds to help subdue monsters that are otherwise impossible to defeat and despite teleportation and monster appearances still occurred, they no longer suspect each other.

"How strange. Although everyone of Dragon World I considered my own, but it feels a little special holding this child."

-First Dragon God

The First Dragon God and Laplace returns from the meeting with the Gods but to their surprise, they see the Dragon World having a festival where everyone is jubilant and they are welcomed with a joyous chorus. Having caught on what has happened, the First Dragon God flies at great speed to his mansion and Lunaria welcomes him with their child held in her hand. The First Dragon God then holds on to the child then Lunaria asks him to name the child but the First Dragon God is unusually hesitant to name their child and did not give a name for the time being. All the Gods of the other world also came to give their blessings to the new born child which is a spectacular and majestic moment since Gods do not typically appear in other worlds let alone all six of them in the Dragon World and the peace between Six World continues.

However, the peaceful era of the Six Worlds lasted until the First Dragon God finds Lunaria dead in her room in a pool of her own blood which indicates she died while protecting their child. The First Dragon God is enraged by this and his roar is heard through out the Dragon World that frigtened most of its denizens.
 After Lunaria's funeral rites, a meeting is held with the Dragon Generals presenting their lists of suspects and during this time, the Human God also joins them to reveal that the other worlds are suspicious of the Dragon World and they might have plotted to kill his child but Lunaria was killed during the attempt. Although the First Dragon God is in disbelief of the other world's plot, he commands his Dragon Generals to prepare for war.

The First Dragon God and the Five Dragon Generals goes to the Beast World who greets them with 10,000 troops. The First Dragon God shouts to bring out Lunaria's murderer but the
Beast God
 does not know and the battle begins which lasts for 3 days and 3 nights. The First Dragon God and Beast God attack on each other causes shockwaves that creates several tornadoes but is not enough to penetrate each other's scales nor fur.  On the fourth day both the Gods had sustained enough damage and the battle is settled by the Beast God biting the shoulder of the First Dragon God and it spewed blood but the First Dragon God is waiting for this and he grabs the left and right head of the Pudoria and using his Dragon Battle Aura to tear his body in 2 then slams Beast God to the ground causing a huge crater to form and a shockwave that caused even the Dragon Generals to be blown away. The First Dragon God emerges from the crater and roars then hands Laplace a jewel and goes back to the Dragon World while the destruction of the Beast World begins upon the Beast God's death.

The First Dragon God and the Five Dragon Generals goes to war against the Ocean World and Sky World whose army dyed the sea black and the sky blot out the sky respectively but like the Beast World it is a massacre that eventually resulting to First Dragon God killing of both the
Ocean God
 and the
Sky God
 and the destruction of their world. Despite the victory, the First Dragon God's body is still afflicted by the wounds from his battles from the Gods he defeated. The Beast God's bite on his shoulder is still bleeding, the poison from the Ocean God is eating away his leg and the Sky God's beam of light blinded him on one eye but the war still continues as they prepare for war against the Demon World.

The war between is particularly fierce since the 5 Dragon Generals are matched by the Demon World's 8 Demon Kings, making it impossible to destroy the Demon World. So the First Dragon God also brought the full force of Dragon Warriors to invade the Demon World who in response, the Demon World's fighters are rallied to battle them. The war became a back and forth between invading and defending the Dragon and Demon World and vice versa which raged for decades but eventually take its toll on both sides due to massive casualties caused by the advancement in technologies of both worlds. With the fighting force of the Dragon Tribe nearly depleted, the Dragon Generals luring and isolating one Demon King after another at the suggestion of the Human God, causing the Demon God to appear in battle where the First Dragon God battles him.

The battle between the First Dragon God and Demon God is unusually long because because of the Demon God's power to regenerate his body parts and his other ability to alter his size. On the 100th day of battle, First Dragon God activates the Magic Circle   beneath the feet the the gigantic Demon God which causes the body of the Demon God to rapidly collapse. After, the First Dragon God collapses and the Dragon Generals carried him back to the Dragon World.

"In the end, Dragon God-sama's words were true and we were wrong... thats... great. Betraying Dragon God-sama was a mistake... thats... wonderful..."

-Dora's last words upon learning the truth

The First Dragon is bed ridden after fighting the Demon God and the wounds from the his battle Gods have not yet healed. When Laplace gave his report about his encounter with Necros, the First Dragon God prepares to invade the Human World much to the shock of Laplace and when relayed to the rest of the Dragon Generals, they were shocked as well and  opposed the order.
 The Dragon Generals tried to persuade the First Dragon God to reconsider the invasion but he replied that he will go alone so the Dragon Generals responds that they will stop him by force.

The First Dragon God is shocked by the intention of the Dragon Generals to fight him but accepts their decision. Before the start of the battle, the city of Kayos is evacuated and the First Dragon God asks Laplace what he plans to do to which he responds he will fight beside the First Dragon God. But the First Dragon God instead commands him to protect his son which the latter obeys as they watch the battle begin. The Dragon Generals used the technology they have developed against the demons but despite his injuries from his battle against the other Gods, the First Dragon God defeats the 4 Dragon Generals with most of them being severely injured, even missing limbs. Just as the battle finishes, the Human God strikes the First Dragon God and took out the Divine Jewel inside his body. The Human God then admits that the murder of Lunaria, war between the Gods, destruction of all the other worlds were his plan to begin with and how he manipulated everyone to accomplish it. The First Dragon God further pressed for answers but the Human God shattered the Divine Jewel causing the First Dragon God to be gravely wounded and the destruction of the Dragon World began as the Human God flies away.

"May the fortunes of war be with you" ..."everything shall be left to fate."

-Final Words Exchange of the First Dragon God and Laplace

Chaos and Maxwell asked for forgiveness and offered to end their life as well like Szilard did before them but the First Dragon God forgives them and gives them a mission to buy him time. After hearing Dora's words reported by Laplace, he asks Laplace to bring him to Dora's Teleport Research Laboratory. At the laboratory, the elderly researchers is greatly concerned for the First Dragon God as they lead him to the laboratory's innermost chamber which has an altar that functions as a gateway to another world and a stone monument with sophisticated Magic Circles. After studying the monument, the First Dragon God began to draw
Magic Circles
 onto his child who is placed on the altar by Laplace. Then the Dragon God placed one of the three Divine Jewels in his chest which is absorbed into his body, the another Divine Jewel on the chest of his child which is absorbed into his body and the final Divine Jewel he gives to Laplace with a mission.

Aware that his death is unavoidable the First Dragon God still sought vengeance on the imposter pretending to be the Human God whom he now calls "
Hitogami
" and after parting ways with Laplace, he goes to the Human World to battle Hitogami. The battle of the First Dragon God and Hitogami lasted for 8 days but neither the First Dragon God nor Hitogami can be found afterwards.

Legacy

"Hitogami is... my father's ruin. And, overthrowing Hitogami is the ancient Dragon Tribe's dearest wish. Our, the Dragon God's sole reason for existence is to defeat Hitgami."

Orsted

Hitogami begins to also use the name "Hitogami" which is the name the First Dragon God uses to refer to him when talking to Laplace and he uses that name to introduce himself to
Rudeus Greyrat
.

Laplace succeeds the First Dragon God who becomes the Second Generation Dragon God and makes preparation for war against Hitogami to avenge the death of the First Dragon God, Lunaria and the Five Dragon General's regret.

Laplace together with Saleyakt and
Rostelina
 begins to live in the largest mountain of the Human World and renames it to "Dragon Roar Mountain"; named after the largest mountain in the Dragon World, the First Dragon God's home and his former home.

After witnessing destruction of their respective worlds at the hands of the Dragon Tribe, the surviving
Races
 begin to hate and fear the Dragon Tribe especially the Dragon God that permeates throughout the Human World.

The surviving Dragon Tribe are hunted and killed but Laplace refuses to help them since the mission given to him by the First Dragon God is more important than the survival of the Dragon Tribe.

Laplace initially thought that Hitogami and First Dragon God had killed each other but Hitogami's indirect interference to his activities made him conclude that Hitogami is in the
Void World
 after searching everywhere in the Human World.

Rudeus eventually becomes a subordinate of Orsted who tells him his objective of defeating Hitogami on behalf of his father.

Equipment

『Godsword』

I named it "Dragon Godsword". It is a sword that can withstand even the mighty power of Dragon God-sama. Even though Dragon God-sama might not need it; I plan to offer it to his child when he is born.

-Mad Dragon King Chaos

The Godsword, short for Dragon Godsword is forged by Chaos for the First Dragon God.
 At the hands of the First Dragon God, the sword's strike is so powerful that only the other Gods are capable of withstanding its strikes. When the First Dragon God wielded it against the Dragon Generals, its strike can cut everything in half which seems to distort the world that everything in its path, be it dragon scales, Battle Aura, or even the Flying Fortress Chaos Breaker was sliced in two.
 Godsword is eventually inherited by Orsted which costs a huge amount of mana to summon so he uses it only when he needs to fight seriously.

Summary

As Man-God advised Rudeus to take the lost pet quest, the trio are led by Ruijurd as he tracks the missing cat. As Rudeus ponders why with a theory that it could lead to more profitable opportunities, an annoyed Eris asks Ruijurd if he does know where he's going as they've trekked through slums, and Ruijurd reassures them given his third eye's radar ability. Once they found the location of the missing cat, they find numerous other animals caged, as Rudeus believes there's a criminal operation happening. Ruijurd finds the cat, really a large black panther, verifying it by the collar before Eris detects someone approaching. As three persons enter, Roman, Jalil and Vizquel, Rudeus uses the earth magic spell [Quagmire] to unbalance so Eris and Ruijurd can knock them to a wall for Rudeus to use [Earth Cuffs] to restrain them.

After Rudeus celebrates a peaceful capture, he is kicked across the room by Roman, before Eris is also set aback by Ruijurd's spear backing into her head. Finding blood, Rudeus finds Ruijurd murdered Roman with effortless bloodlust, reasoning that he had to as Roman kicked a child, and didn't know his position as a prisoner. Rudeus is sent into a quiet panic but knows that killing is common in the world, but since Ghislaine attempted reason first against Almanfi. As Ruijurd killed a man just for kicking a child, Rudeus recalls Roxy's words on Superds, but also recalls Ruijurd's vulnerability from before, and wants to reason with him. Arguing that killing even for the most minor offenses will forever hinder his aim to repair the Superd reputation, and those that love him will ultimately become scared of him as he kills, Ruijurd promises to stop after seeing his logic, and Eris scolds Ruijurd for whacking her in the head causing a cut.

Calming down, Rudeus approaches the surviving two and learns their scheme to abduct then return pets for D-Rank rewards at the Adventurer's Guild. However, as they overheard Rudeus talking to Ruijurd, they know his secret as a Superd and fearfully promise to keep it secret, putting Rudeus in a predicament. Thinking of a monetary and reputation solution, Rudeus learns that the slain prisoner imposed himself into their pet abduction scheme so it was more convenient that he was gone. With that, Rudeus invites them to team up and orders they promote from D-Rank to C-Rank, earning anger and confusion from Ruijurd. With that, Jalil and Vizquel take their leave to fulfill Rudeus's command. However, Ruijurd grabs Rudeus demanding to know why he did so, Eris attacks Ruijurd while also countering his arguments. As he promised to escort them home and if he didn't like how Rudeus was planning things, Eris berated him that he could leave. Bound by his promise, Ruijurd relents and they deliver the lost pet back to the owner.

There, the young lizard girl hands over the quest card and thanks the "nice devils" for their kindness. Receiving payment for the completed quest, a despondent Ruijurd accompanied Rudeus and Eris back to their inn, while Eris notes how small the coin is. While Rudeus agrees, he can't help but feel that the coin is too heavy as he is filled with doubts of his choice, but chooses to press forward. As they leave, Nokopara surprises upon Jalil and Vizquel, charming his way into their conversation.

Rudeus Greyrat

Summary

In the family library, Rudeus encounters Philip and asks for a translation reference to a Demon-God language book he purchased. When asked why he was learning the language, Rudeus wanted to learn a new language for a future benefit; when really a summoning book he wanted was already sold and he bought the book he did on a whim. But it was still half-true to him, remembering how he failed learning languages in his old life and now he wanted to dedicate some focus in this life. Appreciative of Philip's help, Rudeus is startled by a quick sinister expression by Philip in passing.

Searching for her husband, Lady Hilda finds him and Rudeus in the library. Rudeus bows courteously and gets a good angle on Hilda's bust, and wonders how Eris will develop in a few years. But as he returns to reality with Hilda's face in antagonistic disgust of him, she informs Philip that her gifts for Eris's 10th birthday only just arrived, and goes to see to their proper opening. While disturbed by the encounter, Philip explains to him that Hilda is rather upset given the Greyrat family tradition. After Philip failed in a bid to become head of the Greyrat family, Eris's older and younger brothers were "adopted" by his victorious brother to study in the Asura capital. As it is a Greyrat tradition to make compliance across all four houses, Hilda is upset since Rudeus can stay while her own sons cannot.

Philip asks Rudeus only tolerate Hilda's disdain for him, while Philip "enjoys" his presence. Taking his leave, Philip advices Rudeus speak to Ghislaine about learning the Beast-God language as she originates from the Doldia Tribe. Relieved the situational pressure had past, Rudeus spends some time looking over books for how to translate the Demon language. After so long and finding nothing, he remembers Roxy was of the Demon race and planned to write a letter for her help to learn.

When exploring the village, he happens upon a shout, and remembering how he was bullied in his past life, he finds a group of children's bullying another by throwing mud balls.

Worried that he may be bullied again, Rudeus decides to become friends with the shy Sylph. After bringin lunch to Sylph's father at the village watchtower, Sylph asks Rudeus if he can teach magic and he accepts planning to begin tomorrow. Parting ways for the day, Rudeus returns home to find Paul upset because a mother say that her child was attacked by Rudeus.

Gal Farion
==========

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Gal Farion
 (
ガル
・
ファリオン
)
 is the Sword God, ranked 6th on the
Seven Great Powers
, and the teacher of
Eris
 and
Ghislaine
 in the
Sword God Style
.

Appearance

Gal Farion is described as an adult
man
 with blue hair with a face "like a ferocious wolf" and a prominent scar below his left eye that reaches below his left ear and another scar at the tip of his right eye.

Personality

Gal has a calm personality and is able to withstand insults. He is capable in teaching others and is a little arrogant, due to his great strength. Gal also hates asking help from anyone with the exception of training Eris for her battle against Orsted where Gal asked Reida's help who was intrigued of what Gal was planning to ask help even from her.

Orsted describes him as "A man of good character, with a hobby of collecting swords."

He seems to be an impatient man and makes quick decisions, complementing his swift sword-god style.

After being defeated by
Jino Britts
, he becomes much more irascible and prone to carelessness, easily giving into Eris' provocation and failing to notice Ruijerd's presence until it was too late.

Background

A young Gal Farion battling Enzo Moreira in the Manga
Gal Farion defeated by Orsted in the Manga
Gal Farion meeting Ghislaine in the
Anime
1/3

At a young age, is already a talented
Swordsman
 and when during his time at the
Holy Land of Swords
 where he defeats
Enzo Moreira
 who was a
Sword Saint
 in a sparring match.

Gal Farion describes himself as stubborn Sword Saint when he challenged Orsted to a battle. Naturally, he lost but survived with his 4 limbs intact and his stubborness was completely broken. Since then, He trained earnestly and made no compromises with the goal to cut down Orsted and eventually his ascension on becoming the Sword God of his generation. He claims to have become strong using rational methods that he also teaches to his students.

Like in previous generations, battle for who is the strongest swordsman of the generation occurs which also results to which
Swordstyle
 controls the Holy Land of Sword where Gal Farion battles and defeats
Water God
 Reida Reia. He was considered to be the fastest of his generation as not even Water God Reyda could withstand his attacks.

On his journey to the Great Forest, Gal met
Ghislaine Dedoldia
 and trained her in the Sword God Style wherein afterwards, she attained the rank of Sword King. He gifted her
Hiramune
 as proof of her mastery.

Plot

Volume 9 - Special Student Chapter






Gal meeting Eris in the Holy Land of Swords



Eris arrives at the Holy Land of Swords and defeats Jino and Nina. Gal took interest in Eris' potential in the sword and agrees to train her as his student to defeat Orsted, a dream that they both share. News of
Badigadi
 attacking
Ranoa Magic Academy
 also reaches Gal and is looking forward to fighting the demon lord but lost interest when Nina told him that Rudeus has already defeated him.

Volume 10 - Younger Sisters Chapter

When Eris fought
Auber Corvette
, Gal has been watching the fight for some time and and calls them out to stop before the two kills each other. Auber greets Gal confirming he received his letter and has never met such a swordsman like Eris who was like a beast then realizes that she is the Mad Dog that Gal mentioned. That evening, Ghislaine questions Gal's training for Eris. Gal knowing Ghislaine will not understand even if you carefully spell it out from A to Z for her explains that Orsted is 『an existence beyond rationality』while recalling his own battle against Orsted when he was a Sword Saint where he was left alive and without a limb missing by Orsted. Ghislaine still doesn't understand so Gal explains why he brought Auber for Eris'
North God Style
 training and his plan to also bring a
Water God Style
 teacher in the future so Eris can cope up with the techniques of each school that Orsted uses at God Rank.

Volume 13 - Everyday-life Chapter

Gal invites
Reida Reia
 and
Isolte Cruel
 into the sword santuary with the objective of teaching Eris how to fight and counter the Water God Style, with Reida remarking how weird it is for him to ask her anything as he hates to rely on others for help, He makes Isolte fight against Eris and Nina, and makes the three of them train together.

Volume 23 - Young Man Period - Decisive Battle Chapter

He was one of the people employed by
Geese
 to kill
Rudeus
 by disguising himself as a guard that went to the Supard village for inspection.

When the first stage of the final battle began, he fought
Eris Greyrat
 who was accompanied by
Ruijerd
. His defeat against
Jino Britts
 made him lose his confidence, and he made 2 mistakes that costed him his victory. He hesitated using the Sword God Style and used the unfamiliar Water God Style due to his lack of confidence, and his tunnel vision of
Eris
 made him not notice Ruijerd's presence.

Hitogami

Power and Abilities

Sword God Style






Gal training Eris



As someone possessing God-rank, he was considered the strongest in the Sword God Style until Jino Britts defeated him. He possesses an extremely fast sword arm and was acknowledged by the Water God as the only man whose sword she could not stop.
 His speed is second only to Jino Britts. He knows various techniques of the Sword God Style and is adept at using them.

Water God Style

He possesses proficiency in the Water God Style at around the level of a Water Emperor, and was able to combine the Longsword of Light of the Sword God Style with one of the secret arts of the Water God Style. He thinks that he would have been able to reach great heights in the Water God Style if he had continued to pursue it.

Battle Aura






Gal's Battle Aura



Being the Sword God, when Gal unleashes his Battle Aura, it releases a pressure so strong that it knocked back Eris out of the dojo and the door also got destroyed as she crashed through it.

Quotes

Gal: "You have good eyes, huh. Just who is it that you want to cutdown?"

Eris: "The Dragon God! The Dragon God Orsted!"

Gal: "Hahhahaaa! I see, if you compare me to Orsted then I'm certainly a small fry! I see, I see, so it's him that you want to cut down! So there was someone besides me who wanted to cut him down!"

Reida
: "What, are you planning on having this beast assassinate me or something?"

Gal: "Goodness, no. What use would there be in killing an old lady who would croak on her own?"

Reida: "In that case, tell me what you're thinking. Why do you need me to teach her the Water God Style? Just who on earth is she planning to fight?"

Gal: "Eris over there wants to defeat the Dragon God Orsted."

To Eris: "
That person
, for some reason won't fight seriously. Even though he knows sword techniques and
magic
, he'll limit himself to just
Battle Aura
 and barehanded techniques whenever possible. Especially when he knows his opponent's skills. Battle Aura and barehanded techniques, if these aren't enough he'll use magic. He'll try to win as efficiently as possible, but in unfamiliar situations... Seeing a technique for the first time, he will try to study it. That is probably his weak point."

Trivia

He lost confidence in his Sword God Style because
Jino Britts
 defeated him despite the student's inexperience.

He is hinted to be emotionally blind, being incapable of understanding Jino Britts's and Eris's strength over him. Jino defeated him only to ask for his permission to marry his daughter and Eris drew her strength from the desire to protect her dearest. Gal Farion believes that a person is strong simply because they trained on top of having talent.

Ghislaine, to
Rudeus

Ghislaine Dedoldia
 (
ギレーヌ・デドルディア
,

Girēnu Dedorudia
)
 is a talented swordswoman from the
beast race
, is the daughter of
Gustav
, the former Doldia Village chief, the mentor of
Eris
, and the student of
Rudeus Greyrat
 in
magic
 and other subjects. She is one of the few people who have become a Sword King.

Appearance

Ghislane has dark skin and wears a revealing leather outfit.
She has a slender build along with rippling muscles, and is full of scars all over her body. She wears an eye patch with sculpted like face gives off a delinquent boss vibe. She completely feels like a female amazon warrior from some fantasy story. Also she has beast-like ears and a tail like a tiger's. Her fur is very thick.

Personality

Ghislaine was described as a strong-willed individual and a meathead by
Paul
. She often has an expressionless face that can feel intimidating, but behind that face is a more emotional and rash person at times. She is like an older sister to Eris, looking after her and listening to her problems. She is deeply loyal to
Sauros
 and Eris, who saved her when she was on the brink of death.

When she was younger, she was extremely violent and dumb, totally incapable of reasoning. She would just try to solve all problems with violence, creating a lot of trouble for the tribe, to the point everyone felt relieved when she was taken by an adventure forcing her to leave the tribe.

Ghislaine is also diligent and hard-working. During the time of Rudeus a tutor in Eris' house, Ghislaine succesfully learned to read, write, count and do elementary magic.

Background

Because of her enormous power, Ghislaine's childhood was spent by her bullying
her brother
, causing troubles and at some point lead to her running away from her family.






First meeting of Ghislaine and Gal in the
Anime



At age 10, Ghislaine first meets
Gal Farion
 who was a wandering swordsman at the time and took her in due to her wild nature and her potential as a swordswoman.

After becoming a Sword king, she traveled with
Paul Greyrat
's
Fangs of the Black Wolf
 party as a warrior and she also the one who train a sword skill to
Paul Grayrat
.

After that, their adventurers party disbands, due to
Zenith
 and Paul's marriage.

She became victim to many scams because she did not knew how to read, write and due to her not knowing math she was fooled many times in money matters, this led her wanting to gain wisdom and knowledge.

When she was down on the ground due to hunger and weak health conditions, Eris' family took her in and gave her a job as a bodyguard and sword instructor with a monthly salary of 2
Asura
 gold coins.

Plot

She was first seen coming to pick up Rudeus and safely transported him to the
Citadel of Roa
. When Rudeus' plan backfired, Eris and Rudeus were kidnapped again and almost died, but Ghislaine stepped in just in time and saved both of them by finishing off the kidnappers. After Rudeus was hired as Eris' tutor, she was also tutored by him, she convinced Eris that math and literacy was important after telling her tale of how she nearly died from being scammed before. Later, on Eris' tenth birthday, Rudeus saw that she was hungry, but being a guard on duty, she was unable to go and dine with the other guests. In a kind act, Rudeus asked a maid to set up a private party with food in his room. Rudeus gave both of them wands signifying that have successfully passed their exams, she was honored to receive this gift, setting as an example to Eris again. She would then gift Eris a ring that was passed down her family as a reminder of her.






Ghislaine during the Teleport Incident



On Rudeus' 10th birthday, she was tasked to distract him while the rest of the family prepared a private party, asking to see his most powerful
spell
. Later that day they would go out to a field outside the city, then and there a storm began to brew before Rudeus had the chance to cast his spell, when suddenly a
mysterious masked man
 appeared and try to kill Rudy, thinking he was the source of this chaos, instantly parrying them, within a blink of an eye, everyone was transported later called the
Teleport Incident
. She ended up in the
Strife Zone
 and would then try to locate anyone she knew, but all she discovered was the corpses of
Philip
 and
Hilda Boreas Greyrat
. She then went back to try to reunite with everyone where she came across the family butler in a survivors camp in
Fittoa Region
, where she would then spend the next 3 years helping its refugees.

Once Rudy and Eris made their way back, she rejoiced that both of them were alive, and shocked to hear that they were teleported to the
Demon Continent
. She had been worried about their safety for all throughout those 3 years, when it came time for the meeting, they broke the news to Eris about her family's demise and that most of the Greyrat staff are still missing. She and the family butler also then argued over what course of action should be taken, with both options being unfavorable, Eris chose to leave on her own accord. Despite desiring revenge for the death of
Sauros
, Ghislaine puts this on hold for now to train and watch over Eris' during her time in the Holy Land of Swords.

After 6 months, Ghislaine questions the training method of Gal for Eris causing Gal to explain his plan for Eris of having knowledge of all the three sword styles to defeat
Orsted
 who can use all of its technique in God rank. Ghislaine realizes the reason why
Auber Corvette
 is there to train Eris in the
North God Style
 and confirms with Gal that he plans to invite a
Water God Style
 teacher in the future. Convinced with Gal's answer and despite being annoyed by his smell, Ghislaine welcomes Auber who also returns the gesture.

Mana
.

Equipment

Hiramune






Ghislaine's Weapon: Hiramune



Hiramune lit. Flat Core is Ghislaine's weapon, given to her by Gal when she became Sword King and is one of the
Sword God's seven swords
 that she sheathes by her left hip and usually uses forward grip style in fighting. Hiramune is a katana with a dark colored back side and patterns by its reddish edge side. The golden cross guard also serves as a blade collar but it is longer on backside and as it crosses to the edge side. The dark hilt is slightly curved and has a golden pommel.

Like Paul, Ghislaine is always seen with Hiramune wherever she goes and when on guard duty she is always ready to draw her Hiramune at a moment's notice.

Achievements

These are the achievements that Ghislaine gained through her adventure, action, and training:

S-Ranked Adventurer

Sword King Class Swordswoman

Princess Ariel's Bodyguard

Quotes

Rudeus:

"Ghislaine, what do you plan to do next? Will you stay around?"
Ghislaine:

"No, once I leave Eris-sama with you, my work here is done. I plan to head back to the Asura Kingdom."
Rudeus:

"Asura Kingdom? Going to help rebuild the Fedoa Region?"
Ghislaine:

"No, I will go hunt down those that killed Sauros-sama and kill them."

Trivia

Ghislaine has the ability pick the correct answer out of two choices consistently, despite being weak in analysis.

Nobody believes that Ghislaine can read, count, and do (elementary) magic.

She is able to speak both human and beast god tongue.

Judging from
Gal Farion
's sword collection, Ghislaine is the only Sword King before Eris,
Nina
 and
Jino
 ascended to the position.

Thanks to her demon eye, she could see through teleportation traps when clearing labyrinths during her adventurer days with Paul's party.

The reason why Gustav sent
Pursena
 and
Linia
 to the
Ranoa Magic Academy
 is that she and her brother Gyes are unsuited to become village chief.

According to Paul in a letter he wrote to Rudeus on his trip to meet Eris for the first time, she never lost to Paul in anything except for when in bed.

Elinalise
 states that she wagged her tail when Paul was around (in the sense that Ghislaine flirted a lot with Paul); Ghislaine states that this was because she was in mating season.

Rudeus thought Paul had plans to take Ghislaine as a third wife.

Upon meeting Rudeus for the first time on their trip to the
Citadel of Roa
, she questions whether or not he's actually Paul's son, noting him to be "way too polite for Paul's son" she asks why Rudeus wants to learn the
Beast God Language
 to meet pretty
Beast Race
 girls. During their time together, she learns how to read, write, how to do math and Fire Magic alongside Eris while Ghislaine also trains Rudeus in the
Sword God Style
 but she notices that Rudeus' approach in learning the Sword God Style is similar with how he learns
Magic
 and concludes that Rudeus is more suited with the
North God Style
 would gladly find him a teacher of the North God Style should he decide to pursue being a
Swordsman
. For this, she becomes rather grateful to him and also respects Rudeus as much as Gal Farion. Rudeus also has Ghislaine's respect, such respect that Ghislaine actually considers their advice valuable to the point of momentarily putting her goals aside to follow this advice.

After the Fangs of the Black Wolf party disbanded, Ghislaine was cheated and is left with no money and was on the verge of starving to death when she was found by Sauros, Philip and Eris who hires her to be their bodyguard and since then she is loyal towards her benefactor.
 Despite burning with desire to avenge the death of Sauros, Ghislaine did not pursue vengeance until she entrusts Eris to Rudeus and plans to avenge Sauros afterwards.

Philip Boreas Greyrat

Eris:"Are you listening? I'm telling you to protect the most important person to me!"
Ghislaine:"...I won't! If you die, I won't be able to face Master Sauros and Master Philip!"

Due to the love of the
Boreas Family
 for the
Beast Race
, Philip asks Ghislaine to be his concubine but she refuses and continues to fulfill his duty as their bodyguard.
 After the Teleport Incident, Ghislaine finds the remains of Philip and Hilda and buried them after killing all the enemies responsible for this.

Rudeus Greyrat

Eris Boreas Greyrat

Summary

After Rudeus convinced Ruijurd to guide them to the nearest inhabited area, Rudeus and Eris fought coyote packs on the way as combat training. But when Rudeus distracted Eris by his grazing her on an attack spell, they were met by a Stone Treant that was swiftly dispatched by Ruijurd and made into firewood. Arriving at the village, Rudeus's anxiety of what to do after Ruijurd leaves fades as a random child greets them before the front gate guard, Rowin, encounters them. Distrustful of outsiders, Rowin tells them to leave before the elder arrives to invite the group in, where Rudeus can't help but feel an uncertain familiarity with the people in the village.

With the sea between the Central and Demon continents homw to the rule of Sea Folk, Rudeus and Eris must head far south to Wenport before traveling through Millis Continent to then trek the Central Continent to return to Asura Kingdom. Given the perils on the road, Rudeus worries of the timelapse such a trek would take, but is surprised hearing Ruijurd state his promise to see them home. While not wanting events to play as Man-God wants, and with the elder noting he's a wanted man in every city, Rudeus hears Ruijurd's dedication is because of his ultimate goal: to clear the Superd's tainted name. Asking how given history, Ruijurd's angry flares trying to explain himself but subsides seeing a toddler fear him.

Ruijurd tells his story, how Laplace gave the demons on the continent rights when humans did not, as well as how the Superd were his fighting force due to their radar like third eye gems, garnering respect as warriors. But when Laplace provided "new spears" for them mid-war, many Superds were offended as their own spears are their souls; as a Superd's spear is their once tail, naturally detatched in adulthood and formed into a spear. When Ruijurd was action commander, he ordered his fellow Superds to comply, resulting in their people gaining incredible strength and madness as a result, attacking friend and foe alike before Ruijurd was freed by his son sacrificing himself. Ruijurd destroyed all the dark spears while the surviving Superd scattered across the world, as Ruijurd swore he would kill Laplace for his treachery, intervening in the battle between the three heroes and Laplace using his son's spear.

While Laplace was the perpetrator, Ruijurd still holds some culpability upon himself for his role, and aims to clear the Superd's reputation no matter what. Hearing how terrible his story was, Rudeus offers to help him in his quest. Ruijurd will protect him and Eris in the wild, while Rudeus and Eris will protect him in cities. His heart moved by Ruijurd's goal, Rudeus can't help but be quietly fearful he is playing into Man-God's plans. The elder has Rowin summon his wife, Rokari, to bring tea for their visitors. Curious to see him standing there, Ruijurd explains how the Migurd are telepaths, and Rudeus is shocked to see Rokari resembles Roxy. Rowin then gets in close to Rudeus asking how he knows Roxy and has her pendant, Rudeus berates him for not giving Roxy proper honorifics, before Rowin explains he and Rokari are Roxy's parents. Realizing he is in Roxy's hometown, Rudeus tries to play that Rowin is his "father-in-law" much to Rowin's annoyance.

Gods
====

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Gods
 are the most powerful beings on the
Six-Faced World
, and the original guardians of each world. Unlike the other beings that followed with the title of "God" such as the
Seven Great Powers,
 these are actual beings of divine origins and are worshipped by the denizens of their respective worlds as deities.

History

Creation

After the Creator God created the Six-Faced World, he decided to use what was left of his power to split his body into 6 pieces and form divine beings who will ensure that all six worlds would prosper and to keep the worlds in balance. These six beings would come to be known as Gods to the people of their respective world.

Age Of The Gods

At the suggestion of the Human God, all the Gods formed a council to share information and knowledge with each other to benefit their worlds. The Gods would regularly meet, trade information, and discuss the state of the Six-Face World.

The God Wars

The God Wars (not the official name) began when the first Dragon God declared war on 4 of the 6 worlds in order to search for the murderers of his wife, Lunaria. Evidence pointed to a conspiracy of these four worlds that resulted in Lunaria's murder, and so the Dragon God and his five Dragon Generals began their massacre on the Beast world, followed by the Ocean World, the Heaven World, and finally the Demon world. Each time, the Dragon God faced off and killed one of the Gods while his Dragon Generals committed genocide on the world populations. The Human God then opened a rift to allow the survivors of those worlds to escape into the human world.

Dragon World Fall

After the war was won, the Dragon God ordered his Dragon Generals to invade the Human World, even though the Human God was their ally. The Dragon Generals then turned on him in order to stop his rampage but were eventually defeated. In the battle's final moments, the Human God appeared and struck down the Dragon God, revealing himself as the mastermind of the entire war. The Dragon God also revealed that he knew the god who defeated him was not the Human God, but an unknown entity wearing the Human God's form who then dubbed himself Hitogami. After which, Hitogami destroyed the Dragon world however the dying Dragon God challenged the trickster to a final fight that ended with the Dragon God's death and Hitogami's imprisonment in the Void World. With all the Gods dead and Hitogami imprisoned, the Age of the Gods faded into legends.

Abilities and Powers

"No. Like Dragon God, I'm not omniscient either. I don't know everything, but I do know knowledge from the Gods of each world. For example, your true potential..."

Human God to
Laplace

The power of the Gods was immense, they could destroy an entire world without too much effort and were impossible to kill by anyone or anything other than another God. Wounds inflicted by Gods would take around a century to heal even if they are inflicted on another God. The Dragon God's blood had healing properties, and the Demon God could change his size to more then 200 meters (it's unknown if this was exclusive to him or if all Gods could do this).

List of Gods

Creator God

The Creator God was an impossibly ancient being that created many worlds during its lifetime. At some point, it realized that it's death was near and decided to make one last effort to make one last world. But the world it built was unbalanced, so it made 5 more and stuck them all together making the Six-Faced World. Before his death he made the six Gods to govern each world. With his final work completed, the Creator God died.

Sea God

A man with a large amount of tentacles growing from his mouth and squid-like slimy skin.

Beast God

The Beast God Pudoria Dordia is man with two heads, a dog and a cat, riding on a white wolf.

Heaven God

A beautiful God with twin eyes on his forehead and six wings on his back.

Demon God

A man with eight arms and six horns, spanning a height of over three meters. He was considered the second most powerful God.

Human God

A featureless man with a mosaic-covered face. While he was the weakest of the Gods, he was also the most respected by all the other Gods and was considered their leader. He was the one who suggested that all the Gods come together and share their knowledge and technology with each other for the benefit of all worlds. It is due to these meetings that the Human God shared various wisdoms from his world such as the use of "Language" and "Letters" to the other Gods which greatly advanced their civilizations.

Dragon God

The First Dragon God had silver hair, skin covered in silver scale, golden eyes, sharp claws and fangs. He was the most powerful of all the six Gods. He was tricked by Hitogami into killing the other Gods and subsequently destroying 4 of the 6 worlds, only to be killed by Hitogami himself later causing the destruction of his own world.

Hitogami

Hitogami shares the Human God's features, however he is not the original Human God but an imposter wearing his shape. He is actually an unknown entity born in the center of the world that at some point usurped the Human God, and while not a proper God made by the Creator God he still wields divine powers equal to that of a God.

Demigods

Demigods are not actual Gods but rather the offspring of one of the Gods and a mortal. While not as powerful as their divine parents, they still carry immense power within them.

Kishirika Kishirisu

Kishirika Kishirisu is the daughter of the Demon God and the once Demon Empress Kirisis Calisis.

Lunaria

Lunaria is the daughter of the Human God, Wife of the Dragon God,
Laplace
's adopted mother and Orsted's biological mother. She was loved by all and had an almost otherworldly ability to calm people and make them feel safe and at peace. However, after giving birth to Orsted, she was murdered by Hitogami when she used her body as a shield to protect her newborn son, who was the true target of the assassination. Her death was the catalyst that caused the Dragon God, out of sadness and rage, to destroy other worlds believing that the other gods or their servants were responsible for her murder.

Orsted

Orsted's birth was the idea that came from the Human God, who proposed that the Dragon God marry his daughter Lunaria in order to produce a Demigod that is three-quarters God rather than only half, and the result was Orsted.

Trivia

Spoilers ahead!

Despite his talents for politics, the fact that the Asura Kingdom suffers in loops where he is king implies that he ultimately is not a good ruler. This might stem from the fact that he looks down on the lower-class, which he openly admits to.

It was noted by
Orsted
 that in futures were Grabell was to become king of Asura, he would create policies that would lead to them focusing more on their military might, as opposed to magical, which would eventually lead to them being unable to overcome an obstacle hundreds of years in the future.

Greyrat Family
==============

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

The
Greyrat
 bloodline is a prominent old noble family of the
Asura Kingdom
 divided into 4 Noble Houses, Notos, Boreas, Euros, Zephyrus. who protect all the sides of the kingdom and has many branch families.

Background

The Greyrat Family can be traced back to the Asura Kingdom's royal family and it is known that the men of the Greyrat bloodline are particularly infamous for their sex drive and perversion;
Luke Notos Greyrat
,
Paul Greyrat
 and
Rudeus Greyrat
 all being notable examples of this. Various branches of the Greyrat line are known for having specific preferences in women. For example, the Notos branch has a fetish for large boobs, while the Boreas branch has a fetish for beast people.

The name Greyrat is not unusual to any degree in Asura Kingdom due to the family's fondness for women and  hearing a lower noble's daughter or maid conceiving a child in order to become a mistress is a common thing to hear. Thus, it is allowed for those mistresses to also call themselves Greyrat. To distinguish the upper nobilities, they decided that the names of the protectors of Asura will be called: Notos, Boreas, Euros and Zephyrus as the four main branches of Greyrat family.

For nobles who wish to establish themselves, they need to have blood relations with one of these four main branches of the Greyrat Family which is a common practice to be working towards that end. But despite the Greyrat being an ordinary name, the talk becomes different when its a talk about a genius.

"I'm not a Boreas anymore. Its just Eris Greyrat."

-
Eris
 to
Orsted

There are also instances where family members of the upper nobility would sever their ties to their family and would willing be called Greyrat like Paul who severed his ties to the Notos Family and became an
Adventurer
 and Eris who severed ties with the Boreas Family after learning the death of
Sauros Boreas Greyrat
 and decides to go to the
Holy Land of Swords
 since none of the remaining Boreas would adopt her.

Philip Boreas Greyrat
 to give him a job so the Boreas Family arranges that he become a lower class
Knight
 who is assigned to defend Buena Village while Zenith becomes the healer of the village. They both lived in a two story wooden house where they hired

 to be their maid and eventually where
Rudeus Greyrat

 were born
.

In
K417
, the
Teleport Incident
 occurs causing the citizens of Buena Village to be teleported randomly through out the
Human World
. Three years later, Rudeus manages to return to Buena Village but all that is left are the ruins of their house and the village is abandoned. Rudeus then decides to head to the northern regions of the
Central Continent
 to search for his missing families.

Sharia






Rudeus, Cliff and Zanoba preparing to exorcise the "Haunted" House



Rudeus eventually receives news that
Zenith
 has been located and ceases his search and at the suggestion of
Elinalise Dragonroad
, he goes to
Ranoa Magic Academy
 to continue his studies where he eventually reunites with
Sylphiette
.
 With plans of marrying her, Rudeus decides to look for a house to settle down and finds a listing for one that is rumored to be haunted. Due to his reputation as "Rudeus the
Quagmire
" and also listing his guarantors to be
Ariel Anemoi Asura
 and
Badigadi
, he managed to lower the price of the house. Still interested in buying the house despite being haunted, Rudeus is assisted by
Zanoba Shirone
 and
Cliff Grimoire
 to exorcise the house which turns out that the ghost is an automated doll.

Layout






Sharia Greyrat House Layout



With the house "exorcised", Rudeus begins renovations and hires
Balda
 of the Great Cave for the repairs and to avoid further expenses, Rudeus also provided the materials for the repairs with his Earth Magic. From Balda's inspection he describes the floor to be oddly well made but the walls and ceiling are shoddy as if the basement is the most important part of the house and everything else is just extra.

"I picked a color close to your original hair for the roof. You might not have liked your hair, but I really did."

-Rudeus to Sylphiette

The Greyrat House in Sharia is located at the Student District of the city, built over a century ago that has an untended garden; walls, ceiling had water damage; roof leaking during rains and walls shrouded in moss and shriveled vines making it look more like an abandoned ruin than a house. After the renovation, the walls and stones are polished and cleaned with the roof painted bright green.

Door

The Front Doors were knocked down by Zanoba when they exorcised the house so Rudeus replaced it with double doors made of expensive wood shaved down to fit the frame and the outside slab has a knocker in the form of a lion head. A
Magic Circle
 is also drawn at the edge of the door as a security measure that causes a loud noise if the door is forced open which echoes throughout the house.

Main Hall

"I decided to buy only the bare essentials of furniture for now. Perhaps it was just the Japanese part of me talking, but I felt like I should save the rest for myself and Sylphie to decide on together."

-Rudeus

Beyond the front door is the main hall that has a stairs leading to the second floor and behind it is another stairs to the basement while the doors on each side leads to the living rooms. Despite the hall being in ruins, it has excellent natural lightings.
 After the renovation, the ceilings has been restored with bright wooden panels that eliminates the concern of water leaking when it rains.

Bathroom






Rudeus and Sylphy inspecting the Bathroom tub



Before the renovation, the bathroom is a second kitchen later converted to a bathroom since it was initially used for washing so most of the bathroom's plumbing are kept in tact since most of its interior structure does not appear to be used much but the floorings are replaced from stones to tiles and has a large tub is placed at the end of the room.  The bathroom in the house was made at the request of Rudeus that is normally seen in the house of nobilities
which also caused rumors about him that despite his carelessness for his clothing, he loved cleanliness and bathed almost everyday.

Living Room

The Greyrat House has 2 living rooms which is a large, warm family-oriented room. The room has a 3 seater sofa, 2 single seater sofa around the fireplace and a nearby jug and water that gives the feeling of a relaxing home.

Kitchen






Rudeus and Sylphy in the Kitchen



Before the renovation, the Greyrat House has 2 kitchens but only the first 1 has a kiln giving the impression that it was 2 houses merged into one. After the renovation, the kiln is refurbished and the kitchen also hosted an assortment of the newest cooking equipment, a counter large enough to butcher an entire boar and a cooking stove with a gigantic pot. There are also casks, jars and other sorts of containers for storage purposes.

Basement






Rudeus praying at the shrine at the basement



The Basement is initially where the automated doll stays when inactive at a hidden room. After Rudeus moves into the house, he turns the basement to be his private study while the hidden room becomes the shrine for her Goddesses and their relics.
Aisha
 eventually discovers the shrine and uses it to as a means to get what she wants such as getting Rudeus to agree in keeping
Beat
 as their pet.

Hitogami
 attempted to manipulate Rudeus in to releasing the mouse infected with
Magic Stone Disease
 but he was stopped by an
old man
 before he could enter the basement.

Bedrooms

Meanwhile, Ariel is in a secret dispute with her brother Grabel over succession to Asura's throne, her most loyal supporters being her other bodyguard Luke and his father Lord Pilemon Notos Greyrat. Later, Ariel learns that Sylphie suffers from nightmares about the Teleport Incident, and Ariel confides that she has nightmares about her own near death experience as well. The two decide to sleep together for the night, then later that night Sylphie fights off and manages to defeat Nights Eye Crow sent by Grabel and Darius to assassinate Ariel.

Hitogami
========

Information

Chronology

Hitogami
 (
ヒトガミ
,

Hitogami
)
 is the self-proclaimed
Human God
 (
人神

,

Hito-shin

, lit. "Man-God")
 and the sworn enemy of Dragon God
Orsted
.

Spoilers ahead!

Initially a supporting character, aiding
Rudeus
 by offering helpful advice, he later becomes the overarching antagonist of the series following the revelation that he actually sought to prevent the birth of
Rudeus' children
, who are prophesied to kill him one day.
He is the physically oldest being in Mushoku Tensei Verse.

Appearance

He has a blank white face coupled with a grin that eludes memory, which gives off the feeling that his face is covered in a mosaic.

Personality

Hitogami appears friendly and casual when communicating with his apostles, but he is actually a manipulative trickster who pulls strings behind the scenes. He seems to derive a sick sense of enjoyment from tricking people into destroying what they value the most, and laughing at their despaired faces afterwards. He is also a sore loser that throws tantrums when things aren't going his way.

Background

Hitogami's exact origins is unknown. It is known that after the
Creator God
's death, unbeknownst to anyone, he was born within the
Void World
. At some point in the distant past, the being who would come to be known as Hitogami killed or otherwise usurped the
original Human God
 and took his form. He then began manipulating the
First Dragon God
 and his five Dragon Generals into destroying the other four worlds and then proceeded to help the survivors of those ruined worlds to flee into the
Human World
. When the five Dragon Generals turned on the Dragon God and weakened him, Hitogami took that opportunity to strike a fatal blow to the Dragon God and then destroy the Dragon World. However before Hitogami's victory was complete, the dying Dragon God used the last of his power to trap Hitogami within the Void World.

He is the sworn enemy of
Orsted
 as he was the one that caused the fall of the First Dragon God, Orsted's father. Despite not being able to physically manifest in the Human World, he was still pulling the strings from behind the scene by appearing in people's dreams, manipulating them as his "apostles". During the
Second Great Human-Demon War
, he convinced
Badigadi
 to steal the Golden Armor from Demon Dragon God
Laplace
 and fight him head on, resulting in the huge explosion that formed the
Ringus Sea
 and Laplace being split into two beings. He is currently still sealed in the
Void between the worlds
, presenting himself as the god associated with humans.

Note: This section is under construction and revision
.

Power and Abilities

Not much is currently known about Hitogami's Powers.

He is automatically trusted by all inhabitants of the
Six-Faced World
, except members of the
Dragon Tribe
 as well as otherworlders and their descendants.

He has the ability to talk to people in their dreams.

When he speaks with people in their dreams, he's able to read their minds.

His powers won't work on non-human opponents, like spirits.

Being the physically oldest in the world coupled with the power of all seeing eyes, he has very high knowledge of magic and history surpassing that of even Orsted.

According to the First Dragon God, he has Divine powers being able to destroy the Dragon World with a single strike. He is without a doubt one of the strongest characters in the series with his powers possibly being second only to Orsted.

『Divine Powers』

While Hitogami Full Powers are still unknown, he is powerful enough to destroy the Dragon World with a single attack. The first Dragon God implied that he is so powerful that only another god can kill him.

『Future Sight』

He has the ability to see the future, probably the strongest one there is as he can see nearly 100 years into the future (when looking at his own future only), but according to
Orsted
 the more apostles he controls the more his future sight becomes vague, and because of this ability he can also adjust the future to a certain extent. He can likely control only three apostles at the same time because he is always using much of his own future sight to look at his own future constantly and trying to control it in a way that would benefit him.

『All-Seeing Eyes』

Like Kishirika's All-Seeing Eyes, he can see anywhere in the world except places with high mana concentration.

Achievements

Successfully tricked the previous dragon god into destroying the other races' worlds, forcing them to migrate to the human world and effectively creating the setting of Mushoku Tensei.

Drove
Pax Shirone
 into suicide via his apostles and prevented the formation of the Republic of Shirone, thus foiling Orsted's plan to pinpoint and kill Laplace when he is newly born
.

Alternate Timeline

Indirectly killing
Roxy
 during pregnancy and effectively preventing the birth of
Lara
, whom is prophesied to play a key role in his death.

Taking over
Asura Kingdom
 through his apostles.

Quotes

To Rudeus:
 “Ah, you see, last time my advice didn’t turn out so well for you, did it? So it was a bit hard for me to show myself again.”

Trivia

In the Seven seas version of the light novel, Hitogami is called Man-God, meanwhile in the seven seas version of the manga he is called Hitogami.

He is the only character of the anime adaptation that is animated with CGI.

It was speculated by Laplace that the source of Hitogami Divine Powers is the Corpse of the Creator God.

By his own admission, the world will end if he dies.

References

Hitogami/Chronology
===================

Information

Chronology

Mushoku Tensei

He first appears after the Mana Calamity which teleported Rudeus and Eris to the Demon Continent. He advises Rudeus to trust and help Ruijerd. Rudeus immediately finds him suspicious. However over time he starts to trust him after all of the beneficial advice Hitogami has given him. However it seems that the Human God is constantly working against Rudeus, and Rudeus just has strange luck that everything works out for him. However when the future Rudeus comes back to the current time it is revealed that the Human God will cause the death of everyone Rudeus cares about. This is because the Human God sees a future where Orsted teams up with Rudeus's descendants to kill the Human God. To counter this future he tells Rudeus that he will not be left alone unless he kills Orsted. However after Rudeus and Orsted fight Rudeus joins the fight against the Human God as long as Orsted promises to defend his family. Although Hitogami cannot speak to Rudeus anymore, he still has many apostles. During the events of the Asura Kingdom Chapter, Hitogami manipulated Darius, Reida, and Luke. Hitogami manipulated Geese the entire time and had him take Zenith out of Cliff's house and deliver her to the Latreia House.

Mushoku Tensei Sequel

Hitogami's fate is one of the major story threads that remained unresolved by the end of Mushoku Tensei. However, Rudeus did see a vision where his and
Roxy's
 daughter,
Lara
, helped
Orsted
 and an unknown individual, presumably
Shinohara Akito
, reach his realm to finally kill him. This implies that Hitogami will once again be a major antagonist in the planned sequel series.

A Human Race family from the Human World in the Anime



Humans
 (人族,
Jinzoku
) are the main race that lives in the Human World, ruled by the Human God.

Appearance

The Humans of the Human World have similar appearances to the humans on earth with the exception that Humans on the Human World having black hair is quite uncommon.

Background

Six-Faced World
 Era

Humans are the main race that dwells in the
Human World
 during the
Six-Faced World
 Era 10, 000 to 20, 000 years ago and is ruled by the
Human God
. Under the Human God's guidance, the humans were able to thrive faster and advance their civilization greatly ahead of the other five worlds from words and letters to communal living and forming a social order.
The Human God wishes to share this to all the other gods to help advance their respective civilization and the summit of the
Gods
 is formed with aims for the prosperity of all civilizations of the Six Worlds.

In exchange for the Human's knowledge, the other races also passed on their own knowledge and strength to the human race such as: The
Dragon Tribe
 teaches how to use the inner power of the body known as
Battle Aura
; The Demon Race teaches how to empower and transform their body so as to withstand the Battle Aura; The
Beast Race
 teaches how to tame ferocious beasts; The Ocean Race teaches how to purify water and keep it clean; And the Heaven Race teaches how to read the wind and control the weather.

Age of Chaos

The Age of Chaos Era is the period from
8,000 - 10, 000 years ago
 in the aftermath of the other five worlds being destroyed at the hands of the
First Dragon God
 and the surviving denizens fled to the Human World. The Human World was once an endless grasslands and hills now it has terrain features of the other worlds before they were destroyed. Most of the surviving race settled in continents that matches their previous world but the Humans and Demons are at ceaseless conflict on where to settle since at this time, the
Central Continent
 and
Demon Continent
 is a single massive continent called the Grand Continent.

First Human-Demon War

Around
7,000 years ago
,
Magic
 and martial skills has greatly advanced, as well as the population of the humans increased.
 However the
Mana
 also caused the younger humans to be afflicted with a disease called
Drain Syndrome
 but the disease was eventually eradicated as the human body adapt and increased their magic power.

It is also during this time that the conflict between the humans and demons escalated into a Great War called the First Human-Demon War led by Demon Empress
Kishirika Kishirisu
 and her 5 Great Demon Kings which lasted a thousand years with an interval of fierce battle and lulls between. Around 6,000 years ago, the Humans is lead by the Hero
Ars
 and together with his 6 comrades, they lead the fight until Kishirika and her Demon Kings are defeated. For his victory, the capital city of
Asura Kingdom
 is named after Ars which becomes the largest city in the Human World.

Second Human-Demon War

Around
5,500 years ago
, the Humans being victorious on the previous war that resulted to the demons being enslaved, they grew drunk with power and begin warring other races and among themselves that lasted for next 500 years. 5,000 years ago, Kishirika revives and once again rallies the demons to another war for vengeance for a thousand year grudge. The demon army established an alliance with the
Beast Race
 and
Ocean Race
 against the humans who were backed into a corner but they refused to surrender and continue to fight for the next 800 years.

Around
4200 years ago
, the Golden Knight
Aldebaran
 routes over 10,000 enemies by himself and the humans were able to push the demons back. Aldebaran also defeats all the powerful demons which also makes him a legend and an entry in history believes that he is the
Human God
 himself. But in the battle of Aldebaran against the
Fighting God
, Aldebaran's final attack causes the Grand Continent to implode, splitting it to several continents. With the continents now split and separated by
Ringus Sea
, the Second Human-Demon War ends where most of the humans settled in the
Central Continent
 or the southern region of the
Millis Continent
.

Traits

During the Six-Faced World era, the Human race is a weak race with the shortest lifespan which also forced them to learn quickly. However due to the Human World being rich in nature and abundant food, the Human race thrived faster than any other race, that causes their civilization to advance.

''Note: This section is under construction and revision''.

Culture

In the
Asura Kingdom
, the Humans there only celebrate their birthday every 5 years where they are given gifts or celebrate parties especially by the nobility and by reaching 15 years old you are considered an adult.

Marriage is used as a recognition of a strong connection between families with the general notion that the head of the family decides on the marriage of their family members

In the Shirone Kingdom, the husband sends a gift to the bride's family over time while in the Milis Kingdom, where the family of the bride gives the husband a present while husband helps out when something is going on in the bride's home.

Humans with last names is usually seen among the nobilities as proof they are part of this family but those left their families also relinquish a portion of their last name as proof like
Eris Boreas Greyrat
 and
Paul Greyrat
 relinquishing their Boreas and Notos names respectively.

Human-Demon Wars
================

The
Human-Demon Wars
 (人魔大戦
Jinma Taisen
) were three wars fought between the
Demon Race
 and the
Human Race
. The first two wars were waged by Great Demon Empress
Kishirika Kishirisu
, known as the
Great Human-Demon War
, to reign superiority over the Human Race. But the third war was waged by Demon God
Laplace
 in his own name, referred to as the
Laplace War
, as an outcome of his hatred of the Human Race.

First Great Human-Demon War

The
First Great Human-Demon War
 (第一次人魔大戦
Daiichiji Hito-Ma Taisen
) is the first great war between the Human Race and the Demon Race which was fought between
6000 - 7000 years
 prior to the main story. Kishirika Kishirisu, the Great Demon Empress, and the Five Great Demon Kings led the Demons against the Humans. This war was fought before the splitting of the
Central Continent
 and the
Demon Continent
, when the Humans and the Demons still lived in one landmass known as the
Great Continent
. The war lasted for approximately a millennium, repeating constantly between a state of fierce battle and relaxation. Finally the hero of humanity Ars and his six comrades ended the long war following the defeat the Five Great Demon Kings and the Demon Empress Kishirika.

Second Great Human-Demon War

The
Second Great Human-Demon War
 (第二次人魔大戦
Daiiniji Hito-Ma Taisen
) is the second great war between the Human Race and the Demon Race which was fought between
5000 - 4200 years
 prior to the main story. The Great Demon Empress Kishirika Kishirisu, seeking vengeance for a thousand-year old grudge, brought the
Beast Race
 and
Ocean Race
 to the Demon side and waged war for the second time against the Human Race. This time the Human Race was pushed back and cornered but the war still went on for several centuries without surrendering.

At the time of distress of the Humans, the Demon Dragon King
Laplace
 joined the war to annihilate the Demon Army singlehandedly which allowed the Human Army to retake their frontlines. Laplace was eventually defeated by the
Fighting God
 who was an Apostle of
Hitogami
. On the verge of death, Laplace performed the reincarnation
Magic
 of the
Dragon Race
 but the spell went out of control and the released force of
Mana
 was so strong that it split the Great Continent into two - now known as the Central Continent and the Demon Continent - forming a new sea in the middle now referred to as the
Ringus Sea
. This event marked the end of the Second Great Human-Demon War which lasted for 800 years.

Laplace War

The
Laplace War
 (ラプラス戦役
Rapurasu Sen'eki
) was a war that lasted between
500 - 400 years
 prior to the main story. Though it lasted much shorter than the previous wars, the humans were forced into a war far more brutal than any they had fought before. The one who united all the Demons of the Demon Continent and launched this assault against the Humans was the
Demon God Laplace
 - a human-hating Demon who was split from the failed reincarnation attempt of Demon Dragon King Laplace in the previous war.

Demon God Laplace spawned approximately a thousand years ago. In a extremely short period of time, he rallied the Demons and conquered the Demon Continent. For many years he cultivated his empire, building his race to be tough and fierce. After long years, he pulled the Beast Race and the Ocean Race over to his side.

Laplace began his military campaign approximately 500 years ago. The invasion began from the south, drawing all the humans' military power there. Then he set his wyrms upon the land, making passage through the mountains impossible. After that he took the humans by storm, attacking with a separate unit from the north, scattering his enemies. In a short time, he had gained total control of the north and the south. Then from both directions, he pressed his assault on the western region.

Forced into a corner, the humans took their last gamble. The
Seven Heroes
 convinced the Ocean Race to lift their blockade, then set out on the seas for the Millis Continent. Now allied with the demons, the Beast Race had taken control of the Holy City of Millis. So the Seven Heroes took the clan leaders' children hostage and threatened them into cooperation. The Seven Heroes, leading the
Holy Knights of Millis
 and the Beast Race, launched a decisive battle and assaulted Laplace's main stronghold.

After a violent confrontation, four of the Seven Heroes were dead, but they successfully sealed Laplace away and destroyed his closest companions. Though Laplace was defeated, the humans were greatly exhausted from the long battle and couldn't keep up to fight anymore. Instead, they signed a treaty with one of the Demon Kings who wasn't allied with Laplace and the blockade on the Demon Continent was lifted. According to the terms of the treaty, racial discrimination was prohibited and demons could now freely travel to other continents.

Trivia

Demon Dragon King Laplace joined the human side of the Second Great Human-Demon War under the false name of
Aldebaran
 who was nicknamed the Golden Knight.

Demon Dragon King Laplace, who was a Demon-Dragon hybrid, split into two beings after his failed reincarnation attempt - Technique God and Demon God. Technique God retained his Dragon Race side and all his knowledge; Demon God retained his Demon Race side and his hatred for the
Human God
, eventually forgetting the "God" part his hatred mistakenly turned towards the Human Race itself.

During the First Human-Demon War, the great elven swordsman Idaztleid fought and was killed by the great demon king
Necross Lacross
 but almost no one today remembers this event.

Plot

Rudeus admits he loves Slyphie as well, but to his dismay he cannot make love to her since his impotence still isn't fully cured. Sylphie reports back to Ariel and Luke, with Luke agreeing to help Sylphie find a cure for Rudeus' impotence out of sympathy for him. Luke gifts Sylphie a rare and powerful aphrodisiac that should counter Rudeus' impotence while Ariel provides some advice on how to seduce him. Sylphie meets Rudues later that night and they both imbibe the aphrodisiac, which helps push them to make love. The next morning, after realizing that Sylphie hasn't abandoned him, Rudeus experiences an emotional catharsis and overcomes the trauma caused by Eris leaving him, and is cured of his impotence. Rudeus then thanks Ariel for her help by pledging his loyalty to her, and then asks for Sylphie's hand in marriage which she accepts. Ariel releases Sylphie from her obligation to disguise herself as Fitz and accepts Rudeus as part of her inner circle. Sylphie then thanks Ariel and Luke for everything they've done for her.

Into the Labyrinth
==================

Into the Labyrinth
 (迷宮入り)
Meikyūiri
) is the twentieth episode of the
second season
 (44th overall)
Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on June 2, 2024 and also the second episode of the
Labyrinth Arc
 for the Anime.

Synopsis

Upon arriving at the labyrinth city of Rapan, Rudeus and Elinalise quickly find Geese who brings them to Paul and Lilia. Rudeus gently speaks to the exhausted and haggard Paul, who is lamenting he is unable to rescue Zenith. They discuss the conquest of the Teleport Labyrinth where Zenith is supposed to be, but Roxy, who should be there, is nowhere to be found...

Plot

Rudeus and Elinalise finally arrives at Rapan where Rudeus intends to meet with Paul's group first so Elinalise suggests to head to the Adventurer Guild Headquarters and look for Paul or Geese where the latter would establish his information network being the party's
Thief
. Upon looking around, they immediately find Geese who is trying to enlist a male
Beast Race
 but is refused then Elinalise calls out Geese who approaches them. Geese is surprised on how quickly they arrived since it was only 6 months since he sent the letter and were expecting them in another 6 months. After agreeing to delay the details of their situations, Rudeus asks Geese to takes them to his father which suprises Geese on how his "Boss" has grown up and asks to be called as he did before. The two explain their
history
 to Elinalise, Geese brings them to the Inn where Paul is staying.

Before entering the Inn, Geese tells them Paul is in a bad shape then asks Elinalise and Rudeus to avoid picking a fight with him for now to which Elinalise refuses to make any promises and Rudeus agrees. Upon entering the Inn, Paul, Vierra and Lilia are there where Lilia wakes up Paul. After confirming he is not dreaming, Paul also remarks how fast Rudeus arrives to which Rudeus mentions a "
unique method
" they used to travel. Paul hugs him and laments he is unable to rescue
Zenith
 to which Rudeus affirms it is enough reason to take the journey. Paul also remarks how Rudeus has grown but is surprised that Rudeus is about to have a
child
. Paul then approaches Elinalise and bends his knee to apologize to which Elinalise also admits she is partially at fault too and extends her hand to help Paul stand up.

Paul the mentions how Elinalise was able to last the journey due to her
Curse of Promiscuity
 that Elinalise mentions it was thanks to the
Curse Supressing Tool
 created by
Cliff
, her husband which even surprises Paul.

Paul then explains the situation that Zenith is captured in the Teleporation Labyrinth which is a day's travel north from Rapan and it is still unknown if she is still alive after 6 years according to the intel gathered by Geese. Talhand and Shierra arrives at the inn from shopping where the Talhand confirms Rudeus is Paul's son. But as Paul continues the discussion, Rudeus inquires where is Roxy that causes everyone to be tense and Paul tells him that she is missing for a month already. Rudeus is horrified and asks is she is dead but deep inside he'd rather not hear it. Paul elaborates she stepped into a Teleportation Circle and has disappeared while Geese and Talhand argues that she could still be alive despite their five attempts to look for her for the past month. After recovering from the shock with Elinalise's help, he is told that the labyrinth in question is the Teleportation Labyrinth and is considered S-rank in difficulty. Upon hearing this, brings out the "An Exploratory Account of the Teleportation Labyrinth" book he borrowed from the library of
Ranoa Magic Academy
 and after reading it, Geese is delighted that all the details they need to clear even the sixth floor are detailed in the book so Paul then proceeds to discuss their formation.

That night, Rudeus, Paul and Lilia shares the same room where Lilia mentions it is their first time sharing a room then they talk about
Aisha
 who Rudeus mentions that she is a big help and wishes that she was a little more selfish. This made Paul laugh who was also listening. Then they talk about Rudeus'
wedding
 with
Sylphiette
 which relieves Lilia upon hearing Sylphy is alive but Paul is surprised that Rudeus is not married to
Eris
. After exchanging apologies once again, Rudeus and Paul have a light talk about their past exploits to the chagrin of Lilia.

Next day, at the cave entrance of the Teleportation Labyrinth, Rudeus takes over Vierra's role of Magician and Healer, Elinalise is the Tank that was the previous role of Shierra, Paul is the secondary attacker, Talhand can be a Magician or secondary attacker and Geese is the scout. While Lilia, Shierra and Vierra are the support team will return to Rapan for supplies acquisition and other house sitting maintenance.

As they progress through the Labyrinth, Geese and Rudeus each uses
Summon Lamlight Spirit
 scrolls to light the way that Talhands praises the convenience it brings and Paul acknowledges as Rudeus is his pride and joy. As they walk, Rudeus explains how some Teleportation Circles does not glow but will transport them anyway so the party is following the footprints that has a cross-shaped mark that Geese creates with his special pair of boots for scouting until they encounter a
Tarantula Deathlord
 where Elinalise moves to position to tank it but Paul runs ahead and kills it with his
dual

swords
.

Although everyone in the party is aware that Paul showing off to Rudeus and moves on, Elinalise tells him off for being in beaking formation. Paul tries explains he is trying to loosen their nerves but Elinalise rebukes him as he is showing the same excitement when Zenith joined their
party
 in the past. When Paul mentions that Elinalise is nagging him more than usual, she responds that he is like a son to her as Paul dismisses the notion to be a joke while Rudeus watches amusingly but didn't tell Paul he is now Elinalise's son due to Rudeus' marrieage to Sylphy, her granddaughter.

They finally reach the Teleportation Circle to the second floor but are guarded by a lot of Tarantula Deathlords and before engaging to battle, Talhand reminds Rudeus not to use
Fire Magic
 due to Carbon Monoxide poisoning; not to attack the ceiling to avoid cave ins; and to also avoid water magic but instead use Ice Magic to avoid softening the ground that might cause it to collapse.

As Paul and Elinalise kills their share of Tarantula Deathlords, Rudeus uses
Blizzard Storm
 that kills a large number of Tarantula Deathlords, that Talhand praises that he is indeed Roxy's apprentice.

Looking at the Teleportation Labyrinth Book, Geese confirms the Teleportation Circle leads to the second floor and they all step in together.

After battling a few more Tarantula Deathlords at the Second Floor, Paul calls for a quick break where Paul, Geese and Rudeus checks and clean up their gear while Elinalise and Talhand are on the lookout. As they are resting, Geese mentions that the third floor's Teleportation Circles will only send people on the same floor and hopefully find Roxy there.

Upon reaching the third floor, Geese consults with Rudeus on where might Roxy be with his intuition and after a few moments, Rudeus suddenly stops causing the party to question him as he approaches a wall then shows a worried expression.

Somewhere in the third floor, armies of Tarantula Deathlords,
Iron Crawlers
 and
Mad Skulls
 are battling Roxy who casts
Earth Fortress
 that stops the advance of the Iron Crawlers but they crawl its wall. Roxy then casts
Water Splash
 to soak the monsters then follows up with
Icicle Field
 to freeze the wet monsters in place then finishes them off with Blizzard Storm. After defeating the wave of monsters, Roxy is breathing heavily but more monsters appear from the Teleportation Circle, and narrowly dodges a mud ball thrown by a Mad Skull that destroys a portion of the Earth Fortress where an Iron Crawler enter. Roxy strikes one of the Iron Crawlers with
Flame Slice
 then tries to cast another Earth Fortress but cannot do so due to exhaustion as more Iron Crawlers break the Earth Fortress. This causes Roxy to panic and tries to strike them with his staff but a Tarantula Deathlord shoots a web to knock the staff off her hand. Unable to fight back anymore, Roxy calls for help and shuts her eyes tight as the Iron Crawlers approach her.

Moments later, Roxy opens her eyes thinking she died but is surprised that she sees a world of ice where all monsters are frozen in place like white statues and the Mad Skulls at the back are frozen to their core as one of the frozen skull falls off. Roxy then sees Rudeus walking pass the frozen monsters to approach her and is relieved to see Roxy and smiles as Roxy looks on blushing.

Isolte Cruel
============

Information

Story

Relationships

Isolde Cluel
 (
イゾルテ
・
クルーエル
)
 is the granddaughter of the late Water God,
Reida Lia
, trained in the Water God Style. Introduced initially as a Water King, she later on becomes a Water Emperor. By the events of
Redundant Reincarnation
, she becomes the next Water God, taking on the name of
Reida Lia
 in accordance to the title's tradition.

Appearance

Isolde is a very beautiful woman with a round face and long, black (ultramarine) silky hair who appears to be in her twenties. She is noted to resemble her grandmother and is likened to a beautiful blue flower by her future husband,
Doga
. When
Rudeus Greyrat
 saw her for the first time, he remarked that she is stunning in looks.
 Later on, he says her smile is a beautiful thing to witness; she looks like the prim and proper type but there is a hint of allurement about her too. He surmised he could see her as "the sexy wife next door."
 A few years later, Rudeus still considered her beautiful from her face to the way she holds herself after expressing gratitude for her assistance in battle.

She is usually seen wearing the Asuran royal knight armor complete with helmet and carries a sword by her hip.

Personality

Isolde is highly loyal to her family and friends, defending them and easily becoming hostile to people who mistreat them. Isolde is also very proud of her sword style, looking with contempt at the Sword God Style users when she first entered their territory, but later coming to respect it. She is studious and open to improving her own battle skills, such as in Sword Sanctum and in the battle against the
Fighting God
, but also able to impart tactful advice to other swordsmen such as
Nina Fallion
 and Eris Greyrat. Isolde is good at reading people, such as when she realized that Rudeus took good care of
Eris Greyrat
 without him saying anything. She can also be a little bit manipulative, being able to pacify Eris' provocations in a way that makes Rudeus describe as "throwing a bone to a dog."

She is a Millis follower, having the conviction of one man and one woman when it comes to marriage and love, and thus was outraged when she found out Rudeus already had two wives in addition to considering taking her dear friend Eris as his third.

Isolde is morally good and righteous but can be shallow and is particularly picky about a man's looks when it comes to preferences. However, a person's personality and integrity is far more important and even makes a man look more attractive to her if they possess good qualities. Eventually, she chose Doga for his inherently good nature and love for her. As a married couple, Isolde calls Doga 'darling' when in private.

Background

Isolde is the granddaughter of the famous Water God Reida Lia. Her father had no surname due to Reida abandoning hers, and instead Isolde took up her mother's surname. Her parents had died at an early age, leaving her older brother Tantris to take care of her.

Possessing raw natural talent for swordsmanship, she eventually surpasses her older brother under the age of ten to become the next prized pupil of Reida Lia. This leads her on a journey towards becoming even stronger, eventually crossing paths with Eris Greyrat and
Nina Farion
, her two rivals and also closest friends.

Power and Abilities

Isolde is a powerful swordsman trained in the Water God Style and serves as one of
Asura's Seven Knights
 under the rulership of
Ariel Anemoi Asura
, the
King's Greatshield
. A prodigy from birth, she had more raw talent than her older brother Tantris Cluel, an upper-level swordsman in the Water God Style, and surpassed him under the age of 10.
 As a Water King, she was able to easily defeat
Eris Greyrat
 while training in the Sword Sanctum. As a Water Emperor, she was able to stall the
Fighting God
 for an extended period of time. She was entrusted the future of Water God Style by her late grandmother and would later on become the next Water God as
Reida Lia.

She also becomes a palace sword instructor and operates several dojos across Asura Kingdom as the next carrier of the Water God Style.

『Water God Style』

As an expert practitioner of the Water God Style, Isolde excels in reading the emotions of her opponents and using her surroundings for defensive and counter maneuvers, able to use elementary techniques such as
Flow
. She is able to do this with such elegance and finesse that would gain her the admiration of many nobles and swordsmen. Having surpassed the level of Advanced, she is also able to self-consciously use
Battle Aura
 to enhance her physical attributes.

Upon introduction as a Water King, she is able to easily defeat Sword Saint Eris Greyrat in sparring, warding off everything Eris threw at her and answering with a bunch of sharp counters. Over the course of that bout, which had lasted less than 30 minutes, Eris would have "died" nearly a hundred times.

Later on as Water Emperor, she is able to deflect all of the Fighting God's attacks against her and striking back with her own, moving with grace and precision. Her technique made the Fighting God's violent blows - any one of which could have been lethal - and turn them into something inconsequential like a child's tantrum. Rudeus notes that in a one-on-one battle, she may have been able to give the Fighting God a good fight (but still not win).

As Water God Reida Lia, she is sad to have mastered at least three of the five Water God Style's secret arts. She is still able to defeat a more seasoned Eris Greyrat in all of their multiple mock battles, although the matches were never decided by a single blow because of Eris' tenacity and ability to counter sometimes.

Quotes

Isolde:
“Thank you as well, Eris."

Eris:
“…I’ll land one on you tomorrow.”

Isolde:
“I look forward to it.”

Isolde:
“What’s so weird? This is the official armor of the Asuran Royal knights… I thought it was rather impressive.”

Eris:
“Looks hard to move around in, though.”

Isolde:
“With the Water God Style, you don’t have to move very much. This suits me perfectly.”

Isolde:
“Please, Eris, don’t even joke about that. I have an obligation to protect the training halls of my style. The last thing I need is to suffer some lifelong injury fighting a crazed hellcat like you."

Eris:
“Who cares about a bunch of musty training halls, anyway?"

Isolde:
“I suppose it would seem odd to a girl who fled her house and her responsibilities. But for some of us, our obligations are very real.”

Rudeus:
"And thank you, Isolde. If you hadn't stood between me and the Fighting God, I'd be dead."

Isolde:
"Not at all! It was a highly educational battle. I should be thanking you."

(To Doga's proposal): "
I'm yours, if you'll have me.
"

Trivia

Though it's stated in the novels that Isolde has black hair, Rifujin notes it's better off as
ultramarine
 in color when done by an artist since black hair is rare in the setting.

Isolde became one of the
Seven Knights of Asura
 known as the
King's Greatshield
.

After her husband Doga "quitted" his position as Ariel's nightly bodyguard, Isolde became Ariel's own personal bodyguard with Doga protecting Isolde (all to the benefit of Ariel).

Isolde's beauty is often commented by Rudeus, surmising that he could see her as "the sexy wife next door."

When Isolde and Doga married, Rudeus thought that Isolde might have manipulated or tricked Doga into marrying her. Once he saw that the two were truly in love, he gave his blessings to the couple's marriage.

By the events of Web Novel 17 (Light Novel 14), Reida had already mastered 2 out of the 5 secret arts of Water God Style.

Though there were others who had mastered 3 out of 5 secret arts of Water God Style by the time Isolde did, they either: 1) couldn't surpass her, 2) had various other reasons, 3) had a wife and kids, 4) acknowledged Isolde as the true Water God.

In
Redundant Reincarnation Volume 3
, Isolte's real name is never mentioned; she only goes by her title Water God
Reida Lia
.

Isolte Cruel/Relationships
==========================

Information

Story

Relationships

Doga





Doga confessing to Isolde a second time after he quits his position as one of Asura's Seven Royal Knights.



Doga is her husband whom she affectionately calls 'darling' in private. Initially acquaintances by virtue of their positions, Doga first took notice of Isolde in a match against her where she won by a landslide, remarking she moved like a "graceful and beautiful flower." It was then when he fell in love with Isolde.

When Doga confessed to her with the help of Ariel, Isolde was so smitten with Doga giving up his job and wanting to protect her, that she was reminded of the first Water God's story about how he gave everything up for a princess. Isolde considers Doga to be far above the countless Asuran nobles in terms of character and personality with whom she's interviewed, regardless of looks. She accepted his proposal and they got to know each other for one year, after which they married. They have one daughter.

When Rudeus spied on them, he noted that Doga looked extremely happy, and that the couple were lovey-dovey with each other.

Doga is considered to be better than Isolde at being the 'househusband' from cooking to cleaning, which makes her monotone as she admits this.

Reida Lia

Reida Lia is Isolde's grandmother as well as her master. As her prized pupil, Isolde held a high opinion of her and would listen to her requests such as extended training in the Sword Sanctum. They were close enough that Reida considered her as her successor to the Water God Style. When Reida died at the hands of Dragon God Orsted, Isolde was visibly distraught and overcome with fury against him. It took her a few days after the incident to get over the grief of losing her master, but noted with respect that she at least died a swordsman's death - rare for this day and age.

Eris Greyrat





Isolde approaches Eris at Ars Capital in Asura Kingdom.



Eris is one of the few friends she made at the Sword Sanctum and still keeps in touch with. When Isolde first met Eris, she held a patronizing view of her along with the rest of Sword God Style. This was reinforced by the fact that she easily beat Eris, a Sword Saint with speed and power approaching Ghislaine's at the time. However, thanks to Nina and the three-way deadlock among the three girls, Isolde was able to properly teach and learn from Eris thereby initiating a real friendship.

During Eris' departure, Isolde gets upset on her behalf for Rudeus' brazen letter suggesting Eris be taken in as his third wife, showing concern for her friend. When Eris later visits Ars Capital in Asura Kingdom, Isolde calls out to Eris and briefly catches up with her.

After the conflict where Ariel secures her position to the throne, Isolde visits Eris again and makes peace with her, not blaming her, Rudeus, or Ghislaine for Reida Lia's death. She takes Eris around for a tour of the city and genuinely enjoyed her time with each other.

Isolde is experienced at handling Eris and her explosive personality. After backing down from a provoked challenge and defusing the situation, she was regarding Eris with the patronizing smile of someone who’d just tossed a dog a bone.

As
Ars Greyrat
 noted in his encounters with various swordsmen, Isolde was among those who said that Eris isn't an opponent who could be defeated so easily.

Isolte Cruel/Story
==================

Information

Story

Relationships

Volume 13

Isolde, a
Water King
, accompanies her master
Reida Lia
 to the Sword Sanctum at the request of
Gall Falion
. In the
Asura Kingdom
, Isolde has no equal among her fellow disciples of the
Water God Style
 and has become arrogant, which saddens Reida as she senses that in the past year, Isolde hasn't grown at all despite taking her training seriously but in conceit. After Gall and Reida propose a bout between their students, Isolde exchange introductions with
Nina Fallion
 and
Eris Greyrat
, then first fights against Eris. Despite Eris' speed being in the top 10 among the students of the
Sword God Style
 and strength close to Sword King
Ghislaine Dedoldia
, Isolde defeats Eris to the point where she is unable to land a hit on Isolde (Eris would have "died" almost a hundred times). However, Nina defeats Isolde with 1 hit as she could not sense any bloodlust from Nina's attack and thus could not counterattack accordingly. Gall and Reida then have an agreement that from dawn to noon, Isolde, Eris, and Nina will train with their respective teachers, and from noon to dusk, the three will practice and train together.

Volume 14

One month later, a strange triple deadlock has formed where Eris beats Nina, Nina beats Isolde, and Isolde beats Eris. On one of the three's discussions, Isolde points out that Eris' constant release of bloodlust is something the Water God Style can easily counter while Nina points out that the release of bloodlust is unnecessary as long you are the faster one. During this time, Isolde admits that she feels getting stronger with Eris and Nina's help and is having fun as it is her first time having discussions with people of her level and age.

Volume 15

After a few years of training in the Sword Sanctum, Isolde is invited to Asura Kingdom to become a sword instructor in the Silver Palace and tells her friends that they should visit Asura Kingdom in the future, where she will give her a tour. During this time, Eris has reached Sword King rank and is also leaving for Sharia in Ranoa Kingdom. Before they depart, a letter from
Rudeus Greyrat
 arrives and Isolde reads it for Eris. Isolde becomes outraged at the contents of the letter, praying to Saint Millis and telling Eris to join her to Asura Kingdom instead of going to Ranoa while berating Rudeus for even asking Eris to become his third wife. Isolde then reads the second paper which is a postscript of Rudeus challenging the Dragon God
Orsted
. This causes Isolde and Nina to stiffen up in fear of those words. However, Eris smiles upon hearing this, gets on her horse, and tells Ghislaine that she will be late if they don't hurry while Isolde and Nina see them off with a dumbfounded expression.

Volume 17

Isolde reunites with Eris upon the latter's arrival to Ars, the Royal Capital in the Asura Kingdom. Isolde is currently a novice knight and well on her way to become a full-fledged knight of the Kingdom, with additional potential as either a palace sword instructor or a captain of the Royal Knights. She initially mistakes
Luke Greyrat
 as Rudeus and thus treats him coldly (due to having three wives), while taking an interest in Rudeus himself, unaware that this is actually Eris' husband.

She arrives to the sight of her master Water God Reida Lia using her technique on the entire party venue. Horrified, Isolde questions her master why is she doing this. In turn, Reida gives a cover-up story about how Isolde is to take her down and become the next carrier of the Water God Style. After
Orsted
 brutally kills Reida, Isolde cries in rage at him but he runs off, leaving Isolde cradling her dead grandmother in her arms.

Isolde visits Eris and Rudeus in the ten days after the events of Ariel's gathering, and after having gotten over her grief at her master's death. She properly introduces herself to the real Rudeus and notes that he actually takes good care of her dear friend despite having three wives. After teasing Eris for a bit and explaining the defused situation involving the former Water God's assassination attempt on Ariel, she takes Eris and Rudeus for a tour around the city.

Volume 26

Isolde, now a
Water Emperor
 and one of the
Seven Knights of Asura
, joins in the battle against the Fighting God, stepping in to save Rudeus. She plays a major role by acting as a frontliner, skillfully parrying and countering the Fighting God's violent blows - any of which could have been lethal - and making them look like a child's tantrum. After the Fighting God is defeated, she accompanies Rudeus as a guard to see Geese in his final moments. She then gets knocked out with the rest of the guard by a resurrected
North God Kalman III
 wearing Fighting God armor and wielding the King Dragon Sword Kajakut.

After Kalman III is defeated, Isolde finally departs with the rest of her crew and thanks Rudeus for the educational experience of fighting such a powerful opponent.

Redundant Reincarnation





Doga proposing to Isolde in the dojo.



Isolde is currently the new
Water God
 after mastering three out of the five secret arts of Water God Style. She seeks a suitor for marriage but to no avail as none fit her personal preferences. In a sudden turn, North Emperor
Doga
 confesses his feelings to Isolde and asks her to marry him while carrying a bouquet of blue flowers, but Isolde initially rejects him due to their responsibilities as Ariel's personal knights and arrangements by Ariel (at her own request) to marry royalty. However, Isolde is moved after Doga quits his position for the opportunity to be with her and with encouragement from Ariel, who tells Isolde that there is no greater honor for a woman than Doga's personal sacrifice. Isolde then realizes that there is no one else who loves her more than Doga, probably. She is deeply touched, having been reminded of the first Water God's tale with the runaway princess, and accepts Doga's proposal.

They get to know each other and marry after one year, eventually having one daughter who looks like Isolde herself. During the couple's private moments, she is affectionate with her husband and calls Doga 'darling.'

Jino Britts
===========

Information

Relationships

Jino Britts
 (
ジノ
・
ブリッツ
)
 (
Gino Britz
 in the official light novel) is a swordsman of the
Sword God Style
 hailing from the
Sword Sanctum
. He is the son of Sword Emperor Timothy Britz. Later on, he becomes the next Sword God succeeding
Gal Farion
, as well as the husband of
Nina Britts
 (née Farion).

Appearance

In his youth, Jino had short, spiky hair that is light brown in color and waved to one side. He wears an obi with a long-sleeve shirt underneath typical for swordsmen and carries his sword by his hip, latched onto his sash. He had a plain face that showed signs of immaturity when confronted with an issue he cannot deal with.

As an adult, Jino wears a coat similar to that of
Gal Farion
 and is often seen with a carefree, unconcerned expression on his face (alongside his wife Nina).
 Nevertheless, he can also express a stern, imposing gaze towards anybody who would put himself or his family in danger, as he did towards
Rudeus Greyrat
. According to Rudeus, Jino looks young and surmises he is around Rudeus' own age.

Personality

In his youth, Jino had an immature and naive way of thinking, seeing swordsmanship as a dull routine he simply did because it was natural to him, despite being praised as a prodigy. In fact, he actually didn't like sword fighting very much; he kept up his practice, but only because his parents made him do it without any desire himself. Neither did he feel happy when people praised him for being the youngest to achieve Sword Saint rank. He lived a life of complacency, doing things that would anger no one and bother no one.

Being brought up in a sheltered environment, he had many preconceived ideas and expectations about life, initially fearing the outside world (in part due to Ghyslaine's stories) and feeling no desire to ever leave the Sword Sanctum.
 The latter would continue on throughout his adult years. He had a vague idea of differences in philosophy but wasn't sure of specifics nor which was right until after his awakening.

His love for
Nina Farion
 and desire to want "more" of his first time with her awakened him to the idea of a "goal" that both
Eris Greyrat
 and arguably Nina failed to articulate to him correctly. With such a goal in mind, he could easily make the most out of his outstanding talent, with an unprecedented interest and effort in his swordsmanship. It was also around this when he finally understood his master Gal Farion's teachings, and thus became single-mindedly obstinate in his determination to live only for himself.

After becoming the Sword God, Jino still behaves calmly and in ways that exasperate the former disciples of
Gal Farion
, ignoring rudeness and only paying attention to Nina, even groping her and smelling her hair in plain daylight. He has no attachment to his authority as Sword God or status as master, and has offered to leave the Sword Sanctum, not doing so immediately due to his children being too young. He would look unconcerned at his disciple's frustrations about upholding the honor of the Sword God Style, having a look that wondered what the disciple was going on about.

While still respecting his former master and following his teachings, Jino bears no animosity toward Rudeus and Eris for his death, stating that if the former Sword God died by himself and for himself, then there is nothing to be resentful about.

Background

Jino Britts was born in the Sword Sanctum and into the Sword God Style. His family is a branch family of the Sword God Gal Farion: his mother is Gal's younger sister and his father is a Sword Emperor under him.
 He is considered a prodigy by his fellow practitioners, being able to come up with outlandish battle theories as a child, and attained the title of Sword Saint at the tender age of 12 as the youngest Sword Saint ever. Of those around his age, only Gal's daughter
Nina Farion
 was able to match his own sword skill and keep up with him.

Like almost every other Sword God Style practitioner in the Sword Sanctum, Jino has a great deal of respect for the Sword God. Eventually, Jino develops feelings for his daughter Nina and asks for her hand in marriage. When Gal refuses to give his approval unless Jino were to defeat him, it is with this motivation to marry Nina that beckons Jino's tumultuous awakening and dramatic rise in power as the next Sword God.

Power and Abilities

Jino is a Sword God Style swordsman of prodigious skill and talent, being both the youngest Sword Saint and Sword God in history. Despite his ambivalence about sword work, he was revered a genius by his peers; even as a child, he came up with somewhat outlandish battle theories, which would eventually enable him to see a path towards victory against the contemporary Sword God.
 He was able to catch up to Nina Farion in no time after being motivated by both a desire to get stronger and his feelings for her. When he had a "goal" in mind, he is able to put in the "work" to hone his body and skills to perfection to best Gal Farion in mock combat. Jino displayed speed equal to Gal but able to react and retract his sword faster than Gal, enabling him to obtain victory like needling a thread into a needle.

As the Sword God, he is able to completely overwhelm Eris Greyrat in mock battle, breaking her arm and toe so fast nobody except God-tier fighters were able to notice what had happened. He is also able to defeat
North God Kalman III
 (one arm sealed) in mock battle without so much as a single scratch. In the original timeline, it was Jino who defeated Kalman III, not Rudeus, which led the latter to become mature enough and eventually become a true hero.

Due to never leaving the Sword Sanctum and making a name for himself, he is said to be the weakest Sword God in history and believed to have inherited the title only due to passing of generations. Yet out of all the Sword Gods, he lived the longest.
 It is said that had he left Sword Sanctum, he might have defeated mighty foes such as Water God
Reida Lia
 and Death God
Randolph
.

『Sword God Style』

As a practitioner of the
Sword God Style
, Jino is able to use basic techniques such as
Sword Cleaving
 and advanced techniques such as
Longsword of Light
. In his youth, he was able to regularly keep up with Nina Farion in skill, albeit he lost more times to her in training than not. However, with proper motivation he was always able to close the gap due to his prodigious talent.

After his "goal" awakening, he became fast enough to parry Gal's sword in a direct exchange of blows, something Water God
Reida Lia
 could not do in her advanced age. As Sword God, while fighting mock battles simply for
Nina's
 amusement, he proved his superiority over Eris Greyrat in a fast double strike to her dominant arm and leg, so much that it even made the proud Eris concede in frustration. He is able to intercept and pressure a one-armed
Kalman III
 by landing countless hits on him without being struck back once, albeit it left him in a sweat. In fact, Kalman III was only able to keep up due to his demon regeneration. Rudeus notes that had it been real combat and with a scabbard for balancing his sword stance, Jino could have moved even faster.

Quotes

Gal: "
What do you think makes the difference, Jino? Answer me.
"

Jino: "
Th-the ability to think logically, to move skillfully... uh, body strength... or m-maybe weapon quality...?
"

Gal: "
Weapon quality?! How many years have you been training for, boy? You sure you don't need to go back and start from the basics?!
"

Eris: "
You lost?
"

Nina: "
Yes, before he challenged the Sword God, he told me,
'If I win, be mine.'
 I fought him without holding back and I lost
."

Eris: "
That's a beautiful way to propose.
"

Nina: "
Isn't it?
"

Jino: "
I will not work with you. I wield my sword for myself alone. Everything I do, I do for myself.
"

Rudeus: "
Even if your family were in danger, you wouldn't pick up your sword?
"

Jino: "
I would. If I loved them, I would. Or are you saying you'll kill my family if I refuse to work with you?
"

"
It is because you are such a man that I feel safe in saying that I will not work with you. My sword fights for me and those I love, and no one else.
"

Trivia

Jino is the son of
Gal Farion
's younger sister, which makes his wife
Nina
 his first cousin.

In the original timeline, without
Rudeus
, Jino was the one who defeated
Kalman III
 and set him on the path of becoming a true hero.

According to Orsted, in his youth Jino may have been susceptible to the
Mangod's
 teachings.

Jino's sword theory, while fundamentally still Sword God Style, actually differs slightly in that it is not based on one-shot one-kill, but rather the quickness and precision to disable one's opponent before attacking them again in rapid succession. Much like
Eris Greyrat
 and
Ars Greyrat
, he has created a variation of Sword God Style that overcomes some of the style's weaknesses.

Jino Britts/Relationships
=========================

Information

Relationships

Nina Britts (née Farion)

When he returned with the title of Sword God, he swept Nina up and kissed her forcefully... that day, Nina had become Gino's in both mind and body.

—
Nina Farion

Nina is Jino's first cousin, childhood friend, and eventually wife. They grew up training together and Jino has always followed Nina in whatever she did, whether it be forming secret organizations for Sword God Style children or sparring together. Even though Nina would treat him like an underling, the two often understood each other best - when Nina frustratingly lost to Eris Greyrat in the selection to becoming a Sword King, they simply stayed silent and kept on training.

Jino eventually developed feelings for Nina during their training sessions and they consummated their relationship. It was his love and desire for Nina that finally motivated Jino enough to put in "work" towards achieving a "goal": to be with Nina in marriage after he was rejected by her father, Gal Farion. He became strong enough to defeat the current Sword God, and this earned him Nina's deep admiration too. Nina also takes Jino's family name upon marriage.

After becoming Sword God, he wields his sword only for the sake of himself and his family, proving his deep love for them. He also made Nina a Sword Emperor as a gift. During training halls in the Sword Sanctum, he is often seen cuddling with Nina at his side, oblivious to others' disapproving looks. He only cares for Nina and will do anything she commands him to, such as mock battles with Eris Greyrat and Kalman III.

Gal Farion

Gal Farion is Jino's uncle, former teacher, and his predecessor to the title of
Sword God
. Gal always tried pushing a young Jino to work harder and take swordsmanship more seriously, who simply practiced it out of habit and due to family pressure. He even tried to encourage him to adventure out into the world, to no avail. When Jino came to ask for Nina's hand in marriage, Gal saw it as an opportunity to motivate Jino into getting stronger - which he did, to the point of beating Gal in a 1-on-1. After that, Gal was crushed and held Jino in contempt yet begrudging respect. On the other hand, Jino bears no animosity towards Gal and wishes to uphold his former master's teachings: to wield the sword for one's self.

Eris Greyrat

Gal Farion: "See? Naive, right?"
Eris: "He really was , huh."

Eris is an acquaintance that Jino made at the
Holy Land of Swords
. Eris' first impression of Jino is that she thought he was a weak runt, and she never paid any attention to him.
 Despite being completely defeated by Eris during their first meeting, Jino did not see this defeat as a huge change since losing was an everyday occurrence to him due to frequent sparring and losing against Gal or even Nina in the past. Eris is responsible for Nina's growth after training together with Eris, who secretly trained with Jino during their free time; this made Jino begin to fall in love with Nina.

Eventually, when she fought Sword God Jino directly in a mock battle, she was frustrated but acknowledged his overwhelming superiority against her. Nevertheless, they remain on friendly, humble terms with each other, with Jino saying that Eris wouldn't back down in the old days and complementing her on her matured self-control. As
Ars Greyrat
 noted in his encounters with various swordsmen, Jino was among those who said that Eris isn't an opponent who could be defeated so easily.

Ghislaine Dedoldia

"The world is a place where even the most talented swordsman die. If you don't know how to use
Magic
 or math, or how to read, death will come swiftly."

-Ghislaine

Sword King Ghislaine Dedoldia is the 4th in rank at the Sword God Style and is Jino's senior who travelled around the
world
 as a famous
Adventurer
. When Ghislaine returns to the Holy Land of Swords, Ghislaine tells Jino stories of her journey. Unlike the adults, Ghislaine's serious face causes Jino to believe her warning since like the rest of the children in the region, he does not know how to read, write, use Magic nor know math. Despite this, Jino is still not interested in leaving his homeland to go for an adventure like Nina did as he fears of not being able to solve anything with swordsmanship alone.

Rudeus Greyrat

Rudeus is someone that Jino respects, primarily because of their similar love for their respective families. Jino has heard stories of Rudeus, such as how he would attack the Dragon God and even destroy a whole country to protect his family, which piqued his interest in Rudeus. As a result, Jino trusts that he will uphold their neutrality pact. Rudeus, on the other hand, finds Jino somewhat terrifying due to the cold bloodlust as a result of a misunderstanding, and somewhat eccentric due to his constant public display of affection with Nina during training.

Upon arriving at the Northern Central Continent, Jirou seems to be struggling with the cold and could anytime that Rudeus decides to at least give him a name and decides that it will be Jirou.
 But Jirou manages to survive and gets used to the colder weather and eventually becomes Roxy's ride to
Ranoa Magic Academy
.

Power and Abilities

Jirou is large and strong enough to carry people on its back or pull a carriage.

Trivia

The name Jirou  (ジロー,
Jirō
) is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of armadillo (アルマジロ,
arumajiro
), which is also the same pronunciation as a common Japanese name “次郎”.

The English LN translation named it "Dillo" in the same manner, despite its unfortunate resemblance with the word "dildo".

Roxy rides it to work when she is not accompanying anyone else.

Plot

''Note: This section is under construction and revision''.

Powers and Abilities






Julie successfully casting Chantless Earth Magic in the Anime



『Magic』

Julie is trained by Rudeus in Earth Magic to create dolls for Zanoba and since Julie is a dwarf, she has a strong affinity to Earth Magic and Fire Magic but is more focused on the former.

『Chantless Spellcasting』

Julie is one of the few people who can cast Chantless spells that she learns under the guidance of
Rudeus
. During this time, there is no formal method of teaching Chantless Spellcasting so Rudeus calls this peculiar method of training an experiment. At the beginning of each day, Rudeus trains Julie to cast magic with
Incantations

Since being trained in Magic by Rudeus since she was six years old, Juliette also possess a high amount of mana which is increased during childhood. Although this is an accepted fact in Rudeus' family and part of their training, teachers of the Ranoa Magic Academy is only a theory and for the case of Rudeus, Sylphiette and Juliette is a special case.

Note: This section is under construction and revision
.

Personality

Alex is an easygoing man that gets along with most people. Despite his carefree and slightly eccentric outlook, he is actually very intelligent and perceptive, capable of quickly discerning opportunities and threats.

During his younger age, he was a person that chased after fame. Even so, he is good-natured and willing to lend a hand to those in need.

Background

Being the first North God and Demon Lord Atofe’s son, Alex was told repeatedly about his father’s heroic tales. However, people did not give the North God's reputation the respect he deserved, describing him as a coward because he did not defeat any major threat directly and died to the Emperor Dragon King. Wanting to improve the reputation of the North God and to be like his father, Alex became a heroic wannabe and went on a journey to slay the Emperor Dragon King Kajakut. On the way, he saved three girls from death: young assassin “Chiki” Chiquita, the “Death God Knight” Shaina Marianne and magician Frau “Flowing Clouds” Claudia. After Shaina saved him from a fatal attack, Alex killed Kajakut. Kajakut’s remains were forged into 49 powerful swords by master blacksmith Julien Halisco. The strongest one, King Dragon Sword Kajakut, was given to Alex. Both Chiki and Shaina had feelings for Alex, and Shaina would later become
Randolph Marianne
’s grandmother.

He was knocked off into the sea by the Fighting God and drifted ashore to Onigashima where he stayed to recuperate. It took him 10 days after the fight to come back.

Power and Abilities

Originally, his weapon was sword, but he tried a new fighting style using a metal rod as a method of self-discipline. He believes that staying inside the comfort zone will dull a person's skill.

He is strong enough to buy time (and survive) for Rudeus to call reinforcement by fighting Badigadi when he emerged as the Fighting god.

He defeats
Eris
 without much difficulty when she asks him for a duel.

grandmother
 in a lesser degree.

He worked as one of
Gisu
's associates in order to destroy the
Superd Tribe
 and kill

Hitogami
 scheme and was only interested in the fame that came with the Hero title.
Rudeus
 and company were able to defeat him after an intense battle and was considered dead for a while. However, as he is a descendant of
Atofe
 it was only a matter of time until his body regenerated. He was eventually defeated by
Orsted
 after a very one sided battle that lasted only 10 minutes and in which he ended up losing both arms. He subsequently ended up becoming another subordinate of
Orsted
 and member of the
ORSTED Corporation
.

When Rudeus is on missions for Orsted, he usually leaves Alek to protect and watch over his children especially
Sieghart Saladin Greyrat
 who really likes the stories about his father.

In Orsted's knowledge of the original history, Alek fell into despair after losing to
Jino Britts
 and took a single child as his disciple who was no way talented but by watching him grow and correcting himself, he matured to be a true North God. In the second

Appearance

Personality

He was bad at studying,  had not an ounce of martial talent, and was always sneaking out to the city to get drunk and ogle bar wretches.

Gallery

Kishirika Kishirisu
 (
キシリカ・キシリス
,

Kishirika Kishirissu
)
 is a member of the
Immortal Demon Clan
 and the former empress of the
Demon Continent
.

Spoilers ahead!

She is a recurring character who usually offers aid to
Rudeus
 and his acquaintances as thanks her doing her favors, having been the one who granted him his
Demon Eye
.

Appearance

Headless statue of Kishirika before her death.

Kishirika looks like a little girl with curve-less figure. She has pale skin, voluminous and wavy violet hair, and a pair of goat-like horns. She also has different color eyes that can spin to change color, due to her various
Demon Eyes
.

Personality

Kishirika is hilariously simple-minded, gullible and carefree, yet being haughty and ambitious. She is depicted as using the 妾 (
warawa
, lit. "mistress") pronoun to refer to herself, which is usually used in fictional settings to represent archaic noble female characters. She will gratefully grant a wish within her power, for anyone who helps her.

She loves her
fiancé
 but she doesn't mind if he sleeps with other women, mostly because they can't be intimate with her child-like body for the time being.

It's worth noting that she tends to hold grudges; when
Rudeus
 knocked her out for her mistake and handed her over to
Atofe
, she was mad at him and almost didn't help him escape from Atofe's castle.

Background

Kishirika Kishirisu was the daughter of the
First Demon God
 and the then Demon Empress
Kirisis Calisis
. She was an infant when her father was killed by the
First Dragon God
, and was saved from the collapsing Demon World by the Demon King
Necross Lacross
 (Badigadi and Atofe's Father) and Demon Dragon King
Laplace
 and grew up in the Human World.

During the Human-Demon Great War, Kishirika Kishirisu, the Immortal Demon Empress who commanded the magic race, engaged in battle but suffered a swift defeat, leading to her imprisonment for three centuries.

Following her reincarnation, she would boldly declare her true identity, yet her claims were often met with disbelief or indifference. Frequently faced with hunger, she finds herself living more as a beggar than an Empress.

Plot

Volume 2 - Infancy Period

Before the
Teleport Incident
, she was one of the many who took notice of the phenomena that was occurring over the
city of Roa
. She attempted to see what was the cause with her many
Demon Eyes
, however, it appeared that the culprit skillfully concealed their identity.

Volume 4 - Juvenile Period - Voyage

Rudeus
, under the guidance of
Hitogami
, encountered Kishirika in an alley in Wind Port, being pulled by a strange man. Misunderstanding the situation, he attacked the man, knocking him out in one hit. However, Kishirika was starving, as she hadn't eaten  much since she had been reborn, so Rudeus gave her some food. She gratefully accepted, and in exchange, offered him a demon eye, suggesting he take the
Foresight Eye
. Rudeus agreed, however not realizing that he was speaking to the real Kishirika. He was thus surprised when she actually changed his eye into the Foresight eye.

Volume 6 - Juvenile Period - Homecoming Chapter






Kishirika using her Clairvoyant Eyes to locate Rudeus' Family



Kishirika had a drinking contest against
Tallhand
 who she defeated but was nearly taken in as a slave for being unable to pay for the drinks.
Roxy
 paid for her, saving the situation. In gratitude, Kishirika informed Roxy of where Rudeus' family was located at Roxy's request, with her
Clairvoyant Eye
 and also informed her that
Zenith
 was in the
Teleport Labyrinth
 at the
Begaritt Continent
.

Volume 14 - Young Man Period - Summoning Chapter

A year prior, Kishirika had found herself in
Rikarisu Town
 and ended up drinking a large amount of wine, which belonged to
Atoferatofe Rybak
. As a result, Atoferatofe came to Rikarisu in search of Kishirika to punish her. However, she didn't know how Kishirika currently looked and thus couldn't find her.

Kishirika, however, spent that time starving in the city, trying to get food, while wearing a hood. Eventually, when Rudeus and his company arrived in the town with
Cliff
 giving food to Kishirika, who he believed was simply a beggar. She later gave Cliff an
Identification eye
.

Volume 22 - Young Man Period - Organization Chapter

She was tricked by Atoferatofe Rybak's imperial guards and imprisoned. Later on, she met
Rudeus
 who gave her donuts and asked her to find a man named
Geese
. She also revealed the truth about the Fighting God, and that she and
Badigadi
 were formerly
Hitogami
's apostles and told Rudeus to be wary of Badigadi due to him still feeling indebted to
Hitogami
. She gave Rudeus the
Clairvoyant Eye
 for giving her a donut. Before she left, Atofe asked her the location of Earl and
Kalman III
, but Kishirika rejected until Rudeus showed her
Randolph
's ring. She promised Rudeus that she would  help with anything as long as it doesn't involve
Hitogami
.

Quotes

To Rudeus:
 “My belly aches from the hunger…and this man was going to provide me with a meal”.

Atofe's soldiers:
 "Lord Kishirika, please cease this! Please do not provoke Lord Atofe any further!"

Kishirika:
 "Shut up! This One followed you lot because you told This One you would feed This One something good and all This One gets is poor treatment! This One shan't feel better until This One has said at least that much!"

Trivia

She has low metabolism (compared to a human's), so eating about 14 skewers can last her one year.

Kishirika said that
Rudeus
 is "disgusting" when she saw him for the first time, wondering if he was a twin with a stillborn brother
. This is due to Rudeus' having an immense quantity of magic power/mana.

This is omitted in the anime, where Kishirika just said he's disgusting without mentioning anything else.

She and
Badigadi
 were once
Hitogami
's apostles before the Human-Demon Great War.

She hates
Hitogami
 and even told Rudeus that he could ask for her help for anything as long as it doesn't involve Hitogami.

In
Episode 12
, Kishirika switches her eyes like a slot machine and also show some fruits before switching to her Magic Power Eyes on Rudeus.

A running gag in series is that Rudeus occasionally imagines the possibility of Kishirika appearing out of nowhere, like being born as his child or summoned from a magic circle.

It is hinted that Kishirika possesses a large amount of mana, as
Orsted
 said she can't be summoned by the small summoning magic circle he made for
Rudeus
 due to her mana capacity
.

According to Badigadi, she cannot leave the Demon Continent
.

Kishirika Kishirisu/Power and Abilities
=======================================

She does not seem to possess great fighting capacity as she panicked upon being threatened to be sold into slavery by a simple bar keep.

Immortality

She seems to be immortal, but it's likely that she just revives after death with her age reset.
Badigadi
 once mentioned that because of how thoughtless she is, she dies pretty often, so it wouldn't be strange for her figure to turn back to that of a child, considering the fact that
Badigadi
 revived in a much smaller figure when he was killed by
Rudeus
.

Laplace
=======

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Information

Relationships

Laplace
 (
ラプラス
,

Rapurasu
)
 is a powerful demon who waged war against humanity 500 years ago before being sealed by the
Seven Great Heroes
. In reality, there are actually two Laplaces,
Demon God Laplace
 and
Technique God Laplace
, having been split into two whilst fighting the
Fighting God
. While it is mentioned that he will revive in the future, neither of his two halves actually appear in the main story.

Appearance

"A mixed race of demons and dragons. Where and how were you born?"

-First Dragon God

Being born with
Dragon Tribe
 and Demon blood, Demon Dragon King Laplace before he was split in two was described as over 2 meter tall with silver hair with patches of green but has lesser scales compared to those of the Dragon Tribe. In addition he had fangs, claws. a set of wings, transparent white skin and two golden eyes.

Demon/Magic God Laplace was described to have emerald green hair, and gentle eyes.

Personality

"I killed beasts and ate them, but the lonely feeling did not heal."
-Laplace

In his early life at the Demon World, Laplace lives a primal life where he would prey, live and die by instinct by feeding of the demonic beasts at the corner of the Demon World. But after seeing a family of demonic beasts together, Laplace begins to feel a sense of loneliness that he is unable to cope with and begins to search for people like him and eventually finds a town but is seen as a monster. Despite being treated as a monster and being forced to retreat, he persisted to return as he does not want to feel lonely
 which persisted even when he begins to live in the
Human World
 until
Rostelina
 joins him.

Ever since being brought to the Dragon World, Laplace is fiercely loyal and devoted to the
First Dragon God
 who saved his life and
Lunaria
 who he considers like her real mother even though they are not related by blood. Even after the destruction of the Dragon World, Laplace faithfully follows the First Dragon God's last mission to him to prepare techniques, magic and knowledge for
Orsted
 to defeat
Hitogami
.

Background

Meeting the First Dragon God

"Alright. If the Demon God neglected you for so long, he wouldn't mind if I just take you away, even though there are so many uses, what a waste..."

First Dragon God

Even Laplace himself does not know where he was born. Ever since becoming aware as a child, Laplace found himself in a cave at the corner of the
Demon World
, a land of death, full of miasma and roaming demonic beasts where he goes hunting monsters for food and sleeping on a regular basis. Laplace soon felt lonely after witnessing some demonic beasts huddling and playing with each other and decides to wander and finds a demon town but its inhabitants viewed him as a monster and the Demon King of the town fought and injured him but he manages to escape. Laplace would eventually encounter a hydra that spits fire and poison mist where his injuries from it would not heal like it normally does after eating and sleeping.

On the brink of death, Laplace is saved by the
First Dragon God
 and brings him to the
Dragon World
, an inverted land where the mountains grew from above while a clear blue endless sky and white clouds is seen below. Upon arriving at the First Dragon God's home in Kayos,
Lunaria
 greets them and the First Dragon God tells her that he plans to raise the child with her and gives him the name Laplace.

Dragon Warrior Training and Dragon Tamer

Laplace is then trained by
Dora
 at the command of the First Dragon God to become a Dragon Warrior and for the next decades, Laplace is trained on how to speak the Dragon God Language along with different subjects about the Dragon World, how to use
Dragon Battle Aura
 and how to fly.
 After completing his Dragon Warrior training, Laplace becomes Dora's subordinate and his first task is to train dragons that are the mounts used by the Dragon Tribe. This is where he first meets a
red dragon
 who was initially hostile towards him but eventually is able to tame him. Laplace names him Saleyakt and afterwards he would rise into prominence because of his ability to train dragons that are considered untrainable by traditional methods.

During the spawning season, Laplace becomes Dora's temporary replacement on being in charge of all the dragon training facilities in the Dragon World and his work is appraised highly even by
Maxwell
 for the high quality dragons that he trains and being used by his unit.
 After
Crystal
's death, Laplace attends the meeting with the First Dragon God and the Dragon Generals where he is there as Dora's substitute. Laplace is assigned to conduct further investigation after Maxwell who also aids him by assigning
Gora and Scrubava
 to assist him in the investigation.

Search for Crystal's Killer

Despite the support from the Dragon Generals and his subordinates, Laplace is still struggling to find the suspect for years until the
Human God
 appears in his dreams and tells him about his
Demon Eye
 that he uses to look at the Gold Dragon's nest where Crystal's remains were found. With the use of his Demon Eye, Laplace found a trace of the culprit and managed to locate his hideout but the culprit
Necrolia Nacrolia
, is also in the hideout and kills Gora and Scrubava leaving Laplace to battle the Demon King on his own. After days of fighting both Laplace and Necrolia are on the verge of exhaustion and in desparation, Laplace unconsciously uses Dragon Battle Aura Explosion which destroys the mountain they were fighting . Laplace is the first to wake up and realizes that Saleyakt has brought him and Necrolia to the ledge they are at now then he restrains Necrolia's arms and legs and brings him back to Kayos.

Laplace is welcomed by
Szilard
 who handles the interrogation of Necrolia and the Dragon Warriors stationed at the gate also are shouting with joy for capturing the culprit. Laplace fell into deep sleep for three days and three nights afterwards then had a meal with
Lunaria
, reports to
Maxwell
 that his subordinates has died in battle and finally visited
Dora
 who has already finished spawning safely. After reporting his capture of Crystal's killer, Dora asks him to give their child a name to which he names him
Perugius
.

Demon Dragon General Laplace

Another meeting is held by the First Dragon God and the Dragon Generals where Laplace reports of his search for Crystal's killer, the
Human God
 appearing in his dream and telling him about his
Demon Eye
, his battle and eventual capture of Necrolia then he hands Necrolia over to
Szilard
. After Szilard's report, the Dragon Generals urged the First Dragon God to go to war against the Demon World but the First Dragon God refuses and will negotiate with them instead. At the suggestion of Szilard to reward Laplace for his accomplishment, the First Dragon God names him Demon Dragon General Laplace and the successor of
Crystal
 as a Dragon General.

New Mission at the Human World

Demon/Magic Dragon King Laplace was the sole survivor left of the Five Dragon Generals after the incident which caused the inhabitant of the four destroyed Worlds to escape into the Human World and the collapse of the Dragon World. He was the second generation Dragon God after the first passed away.

Laplace escaped the collapsing Dragon World and drifted to Human world. He became the second generation Dragon God. He researched about methods and techniques to overthrow
Hitogami
. He taught to those who called themselves "Dragon God" the techniques he had developed over a long time. All for the sake of passing down the power to
Orsted
 who came to the future, and said to possessed the greatest strength among the dragon-tribe.

He went to human-demon race world war where he fought against
Fighting God
 who was Human God's apostle and his soul was split into two halves. Laplace, who was split in two, lost his memory and became two, the human-hating [Demon/Magic God] and [Technique God], whose aim was to overthrow god.

[Demon/Magic God] Laplace lost the power of
dragons
. He only remembered the enormous amount of magic knowledge and that he must definitely kill 'human' forgetting the God part. For that purpose, he rallied the demon race to exterminate the 'human race'. He was cursed the same way
Orsted
 was, however he was able to transfer the curse to the
Superd race
.

[Technique God] Laplace who lost the power of magic, only remembered the enormous amount of techniques and that he must definitely teach and pass them down to someone. Thus Technique God created the Seven Great Powers ranking and devoted himself in studying those techniques.

Plot

Mushoku Tensei

Mushoku Tensei Sequel

Since the planned sequel series seems to be taking place around the time which the Demon God Laplace would finally reincarnate, it is very likely that he will finally make his debut here. Particularly, he is set to play a vital role in several major storylines. Most obvious is
Perugius'
 quest to finally kill him for good and avenge the members of the Seven Great Heroes who died whilst sealing him 500 years ago. However, he is also set to be deeply involved with
Orsted's
 quest to kill
Hitogami
, since he holds the final key the former needs to enter the latter's realm. If the events play out like in Orsted's previous loops, then
Ruijerd
 and
Norn's
 daugther,
Luicelia
, will play a major role in his eventual defeat.

Power and Abilities

Dragon Battle Aura

Trained by Dora to be a Dragon Warrior, Laplace's
Fang Technique
 has enough destructive power to be considered "deadly" and is among the few Dragon Warriors who can match Dora in combat.

Dragon Battle Aura Explosion

During the battle against Necrolia Nacrolia, Laplace concentrated his remaining strength in desperation, which caused his Dragon Battle Aura to swell below his heart and to explode like a suicide bomb, with enough force to destroy an entire mountain and was felt even in Kayos. However, he admitted that he did not know how to activate this ability.

Original Self

Before he was split into two beings, Laplace was considered the most powerful entity in the world. As one of the Five Dragon Generals, he had enormous physical strength, night vision and a demon eye that allowed him to track and sense enemies. Laplace could also fly.

Technique God

Technique God Laplace has the Dragon Power and knows many techniques in the world to overthrow 'God'. He created the Seven Major World Power system and ranked himself 1st. But, he loses some part of his memories, leading him to only remember his objective is to overthrow 'God' by teaching those who call themselves Dragon God all of his technique and lost all of his Magic Power, making him unable to use magic and knows only physical combat.

Demon/Magic God

Demon/Magic God Laplace has the enormous Magic Power and a master of all magic. He lead the demon race to exterminate 'Human' 400 years ago and ranked 4th in the Seven Major World Power system. But, he loses some part of his memories, leading him to only remember his objective is to kill 'Human' by leading the demon race in his military campaign and lost all of his Dragon Power, making him unable to use battle aura. Although he could not use battle aura, he was still so strong that he killed four of the seven heroes that led humanity in the Laplace War and the remaining three(
Dragon God Urupen
,
Perugius
,
North God Kalman
) were unable to kill him even with the help of
Ruijerd Superdia
 who could see his weak point with his third eye and thus, had to seal him to end the war.

Quotes

"Let's continue the story once I'm done. No worries, because no story is as miserable as those of Dragon World’s."

Trivia

Laplace is formerly a second generation Dragon God.

Similar to Orsted, he holds a curse of fear and hate, which according to
Perugius
 is a curse that shakes the innermost heart of people.

He sent his traits into the future people so that he could reincarnate into the future. This is a technique used by the Ancient Dragon Race, and is a required step to prevent his soul from being rejected by an incompatible body. As a result, many people have recently been born with traits similar to him. (This has been called the "Laplace Factor")

Kishirika Kishirisu
 describes him as a handsome looking guy.

His name is likely a reference to scholar
Pierre-Simon Laplace
 and
Laplace's demon
.

In the removed chapters of Aisha, in the story of the legendary Hero Alus, The First Sage (who was assumed to be Magic Dragon King Laplace) granted Alus the power to properly wield the four treasures Alus borrowed from the other four Sages in order to defeat the Demon Lord.

Laplace is the person who named
Perugius
.

Demon-Dragon God Laplace only needed to eat once every one hundred days and only needed to sleep only once every few years.

Demon-Dragon God Laplace is one of the few beings known to posses a Divine-Jewel although it is unknown whether that Divine-Jewel was destroyed during his fight with the Fighting God.

Demon-Dragon God Laplace's power was comparible to Dragon God Orsted.

First Dragon God

"Hmm. I decided to come after hearing that there was a monster with the form of a man but... How interesting. A mixed race of
Demons
 and
Dragons
. Where and how were you born?"

-TheFirst Dragon God on meeting Laplace

Laplace first meets the First Dragon God after the latter is wounded by a
monster with many heads
 where Laplace was at the brink of death due to being poisoned and bleeding. After healing his wounds, the First Dragon God takes Laplace to the
Dragon World
 and adopts him to be his son
 where he would eventually become one of his
Five Dragon Generals
 after capturing
Necrolia Nacrolia
, Crystal's killer.
 Laplace would then accompany the First Dragon God as his assistant on the summit of the
Gods
 where he is presented as proof that the Dragon Tribe has no hatred towards the Demon Race and they agree to have peace and Laplace would become the ambassador on behalf of the Dragon Tribe to the other worlds.

Lunaria

"You're Dragon God's adopted son, then you are my child as well. Please rest assured, this is your home too."

Lunaria to Laplace

Lunaria welcomes Laplace after the First Dragon God adopts him and would also cares for Laplace while he adjust to his new life that Laplace would consider Lunara to be her mother.
 After Laplace begins working for Dora, he would also spend time with Lunaria telling about his work on training dragons like a family.

Dora

"Show respect and submit to me. I don't tell lies. Be true and trust me with all your heart. No whimpering or saying I can't. Its a waste of time. If you don't give up, I will surely raise you into a fine dragon warrior."

-Dora to Laplace

At the First Dragon God's instructions, Armored Dragon General Dora educates Laplace on words of the Dragon Tribe Tongue that he learns after a year followed by writing, history, geography, status, relationships, etiquette, industry and other common knowledge of the Dragon Tribe then she trains Laplace on becoming a Dragon Warrior and how to fly.

After Laplace completes his training under her wing, she assigns Laplace to train Dragons that is the main mount of the Dragon Tribe and later names him to be his substitute an supervising the Dragon Training Grounds since the spawning season has started.
 After Laplace captures
Crystal
's killer, Dora is among the Dragon Generals who approved Laplace to be Crystal's successor as the Demon Dragon General of the First Dragon God.

Perugius Dola

"I have a request for those who read this book. There is a child of the Dragon Tribe who does not know his name in this world. I have forgotten many things that happened, but this too was one of my missions. This child has silvery hair, must be a nameless man by now. Please tell him, "Your real true name is Perugius." Perugius, son of Dora-sama, the Great Dragon King Dora"

-Laplace

After Laplace captures
Crystal
's killer, Laplace reports this to Dora who is grateful for what he has done and asks Laplace to name her and Crystal's child. Although Laplace was reluctant but decides to name the child Perugius, which also makes him to be Perugius' godfather.

Saleyakt

Saleyakt is the first Red Dragon the Laplace tames but instead of taming him in how the Dragon Tribe does, he forms a bond with him by eating and sleeping together but Saleyakt would only listen to Laplace.
 Saleyakt would also help Laplace tame other dragons
 and later saves him after his battle against
Necrolia Nacrolia
 and remains to be his companion in the Dragon World and later the Human World.

Necross Lacross

Necross Lacross first meets Laplace when he was still living in the Demon World where he would defeat and kick him out when he tries to enter the city. After the
Gods
 agreed to cooperate, Laplace and Necross Lacross recruited collaborators from the
Six-Faced World
 to serve as ambassadors to assist other worlds to advance each other's civilization.

Before the destruction of the Demon World, Laplace is assigned to witness its destruction and finds Necross fleeing and upon learning what has happened to him, Laplace tells him to use the portal to reach the Human World.

Laplace Factor
==============

Laplace Factor
 (
ラプラスの因子
,

Rapurasu no Inshi
)
 is a unique trait in capability, or sometimes bodily appearance, a rare percentage of people are born with. It is a result of the Demon God
Laplace
 sending his soul from the past into the present by having it attached itself to multiple bodies in preparation of his revival.

Origin

Approximately
400 years
 prior to the start of the story, when Demon God Laplace was defeated and sealed by the, presently-known,
Three Legendary Demon-God Slayers
 he initiated a reincarnation method by which he would reincarnate in the far future. This method of reincarnation involves sending the soul of oneself into the future and plant itself onto multiple people to search for the perfect vessel. Those said people would have unique traits, though mostly dormant, originally associated with Laplace's internal or physical features. When those people give birth to children, Laplace's traits they inherited will be passed down to their offspring. As a result, slight bodily changes start to appear in children.

The process of bodies adapting to the soul would repeat for numerous generations, and slowly, when Laplace's predicted time of reincarnation gets closer, the dormant traits starts to awaken signaling the body-adaptation is getting nearer to the ideal. By this point in time, the person in possession of the factor would have already noticed their abnormality, by intuition or when exhibited for any person to notice. It must be noted that the traits awaken in different persons possessing the factor.

The reincarnation will occur when an adapted body possessing the factor perfectly matches with the soul. Taking over the body of the soul it was originally supposed to be in and be born while pretending to be it. This was originally a technique of reincarnation perfected by the
first generation Dragon God
 which had been used by many ancient
Dragon Race
 people to reincarnate into the present. Laplace's knowledge of this technique owed to him already having learnt it before he was split from the
Demon-Dragon King
 self; knowledge of this technique was passed to his Demon God self.

Lara Greyrat

Lara Greyrat
============

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Lara Greyrat
 is the second child and daughter of
Rudeus Greyrat
 and the first daughter he had with
Roxy M. Greyrat
. She is the older sister of
Lily Greyrat
 and the half sister of
Lucy Greyrat
,
Ars Greyrat
,
Sieghardt Saladin Greyrat
 and
Christina Greyrat
. It was prophesized that she will be an important person in the future and destined to be the savior that the
Doldia Tribe
 were waiting for.

Appearance

Lara has light blue hair and eyes like her mother
Roxy
 that covers most of her forehead except the middle with a single ahoge and her mouth is just like Rudeus. Because of the color of her hair that could be viewed as green that is matches the hair of the Superd Tribe, her mother and
Sylphy
 worry about it since she might get bullied
.

As she reaches adulthood, she has the appearance of a 13-14 year old human girl, resembling Roxy so much that Rudeus may mix up with them when viewed from the back, which makes her tie her hair into a single braid to differentiate from her mother.

Personality

On the outside, Lara seems to be stoic and has a stern personality, but in reality it is actually due to her telepathy which she usually uses for communicating frequently with
Zenith
 and
Leo
.

She is mischievous, independent and likes making pranks to anyone for her amusement even if its
Kalman III
 or Orsted.
 Despite this she is also shown to be caring to her younger siblings especially Seig comforting him when he cries. She gets along with Ars, the two of them often causing mischief.

Background

"As I thought, Roxy's child is special."

-Orsted

Before Rudeus and Roxy were married,
Hitogami
 tried to get rid of Roxy many times, first by telling Rudeus to get a
Demon Eye
 from
Kishirika Kishirisu
, leading him to avoid meeting Roxy in Wind Port
. He then attempted to stop him from going to the
Teleport Labyrinth
 to save Zenith (and Roxy)
 which failed because of Rudeus and Roxy having a strong fate. Hitogami further manipulated Rudeus by leading him into a situation that would end up with Roxy falling ill and die later due to
Magic Stone Disease
 while Roxy is pregnant with Lara, but this was prevented by the intervention of
his future self
.

Hitogami confronted Rudeus in his dream because of this and angrily told him the future that Lara along with Rudeus' descendants would ally with
Orsted
 to kill Hitogami
. A compromise was eventually established that if Rudeus kills Orsted, Hitogami would leave his family alone. However, Orsted defeated Rudeus and made him his subordinate
. On the day of Lara's birth, there was a heavy snowstorm and Lara's shoulder being caught due to her larger size being a child of a
Human
 and Migurd, Lara was born safely with no complication
.

Plot

Volume 20 - Young Man Period - Zanoba Chapter

Shirone

 until Roxy said that she's going together with Rudeus.

Mushoku Tensei Novel Volume 20.5 - Intermission Chapter

Eris
 once found her attached to
Leo

Volume 22 - Young Man Period - Organization Chapter

Lara traveled to the Demon Continent with her parents to visit her
Grand
parents
 in Roxy's hometown. It was there that Rudeus and Roxy discovered that Lara had the power to use Telepathy which is a trait that was skipped in Roxy. Roxy proposed to Rudeus that Lara should live with her grandparents for a while since Roxy felt that she would be an outcast with her special traits. Lara somehow overheard this and later pleaded with her mother to not leave her and spoke.







Jobless Oblige

Sieghart
 mentioned that  she became a researcher at
Ranoa Magic Academy
 after her graduation of Asura Royal Academy, and her research subjects are summoning magic and divination magic.

Redundancy
The Last One to Leave the Nest

In the last chapter, Lara and Leo leave the house, searching a place with high concentration of mana and promising to Sylphy and Roxy that she is going to back with a boy (Rudeus and Eris will be dead when she comes back). Before she parts, Sylphy gives her cuisine recipes, Eris gives her a knife amulet, Roxy gives her her old hat and Rudeus gives her his 『Arrogant Water Dragon King』, she also takes an old robe of Rudeus.

Note: This section is under construction and revision

Power and Abilities

Telepathy

Because she is part
Migurd
 on her mother's side, Lara has telepathic abilities that normal Migurd have. It was discovered that she had this ability when Rudeus and Roxy took her with them to visit her grandparents. Her parents did not know that she held this ability since no one capable of verbal communication are able to use telepathy, and Roxy was the sole person in the Migurd village born without it.

However, it appears that her telepathy is not limited to Migurds, as she often uses it to communicate with
Zenith
,
Leo
 and
Beat
.

Summoning Magic

Equipment

『Arrogant Water Dragon King』 (Aqua Heartia)

She received the 『Arrogant Water Dragon King』 from her father as a parting gift before she left her house. Rudeus knows since a long time she wanted this staff.

Trivia

She is the Hero that Leo guards, with a fate strong enough to steal the destiny from the original hero of all of
Orsted
's previous loops.

After an embarrassing incident that happened when Rudeus mistook Lara as Roxy, he never sneaks up to Roxy from behind again.

Leroy Greyrat
=============

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Leroy Greyrat
 is the son of Ars Greyrat and Aisha Greyrat whose relationship was initially opposed by rest of the
Greyrat Family
 but Rudeus eventually accepts them when Aisha became pregnant with Leroy.

Personality

Rudeus describes Leroy to be a rowdy boy like both his parents and inherited his mother Aisha's Intelligence and his father Ars' perverse fondness for large breasts.

Background

"As Ars grew, so did that feeling... But I still tried to restrain myself! After all, we're a decade apart! Not to say that he's the firstborn, thus needs a proper prospect for continuing the Greyrat House legacy! But Ars said he loves me too!"

-Aisha Greyrat

Ever since
Ars Greyrat
 was born,
Aisha Greyrat
 has grown fond of the child. As Ars grew up he also becomes close to Aisha and they eventually fall in love.
Rudeus Greyrat
 later finds out of their relationship and affair that shocks him along with the rest of his family. Despite the strong objections especially by her mother
Lilia Greyrat
, Aisha insists that she loves Ars and will marry him but Rudeus refuses and decides that Ars will attend the
Asura
 Royal Academy that Aisha refuses but eventually agrees to Rudeus' recommendation. The next day, Aisha elopes with Ars leaving the family a letter: "We will live our own lives."

Around a year of searching, Rudeus manages to find Aisha who is already pregnant with Leroy. Aisha was willing to die as long as Leroy would live but Rudeus refuses and after further talking things out with Aisha, they return to the Greyrat House.

Plot

Back at the Greyrat House, Lilia is horrified that Aisha is pregnant and grabs a knife but Rudeus stops her. After settling the matter with the family, the punishment is decided that after Aisha gives birth, she will study at Asura Royal Academy and Ars will continue his study at
Sharia
 while Leroy will be under the care of Lilia and Rudeus' family.

4 years later, Ars graduates and he tells Rudeus that he is ready to be with Aisha and races to Asura Kingdom to marry her who also graduated and is working under
Ariel Anemoi Asura
. Ars, Aisha and Leroy settles down in Sharia and buys a house but often visits the Greyrat House.

Trivia

As he exists now, he is now part of the canon because the story of his background was appeared in
Light Novel Extra Edition Volume 3
 following the deletion in the web novel.

His daughter, Feris Greyrat, is also part of the canon.

At their Inn at Rapan, Rudeus is yet to come to terms with
Paul
's death and as he hold on to
Paul's Beloved Sword
, he thought out loud how he should have saved anyone from their
family
 but not him and he struggles on how to move forward. Roxy then enters the room and invites him to walk around the city but Rudeus refuses. Roxy then sits beside Rudeus and she tells him that she considers her
time
 at
Buena Village
 to be the happiest time of her life and being an
Adventurer
, people close to him can die and she has gone through
it in the past
. But Rudeus tells her that
her

parents
 are both fine and she does not understand in anger. Rudeus then realizes that he thought he was getting things right after being
reincarnated
 into the
Human World
, but he neglected the clashes of his family and he is still the same. Roxy consoles him and considers her life as a bliss in Buena Village that he sees Paul and Zenith like a second family. Rudeus gets up and walks away but Roxy grabs him by the hand and pushes him to the bed that surprises Rudeus as Roxy tells him to leave everything to her and they share a kiss...

Next morning, Rudeus wakes up and sees Roxy beside him who also wakes up and after getting dressed, they resume their talk where Roxy tells him to move forward and its what Paul would have wanted.

At the hallway, Elinalise sees Rudeus and Roxy come out of their room and realizes what has happened. Roxy then tells Rudeus that she needs to talk to Elinalise and he should go ahead and talk to Lilia.

At Zenith's room, Rudeus sees Lilia is feeding Zenith who is still unresponsive and apologizes for leaving her to care for her mother but Lilia assures her that it is her job since Paul has passed away and they talk about Zenith's condition who is physically well but lost her memory. Lilia then tells him of Shierra's findings that being trapped in the
Magic Crystal
 caused a magical impairment while Elinalise told her that she is unlikely to recover. Rudeus offers to help in caring for Zenith but Lilia tells him to focus on his own duty and it is what Paul wanted so Rudeus tells her that they should go
home
.

At the Southern Desert Region, Rudeus, Roxy, Elinalise, Talhand, Geese, Shierra, and Vierra are traveling in formation around the coach, where Zenith and Lilia are riding, being pulled by Jirou.
T-Rex Lizards
 then attack them where Rudeus and Roxy uses
Fireball
 against them while Elinalise, Talhand and Shierra
tanks
 them and Vierra uses
Protection Magic
 on the cart with Geese on
lookout
. They then reach a cliff side that Rudeus uses
Earth Lance
 to lift up the party instead of needing to climb it and when it begins to get dark, Rudeus creates an
Earth Fortress
 to shelter them for the night.

That night, Rudeus and Roxy are on guard duty by the campfire outside the Earth Fortress where Rudeus reflects on how he loves both Roxy and
Sylphiette
 and tells Roxy he is already
married
 and about to have a
child
. But Roxy tells him that Elinalise already told her and it was her choice to take advantage of him when he was mourning. Rudeus asks Roxy if he can repay her in anyway so Roxy tells him that she fell in love at first sight when Rudeus
rescued
 her. She then explains that since Sylphy is not here to support him, she did what she had to do since Elinalise and Geese planned to leave him alone while Lilia is busy taking care of Zenith. With all this happening, Roxy confesses she loves Rudeus in tears who tries to console her but she tells him she does not need to do anything.

At Lumen Forest, Rudeus' group are leaving the Teleportation Circle Ruins then Rudeus tells everyone to remove their blindfold to the surprise of everyone that they are now in a snowy forest and Roxy asks where they are so Rudeus tells her that they are in a forest near
Sharia
. Talhand is surprised that they are really at the Northern
Central Continent
 while Geese now understands how Rudeus and Elinalise
travelled
 to Rapan so fast to which Rudeus tells them keep this a secret and they resume their travel.

That night, while on guard duty. Elinalise confirms to Rudeus that neither him nor Sylphiette are members of the
Milis Religion
 unlike
Cliff Grimoire
 who is a devout follower and is only allowed to have 1 wife. With this said, Elinalise urges Rudeus to marry Roxy as she can't stand seeing Roxy like this and she is her close friend since they
travelled together
. Rudeus is still struggling on what to do as he recalls how he calls Paul a scumbag and now about to do what he
did
 to their family. Elinalise then asks how are Zenith and Lilia afterwards and is told that they were happy despite a rough start so Elinalise assures him that he can love Sylphiette and Roxy equally being Paul's son. But Rudeus does not know what Sylphy and Roxy will say so Elinalise leaves to calls Roxy to hear her thoughts on the matter.

Roxy approaches the campfire where Rudeus is on guard duty who tells her how her teachings saved her in his
journey
 and after gathering his courage and would rather be called a scumbag than having regrets, he tells Roxy to change her name to "Roxy Greyrat" and he loves her. Roxy while initially calm, she realizes what he means and manages to compose herself to tell him that they need to have Sylphiette's approval and they both agreed to leave it there for now. Roxy goes back to sleep and as the sun rises, Rudeus places his hand on Paul's Sword and as if talking to him, he tells Paul that they are the same.

==============================

 (推薦状
Suisenjō
) is the fourth episode of the
second season

Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on July 30, 2023.

Synopsis

Rudeus, who had become impotent and let out the feelings he had been harbouring, hit it off with Soldat and later accepts his offer to
join him
 so they began to work together. While staying in the town of Pippin, Rudeus is visited by Elinalise, who was once a member of the same party as
Paul
,
Fangs of the Black Wolf
, and she as been traveling with
Roxy
. She gives Rudeus some information about
Zenith
.

Plot

Rudeus spends the next two years adventuring with Soldat's
Stepped Leader
 party, jumping from town to town, in hopes of spreading the story of Rudeus, eventually culminating in him slaying a
red dragon
 singlehandedly. He could not bring himself to go back to Rusenburg, because he knew Counter Arrow would only distract him from his main objective. Shortly after, in the city of Pippin, Elinalise finally catches up to Rudeus and informs him that Paul and Roxy had already set off to the
Maze City of Rapan
, Begaritt Continent to find
Zenith
 and takes around 1 year to travel. In the meantime, Rudeus decides to stay in the
northlands
 until winter passes before traveling to Rapan himself, and he quickly finds out about Elinalise's
sexual promiscuity
.

Some time later, Rudeus receives a letter from the Ranoa University of Magic inviting him to attend as a "special student" due to his recent exploits. Rudeus is intrigued, but wants to find Zenith first. That night, Rudeus encounters the Human-God in his dreams again, with Hitogami advising him to enroll at the University and investigate the
Teleport Incident
 there, promising that doing so will cure his erectile dysfunction. Rudeus is persuaded to accept the University's invitation and journeys to Ranoa with Elinalise. Meanwhile, it is shown that Sylphie, Ariel, and Zanoba are also students at the University.

Library Labyrinth
=================

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!





The
Princess Ariel Faction
 in the Library Labyrinth



The
Library Labyrinth
 is a castle owned by
Demon
 King
Beethove Tovetha
 where copies of books from all over the
Human World
 are stored.

Geography

The Library Labyrinth is a castle located deep in the Wraith Forest in the Hyleth Region of the
Demon Continent
.

Entry





Rudeus and Eris at the entry room of the Library Labyrinth in the Light Novel



"Good day to you, Demon King. A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am Rudeus Greyrat. This is an incredible library you have here."

-
Rudeus Greyrat

While the physical entry to the Library Labyrinth is not revealed,
Orsted
 creates a
Magic Circle
 for Rudeus and the
Princess Ariel Faction
 to teleport into to the labyrinth where they will be inside the castle at a room with a stone floor and walls similar to
Dragon Tribe
 Ruins that also houses a Teleportation Circle. The only difference is the Library Labyrinth has a proper door and the room is filled with the smell of ink, parchment and mold even if there no books in the immediate area.

Background

"I am Demon King Beethove Tovetha, of the Nen Tribe. Welcome to my castle, Future Author-in-the-Making."

-Beethove Tovetha

Demon King
Beethove Tovetha
 of the Nen Tribe is described by Orsted to be a bookworm who uses his
All-Seeing Demon Eyes
 to make copies of books all over the
Human World
 that he stores in a castle that eventually is called the Library Labyrinth.

While the exact date when the Library Labyrinth is created by Beethove Tovetha is unknown, it has books accounting the life of
Kaunis Freean Asura
 during the
Laplace Wars
, implying that Beethove Tovetha has been creating books for the Library Labyrinth for 400 years or even earlier.

Population

The Library Labyrinth is the home of Beethove Tovetha where he spends his time recreating books. There is also a bunch of
Monsters
 mostly comprise of an enormous number of knee high bipedal
ants
 who dig through the walls and making shelves to house the created books, smaller
slimes
 who collects the resulting rubble by the ants and reform those in their bodies to more book shelves. Finally
Cthulhu Snails
 who protects the Library Labyrinth from enemies.

Despite being a labyrinth that has monsters that normally attack any intruders like the
Teleportation Labyrinth
, they act as familiars of Beethove Tovetha but they are not aggressive and don't attack intruders to the point that they don't even spare a glance at them and continue with their work when they spot them.

Plot

"The vast majority of literature about Kaunis Freean Asura is grouped together by publication date. It would be difficult to gather everything ever written about him, but you would still find more in there than you would in Asura's national library."

-Orsted

After Rudeus is defeated by Orsted in their
second battle
, Rudeus becomes Orsted's subordinate and is given the mission to make
Ariel Anemoi Asura
 to be the next queen of
Asura Kingdom
. In order to accomplish this, the
Princess Ariel Faction
 needs the backing of
Perugius Dola
 who questions Ariel what is the trait of a true king like his friend
Kaunis Freean Asura
 and Ariel's ancestor.
 Since then, Ariel has been staying at the
Chaos Breaker
 as a guest of Perugius but is struggling to find the answer.

Rudeus informs Ariel that they can learn more about Kaunis in the Library Labyrinth as suggsted by Orsted to which Ariel immediately accepts and with the use of Orsted's Teleportation Circle the Princess Ariel Faction enters the Libary Labyrinth

Initially, they were on guard but the monsters on the Library does not attack and simply ignores them when they see Ariel's group so they begin to search for information about Kaunis. Days later, the monsters nor Beethove Tovetha has shown no hostilities towards the Princess Ariel Faction so Rudeus tries to communicate with Beethove Tovetha and he is successfully able to do so by communicating with writing. After showing Beethove Tovetha the book provided by Orsted, he gives Rudeus the journal of
Derrick Redbat
 and he shows it to Princess Ariel.

He intercepts a speeding truck heading towards a group of teenagers in an attempt to do something meaningful for once in his life and manages to pull one of them out of harm's way before dying. Awakening in a baby's body, he realizes he has been reincarnated in a world of sword and sorcery. He resolves to become successful in his new life, discarding his past identity for his new life as Rudeus Greyrat. Due to inherited affinity and early training, Rudeus becomes highly skilled at magic. During his childhood, he becomes a student of demon magician Roxy Migurdia, a friend to demihuman Sylphiette, and magic teacher to noble heiress Eris Boreas Greyrat.

Light Novel Volume 1/Summary
============================

Information

Summary

Prologue

A thirty-four-years-old unemployed and reclusive man is disowned and kicked out of the house by his siblings following the death of their parents. As he wanders along the streets aimlessly reflecting upon his ugly and regretful past he suddenly notices a truck speeding towards a group of three students. Realizing the students had not noticed the out-of-control-truck headed for them, the man rushes in with the intent to pull them away only for him to end up directly in line with the truck's path. He is pinned by the massive truck against a wall ultimately killing him.

Chapter 1: Is This Another World?

As he opened his eyes, he is blinded by a dazzling light but as soon as it lifts away he notices a young woman and a man of about the same age; they seem to be talking in an unfamiliar language. He then realized, to his dread, he could not move his body believing he had woken up after the accident with his limbs lost. A month later, he finally sums his situation; he had been reborn with his memories intact and he is no longer in Japan, and the two persons he saw was most likely his parents now. Half a year later, he quickly begins to pick up on the language and learns to crawl around the house finding out they lived far out in the countryside with a maid on staff. One afternoon, he happens to catch a glimpse of his father practicing sword swings in the yard. Surprised by his odd behavior he slips from the window and hits his head which caused his mother to immediately run up to him. He is again taken aback when his grief-stricken mother recites an incantation of sorts, thinking it was silly, but in the next moment his pain was gone. In the wake of it all, he ultimately comes to an understanding - he has been reincarnated into a radically different world of swords and sorcery. Feeling as if this is his formerly unattainable second chance in life, he decides he would live his life right this time with his former life's experiences to help him.

Chapter 2: The Creeped-Out Maid

Lilia's point of view

Lilia used to be a royal handmaiden and a guardswoman at the Asura Palace. After her leg was caught in an assassin's dagger her movements were still hindered after recovery, leading to her being discharged from her position. Wanting to not put her life in danger again, she arrived at the Fittoa Region where she eventually found a new job in the remote Buena Village. Her employer happened to be her former swordsmanship acquaintance, Paul Greyrat, who was in search of a house-maid following the pregnancy of his wife Zenith. Their newborn, Rudeus, was an unsettling child—Lilia thought—reminding her of unpleasant memories of a depraved minister during her days at the Asura Palace. For the first year, she lived in fear of the child believing he was possessed by a demon. But soon, Rudeus began to change; he would hole up in Paul's study all day and Lilia sensed earnestness and diligence from him in contrast to his crude dullness from just a few months earlier. With nothing to fear about the boy any longer, Lilia figured it was best to leave the boy well enough alone.

Chapter 3: A Textbook of Magic

It had roughly been two years since he was reincarnated as Rudeus and he could now walk and talk in the world's language. Having decided to live his life properly this time, he makes an effort to study and learn various things about the world. He grows particularly attached to a beginner's textbook on magic where he is engrossed over the concept. Wanting to get practical, he recites an incantation to successfully conjure a Water Ball; to his surprise, he manages to conjure up the second and third silently with intuition alone but was physically drained by the fourth due to mana exhaustion. He spends the following days trying to get behind the mechanism of projectile magic and investigating how his mana reserves expand by draining mana everyday. Finally, wanting to start experimentations on magic he decides to build up his magical potential by regularly exhausting his mana.

Chapter 4: Master

Rudeus turned three-years-old, and one day he accidentally blasts a hole in the wall practicing magic. Paul and Zenith rushed in only to end up confused and astonished by the sight. Confirming Rudeus's aptitude for magic they decide Rudeus would learn magic under a private tutor in the morning and swordsmanship with Paul in the afternoons. They eventually hired a magic tutor and contrary to what Rudeus had imagined a magic tutor should look like, a young blue-haired girl called Roxy Migurdia shows up at their doorstep. Roxy initially thinks Paul and Zenith had overestimated their three-year-old's talent but quickly, she is shocked by Rudeus's ablity to silently cast spells and acknowledges his aptitude. From the following day onwards, Rudeus spent the mornings practicing magic with Roxy, physical training with Paul in the afternoons, and then spell experimentations by himself in the evenings. Rudeus soon becomes an Intermediate-ranked mage after four months of diligence and his knowledge of the world progressively starts to expand thanks to Roxy's lectures. During their lessons, he learns Roxy is actually a demon while proceeding to take note of an especially dangerous race of demons called the Superds to never mess with them should he encounter them. After roughly another year, Rudeus successfully advances to Advanced ranked in all branches of magic.

Chapter 5: Swords and Sorcery

Rudeus is now celebrating his fifth birthday. In this world it is customary to celebrate on the fifth and tenth birthday, and finally on the fifteenth when one is considered an adult. Paul gifts him a real sword and a practice sword, a botanical encyclopedia from Zenith, and a wand from Roxy. The following day while practicing swordplay Paul expresses his worries Rudeus might not be interested in learning swordsmanship at all as he was more proficient in magic. At the end, Rudeus comforts him by showing his determination to learn the way of the sword. But again, during the middle of his class Roxy relays her thoughts to Rudeus that he could strive to become a knight instead of a mage. While Paul saw in Rudeus a talent for magic, Roxy saw in him a passion for the sword. Rudeus is concerned over this situation but before he could give his answer Roxy abruptly mentions his graduation is coming up very soon, leaving him in disbelief.

Chapter 6: Reasons for Respect

Roxy had decided his graduation examination would be held outside the house. Rudeus is reluctant and nervous about this idea but Roxy ultimately forces him into riding out with her. As they rode through the village, Rudeus is burdened with anxiety when the villagers gaze towards their direction. However, soon enough he realizes they are not looking at him but Roxy, who despite being a demon had made a name for herself. Rudeus sensed her trustworthy presence and finally calms down. After an hour they stop at a desolate grassland and Roxy then instructs she was going to cast the Water Saint-level spell Cumulonimbus. After her demonstration Roxy informs the test was that he should attempt the same spell himself with the goal of maintaining the effects for an hour. Rudeus starts to chant the incantation but for his own convenience he applies scientific methods from his previous world to keep the spell's effects steady for an hour without expending mana. Roxy, taken aback by his feat, ends the examination on the spot an grants him the "Water Saint" title. The next day, before departing, Roxy gifts Rudeus her amulet of the Migurd tribe to get him out of trouble when demons were included. As she finally goes on her way to explore the world and hone her magic more, Rudeus found the most profound sense of respect for Roxy remembering all the invaluable knowledge she had given and for taking him to the outside world.

Chapter 7: Friends

Rudeus was no longer frightened by the outside world; venturing outside, greeting the villagers and exploring the surrounding lands is now routine to him. One day he decides to make his way up a small hill to scout the village's layout but instead he ends up encountering three kids abusing a lone boy covered in mud. Eventually, Rudeus steps in and successfully drive the bullies away by flinging magic mudballs and rescues the boy. After washing off the filth off the boy, Rudeus is surprised to find he had a very pretty face with emerald-green hair and the boy revealed himself to be a half-elf. Later that day when they went to play on the hill Sylph, the boy, showed an earnest determination to learn magic from Rudeus. Affirming to his desire, Rudeus begins tutoring him. The sun had gone down went Rudeus returns home only to find a vexed Paul waiting for him. Paul had been misinformed by one of the bullies' parent that Rudeus had punched their son, and now Paul demands Rudeus an apology absolutely refusing to his side of the story and eventually ended up striking him. Rudeus, annoyed by Paul's stubbornness, proceeds to break his conscience with words leading to a heavy-hearted Paul apologizing instead. Rudeus, now relieved that he was finally willing to listen, explains the full story and goes on to comfort Paul who was feeling miserable as a parent.

Paul's point of view

It was an afternoon, one of the villagers came to Paul and complained his son, Rudeus, had punched their kid. Paul decided he would need to scold his son properly on how he needed to be very careful with the power he wields. But that evening when Paul demanded an apology, Rudeus had no intention whatsoever of apologizing and led to him out striking Rudeus in the face out of reflex. Rudeus started to speak venomously and slowly Paul came to a realization, while he was trying to get his son apologize for his wrong usage of power, he himself had hit him in the heat of the moment; he was now in the wrong and had to apologize. After hearing the full story he was relived to hear it was not Rudeus' fault after all. Paul felt miserable for repeating the same mistakes as his late father and his immatureness but Rudeus didn't blame Paul. In the end he comforted Paul to learn from this and Paul felt proud to have an understanding son.

Chapter 8: Obliviousness

Rudeus turned six, his day-to-day life had not changed much and he was still stuck at a level in swordsmanship. Daily magic training with Sylph is now a daily routine and he had made remarkable progress over the year. Now Sylph is eager too learn silent spellcasting like Rudeus. To Rudeus' surprise, he is able to pull off silent spellcasting at first try and his self notions of being special disappears. But before they could continue, a downpour came and they rush back to the Greyrat estate in soaked clothes. In the bath, Sylph particularly objects getting naked but Rudeus, wanting to pick on him, suddenly strips him. To his shock, Sylph was not a boy as he had preconceived but a girl after all.

【Paul's

POV

】

Paul came home from work to find his son assaulting his only friend Sylphiette. When he asked for the reason Rudeus only apologized deeply unlike how he snapped back previously. Seeing his boy utterly dejected made Paul a bit uneasy. He directed to Rudeus, if he wanted forgiveness then he needed to apologize to Sylphiette. Rudeus immediately apologized to Sylphiette for his behavior -  he thought she was a boy due to her short hair. When he heard the apology, for the first time Paul felt his son was dumber than he imagined.

【Rudeus' POV

】

After a lot of apologies, compliments, and reassurances, Rudeus finally got Sylphie to forgive him. He found out her name was actually Sylphiette and figured he would call her “Sylphie”. But ever since that incident, Sylphie had very been wary of him.

One day, on Paul’s advice, Rudeus went to Sylphie hoping to reconcile with her, but her reply made him realize he himself was the barrier all along. He had been treating her differently ever since he found out she was a girl. As a result, Syphie didn’t know how to react. Understanding she wanted normalcy, Rudeus decided he would treat like he did before and try his best not to fluster her.

Chapter 9: Emergency Family Meeting

Zenith had learned she was pregnant. The Greyrat household was abuzz at the announcement. It was a day of bubbling joy and countless smiles. The problem didn’t arise until about a month later. Their maid, Lilia, had discovered that she was pregnant, as well. The family was in shock. Paul nervously blurted out the child might be his. And thus was convened an emergency family meeting.

Lilia first proposed she would give birth in Fittoa and then raise the baby back in her hometown. However, Zenith immediately rejected the idea since it was physically impossible not only for the mother but also for the newborn. Zenith was grappling with two separate emotions: her fondness for Lilia and her feelings of betrayal. Rudeus, not wanting to see his family break apart, decided he would help Lilia to solve the problem. He cleverly came up with a plan that used Lilia as the victim of Paul, evidently Paul being the scapegoat. Rudeus turned to his mother and deceitfully crafted a story of Paul making moves on Lilia, and Lilia not able to defy the master giving in to his desires. Paul was in shock by the development but Lilia was able to play along; Rudeus pushed a bit further and Zenith consequently gave in. She finally announced Lilia would be staying with them as family.

【

Lilia’s POV

】

Lilia was the one who seduced Paul. She no initial intention but, after hearing Zenith and Paul release lascivious sounds night after night and to clean a room that scented of a very satisfied man and woman – she had her needs building up.

That came crashing when Zenith got pregnant. Knowing Paul had an abundance of libido, it got into Lilia’s head that this was her opportunity, and invited him to her room. All in all, she blamed herself.

But to her surprise, Rudeus forgave her.  Even though he must have already sensed Lilia was purposely avoiding him, he chose her and her child over his feelings and came up with a plan that allowed her to stay at the house. He has truly earned her respect. Lilia decided at that moment, once her child has grown up, she would see that they made their way into Rudeus’ service.

【

Lilia’s POV – end

】

Several months had passed. Rudeus felt Lilia had begun to open up to him bit by bit ever since that incident.

Soon after, Zenith gave birth. It was a rough experience, with Lilia in her own difficult condition. With the help of a midwife from the village. The birth was a success, to Rudeus’ joy, a baby girl was born. The relief was short-lived, however, as Lilia went into labour as well. Rudeus quickly prepared all the things with magic and the midwife handled the rest. Another girl was born.

Zenith’s daughter was named Norn. Lilia’s daughter was named Aisha.

Chapter 10: Stunted Growth

Rudeus turned seven years old and his sisters were growing quickly. Recently, he had not been able to advance in his swordsmanship at all, still cemented at Beginner level. Surpassing Paul, who was Advanced-level in all three schools and heavily experienced, now seemed nothing more like a pipe dream.

One day, while they were in sword practice, Paul brought up the topic of school. Rudeus was curious about it, but Paul immediately put off that idea. Instead, he recommended trying out adventuring and venture into labyrinths. Rudeus wanted to give it a shot but assessed it was impossible for him as a peaceful life suited him more. Their conversation was interrupted by Sylphie.

Sylphie had been coming to Rudeus’ house to study. Discerning how rapidly Sylphie was growing, Rudeus felt like she’d leave him in the dust in no time. He sighed audibly about having no choice but to go to school or adventuring to learn more things, but to Rudeus’ surprise, Sylphie threw herself at him and obstinately rejected about him leaving the village. Seeing her not wanting him to go away, Rudeus had creeping thoughts - maybe he could just stay at the village with Sylphie and enjoy a slow life. Suddenly, a letter arrived.

The letter addressed to Rudeus, was from Roxy. It opened up by explaining how she had been living as a magic tutor as the court magician at Shirone Kingdom, tutoring the prince. She revealed she had finally achieved Kingly-level Water spells and was walking towards being a Divine-level magician. She wholeheartedly believed, Rudeus must have already achieved Imperial-level or even reached Saintly-level in all other branches and finally recommended her alma mater, the Ranoa University of Magic if Rudeus should want to pursue higher magical studies.

The letter was a wake-up call for Rudeus. His respected master was expecting even greater achievements from him, while just now he had been thinking it was fine to stay at the current level forever.

Rudeus thought he couldn’t leave Sylphie behind, and decided he would ask his father to pay for both their fees. However, Paul out-rightly shot down his request. Rudeus agreed to his Paul's explanation why he couldn't, but asked him to search for a job so that he can earn Sylphie’s fees for university to which Paul agreed.

【
Paul’s POV
 】

Paul wasn’t expecting that. His son was only seven but he was already talking about university and getting jobs to earn fees.

During his adventuring days, Paul remembered someone telling him – rush too fast through your life, and your life will end before you know it. He thought it was a load of crap; Paul was someone who rushed through life, he believed humans had a very limited window of time. But now, Rudeus sprinting forward so fast it made Paul nervous about letting him go.

Recently, Paul also sensed Sylphie had been attached to Rudeus too much. Sylphie needed to learn to stand on her own. Paul thought they might need some time part.

And so with those prospects in mind, Paul wrote a letter.

【
Paul’s POV – end
 】

Chapter 11: Parted

One morning, during sword practice, Paul abruptly asked Rudeus what he would do if he had to stop seeing Sylphie. But before Rudeus
could form a proper answer, as if Paul had already known the answer, he suddenly unleashed bloodlust and leaped towards Rudeus.

Rudeus was bewildered at the sudden dramatic change; he felt the cold and silent death – Paul – rushing towards him. Out of pure instinct, he immediately created a blast with magic that launched him backward, but to his no surprise, Paul immediately closed the distance. Rudeus had to catch both his legs at once; but before he finished prepping Paul was one step away from him! In a blind panic, Rudeus swung a careless attack with his sword, which Paul skillfully deflected. Rudeus already knew for a fact a counterstrike was coming, but he couldn’t do anything – a short, sharp blow came down to his neck and he blacked out.

Rudeus woke up and found himself tied up inside a box. Across him sat a woman – brown skin, muscular physique, with animal ears and tails. She introduced herself as Ghislaine and that she was going to be his acquaintance. Rudeus looked outside the window in the box and saw they were moving across a land he knew nothing of. He was in a carriage, tied up, and on an unfamiliar land – alarms went inside Rudeus’ head. When he asked the woman about the situation, Ghislaine handed out a letter from Paul.

He read the letter, Rudeus finally understood what was going on. Paul had beaten him unconscious and sent him away for a job. The job required him to stay at the Citadel of Roa for five years to tutor a violent young lady. And he would get swordsmanship training from Ghislaine, who Paul remarked as a Sword King, while he would also coach her on basic education. Additionally, in five years, once he finishes providing the young lady solid education, his contract entitles him to a special reward: a payment covering the cost of tuition for two people to the University of Magic.

【
Paul's POV
】

Paul’s son, Rudeus, was lying unconscious on the ground. This method wasn’t particularly an admirable one but Paul came to the conclusion he had no choice. He was trying to beat his son unconscious to send him away for a job he would most likely refuse if presented to him directly.

Paul was surprised by how well Rudeus responded the instant he made the first move. Though the fight lasted for only a few seconds, it actually took Paul three steps to strike him, which one too many to deal with a magician. Paul was proud of his son's knack for battle.

Paul proceeded to hand over his letter for Rudeus to Ghislaine and unceremoniously dumped Rudeus in the carriage. Looking at the carriage moving away down the road Paul silently addressed to Rudeus. He had never wanted to part this way but felt he could not have convinced Rudeus to take the job. Still, as a father, Paul couldn’t just do nothing and had to rely on this crude method. He expected his clever son to understand sooner or later. Paul knew his son would have some harsh experiences, but just like him, he wholeheartedly believed Rudeus would grow stronger and find things he loved that way. After all, he was his own son.

Extra Chapter: The Mother of the Greyrat Family

【
Zenith’s POV
】

Zenith Greyrat, born in the Holy Country of Millis and by birth a member of the aristocracy, was a clueless child who did everything her parents told. As a member of the aristocracy, her life had already been set down the road. But she didn’t end up following it. Zenith’s life changed forever on her fifteenth birthday. She had a terrible fight with her parents and ran away from home. She had been sick of letting her parents control her life.

Zenith was hopelessly naïve. A band of thugs spotted her immediately and out her into their party as a healer. But, to her luck, a man came to her rescue and dragged Zenith into his own party. That was how she met her
husband – Paul Greyrat. Zenith and Paul were total opposites in how they lived their lives, but she slowly grew attracted to him.

She slept with Paul one fateful day, but to her carelessness she got pregnant after a single night. To her incredible surprise, Paul did the honorable thing to marry her. Then she bore his child, his name was Rudeus Greyrat.

⌊
Timeskip: post-Chapter 9
 ⌋

At the moment, Zenith was watching Rudeus. He crouched next to his little sisters’ cribs. Whenever they made a fuss he would make a silly face to amuse them; it always ended with a satisfied grin on his face. It wasn’t a usual occurence. Rudeus always had the most serious expression on; he never looked particularly satisfied. But now, he was making silly faces to amuse his little sisters. Seeing him like that put Zenith in a good mood herself.

Zenith recalled the early years with Rudeus. She felt he secretly looked down on the rest of the family due to his incredible talent. But Zenith had it all wrong. She realized it in the midst of their greatest family crisis. Rudeus stepped in to guide things to a neat conclusion. She, at that time, understood that he did love his family in his own way.

Suddenly, Zenith was waken up from memories by Norn's cry. It was time for her milk; Zenith proceeded to feed her. Norn looked satisfied and put her away in her crib. But then, Aisha started to cry next. After checking up on her Rudeus turned towards Zenith with an anxious face. He said Aisha was hungry too and Lilia was out at the moment. For a moment, Zenith thought if breastfeeding Aisha would make her feel anger or revulsion. But immediately she shook off her uncertainty and picked up Aisha. When she started to feed, she felt nothing other than her warm, pleasant awareness of motherhood just like with Norn. She was truly glad.

Zenith was looking out of the window stroking Rudeus’ head beside her. Outside was a peaceful spring afternoon, golden fields of wheat stretched out endlessly. She felt utterly content. The peace they had now was only because Rudeus intervened that day.
Thank god for Rudeus
, she thought.

Light Novel Volume 13/Summary
=============================

Chapter 1: Roxy's New Job

The chapter opens a couple months later after the return from the
Begaritt Continent
.
Rudeus
 and
Roxy
 wake after their night together. A flashback occurs and takes place a month after the return from the Begaritt Continent. Roxy tells Rudeus that she wants to become a teacher at
Ranoa Magic Academy
. They decide to head to the school in order for Roxy to become a teacher. When they arrive at Vice Principal
Jinas
 office, they see him at his table with piles of paperwork as usual. Upon seeing Roxy, his old student, Jinas was shocked. Roxy tells Jinas that she wants to become a teacher much to Jinas surprise. As they start talking, Rudeus leaves the room as he felt left out in the conversation. Rudeus heads to Zanoba’s research room.
Zanoba
, upon seeing Rudeus is shocked as just 6 months ago Rudeus told Zanoba he was going to come back in 2 years. Zanoba shows Rudeus what he’s been working on for the past half year. It was a glove like magic tool that can be used as a left hand for Rudeus which he had lost. Rudeus comes up with
Zariff’s Prosthetic Hand
 as a name for the hand since Zanoba and Cliff worked to make it. After a bit of talking, Roxy enters the room and tells Rudeus that she got the job. After, Rudeus goes around and introduces Roxy to his friends such as
Rinia
,
Pursena
,
Ariel
,
Luke
 and
Nanahoshi
. He didn’t go to Cliff because there were sultry sounds coming from his room and didn’t want to interfere. They leave school and head home but Rudeus realizes that’s he didn’t introduce Roxy and his wife. Rudeus says that he will eventually introduce her as his second wife.

Chapter 2: Year Three

Rudeus
 gets up and gets prepared to go to
school
 for his third year. Before anything, he takes a look at his daughter
Lucy
. Rudeus had thoughts of Lucy being someone reincarnated but quickly brushed that aside. They also hire a nurse to take care of Lucy when they’re at school. They eat breakfast and head to the school. At the entrance, they encounter
Rinia
 and
Pursena
. Upon hearing about Rudeus’s second wife, they tell
Sylphy
 to not get outclassed. Sylphy makes a expression that’s shows discomfort and Rudeus thought that she was feeling uneasy on the inside. Loudly, Rudeus announced that he loved Sylphy and the people cheered. He then said that he also loved
Roxy
 which most people booed at since most of the people were believers of Millis. Slyphy, visibly embarrassed, hurries to get to her duties. It was at this point that Rudeus remembered that in school she was Fittz. Roxy also hurries away after finding out there was a morning gathering for teacher. Rudeus then heads to homeroom. He then finds out from Rinia and Pursena that there are many rumors going around on how Rudeus lost his left hand.
Cliff
 then calls Rudeus over and asks why he hadn’t greeted him upon his return. Rudeus states that it was because he sounded really busy with
Elinalise
 so he decided not to bother. The homeroom teacher walks in with Roxy and states that Roxy will be their homeroom teacher next year as he is returning to his hometown. Roxy introduces herself as “Roxy M. Greyrat” and also says that she was Rudeus’s second wife. Cliff was visibly upset upon hearing the news however, since Rudeus wasn’t a Milis believer, he calmed down. Later, Rudeus heads home with Sylphy and Roxy. Rudeus then describes his life at home afterschool. Roxy prepares for her classes tomorrow,
Aisha
 makes dinner, Sylphy cuddles with Lucy but occasionally trains her magic and
Lilia
 took care of
Zenith
. When everyone was asleep at night, Rudeus sneaks into the basement, into a secret room to pray in front of the “holy relic”.

Chapter 3: Training with Norn

The chapter opens a month later.
Rudeus
 is seen waking up and grabbing a stone sword he had made to use as a practice sword.
Norn
, in her gym outfit goes outside to train with Rudeus. They do workouts just so that they can get Norn’s body in shape and ready to learn the sword. After the workout, Norn asks Rudeus if she could start learning the sword. Rudeus thought for a second and then agreed but warned Norn that he was going to be strict. Norn agreed. In the evening, Rudeus and Norn is seen in the third external training ground near
Ranoa Magic Academy
. Rudeus warns Norn on quitting learning the sword, which includes the fact that Rudeus won’t teach her again and that Rudeus would never allow Norn to use
Paul’s
 sword. They start by running with a sword in hand as in a battlefield, you need to know how to run fast with a sword in hand. Rudeus also discovered that Norn is reluctant to hitting someone with full force so Rudeus offers to stand still and be a dummy for Norn. Eventually, she gets rid of her reluctance to hit people. They spar at the end which Rudeus wins without even trying. As Rudeus was applying healing magic to
Norn
, he spots a bunch of onlookers. Rudeus tells Norn to leave and change. He then walks over to the onlookers and asks what they were doing. They were all scared to speak at first but one of them eventually said something. He said that Rudeus was bullying Norn as she never expressed the want to learn how to use the sword according to him. He also stated that he forced Norn to learn the sword. Rudeus quickly clears up the misconceptions telling them that she was his sister and that she’s training by her own will.
Rudeus
 discovers that this group of onlookers was like a fan club for Norn.
Rudeus
 establishes a fan club for Norn consisting of around 30 members and also making rules on contacting Norn. Three days later, Rudeus was kicked out of the fan club for bathing with Norn.

Chapter 4: Can I Keep Him?

Aisha
 was seen in the garden caring for the plants with
Zenith
. They were pulling out weeds.
Rudeus
 then remembers a time when Zenith would always spend her time pulling out weeds from her garden. Aisha then tells Rudeus to wait in her room because she wants to show him something. Later, Rudeus goes to Aisha’s room. He looks around the room and notes what’s inside. He stated that the room was perfectly clean from top to bottom. He also states how there were plants near the window and how there was a doll that’s looked like a magician on her bed. He also checked out her closet which has maid clothes, panties, shirts and other girly clothes. All of them were neatly folded or hanged. Suddenly, Rudeus hears sound coming from somewhere. He looks everywhere until he finds out that one of the plants was a
Treant
. Aisha then enters the room. They argue about whether or not to keep the Treant. Aisha threatens to tell
Sylphy
 and
Roxy
 about the hidden shrine in the basement. Just then, Roxy walks into the room. Aisha was about to tell Roxy about the shrine but was stopped by Rudeus with his hand. Roxy looks at the Treant and was amazed. Roxy states that the Treant was harmless meaning Aisha could keep it. They decided to name it
Baby Treant
 or
Beet
 for short. Rudeus established rules such as not letting Beet near
Lucy
, training it to not hurt anyone, everyone must be informed on what the plant is and it must be disposed immediately if it hurts anyone.

Chapter 5: Paternal Dignity

Three months pass and it’s the summer.
Rudeus
 is looking at
Lucy
 thinking about
Paul
. He thinks that he finally understands what it means to be a father. He also wonders if this is what Paul felt like when he had Rudeus. Suddenly, Lucy starts to cry. Rudeus tries to calm her down by making faces like his father had done.
Suzanne
, the nurse and Rudeus’s old adventure friend, walks up to them. After exchanging a couple words, Suzanne says it was time to breast feed Lucy so Rudeus goes into his room to study the
mana
 absorbing magic stone he got from when they fought the Hydra. He figured out that in order for the mana absorption to work, you need to put mana in the back of the stone. However, the amount of mana needed needs to be more or equal to the amount of mana the spell or magic circle has. It was like distortion magic but better since it can dispel completed spells. After,
Zanoba
,
Ginger
, and
Julie
 arrive at the
Greyrat
 household. Zanoba tells Rudeus about the progress he’s made on investigating the automatic doll. He says that he has finished investigating the hands and are now moving onto the feet. He also tells him that he has to make a new prosthetic hand from scratch which could take a month. Then, Julie goes up to Rudeus and gives him a doll of
Ruijerd
 she was assigned to make. Rudeus notes on how Julie had improved. They also talk about
Norn
, who seems to have a hidden talent for writing. She wrote a story on Ruijerd and Julie can’t stop asking Rudeus to read it to her. It is revealed that Rudeus wants
Roxy
 to teach him King ranked water magic.

Chapter 6: A Water King is Born

At school, lustful noises can be heard from a gym locker room.
Roxy
 runs out the the gym locker as the student council arrive on the scene.
Luke
 and
Fittz
(aka Sylphy) arrive and Luke says that
Rudeus
 was attacking a “female student”. Luke hands the situation to Fittz to deal with. Fittz sighs as she tells Roxy that many people still don’t know that Roxy is teacher. Fittz also scolds Rudeus for what happened. Fittz thought that Rudeus was trying to seduce Roxy but then realizes that Rudeus was just trying to get Roxy to teach him King ranked water magic. Roxy didn’t want to because she was scared that her student would become better than her but she agreed eventually. Later in the day, Rudeus,
Sylphy
, and Roxy head out the the outskirts to learn King ranked water magic. Roxy demonstrated the King ranked water magic [
Lightning
]. It starts as the Saint ranked water magic [
Cumulonimbus
] but after a few more
incantations
, lightning struck a tree completely disintegrating it. Roxy then fell as the spell used up all her magic. Rudeus tries to use the spell. He uses it without any problems. Sylphy also tries but failed on the last part. After this, Rudeus officially becomes a King ranked water magic user. As they were riding home, Roxy and Sylphy are both visibly exhausted. On the way home, Rudeus thinks about what had happened throughout his life. He also creates a weaker version of [Lightning] called [Electric] for numbing the nervous system of his opponents.

Chapter 7: The Wedding Ceremony

The chapter starts after they get home.
Rudeus
 decides to sleep in another room separate from
Roxy
 and
Sylphy
 as he knows they are tired and unwilling to do “things”.
Aisha
, seeing Rudeus going to sleep alone, invites him to sleep with her (NOT SEXUALLY). To Rudeus’s surprise,
Norn
 also wanted to sleep with him (ALSO NOT SEXUALLY). As he sleeps, he thinks about the relationships he has with Roxy and Sylphy. Being the pervert he is, he wants to have a threesome with them. The next morning, he goes to
Cliff
’s laboratory. When he walks in, he sees Cliff researching how to remove curses and
Elinalise
 sitting near a window. Cliff was researching the mana absorbing magic stones. Ryder’s brings up the wedding of Cliff and Elinalise and offers to help but was rejected as Cliff wanted to do it himself. Rudeus starts talking to Elinalise and she brings up the topic of a threesome with him, Roxy, and Sylphy. Rudeus denies it at first but after hearing that she could make it happen, Rudeus agrees. However, Rudeus will have to give Elinalise
Asura Kingdom
's treasured
aphrodisiac
. Rudeus agrees to give it to her as she fantasizes about a drugged Cliff on their wedding night. A month later, at Saint
Milis
 Church, Cliff and Elinalise are about to get married. A priest stands in the middle of them as he says oaths. Cliff and Elinalise say their oaths, kiss each other on the forehead, and they get married under the Milis church. As everyone looks at the newlyweds, Roxy looks at Rudeus with a red face. Rudeus has never had a wedding ceremony with Roxy before. So he kisses Roxy on the forehead. Sylphy gives an expression that she also wants one so she kisses her on the forehead as well. Norn, looking embarrassed that someone of her relation is doing this at a wedding, complains. However, Rudeus picks her up and kisses her on the forehead as well. Aisha also comes and asks for a kiss on the forehead so he gives her one. Then, he remembers a letter from Paul saying to hold a celebration once everyone is reunited. Rudeus decides to hold a big celebration for his sisters’ 10th birthday and Roxy’s wedding.

Chapter 8: A Lucky Man

Rudeus
,
Roxy
, and
Sylphy
 all go downtown to search for a present for
Norn
 and
Aisha
. The present is a secret to them. As they walked, they saw many merchants busily running by with carts full of goods. A festival was taking place that celebrates the harvests of the year. There were also many of the beast race whom have come to take the hands of
Rinia
 or
Pursena
. It’s is revealed that there is another reason for coming here. With
Elinalise
’s instructions, they would find a hotel to stay at and perform the deed. They spend the whole day searching for presents. However, what Roxy doesn’t know is that he’s also searching for a present for her as well and the celebration is both for his sisters and for Roxy. They stumble upon a clothing store and they decide to buy Norn and Aisha new clothes as a present. Norn would be getting a colored overcoat and Aisha would be getting embroidered boots. Suddenly, while browsing the store, Roxy sees something that stops her in her tracks. It was a magicians robe with a hat on it. She looks at the price tag on the hat and silently declares it too expensive. Sylphy and Rudeus notice this and then Roxy’s present was also decided. They walk around some more and as the shops start closing, they head towards a tavern that Elinalise told Rudeus to go to because it was the perfect place to do the deed. But what Rudeus didn’t expect was for Roxy and Sylphy to already know about this place. Sylphy was worried that Lucy would have no one taking care of her but Rudeus got
Lilia
 to do that. Roxy also had concerns about school but Rudeus also took care of that. Without anything to worry about, they gave themselves to Rudeus’s care. First they had dinner, then they do the deed.

Chapter 9: Birthday Party

The next morning,
Roxy
 and
Rudeus
 lead
Norn
 and
Aisha
 out of the house so that
Sylphy
 and
Lilia
 can prepare the party. Roxy, Rudeus, Norn, and Aisha all go fishing together. However Norn, Aisha, and Rudeus have no idea how to fish. Luckily, Roxy knew how to and taught all of them how to fish. They also agreed that the loser would have to obey whatever the winner says. Roxy also starts talking with Norn as they don’t have a very good relationship since she’s a second wife and Roxy wishes to fix that. Later on, Aisha is in the lead and Rudeus is dead last. Rudeus decides to activate his demon eye but still can’t catch anything while Aisha already caught 4 fish. When the sunsets, they head home. They talk about their day and how fun it was. Norn and Aisha were arguing about who had more fish and who’s were bigger. When they arrived home, Sylphy, Lilia, and
Zenith
 all surprise Norn and Aisha. Norn had no clue this was happening and was in shock. Aisha was just surprised. They head into the dining room which was decorated with flowers and Rudeus gives a speech about the family’s reunion. Rudeus then calls Sylphy to take out the presents. Aisha opens her’s and gets new boots, Norn opens her’s and gets a new jacket. Aisha goes to show Lilia and Norn goes to show Zenith. However, unexpectedly, Zenith’s usually blank face expressed a smile for a brief moment and everyone saw. Everyone was overjoyed to see Zenith express emotions at last. Finally, it was time for Roxy to open her present. She was confused at first but it was revealed to be her wedding gift. She opens it to see the hat that she had wanted from the store. Tears of happiness stream from her eyes as she thanks Rudeus and Sylphy deeply. After that, they start eating the food prepared.

, and
Zanoba
 all gather in Nanahoshi’s room for phase 3 of her experiment. Rudeus starts pouring magic into the magic circle. The circle shines multiple different colors and then a watermelon appears. Since they didn’t know if watermelons existed in this world, for now they called it a success. Everyone gathered at a tavern for a celebration. While everyone was celebrating,
Norn
 goes to Rudeus and tells him that she had joined the
Student Council
. Rudeus was worried at first because sword training on top of writing a book and now student council business might be too much pressure for her. However, Rudeus approves this anyways as he believes his little sister will find a way to make it work. Suddenly, they hear Nanahoshi yell “let’s cut the watermelon!”. So they cut it and everyone got a slice. As they did Rudeus realizes it’s seedless. There is no known method in this world to make a seedless fruit so it confirmed that the experiment was a success. Later on, Nanahoshi discusses phase 4 of the experiment with Rudeus. Nanahoshi brings up a person that can help them with phase 4 of her experiment. Rudeus asks who this person is and Nanahoshi replies with
Armored Dragon King Perugius

Summary

Chapter 1: Floating Fortress

Nanahoshi
 and
Rudeus
 heads to
Perugius
’s location with
Ariel
,
Sylphie
,
Luke
,
Roxy
,
Elinalise
,
Cliff
, and
Zanoba
. They’ve been walking for half a day and finally reach a stone monument that says “Monument Of
Seven Great Major Powers
”. Nanahoshi then takes out a golden flute which looks more like a whistle cause it has no finger holes. A couple seconds later, a man appears out of no where. He looked around and saw Roxy. He said the demon race wasn’t allowed on the sky castle because Perugius disliked them. Roxy looked flattered but was cheered up by Rudeus with a kiss. He said that Perugius was going to use teleportation magic to teleport them to the sky castle. Once they were teleported, They arrive on the sky castle and are greeted by
Sylvaril
. She leads them through the castle which was laced in art and structures. Zanoba was extremely excited. Before they continued, Sylvaril stopped and looked at Rudeus and Sylphie. She asked if knew someone by the name of
Hitogami
. Rudeus hesitates as when he answered the question to
Orsted
, he almost killed him. Sylphie says that she’s never heard of anyone with such a name. So they continue walking through the castle. They reach the door which leads to where Perugius is. Ariel requests a room to put their things in and to change into formal clothes. After they change, they go back to the door. Rudeus, about to meet Perugius, has an uneasy feeling.

Chapter 2: An Audience with Perugius

The group walks into a room with
Perugius
 sitting on a throne.
Arumanfi
 on his left and
Sylvaril
 on his right. The rest of his familiars on either side of the group.
Nanahoshi
 spoke first and Perugius agreed to teach her summoning magic.
Ariel
 spoke next and Perugius saw right through her and tore down her goal of getting his aid. Then
Rudeus
 speaks up and Perugius tells him is mana resembles
Laplace
. Rudeus asks him about how to cure
Zenith
's curse and he says he doesn't know. Then he looks over at
Elinalise
 and describes saving her 200 years ago from a Labyrinth. Something that she never mentioned before. Rudues says that they can discuss it later. Next is
Zanoba
 who asks about the dollmaker's crest from the blueprints in Rudeus' basment. Perugius says that it belongs to the Maniacal Dragon King,
Chaos
. Lastly,
Sylphie
 asks her question. But before she can Perugius says that he will give a name to her son if she has one. She then asks about the Displacement Incident. He then explains that it was an accident and not manmade. After all of that, everyone proceeds to their guest rooms.

Chapter 3: The Past and a Curse, Summoning, and Jealousy

Elinalise
 finally tells
Rudeus
 about her past and how her curse came to fruition. However, she explains that she never got her memories back from before she was saved from the Labyrinth and that
Zenith
's situation is different from hers. Elinalise returns to
Cliff
 with Rudeus not learning anything new about Zenith's Curse. After breakfast, Rudeus,
Nanahoshi
, Cliff, and
Zanoba
 go to a separate room and learn about summoning magic from
Sylvaril
. Rudeus interrupts a lot with questions. He apologizes but Sylvaril compliments how passionate he is on the subject. She teaches them about the two different types of summoning magic. Fiend and Spirit summoning. She also reveals that she is not one of
Perugius
' ancient spirit familiars. Rather she is one of the skyfolk that he saved during
Laplace
's War.

Before lunchtime Sylvaril asks them what they would like to eat and whether if they wanted something specific. Cliff asks for something from
Millis
. Zanoba asks for something from Shirone. Nanahoshi says she'll go with whatever. Rudeus then asks for many different Japanese food ingredients. Sylvaril says that they don't have anything similar to what Rudeus asked for. Though she knows of something similar to soy sauce in the
Biheiril
 Kingdom.
Arumanfi
 takes an hour to go fetch the supposed item. However, he doesn't come back with soy sauce but something that looks similar to miso soup. Rudeus then asks for some white fish considering that they already had rice and miso. Nanahoshi also got a plate of what Rudeus requested. The food tasted terrible but she appreciated the gesture from Rudeus and thanked him.

After their afternoon lecture, Rudeus began to wander the halls of the fortress. He then spots Zanoba and Cliff who want to investigate some nearby stairs. However, they are unsure as to whether they are allowed to go that way. Nanahoshi pops up and says that they can go and that they would find something that they would enjoy. So, with Nanahoshi as their guide they venture below the main floors of the fortress. They go down several flights of stairs never finding anything interesting in any of the rooms with open doors. Down there they find some architechture from before the first Great Human-Demon War. They finally make it to the bottom to find a room with murals on the walls. They decipher that the murals are connected and tell a story but they can't tell any specifics about it. Then Arumanfi and Perugius pop up at the door that they came in. The group explains that they were just exploring and that's why they were down there. Perugius says he does not mind and that he was not the one who created the murals. Explaining that when he first acquired the castle that nothing was in it besides the murals. He also says that he isn't fond of the paintings.

Arumanfi guides the group back up to their rooms. While Rudeus is sitting in his room,
Sylphie
 enters and she talks about Ariel struggling with Perugius. Rudeus advises her on it. Sylphie then plays a prank on him and acts like she's super jealous of him spending so much time with Nanahoshi. They hug and Rudeus explains that she's just a friend and Sylphie gets over her slight jealousy. As Sylphie opens the door to leave, Nanahoshi is seen standing their and says she heard everything and isn't interested in Rudeus while having a massive coughing fit. Sylphie tries to help her by casting detoxification magic on her to no avail. Nanahoshi then coughs up blood and collapses onto the floor, losing consciousness. Sylphie extremely scared and shocked about the situation and denies that it had anything to do with her. Rudeus reassures her and calms her down as he had seen the whole ordeal. He then tells her to go get help from either Cliff or Perugius.

Chapter 4: Lament

Nanahoshi is now in the sickbay. The group finds out the she has Dryne Syndrome. A disease that infected humans over 7,000 years ago when they didn't have mana. Nanahoshi laments about her whole situation and how unfair it is. Rudeus sympathizes with her and promises to help her. He, Elinalise, Zanoba, and Cliff prepare a journey to the demon continent to ask
Kishirika
 for help as she is one of the few people that was alive during that time.

Chapter 10: Turning Point (Part 4)

Rudeus returns home. He explains to his family everything that occurred over the past few days, including the details regarding Zenith's curse. He falls asleep and then sees Hitogami again. Hitogami reveals what would have happened if Rudeus had followed his previous advice. Paul would still be alive, and Roxy would also somehow be alive (but Roxy and Rudeus would not be married of course). Rudeus would have been married instead to Rinia and Pursena. Hitogami then ends their encounter by requesting that Rudeus go check on his home's basement. Rudeus is more trusting of Hitogami at this point, and agrees. Rudeus then wakes up. As Rudeus is about to leave his room and check the basement, he sees an old man who introduces himself as Rudeus from the future.

Chapter 11: An End and a Beginning

The old Rudeus from the future stated that he arrived here via past teleportation magic. He warned Rudeus that if he were to go to the basement, as per Hitogami's instructions, it would trigger a chain of events that would cause a mouse to infect Roxy with magic stone disease, which causes one to slowly turn into a rock and then die. Killing Roxy is apparently part of Hitogami's plan. Old Rudeus explains that Hitogami also somehow manipulated events so that Princess Ariel returns to Asura to start her revolt. Sylphie to follows Ariel and she is killed in battle. Old Rudeus advises present Rudeus to forgive Eris and reform his connection with her, and send a letter to her in the Holy Land of Swords. Old Rudeus also advises present Rudeus to be skeptical of Hitogami, but to avoid direct confrontation. His third piece of advice was for Rudeus to "consult with Nanohoshi". After giving the above advice, Old Rudeus gives present Rudeus his diary from the future, and then dies.

After Old Rudeus dies, present Rudeus then cremates his self from the future. He then goes to the basement and confirms the mouse that would infect Roxy with magic stone disease, and kills it, with plans to send the mouses' corpse to the magic guild to be studied. Rudeus remains unable to go to sleep, and so begins writing a letter to Eris.

Light Novel Volume 15/Summary
=============================

Summary

Chapter 1: The Diary (Part 1)

Rudeus reads the diary from his future self, which described the following events. Roxy became infected with Magic Stone disease, which was identified by Cliff and his Eye of Identification. This can only be healed with God rank detoxification. So, Cliff, Zanoba and Rudeus go to the Holy Kingdom of Milis using teleport magic circles to get the book with God Class Detoxification chants. Unfortunately, this book is within a cathedral that cannot be entered unless you are archbishop level. They decide to steal the book but are caught. Cliff dies during the battle and the magic teleporting circle that they used is destroyed. They also become wanted men in the Milis region. By the time Rudeus and Zanoba arrive home, Roxy was already half crystalized and had died. Elinalise is informed of Cliff's death, and leaves town while heavily pregnant. Rudeus then becomes depressed due to Roxy's death and dependent on alcohol. He begins neglecting Sylphy. Sylphy then leaves with Ariel who has returned to the Kingdom of Asura. Rudeus then decides to chase after Sylphy by following her to Asura. During his travels, he frequently runs into Eris. She is unable to properly express her feeling towards Rudeus and so just hits him. Rudeus discovers that Ariel has returned to Asura in order to gather an army to perform a coup d'etat. This fails however, and so Ariel, Sylphy, and Luke all die.

Chapter 2: The Diary (Part 2)

Rudeus continues to read the diary from his future self, which described the following events. After Sylphy's death, Rudeus spent more time going to brothels. He also frequently ran into Eris, who also was living in Sharia. Rudeus continues to have mixed feelings about Eris. The Milis Church put a bounty on the heads of Rudeus and Zanoba due to their exploits from stealing the God Class detoxification chant book. Zanoba completes his automaton research. He is able to create essentially a robot that looks like Sylphy and acts like her as well. Rudeus ends up destroying this robot. Zanoba ultimately mass produces his robots. Rudeus develops a hatred for Hitogami. He vows to get stronger in order to kill Hitogami. Throughout this process, he loses touch with his family; only Aisha stays in touch. To augment his physical strength, he and Zanoba develop fully body armour similar to his prosthetic hand, which Rudeus can augment with magic to improve his physical strength.

Future Rudeus continues to work on his magic over the years, developing gravity magic, electricity magic, voice magic. However, he becomes a bad person; he would frequently get into arguments, do whatever he wanted, and occasionally raped women. Rudeus continued to run into Eris, and so he begins to falsely suspect that she is affiliated with Hitogami. Rudeus continues to try to gather more information about Hitogami by questioning beings who are long-lived. He ends up trying to speak to Atofe, but ends up fighting her and her imperial guard, including Moore. During the battle, he becomes careless and is saved by Eris, but then she is killed as a result. After Eris' death, Ghyslaine explains to Rudeus that Eris has loved him all this time and had followed him around for this reason. Ghylaine blames Rudeus for Eris' death.

Years pass, and Zanoba dies, killed by the Order of the Temple. Julie, Ginger, and Aisha are killed as well. With this, Rudeus no longer has any living loved ones. There was no mention in the diary of the fate of Lucy, Norn or Lilia. Through his travels, Rudeus discovers the nature of this world, which is that it shaped like a cube, with six sides: Dragon world, Human world, Demon world, Beast world, Ocean world, Sky world. The interior of the die is the Void World, where Hitogami resides. Rudeus learns that in order to travel to the Void World, one must collect the 5 ancient Dragon Race treasures. However, collecting all 5 treasures turns out to be impossible within his lifespan. Rudeus then learns how to travel to the past and he decides to go to the past to correct his mistakes. The diary then ends here.

Chapter 3: Resolve

After finishing reading his future self's diary, Rudeus has a discussion with Sylphy and Roxy. He vaguely reveals that someone has shown him the future in which a bad person would cause terrible things to happen to his family. Rudeus then broaches the subject of adding Eris to their polygamous relationship. Sylphy and Roxy initially object, since they know that Eris broke Rudeus' heart, which resulted in his erectile dysfunction. Rudeus reassures them that he now knows that this was actually a misunderstanding. Both Sylphy and Roxy tentatively agree to accepting Eris, depending on how well Rudeus' and Eris' are able to reconcile in their meeting together.

Rudeus then falls asleep, and he sees Hitogami in the white void. Hitogami is initially extremely frustrated at the fact that future Rudeus has disrupted Hitogami's plans to kill Rudeus' family. Hitogami reports that Orsted is trying to kill Hitogami, but cannot do so alone. However, Rudeus and his descendants are not affected by Orsted's curse, which cause all beings to hate Orsted. This means that Rudeus' descendants may end up assisting Orsted and kill Hitogami, which would destroy the world. Furthermore, Rudeus and his descendants have 'strong fate', which means that Hitogami has difficulty with changing their fate. So, because Rudeus and his descendants have strong fate and may end up helping Orsted to kill Hitogami, Hitogami tries to kill Rudeus' descendants to prevent his own ultimate death. Rudeus tells Hitogami that he will do anything for him if he is able to save his family. Hitogami therefore suggests that if Rudeus wants to save his family, he needs to kill Orsted.

Rudeus then wakes up. He vows to kill Orsted to save his family from Hitogami.

Chapter 4: Nanahoshi's Hypothesis

Rudeus consults with Nanahoshi, in accordance with his future self's instructions. He tells her everything about his future self's encounter, the diary, and his dream with Hitogami. After spending the day reviewing the diary and thinking, Nanahoshi discusses her hypotheses with Rudeus, which is as follows. Rudeus and Nanahoshi were transported into this world by someone whose goal is to kill Hitogami. Nanahoshi was transported so that she may create some currently unknown method to kill Hitogami, while Rudeus was transported so that his descendants and Orsted could kill Hitogami with that method.

Nanahoshi then suggests to Rudeus that he team up with Orsted instead. Rudeus refuses, since Hitogami is unreachable, while Orsted is within this world. He reasons that for the purpose of protecting his family from Hitogami, it would be easier to kill Orsted as commanded by Hitogami, than to kill Hitogami himself. Rudeus then begs Nanahoshi to help him kill Orsted. She is reluctant, as Orsted has saved her in the past, but ultimately agrees to help.

Chapter 5: A Letter from Afar

Eris gets ready to leave the Holy Land of the Sword to meet up with Rudeus in Ranoa, who she hasn't been in contact for many years. Just prior to departing, she receives a letter from Rudeus. The letter describes how Rudeus initially thought Eris had rejected him, but he now knows this was a misunderstanding and that she actually loves him. Rudeus informs Eris in this letter that he currently has two wives, but is willing to accept Eris has his third wife. Eris' two friends argue over whether Rudeus is an asshole or not. Rudeus' letter also included a post script, which stated that he planned to challenge Orsted to battle, with the caveat that he may not survive. Eris becomes excited at this, and she and Ghyslaine head off toward Rudeus.

Chapter 6: Preparations

Rudeus works on his preparations to kills Orsted. He works on creating full body magic armour that his future self also used, with the help of Zanoba and Cliff. He decides that he needs to find a suitable partner to fight Orsted; Badigadi was missing, Ruijerd wasn't present, and Perugius refused. He rules out Zanoba, Cliff and Elinalise since they are his friends. He considers begging Eris to help fight, if she were to arrive in time. He puts the subject of finding a partner on hold for now. Rudeus also considers various battle tactics to take down Orsted, including using traps and sneak attacks.

During these preparations, Hitogami then reappears to Rudeus in his dreams. Hitogami is quite pleased with Rudeus' decision to try to kill Orsted, but warns that he will wipe out Rudeus' family if he fails. Hitogami offers advice on building the magic armour and suggests that Rudeus use magic tools in his fight. Hitogami again confirms that he cannot see Orsted's future but can see his own, and so he sees that in the future he is killed by Orsted and Rudeus' descendants. Rudeus gets Hitogami to promise that if he kills Orsted, that Hitogami will leave Rudeus and his family alone.

A month passes, and the magic armour construction is making good progress. It stands 3 meters tall, which is much larger than the armour that future Rudeus created for himself. By making the armour bigger, the engineering was easier and it was more robust. Rudeus also goes shopping with Roxy to buy magic tools. He comes up with an idea to multiple of the same tool together so that he can fire off his stone cannons in rapid succession like a gatling gun. They enlist the help of a craftsman to help make this tool. Rudeus then consults with Nanahoshi. They come up with the idea of using poison. They also come up with a plan to lure Orsted. Using Ariel's connections, Rudeus buys the poison that he plans to use against Orsted. Rudeus chooses his planned battleground against Orsted and practices using traps. He also learns close quarters combat from Elinalise.

Chapter 7: Readying for Battle

Another month passes, and the magic armour is complete. It is 3 meters tall, and he wears it like a mecha suit. It has a gatling cannon installed on one hand that fires stone cannons. The other hand has a magic absorbing stone. The armour is also equipped with a shield with Paul's Tantou sword attached, which can ignore armour. Elinalise reveals that she is pregnant with Cliff's child. Cliff confirms this for himself with his Identification eye. Rudeus tests out the magic armour by sparring with Sylphy and Zanoba. Sylphy's magic and Zanoba's punches are ineffective against the armour. Rudeus is quite pleased with the armour.

Back at home, Roxy announces to the family that she is pregnant. The whole family congratulates her. Rudeus notes that this was a stark contrast to the atmosphere when Lilia revealed her pregnancy due to Paul's infidelity, many years ago. Aisha reveals she has successfully cultivated rice in their garden. Rudeus is excited at the idea of being able to eat rice regularly again. The family then enjoys their dinner in celebration.

After dinner, Rudeus informs his family that he will be fighting a strong opponent, without specifically naming Orsted, and that his preparations for the past few months have been leading to this. He warns them that there's a chance he may not survive. Later that evening, Rudeus explains the whole situation to Roxy and Sylphy. He explains that he plans to fight Orsted, about the revelations from Hitogami, and that if he fails to kill Orsted, his family will be in danger. Sylphy and Roxy promise to protect their family and accept the fact that Rudeus will be fighting Orsted, possibly never to return.

Chapter 8: Quagmire vs. Dragon God

Orsted is lured into a deserted village, presumably by Nanahoshi. He is pricked by a poisoned handle and triggers a trap inside a building. Rudeus then follows up with a barrage of long range magic attacks, including a massive explosion like a nuclear bomb. Despite all this, Orsted takes minimal damage. Orsted then closes the distance between himself and Rudeus. Rudeus is able to do some damage to Orsted with his sword, whose force increases exponentially proportional to the enemy's defense. Orsted is then able to cut off both of the armour's arms off, including Rudeus' right arm. Orsted continues to damage Rudeus and his armour. Rudeus then ejects himself from the magic armour and the armour is destroyed. Outside of the armour, Rudeus is quickly defeated and seriously injured. Before killing Rudeus, Orsted questions Rudeus regarding why he came after him. Rudeus explains that Hitogami told Rudeus that his descendants would help Orsted kill Hitogami, which would destroy the world. Rudeus further explains that if he kills Orsted, Hitogami will spare Rudeus' family. Rudeus then crawls to Orsted's legs and begs that he give up on killing Hitogami. Orsted refuses and so Rudeus bites Orsted's leg, with the intention of launching a magical suicide attack, but Orsted uses Disturb magic and kicks him away. Before Orsted can kill and finish off Rudeus, Eris suddenly appears.

Chapter 9: Berserker Sword King vs. Dragon God

A few days prior to Orsted and Rudeus' battle, Eris and Ghyslaine arrived in Sharia city. They find Rudeus' home and meet his family. Eris then finds out that Rudeus has headed off on his own to kill Orsted.

After Orsted and Rudeus' battle had commenced, Eris and Ghyslaine are able to locate them by the sounds of battle and seeing a large explosion. Eris finds Rudeus just as he is on the verge of death. Eris faces Orsted while she leaves Ghyslaine to tend to Rudeus. Eris notes that Rudeus has been able to inflict a significant amount of damage to Orsted. Despite this, looking at Orsted, Eris recognizes that she is unable to defeat him alone. Orsted comments in surprise that Eris is risking her life for someone other than Luke, who was apparently fated to be her husband. Eris responds that she doesn't know of anyone with that name.

Eris thinks back to her last meeting with the Sword God, where he offered her one of three swords before she departed. She chose the Phoenix Elegant Dragon Sword, which has the ability to negate one's opponent's Battle Aura defense, or at least weaken it. The Sword God also gives a piece of advice for her confrontation with Orsted, which was to never move first, because of his strong counterattack, due to his proficiency in Water God sword style.

As Orsted and Eris face off, Orsted is surprised at the fact that Eris doesn't approach to attack. He comments that the Eris in front of him is different than the Eris he knows. Eris and Orsted then fight, with Eris remembering other bits of advice that the Sword God Gull Farion gave her, regarding fighting Orsted. Eris was able to cut off Orsted's hand, but he quickly reattaches it and heals the rest of his injuries from his battle with Rudeus. Eris then transitions from Sword God style to North God style and throws a secondary sword at Orsted, which is easily repelled.

At this point, Rudeus stands up, his injuries healed, but drained and near death. Roxy and Sylphy have arrived to support him. Eris and Sylphy then plan to fight Orsted, while having Rudeus escape with Roxy and Ghyslaine. Seeing this, Orsted then declares that he cannot allow Rudeus to live while he is allied with Hitogami. However, he does note that Rudeus can potentially be useful, with his magic armor, his immense magical power, and immunity to Orsted's curse (the curse which cause all living beings to fear Orsted). Therefore, Orsted offers Rudeus to betray Hitogami and join him. Orsted states that with his power, he should be able to protect Rudeus and his family from Hitogami, but is not able to give any absolute promises. Rudeus agrees to join Orsted to be his subordinate.

Chapter 10: Eris Greyrat (Part 1)

After his battle with Orsted, life returns to normal. Orsted heals Rudeus as promised. Both his missing upper limbs are regrown. Rudeus is also given a magic bracelet, which possibly prevents him from being spied on by Hitogami. Orsted also gives instructs Rudeus to contact him again once his magic has replenished. Rudeus reflects that he doesn't regret betraying Hitogami and in fact feels that Orsted is much more trustworthy. After returning, Rudeus then informed all those who helped him against Orsted that he lost and in fact has now joined him.

Eris has now started living with Rudeus and his family. Rudeus finally hears via Sylphy that Eris has been single-mindedly training for the sole purpose of fighting Orsted along with Rudeus. Rudeus discovers that from Eris perspective, he has betrayed her by marrying other women while she has been training. However, despite this, Roxy informs Rudeus that Eris is actually expecting him to propose to her, to be his third wife. Rudeus sees Eris teach swordplay to Norn. He notes how she has grown as person, as she is now able to logically explain concepts to a beginner, compared to her past self who would only learn things by instinct. Eris and Rudeus then talk. They apologize to each other for breaking the other's heart. Rudeus admits that he does love his current wives Sylphy and Roxy more than Eris. Eris states that she still loves Rudeus. As Rudeus did not explicitly state that he loves her back, she then challenges him to a duel She declares that he must love her as well if she wins, and that if he wins, she will leave.

Chapter 11: Eris Greyrat (Part 2)

Eris and Rudeus face each other, preparing to duel, outside of Sharia city. Ghyslaine acts as their judge. The fight commences but neither side moves to attack. Rudeus announces that he doesn't want to fight if it means that Eris will leave and declares that he loves her as well. Eris walks up to Rudeus and questions if he will still love her, despite her shortcomings compared to Roxy and Sylphy. Rudeus reassures her that he still loves her regardless. They then share an embrace. Rudeus gives a marriage proposal to Eris, and she accepts.

Back at home, during dinner, Rudeus announces that Eris will be his wife. Roxy and Sylphy accept Eris into their family. Aisha and Norn aren't happy with Rudeus for taking on a third wife, but ultimately accept Eris as well. Ghyslaine announces that now she has left Eris in Rudeus' care, her mission is done. She plans to go back to the Asura Empire to enact revenge on those who killed Sauros Greyrat, Eris' grandfather and her former master. Rudeus warns Ghyslaine that Water God and North Emperor are hired by Asura Empire, and Ghyslaine acknowledges she would not be able to defeat them alone. Rudeus suggests that Ghyslaine consider allying herself with Princess Ariel. She agrees to speak with Ariel.

Rudeus goes back to his bedroom, and finds Eris inside. Eris is very sexually assertive, and they have sex. The next morning, Rudeus receives a letter from Orsted.

Chapter 12: The Summons

In Orsted's letter, he asks Rudeus to meet him in a hut outside Sharia city's suburb, and tells him to come alone. Rudeus is nervous as he wants to make a good first impression with his new boss. Rudeus meets Orsted in the hut and it turns out that unbeknownst to Rudeus, Eris has also followed Rudeus there. Eris continues to distrust Orsted and warns him not to harm Rudeus. Orsted states that he will fulfill his promise right now, to protect Rudeus' family. They plan to summon a guardian magical beast which possesses strong fate to protect Rudeus' family. Orsted reasons that this will provide adequate protection as Hitogami cannot manipulate the fate of inhuman beings and cannot manipulate a large number of people at once. However, Orsted warns that since they cannot predict or monitor Hitogami's actions, they should also frequently check in on his family.

Orsted sees that Rudeus has several questions for him and gives him permission to ask them. Rudeus asks to know about Orsted himself. They first review Orsted's curse, which is that Orsted is feared and distrusted by all living creatures, with certain exceptions such as Nanahoshi and Rudeus. Rudeus reveals that this may be because he is from a different world, like Nanahoshi. Other exceptions to this curse are those from the ancient dragon-tribe. Next, Rudeus learns that Orsted's ability to be invisible from Hitogami's view, is actually not a curse. It is actually a technique developed by the first generation Dragon God for fighting Hitogami, which allows him to see fate and deviate from the path pre-destined by fate. The downside of this technique, however. is that it causes your magic regeneration to be 1000 times slower. Therefore, Orsted cannot freely use magic and cannot fight to his fullest ability. He reveals that he had actually used up a considerable amount of magic power in his fight against Rudeus, and so cannot fight seriously for a while. Therefore, Orsted is relying on Rudeus to act on his behalf. Rudeus then asks why Orsted is fighting Hitogami. Orsted reveals that his father, the first generation Dragon God, was killed by Hitogami. Since then, the ancient dragon-tribe's greatest wish, and the sole reason for existence of subsequent Dragon Gods is to defeat Hitogami. Orsted reveals that he is the 100th generation of of Dragon God, and that he was sent from the past to the present, by his father, using a method of reincarnation.

Chapter 13: Explanations

Orsted reveals that he has been alive for the past 2000 years. Rudeus thinks to himself that Orsted's grudge against Hitogami is too strong to be solely fueled by revenge for his father. He asks Orsted to clarify the reason for his grudge, but Orsted gives a vague answer. Nevertheless, Rudeus decides to trust Orsted.

Rudeus then asks about the Laplace factor. Rudeus reviews what he knows about Laplace. He was responsible for a war 400 years ago. He had a lot of magic power but unable to use Battle Aura. He was ultimately sealed by Perugius and two others, but will soon revive. He caused the downfall of the Superd tribe. Orsted reveals that Laplace's method of reviving is the same as the method of reincarnation used by the dragon-tribe. Laplace was previously a Demon Dragon King, who was one of the the 5 first generation Dragon Warriors. Laplace fought against the first generation Dragon God, and perhaps realized that Hitogami had manipulated, and so became the Dragon God's subordinate once again. The first generation Dragon God died, while Laplace survived. He escaped the collapsing Dragon World and drifted to this world. He became the second generation Dragon God and his goal was to defeat Hitogami. Laplace started the Human-Demon race war and fought the Fighting God, who was Hitogami's apostle. As a result of the battle, Laplace's lost his memory and his soul was split into two halves, into the Demon God, and the Technique God. Demon God Laplace lost the power of dragons but retained his magic knowledge and magic power. He also hated the human race and so rallied the demon race to exterminate humans. Technique God Laplace lost the power of magic but retained his knowledge of techniques. He created the Seven Great Major Power ranking. His goal was to overthrow Hitogami.

Orsted explains that the first generation Dragon God invented the method of reincarnation, where you send one's soul into the future, taking over another being's body and ultimately reviving. However, to reduce the chance of the other being's body rejecting one's soul, the Dragon God implanted his factor into multiple people. This factor is passed onto their descendants and modifies their bodies slightly. Orsted explains that many dragon-tribe members have used this method of reincarnation, including Perugius. Demon God Laplace, prior to being sealed by Perugius, distributed his factor and sent his soul into the future for the purpose of reincarnating himself. Currently, people with Laplace's characteristics and possessing the Laplace factor are beginning to appear, characteristics such as an aptitude towards magic, having a large amount of magic power, green hair, and having demon eyes at birth. Sylphy and Rudeus are examples of such people, although Orsted reassures Rudeus that he and Sylphy are not Laplace himself. Orsted further reassures Rudeus that while Rudeus did reincarnate, he likely reincarnated in the body of a baby who was destined to be stillborn, and therefore did not displace someone else's life.

Rudeus next asks Orsted about the mana calamity. Orsted however is unable to give any further information. Rudeus then shares with Orsted the diary from his future self. Rudeus then clarifies the terms of his working relationship under Orsted. Orsted reassures Rudeus that he will receive breaks to see his family, to Rudeus' relief. Next, Rudeus asks about receiving money to support his family, to which Orsted gives him a valuable dagger and a bag of gems, which can be sold for considerable sums of money. Orsted says he will read the future diary and they agree to meet again the next day.

Extra Chapter: A Wild Blade Finds Its Sheath

Eris awakens in one of Rudeus' rooms and remembers how she become his third wife. She dreamed of fighting Orsted for many years, imaging various outcomes, but never expected Rudeus to join Orsted. Fighting Orsted was one of only two objective of her life. All that remains now is for her to spend her life with Rudeus.

Looking at herself in the bathroom, she compares herself with Sylphi and Roxy. She feels she doesn't measure up, and her self-confidence is low. She leaves the bathroom and finds Aisha, Lilia and Sylphiette preparing food. She tries to help, but because of her high cutting ability with blades, she accidentally cuts the pumpkin and the cutting table.

After finding that housework isn't her forte, she decides to work and obtain money. She goes with Roxy to find a job at the magic university. Roxy suggests that a gatekeeper role at the university may be a good fit for her due to the job's simplicity. Roxy leaves Eris in front of the gate as a test. Eris then sees a suspicious man try to enter, and she tries to stop him. The man tries to show proof that he works there. Suddenly a gust of wind, blows at his hair. When the man tries to hold his wig down, Eris prevents him from doing so. Therefore, his wig blows away. It turns out that this man was the principal Georg, and feeling both anger and shame, Eris was fired.

Eris is returns to the house feeling depressed and useless, as she can neither do housework nor work a job. When Eris arrives home, she finds Norn talking with a student from the aristocratic class, who demands that Norn become his fiance, and therefore allow him to form a connection with Rudeus and Ariel. Seeing this student bothering Norn, Eris arrives and cut his belt, threatening to cut him the next time. The student then runs away.

Roxy and Sylphi arrive home and thank Eris. After discussing the events of that day, Sylphi reassures Eris that she doesn't need to worry about feeling useless, because there are things that only Eris can do, such as protect Rudeus. Eris now begins to understand that everyone has their own talents and flaws, and that she isn't useless after all.

As Eris leaves, she meets the gaze of Zenith. Eris thanks her. In her mind she felt that Zenith answered saying "say that to Rudeus". Eris now feels more happy as a wife.

Summary

Chapter 1: The First Mission

The next day, Rudeus goes back to the hut to meet Orsted. He comes alone this time. Outside the hut, he sees Zanoba lying face down, still alive. Orsted explains that the previous night Zanoba went to collect the broken magic armor and unexpectedly encountered Orsted. Due to Orsted's curse, Zanoba decided to fight him. Fortunately, Orsted used hyponosis magic to put Zanoba to sleep for a few hours.

Orsted and Rudeus then resume their main discussions. Orsted has finished reading Rudeus' diary. But before discussing that further, he asks Rudeus to recount all his conversations with Hitogami. Rudeus describes each of his encounters and conversations with Hitogami in detail, including the advice given and its consequences. After hearing this, Orsted suggests that Hitogami seems to have manipulated Rudeus to change history, and that given that Rudeus has strong fate, history was originally not supposed to change. Orsted, however, still doesn't understand why Hitogami changed history to this degree. Orsted will therefore try to once again change history to one that is favorable to him. Rudeus wonders if they can collect the hidden treasures and reach Hitogami. Orsted replies that the last treasure is in Laplace's possession, who will revive in about 80 years. Orsted believes that Hitogami has the ability to be trusted by all living beings, and so has difficulty dealing with irregularities such as Rudeus.

Orsted states that their first mission is to readjust history so that Ariel will become Asura Kingdom's queen. In the original timeline, Ariel should have become queen and was in fact protected by a considerably powerful fate. Originally, there were three key people to her rise in power, guardian magician Derrick Redbat, Eris Greyrat, and Tristina Purplehorse. Derrick was a shrewd man and ambitious, and was originally Ariel's guardian magician. He would have persuaded Perugius to assist Ariel. He would have remained as Ariel's advisor and eventually become prime minister. Eris would have married to Luke, and together they would have protected Ariel from assassins. Tristina was a child from Asura's upper aristocracy's family Purplsehorse, but was abducted when she was 8 years old and became a sex slave to senior minister Darius Ganius. Ariel helped Tristina before she could be disposed of in secret. As a result, Darius Ganius lost his position and first prince Gravel lost influence.

Orsted and Rudeus plan to find Tristina to force senior minister's downfall. If they fail, they plan for Rudeus to kill Darius. Orsted reveals that next month, in January, the information that the king has fallen ill will arrive, but until then, they will continue their preparations. They consider using the magic armor that is currently broken, but they need time to miniaturize it, so they shelve that idea for now. Instead, Orsted promises to give Rudeus a robe, since he cannot wear Battle Aura. They discuss Fighting God's armor. It was built by Demon Dragon King Laplace. While it gives you great power, it also controls your mind, similar to the Superd tribe's spears. Orsted also gives Rudeus a magic circle which can summon a guardian magical beast to protect his family. Rudeus plans on summoning the beast tomorrow. Rudeus worries that one of his descendants will become Laplace, but Orsted reassures him that this will not be the case. Rudeus asks Orsted to forgive Nanahoshi for luring him during their fight and to place the blame on himself instead. Orsted agrees to forgive her. Finally, Orsted gives him a ring that works like a compass, allowing Rudeus to contact Orsted in emergencies.

Rudeus then leaves the hut and carries Zanoba back to Ginger's room.

Chapter 2: Guardian Beast

Rudeus reflected on the fact that Orsted implied that there would always be "next time" if they failed. He considers the possibility that Orsted may have time travel abilities similar to his future self. Rudeus pushes these thoughts out of his mind and vows to try his best without relying on do-overs. Rudeus works on improving his combat power by sparring with Eris. Rudeus asks Cliff and Zanoba to repair and improve the magic armor, by making it smaller and more efficient.

Rudeus gathers his family to their garden as he plans to summon the guardian magical beast. Various family members distrust Orsted and are skeptical that Orsted's summoning magic circle is safe, but Rudeus reaffirms his trust in Orsted. Rudeus activates the magic circle and ends up summoning Arumanfi, Perugius' servant. Arumanfi is very annoyed for being separated from his connection with Perugius and demands that Rudeus annuls their new contract. They quickly annul Arumanfi's new contract with Rudeus, with Perugius' help. Rudeus tries the summoning again. This time, he pictures summoning a lion. He ends up summoning a large dog. Eris soon points out that the dog looks similar to the Holy Beast that they met in Dorudia village. Rudeus worries about angering the Dorudia tribe for taking away the Holy Beast, but he decides against once again annulling the contract. They name the animal Leo.

Chapter 3: Opening Move

Luke comes to Rudeus' house and directly asks for Rudeus' support in Ariel's bid for the throne to Asura Kingdom. Ariel has given up on persuading Perugius to support her. Rudeus suspects that Luke has been influenced by Hitogami as in his future self's timeline. Luke denies knowing Hitogami; he says he is making this request of his own accord. Rudeus tells Luke that he will consider his request to support Ariel and get back to him later. Rudeus thinks to himself that he isn't sure if supporting Ariel would be acting in according with Hitogami's plans, and so he wants to consult with Orsted first.

Chapter 4: Mind Made Up

Rudeus meets with Orsted. They update each other on what has happened on the last 10 days. Rudeus tells Orsted that the Holy Beast Leo was summoned as his guardian magical beast. Orsted is surprised that such a powerful beast was summoned. They feel that the safety of Rudeus' family is now nearly guaranteed. Rudeus informs Orsted that he has asked Cliff to help solve Orsted's curse by developing a magic tool. Orsted has asked Perugius to help Ariel become queen, but Perugius refused, as he isn't certain that Ariel is worthy of becoming queen. Rudeus informs Orsted about Luke's visit with him, about the fact that Luke may be Hitogami's apostle and that Luke asked for Rudeus' support for Ariel. Orsted insists they should still help Ariel. However, Orsted suggests killing Luke, as he is quite certain that Luke is Hitogami's apostle. However, Rudeus is reluctant to kill someone, especially an acquaintance. Rudeus responds that he is concerned that if they kill Luke, they will have taken away a major source of emotional support for Ariel and that he may be vital for her to become queen. And furthermore, Hitogami may have taken into account that Orsted would try to kill Luke. Orsted agrees to hold off on the idea of killing Luke.

Rudeus asks Orsted how many people Hitogami can manipulate. Orsted replies that Hitogami can use future sight on up to three people, although he could manipulate more people without using future sight, he typically limits to manipulating three people. Next, Orsted gives Rudeus a robe, as previously promised, to improve his defense in combat. It has considerable magic resistance and is highly blade resistant. It also reduces the weight of the wearer by half and allows one to move very quickly.

Back at home, Rudeus has a discussion with Sylphy. He confirms that he will be supporting Ariel for queen, as per Orsted's orders. Sylphy remains distrustful of Orsted and asks what Orsted has to gain by doing this. Rudeus replies that Orsted wants political connections. Orsted's plan is to ask Perugius' to support Ariel, as Perugius has political influence. They discuss the fact that Rudeus will be going to Asura Kingdom to support Ariel. Sylphy states that she wants to come as well, to support her friend. Rudeus warns Sylphy to be aware that Hitogami can manipulate anyone, and reveals that Luke is likely being manipulated. Sylphy declares that if Luke ever were to betray Ariel, she would kill Luke. Rudeus thinks to himself that if they were forced to kill Luke, he would take it upon himself to do it.

Chapter 5: Working Together

Rudeus, along with Sylphy, goes to Sky Castle and sees Ariel having tea with Nanahoshi. Ariel looks tired and depressed. They join for Sylphy for tea. Nanahoshi tells Rudeus that Orsted has forgiven her for her betrayal. Ariel notes that while she was afraid of Orsted, she didn't hate him. Rudeus wonders if the Orsted's curse is less effective on her and if Hitogami may be manipulating her. Ariel muses that she had planned to ask for Rudeus' support in the past, but decided against it. She felt Rudeus was too powerful and she wasn't worthy to control that power. Rudeus counters that while he has great magic power, he considers himself an average person with all the worries of an average person. Rudeus tells Ariel that he intends to support her. Ariel is very grateful. She inquires if supporting her was Orsted's idea. Rudeus lies so that he can feed Hitogami false information via Luke; he tells her that it was actually his idea to support her, but that he has Orsted's blessing.

Ariel's group's discuss that their first goal is to gain Perugius' support, given his wide influence. Rudeus brings up Perugius' question: What is the most important factor to a king? Perugius promised that if Ariel came up with the correct answer, he would offer her his support. Rudeus thinks to himself that Ariel's former guardian magician Derrick Redhat would have been the one to tell her the correct answer to the question. So, he asks Ariel about Derrick. Ariel suddenly remembers that Derrick death was what inspired her to become king. She recounts how Derrick sacrificed himself to save her life. Prior to this, she had no interest in being king. She recounts Derrick's final words, which implored her to become the king. Inspired by the sincerity of his dying words, she decided to strive for the throne. Despite Ariel remembering her reason for wanting to be king, she is still unable to answer the question of what is a king's most important factor. (In the Web Novel, she is actually able to come up with the answer to the question at this point, and the story continues on in chapter 8 of this volume).

Chapter 6: Orsted's Suggestion

After the reunion with Ariel,
Rudeus
 inform about what happened to Orsted and the possibility to search about the first King of Asura to find the answer. Orsted proposes to go to the Book Labyrinth, a place where exist a copy of every book of the world made by a demon king, this place is located in the demon continent and they need to teleport. Orsted give to Rudeus a sketch of a certain book if he don't find the necessary information

Rudeus now in Chaos breaker he find Ariel, talk a bit and inform the plan to search in the labyrinth, she accepts the plan. The next day in the base of operation of Orsted they find a magic circle in the basement, The person that go are Rudeus, Sylphiette, Luke, Ariel, Eris and Ghislaine Rudeus formarly presents Eris and Ghislaine as escort to Ariel, in the end they use the magic circle.

Chapter 7: Library Labyrinth

They appear in a room similar to the others teleport rooms, Eris excitedly wants to explore but is stopped by Rudeus, when they enter, they find hallways of books, arranged from oldest to newest and in the center of the labyrinth they find the Demon king Betobe, a huge slime with a eyeball that use his tentacles to write the books. They avoid him decide to search a book about the first king of Asura, Gaunis.

They find a book, he was the third prince during the Laplace war, after his older brother and parent were killed he became the next king of Asura, also find that he have many achievements but in the same time he wasn't perfect, and commonly he went to taverns, got drunk and fought. Rudeus also find books about Mikos, one of them is called "the powerless God" a miko that can change the rules of the world and can nullify the power of gods and abilities, Rudeus think how to remove curses and may help Zenith, taking notes of this in his diary.

He realizes that one of the tentacle started a copy of his diary, and Rudeus write in his diary that he want conversation with the demon King and he appear, because the future diary of Rudeus was a interesting experience of a alternative future, the demon king grant to Rudeus a wish, he show him the sketch that Orsted drew and he give him a book, that book is the Diary of
Derrick Redbat
.

After reading his diary, Ariel find the answer of being king and pass the diary to Luke, crying because the content, when they almost leaving, the demon king becomes angry because a tear of Luke damage the diary and he start to attack.the group start to run way meanwhile they block every attack and they leave the labyrinth.

Chapter 8: The Armored Dragon King and the Second Princess

Ariel arranges an audience with Perugius to once again ask for his support. Perugius reiterates his question: "What is the most important factor of a king?" Ariel's answer is "to inherit wills", that is to be influenced by others. Perugius laughs at this answer and calls her a fool. Ariel stands her ground and admits she may be a fool. She declares that she intends to state her true feelings. She further states that if their ideals aren't compatible, then despite the fact that she wants his assistance, they may not be able to work well together. Perugius is impressed with Ariel's conviction and agrees to lend his support. Ariel thanks Perugius, and leaves.

Rudeus stays behind and asks Perugius if Ariel gave the correct answer. He confirms that Ariel's answer was wrong. However, the way Ariel carries herself reminds Perugius of his old friend from many years ago, Kaunis, who was called the "Ideal King".  Rudeus asks Perugius, "what is the ideal king?", which Perugius refuses to answer. Perugius asks why Rudeus didn't bring up Orsted's in Ariel's negotiations with him. Rudeus thinks to himself that it's because he knows that Orsted had already asked Perugius himself to support Ariel and was refused. Rudeus gives a non-committal answer. Perugius calls him out on this and leaves.

Ariel, Luke, Sylphy and Rudeus plan their next steps. Ariel announces that she has heard news of her father's illness. Rudeus is surprised, as according to Orsted, they had expected the news to come later. Rudeus wonders if Ariel may be influenced by Hitogami. They then debate on the best way to travel to Asura Kingdom. Rudeus suggests teleporting to a magic circle just outside the kingdom. The reason he offers up is to better hide the fact that they used teleportation magic. In his mind, the reason for this is to give him an excuse to track down Tris, who will be key to taking down Darius, which will weaken the First Prince's faction. Sylphy, Luke, and Ariel all feel that they should instead directly teleport to Asura Kingdom to avoid the dangers associated with travel, and avoid assassins and mercenaries. Sylvaril, one of Perugius' familiars, announces that all the magic teleportation circles inside Asura Kingdom have been destroyed and so it is impossible to teleport directly into Asura Kingdom. Rudeus wonders who could have done this. Therefore, they are forced into Rudeus' initial proposal, which is to teleport to a magic circle just outside the Asura Kingdom border.

Chapter 9: Before Traveling to Asura Kingdom

Leo integrates himself into Rudeus' family and acts as their guard dog. Ghyslaine confirms that Leo is from the Dorudia tribe.

Rudeus, Cliff, and Zanoba meet to have dinner at a fancy restaurant. Cliff and Zanoba are concerned that Rudeus is now working under Orsted. They feel that Orsted is too dangerous and cannot be trusted. Rudeus tries to tell them the truth at first, that Orsted has a curse that causes others to fear and hate him. Cliff and Zanoba remain unconvinced, however. Rudeus therefore lies and tells them that he actually plans to kill Orsted in the future, and so needs their help to upgrade the magic armor. Rudeus also asks Cliff for help on reducing the power of Orsted's curse; Rudeus lies by saying that the curse is like a barrier that weakens his opponents. Cliff and Zanoba agree to help Rudeus.

While Rudeus was drinking with his friends, Roxy, Sylphy, and Eris held a meeting. This is the 26th regular meeting between for Roxy and Sylphy, but the first one for Eris. Roxy explains to Eris that the purpose of these meetings is to help their communication and dispel any feelings of envy. They all discuss how they came to meet Rudeus and the history of their relationship with him. Lilia also joins them and reminisces on her past history with Rudeus as well. They all start drinking alcohol. Elinalise joins them and starts drinking as well, despite being pregnant. Only Roxy doesn't drink as she is also pregnant. She casts detoxification magic on everyone once they all finish drinking.

Rudeus meets Orsted. He reports that Ariel successfully persuaded Perugius and the news that the magic circles to Asura Kingdom are broken. Orsted believes that the destruction of the magic teleportation circles were caused by Hitogami. Orsted further deduces that Hitogami's disciple must therefore be First Prince Grabell or Senior Minister Darius. This is because only people with great political influence can access and destroy the magic circles, as they are all well guarded by soldiers. Orsted reiterates that Luke is likely an apostle of Hitogami. He speculates that the third and last apostle is someone talented with the sword or magic. Based on this, he believes that the North Emperor Auber and Water God Reida are likely candidates. Orsted tells Rudeus that all the potential apostles of Hitogami, Darius, Auber, Reida can be killed, while Luke should continue to be observed and killed if necessary.

At home, Rudeus and Sylphy announce to the family that they will be leaving for Asura Kingdom and will be gone for 3-4 months. Eris decided for herself that she would go as well. Norn and Aisha tease Rudeus that he is likely to come back with another wife. Rudeus wants to protest that this won't be the case, but knows he no longer has any credibility on this matter. Rudeus notes that since both he and Sylphy are leaving, they are leaving their daughter Lucy without any parents at home. They leave Lucy for Lilia to raise. Since Roxy is staying behind at home, Rudeus tries to spend more time with her before he leaves. They agree to name their future baby Rolo or Lara if the baby is a boy or girl respectively.

Extra Chapter: The Black Wolf Sword King

Eris and Ghyslaine, accompanied by Rudeus and Sylphy, go to meet Ariel for the first time. Eris and Ghyslaine worry about the fact that they lack knowledge on manners and etiquette in high society. Eris is particularly worried about this as she doesn't want to reflect poorly on Rudeus. Rudeus isn't concerned about himself, but rather on damaging Sylphy's reputation. Eris thinks to herself that she doesn't think of Sylphy as part of her family, but rather considers her to be more of a comrade. Rudeus suggests that Sylphy teach them etiquette until they arrive in Asura Kingdom, to which Sylphy agrees.

Eris introduces herself to Ariel, followed by Ghyslaine. Ghyslaine immediately makes clear that her goal is primarily to exact revenge on Sauros' behalf. Ariel promises Ghyslaine to help her find the perpetrators for Sauros' death. Ariel thinks to herself that it was likely a feudal lord who caused Sauros' execution in order to weaken the forces of the first prince. She considers the possibility that it may have been someone within her own faction, and that this may cause issues with Ghyslaine in the future. Ariel looks at the three in front of her: Eris, Ghyslaine, and Rudeus. Although they are powerful and support her for now, Ariel realizes that they have not sworn fealty to her. Ariel correctly suspects that Rudeus is only supporting her on Orsted's instructions, although Rudeus denied it earlier. Ariel doesn't understand what Orsted is planning, and she remembers the fear she experienced when she first saw Orsted. Nevertheless, Ariel feels secure in the fact that Rudeus only follows Orsted to protect his family. Therefore, Rudeus will not hurt Sylphy, and Sylphy will not hurt Ariel.

Ghyslaine and Elinalise meet in a bar to catch up on each other's lives. They comment on how they wish the rest of their old crew could have been there: Geese, Talhand, Paul, and Zenith. Elinalise describes Paul's final moments and the circumstances that led up to it. They reminisce on how they both used to be sexually interested in Paul. Ghyslaine responds that she was in estrus at that time. Ghyslaine is shocked at how Zenith has lost her memories and personality. They then talk about their past adventurer days as well as things that have happened since the mana calamity and since meeting Rudeus. Ghyslaine muses that her former master Philip died in the mana calamity, but his killer is also dead. Her focus is now on exacting Sauros' killers and she has joined as Ariel's escort for this reason. Before returning home, Elinalise asks Ghyslaine to take care of her grandchild Sylphy and her husband Rudeus. Ghyslaines agrees to do so.

Light Novel Volume 17/Summary
=============================

Information

Summary

Chapter 1: The First Mission

Ariel
's group, including
Sylphiette
,
Luke
, Elmore, Kleene,
Rudeus
,
Eris
 and
Ghislaine
 leave Sharia, headed towards the
Asura Kingdom
 to help make Ariel the King, and take a magic teleportation circle to Sky Castle Chaos Breaker. After greeting
Perugius
, they take a magic circle that transports them to a ruin near the
Red Dragon’s Upper Jaw
. Because it is almost night, the group rest near the road.

On Rudeus's turn for night patrol, he goes into the forest and meets
Orsted
, who is following the group. Rudeus reports on the events of the past few days. Orsted advises that the forest of the Red Dragon’s Upper Jaw is the most likely place for
Darius
 to send soldiers to kill Ariel, as it is still within Asura Kingdom's jurisdiction, while being distant enough to avoid creating big news. They speculate that the North Emperor
Auber Corvette
 is likely to appear there as well. When they discuss the matter of Luke being an apostle, Orsted reveals that
Hitogami
 can only reassign his apostles at certain turning points in the future. In this case, the turning point is when Ariel does or does not become queen. Until then, apostles cannot be swapped or changed, and any apostles that die cannot be replaced. Rudeus is annoyed at not having received this crucial information earlier. They finish their conversation and Rudeus returns to camp.

Chapter 2: The Red Wyrm’s Upper Jaw

The group arrives at the forest of the Red Dragon’s Upper Jaw, which is the most likely place to be ambushed, according to Orsted. The group stop for a moment at the location where Ariel's group was ambushed when she was fleeing Asura Kingdom to Ranoa. She pay her respects for the people that she lost that day.

The next day, the group is ambushed by a group of soldiers. Ghislaine, Eris and Sylphiette fight the group of soldiers. Meanwhile, Luke protects the carriage, with Rudeus in the rear. Using his Eyes of Foresight to monitor the situation, he is looking for and anticipating a surprise attack from Auber. The North King
Wii Taa
 appears and challenges Ghislaine to a duel. He uses his polished armor to reflect the sun's light to periodically blind Ghislaine, and so Ghislaine struggles to fight Wii Taa. Rudeus sees this and summons Mud Rain, therefore nullifying Wii Taa's strategy and allowing Ghislaine to take the opportunity and deal a serious injury to him.

After helping Ghislaine, Rudeus looks to the rear and unexpectedly finds that Auber has appeared from a hole in the road, Auber tries to kill Rudeus, but Auber is repelled. Auber and Rudues briefly fight. When Ghislaine, Eris, Sylphi arrive to support Rudeus, Auber and his group decide to retreat. Luke stares in disbelief as he sees that the soldiers they just fought have the Milbotts crest, meaning that his father
Pilemon Notos Greyrat
 has betrayed Ariel.

Chapter 3: Suspicions and Theories

Luke is still in disbelief at the fact that his father betrayed Ariel. Ariel, in contrast, had fully expected this. Because Auber and his group may continue to ambush them, Rudeus proposes that they try to smuggle themselves into the country. By doing this, Rudeus thinks to himself that he would also be able to complete one of his objectives, which is to find Tris.

Luke voices out loud that he feels Rudeus's recent actions were strange, and that he doesn't trust him. Luke suggests to Ariel to retreat temporarily, and to ask for further reinforcements from Perugius. However, Ariel decides to follow Rudeus plan. They change their course to find smuggling bandits.

During Rudeus's turn for night patrol, he meets Orsted again. They talk about recent events. They are now more certain than ever that Luke is an apostle, but they agree to leave him alone for now. After returning to camp, Rudeus finds that Ariel up and awake. She asks him to accompany her on a walk in the woods.

Chapter 4: Ariel’s Choice

After entering the forest, Rudeus and Ariel sit on a trunk and start with some trivial small talk. Suddenly, Ariel brings up Luke and the fact that she believes that he is betraying them. Rudeus says that he is probably being manipulated, but he hesitates to reveal that Hitogami is behind this. Ariel requests to meet Orsted to understand why he is helping her. Before Rudeus can give an answer, Orsted appears. Even after being affected by Orsted's curse, Ariel regains her composure and they start to talk.

Orsted explains that a being called Hitogami is his enemy and is currently siding with Darius and
Grabell
, the First Prince. Orsted reveals that 100 years into the future, if Grabell becomes king, it leads to events where the kingdom of Asura will fall, but if Ariel becomes king, the kingdom will survive. Hitogami wants Asura kingdom to perish because the person who will defeat him is born in Asura Kingdom. Ariel learns that there are only 3 Hitogami apostles at one time, and that Luke, Darius and either the North Emperor Auber or Water God
Reida
 are the current candidates. Ariel decides to became  Orsted's subordinate.

Chapter 5: Tristina

The group enter to the territory of the band of thieves, where they are surrounded and the leader appears. Using code phrases learned from Orsted, Rudeus indicates that he wants their group to be smuggled and to meet Tris. They arrive to a hut and the group rests while they wait for Tris.

Some hours later, Tris arrives. Rudeus engages with her, but she comes across as guarded and suspicious. Thinking to himself, Rudeus tries to comes up with a plan to gain her trust over time and slowly reveal their group's goal to overthrow Darius. Ariel sees Tris and instead goes for the straightforward approach. She identifies Tris as
Tristina Purplehorse
, a noble daughter that she met several years ago.  Tris also recognizes Ariel and immediately lets her guard down. Ariel asks about the fact that Tris had gone missing and how she came to be a bandit. Tris reviews her life story, starting with how she was kidnapped and became a sex slave for Darius. She was then sold to bandits to become their boss's concubine, then trained as a thief, and then became a free woman when the boss changed. After hearing her story, Ariel promises to exact revenge on Darius on Tris's behalf. Ariel asks Tris to testify against Darius about being his sex slave. Tris accepts and joins their group. Rudeus looks at this exchange in admiration at how Ariel was able to skillfully and easily get Tris on their side.

Chapter 6: On the Road

The next day, led by Tris, they arrive at a lake and a cliff with a secret cave. After several hours of walking through its labyrinthine tunnels, they leave the cave and arrive in Asura kingdom territory. As the group passes by the
Fittoa Region
, Rudeus, Sylphy and Eris reminisce about the past.

The group then arrives at a town named Rickett, which connects to the Asura capital. They stop at an inn associated with the thief guild to rest, while Tris goes out to gather information. Tris returns and goes to delivers her news to Ariel, while Rudeus and Ghislaine are on guard duty. Rudeus then hears some arguing in Ariel's room and goes to investigate. He enters to the room to find Ariel and Luke arguing. Rudeus learns that Tris has confirmed that Pilemon was one of the culprits in the execution of Sauros, and that Ariel will keep her promise with Ghislaine to kill him. Luke is angry as he still believes that Rudeus is aiming to take over the Notos house. Ariel states that after taking power, she has no intention of granting nobility to Rudeus, which Rudeus is grateful for since he had no intention of accepting such a position. The next day, Luke admits that he did indeed receive advice from Hitogami. The advice was a warning of Rudeus's betrayal; that Rudeus's goal is to be lord of Notus House, that he will defect to Darius's side, and that all of his actions and the events that occurred to the group are the result of his scheming.

Days later, with Luke still hostile against Rudeus, they arrive at the capital city Ars.

Chapter 7: Ars, the Royal Capital

The group goes to the Ariel's second house within Asura, which will be their base. As they travel through the commoner district, they see that Ariel is still popular with the common people. When they enter the noble's district, a soldier runs up to them. They reveal themselves to be
Isolte
, one of Eris's acquaintances from the Holy Land of the Sword, and they chat for a bit. The group then arrives at Ariel's second house.

Ariel says that she needs ten days to gather her allies and prepare her Venue to take down Darius and the first prince's faction. They decide to use Sylphy disguised as Ariel as bait to draw in the enemy, giving them an opportunity to launch their attacks to reduce the enemy's forces.

Chapter 8: Duel at Dusk

Ariel works on her preparations to gather her allies. Their group is frequently attacked by assassins targeting Sylphy, who is impersonating Ariel, while the real Ariel hides as a maid. At one party, Luke meets his father, Pilemon. They discuss why he betrayed Ariel. Luke pleads for him to return to Ariel's faction, but Pilemon refuses.

On day nine, preparations for the Venue have been completed. The plan is for Ariel to host a party, with all the major nobles of Asura in attendance, where she will announce that Perugius is supporting her, and reveal Darius' crimes to the other nobles to guarantee her ascension to the throne. That evening, as the group returns to their base, an assailant blocks the road and announces himself as the North King 『Twin Swords』
Knuckle Guard
, a pair of swordsman who are twins. Eris decides to fight them. Meanwhile, Wii Taa appear with black armor and confronts
Ghislaine
 for a rematch.

While they fight, Rudeus searches for Auber, who he suspects is waiting for a surprise attack. Using his spirits of light, Rudeus notices a strange cloth on the side of one of the stone walls and without hesitation fires a stone cannon. Auber is able to evade a mortal wound, but his leg was pierced, severely limiting his mobility. Eris defeats the twin swordsman Knuckle Guard, though suffers a major injury to her arm, and Ghislaine overwhelms Wii Taa thanks to her great night vision, cutting off his arm. Wii Taa then throws a smoke screen and tries to attack the carriage, hoping to find Ariel. However, Sylphy was inside instead and she counters with a Flame Tornado, which clears the smoke screen and illuminates their surrounding. They see Auber escape using his pair of claws to climb up the wall and he disappears. They Wii Taa trying to escape in an alley, but they decide to pursue and finish off Wii Taa.

Rudeus chases Wii Taa into an alleyway, but he finds him already dead with a hole in his chest. Rudeus quickly realizes that the wound was made by Orsted. The others assume the wound was caused by a Stone Cannon from Rudeus, as no one but himself is aware that Orsted is helping them. And even though Auber escaped, their group's plan to reduce the enemy's strength was a success, as two North Kings were killed.

Chapter 9: Ariel’s Battlefield

Several important nobles, including the leaders of the Boreas and Notus house, Senior Minister Darius arrive at Ariel's party. When the party begins, Ariel introduces Tris to everyone in attendance as the long lost Tristina Purplehorse. Tris recounts her lifestory to all the nobles, from how she was betrayed by her family and sold to become Darius's sex slave, to how she became associated with a band of thieves and regained her freedom, leaving out the fact that she also became a thief herself, to avoid tarnishing her reputation. Darius accuses Tris of being fake, and brings in the head of the Purplehorse house, Tris's father. However, Ariel had anticipated this and had already contacted the Purplehorse family, and the head of the Purplehorse house confirms that Tris is indeed real and claims that she was stolen away by Darius. With this, Darius's reputation is badly damaged.

The first prince Grabell then arrives at the party. He states that Darius should not be punished despite his crimes, as he is an important player in running Asura Kingdom. He calls for a vote among all the nobles in attendance, asking them to confirm their allegiance to him and Darius, or Ariel. Before the vote commences, Ariel announces she has one more person to introduce. The nobles see the Sky Castle floating in the night sky and Perugius makes his entrance, along with his 12 familiars. Upon his entrance, it is clear that he is very well respected among the nobles of Asura, commanding more respect that even Ariel or Grabell. Grabell offers Perugius the highest ranking seat among the three seats of honor. Perugius politely declines and offers it to Ariel instead, making clear to everyone that it is Ariel that he supports.

Just as Rudeus was thinking that everything was going well for them, something falls from the ceiling to interrupt the party. It is revealed to be Water God Reida Reia, who has come to support Darius.

Chapter 10: Rudeus’s Battlefield

Water God Reida has a sword technique that allows her to kill all opponents within a certain radius around her, the second they move even the smallest of muscles. With this, she easily kills two of Pergius's familiars,
Almanfi
 and Trophimus, knocks out one of the nobles, and damages Rudeus' Zaliff Gauntlet as he sent mana to the ring in his finger which contacts Orsted. No one else dares to move anymore for fear of being instantly killed, including Rudeus, Ghislaine, and Eris. Reida commands Auber to kill Ariel and finish the job they were hired for. Suddenly, apprentice knights appear, including Isolte. Isolte demands her master to tell her what is going on. Reida states that she intends to murder Ariel, with the fabricated motivation being money, and then intends to let herself die at the hands of Isolte, who will become a hero and carry on the Water God style. As this happens, Rudeus tries to come up with a plan to save Ariel from Auber without being attacked by Reida. Rudeus considers using electric magic to attack Reida and Auber simultaneously. Suddenly, the air changes and everyone senses Orsted's presence approaching. At Reida's instructions, Auber grabs Darius and runs away. Reida begins to explain her motivations. She reveals that, as a child, Darius saved her from having her hands cut off by a mob, and therefore she feels she owes him her life. She had forgotten about this for many years until recently, when she had a revelation in a dream, which told her to come back to the royal palace, where she could return the favor to Darius. With this, it's confirmed that she is an apostle of Hitogami. Orsted then arrives and promptly kills her with a single strike.

With Reida dead, Rudeus, Ghislaine, and Eris are now free to move. They chase after and quickly catch up to Darius and Auber. Darius mutters in frustration at this turn of events. He reveals that he was told by Hitogami to destroy the magic teleportation portals, and recall Auber to the capital to protect himself from Rudeus. Darius tries to negotiate with Eris and Ghislaine by claiming that he has been helping the Boreas house rebuild the Fittoa territory. However, he also reveals that he directly led to the death of Sauros. Eris and Ghislaine therefore resolve themselves to kill him. Seeing that negotiations have failed, Auber launches an attack. Auber is able to badly damage Rudeus's leg, almost cutting it clean off, and stab Eris in the abdomen with a poisoned kunai, but he receives an arm injury from Ghislaine. Rudeus then launches an exploding Stone Cannon at Darius. Although Auber blocks the rock bullet, its fragments blind Darius and distract Auber. With that opening, Eris damages Auber's other arm, followed by Ghislaine landing a killing blow. The battle over, Ghislaine then kills Darius. Rudeus heals all their injuries. They cure Eris's poisoning with the antidote Orsted told Rudeus Auber kept on him to treat that poison he carries as well.

They head back to the party venue and are greeted with an unexpected sight. They see Luke holding a dagger against Ariel's neck. Luke orders Sylphy to kill Rudeus, if she wants to save Ariel.

Chapter 11: The Madness of Luke

A few minutes prior, after Orsted had killed Reida and left, Luke convinced himself that Orsted is evil. Pilemon then bows to Ariel and claims he only pretended to betray her. Ariel is angry at this bold-faced lie as she knows Pilemon sent assassins to kill her. She tells him to have some pride and at least admit his betrayal. Ariel sentences Pilemon to be executed right there and asks for Luke's sword.

Luke experiences mixed feelings about his father. On one hand, Pilemon had protected Ariel all those years until his betrayal. And although he was never close with his father, he didn't hold any bad feelings toward him either. Without thinking clearly, Luke holds his sword to Ariel's neck. Luke continues to be extremely suspicious of Orsted. He voices his concern at Rudeus being Orsted's subordinate and asks Sylphy if she trusts Orsted. Sylphy confirms she doesn't trust Orsted, but she trusts Rudeus. Rudeus then enters the venue. While still holding his sword to Ariel's throat, he asks Sylphy who she would choose to save, Ariel or Rudeus. Sylphy chooses Rudeus without hesitation. Luke then regains his senses and releases Ariel. He continues to distrust Orsted, but he decides to support Ariel regardless. He braces himself for execution for his betrayal, but Ariel forgives him. Ariel decides not to execute Pilemon, as he was just a pawn in Darius' game, and Ghislaine reluctantly agrees with this decision, with Eris's encouragement.

Perugius watched this entire exchange in amusement. Grabell remained seated in his chair, exhausted, and his strongest backer dead. Isolte grieves over the dead body of the Water God Reida.

Chapter 12: Ten Days in the Capital and the Truth About Orsted

Rudeus recounts the 10 days following the event at the venue. During these 10 days, Pilemon is stripped of his position, and placed under house arrest. Luke becomes the Notus family head. Luke's brother is able to ease tensions between their family and Ghislaine. Ghislaine continues to work as Ariel's escort as a permanent employee.

On Day 1, Rudeus has a meeting with Orsted. Rudeus is worried that Ariel's ascension to king is still not guaranteed, and is concerned about other traps set by Hitogami. Orsted is not worried, however. He reveals that he wasn't being truthful to Rudeus when he said he could see the future, because up until this point he never fully trusted Rudeus and was monitoring him during these events to see if he would betray Orsted. He explains that he has the ability to reset himself to the year 330 with his memories intact, whenever time progresses for 200 years beyond that point, even if he dies. Hitogami, in contrast, doesn't retain his memories with each reset and so isn't aware of Orsted's reset ability. Orsted reveals that he has reset well over 100 times. Therefore, Orsted reassures Rudeus that based on all the previous timelines that he has seen, Ariel is guaranteed to become king at this point.

On Day 3, Isolte visits Eris and Rudeus in their home, which was gifted to them by Ariel. Isolte makes clear that she holds no grudge against Ariel or her faction for Isolte's master's death. Isolte makes clear she came to visit only to see Eris. Eris and Isolte then spend some time together exploring the Imperial city, with Rudeus joining as well to make sure Isolte didn't try to attack Eris.

On Day 5, Rudeus and Sylphy have dinner with the Boreas house. Eris was not invited as the Boreas are still wary of her and are not interested in welcoming her back.

On Day 8, Tris returns to the aristocracy. Ariel plans to use Tris to broker deals with her group of thieves. Perugius returns to Sky Castle, where he can revive his two familiars who were killed.

On day 9, Sylphy and Rudeus meet Ariel. Ariel thanks Rudeus for all his help and admits that without his advice and help, she never would have gotten this far. Ariel asks if Rudeus wants anything in return. Rudeus asks for a license to sell his Supard race figurines and books, as well as workshops to help with mass-producing. Ariel agrees to this request. Ariel likewise thanks Sylphy for guarding her for the past several years. Ariel and Sylphy spend some time talking and laughing together.

With their work done, Rudeus prepares to leave Asura Kingdom.

Chapter 13: Farewells and Changes

Ghislaine holds a sword training session with Rudeus and Eris, reminiscent of the old days. They finish their training session with Ghislaine and Eris sparring. Ghislaine then says her goodbyes to Eris. Once Ghislaine leaves, Eris cries.

Before their departure, several nobles from Ariel's faction, who knew Sylphy, come to see her off. Luke says goodbye to Sylphy and Rudeus as well. They forgive each other for distrusting the other and they say goodbye on good terms.

For the return trip, they will go to Sky Castle with Perugius, and then teleport to the ruins near the outskirts of Sharia city. Therefore, the return trip to Sharia will be much faster than the initial trip there. By the time they enter Perugius's castle, the sun had set, and so they spend the night there. Rudeus speaks with Sylphy. Sylphy expresses that she would like to spend more time raising their daughter Lucy, now that she no longer has the role of Ariel's guard. Sylphy states that she initially wanted to be like Eris, who is comparable to Rudeus in terms of combat ability. However, she realizes this would be impossible for her at this point and so she sets her new goal as focusing on raising her family.

Chapter 14: Home Again

Rudeus, Eris, and Sylphy return to Magic City Sharia, having been gone for 2 months. Rudeus is relieved to see that nothing has changed since he left and his family is still safe. Aisha and Lilia welcome them home. Roxy's pregnancy continues to progress well, but she is ashamed at how her body has changed. She reveals to Rudeus that she is particularly sensitive about the fact that her bell button is now protruding outwards, as she recounts how Rudeus previously told her how her belly and navel were perfect. Rudeus reassures her that she still likes her new navel. Rudeus hugs her growing belly and Roxy welcomes him home.

The next day, Rudeus greets all his friends, Zanoba, Cliff, and Elinalise. He greeted Nanahoshi as well while back at Sky Fortress. He then visits his father's grave. Rudeus speaks out loud all the events of the past 2 months. Rudeus then reflects on the fact that he was very lucky this time to return with no casualties on his side. The past journey had several lucky occurrences, such as Orsted appearing to kill the Water God, and Auber carrying his antidote on him. He resolves himself to continue to get stronger so that he can continue to protect his family, without being as reliant on luck.

 writes in his diary, addressing the entries to his deceased father. It has been one and a half years. Rudeus trains with
Orsted
 and improves his magic, attaining Saint class in Fire, Wind, Healing and Detoxification magic, as well as Intermediate class God Barrier magic. Rudeus performs various jobs assigned by Orsted to help various people. Those they help now will become useful to Orsted in the future.

Rudeus has renovated the hut that they use as their base and main office. The building has a conference room, sleeping room and research room. It also has an armory, which also contains the Magic Armor, which has been successfully miniaturized. The basement has magic teleport circles which allow them to quickly travel to other major places around the world.

Rudeus's eldest daughter
Lucy
 is now 3 years old. As Rudeus is often away carrying out missions for Orsted, she often doesn't recognize him, much to his disappointment. Rudeus has also brought Lucy to meet Orsted. They get along very well, confirming that
Hitogami
 was telling the truth that the curse doesn't affect Rudeus's descendants.
Roxy
 also gave birth. Although the delivery was complicated by shoulder dystocia, Roxy was able to give birth to a healthy girl that they named
Lara
. Lara has blue hair, like Roxy. Some family members worry that she may be bullied because of this.
Elinalise
 also gave birth, but without complications, to a healthy baby boy that they named
Clive
.
Eris
 also wanted to have children, but was initially having difficulty conceiving. After taking a break in her training, she was able to conceive. The main cause of her infertility was likely due to her intense daily training.

Asura's king,
Ariel
's father, has passed away from his illness. Ariel will become queen soon. After Eris got pregnant, a letter was sent to
Ghislaine
 informing her of this news. After Eris's child is born, they plan to visit
Asura Kingdom
 to visit Ghislaine.

Zenith
, Rudeus's mother, still hasn't recovered her memory. Her emotions have stopped improving, and she still doesn't speak. Orsted does not have any clues regarding a cure. Nevertheless, Rudeus does not plan on giving up on restoring her memory.

Chapter 1: One Job Among Many

Angelique Curenttale
, Angie, and
Pham Haindora
 are two women who are going on an expedition to collect the petals of the Eant flower to cure the village chief's son,
Dochil
, who has Iburi Disease. As they collect the flower petals, they are attacked by a
Ibri lizard
. At the last moment, they are saved by Rudeus. Rudeus reveals he was sent by a certain person to help Angie, but doesn't reveal any more details. Angie falls in love with Rudeus, as he was her knight in shinning armor that she always dreamed about, but after a few attempts to seduce him, Rudeus pulls out Roxy's panties and sniffs and prays to them. Angie's infatuation quickly turns to disgust. Before parting ways with Angie and Pham, he gives Angie a
Superd
 race figurine along with a picture book. He tells her to read the book to her future children and to tell them that the Superd race don't need to be feared. A few years later, Angie becomes the second wife to Dochil, who is now the village chief. As requested by Rudeus, Angie raised her children while reading the picture book for them. Over time, the story from the picture book became a staple for the children in the village. The story of the bald warrior from the Superd race carrying out justice. Later it spread through the neighboring villages.

Chapter 2: The Borrowed Cat

Rudeus returns home from his mission, saving Fam Haindora, and killing the lizard.
Aisha
 and Sylphy welcome him home. His toddler-aged daughter continues to be wary of Rudeus, much to his disappointment. He finds out that Eris has recently saved
Linia Dedoldia
 from slave traders. Linia recounts her story of how she tried to become a merchant after graduation from school. She soon fell into debt after getting scammed and was sold into slavery. The slave traders then arrive at Rudeus's home. They recognize that Rudeus is a powerful person both in combat ability and in connections and so try to convince him to return Linia to them. They explain that the Boreas house has already bought Linia for 300 Asura gold coins. Rudeus considers giving up Linia to the slave traders, but decides against it. He purchases Linia from the slave traders with three bags of magic stones, which are worth 1500 Asura gold coins in total. Rudeus confirms that the slavers don't also have Pursena in their possessions. Rudeus intimidates the slaver, and gets the slaver to promise to also give him Pursena, if she ever becomes their slave. Trembling in fear, the slaver agrees and leaves.

Chapter 3: The Entrance Ceremony and the Student Council President

In return for saving her from slavery, it is decided that Linia will work as a maid in their house. She is to work under Aisha. She recognizes Sacred Beast Leo and is able to communicate with him.

Rudeus goes back to school. Today is the entrance ceremony for new freshmen. Norn is the student council president and gives a speech. After the entrance ceremony, we are introduced to three freshmen Special students:
Rayfort
, son of the village chief of the elven Magnafold village,
Mi'nal
, son of the village chief of the dwarven Bi'nal village, and
Grannel Zafin Asura
, second son of Asura Kingdom's first prince, Grabell. Linia comes to the university to drop off lunch and recognizes Rayfort and Mii-Nall, who are both scared of Linia. Norn then arrives and scolds Rudeus for allowing Linia to bully the freshmen. Norn introduces herself to the three freshmen. Rudeus thinks to himself that Norn has grown into a impressive and classy lady.

Chapter 4: Research Progress

Rudeus meets with Cliff, and together they go to meet Orsted in the city outskirts. They are there to test Cliff's latest iteration of his curse suppression tool. Cliff has made some progress over the past year with suppressing Orsted's curse. Eris and Sylphy's attitude has softened toward Orsted, from "enemy of all living beings" to "evil boss" thanks the Cliff's surpression artifacts. Through his research, Cliff has also come to realize that
Rudeus lied
 about the fact that breaking the curse was related to Rudeus trying to kill Orsted, and that Rudeus was actually initially telling the truth about the fact that Orsted's curse cause living beings to fear and hate him. With their testing done, Rudeus and Cliff return to the university.

Rudeus goes to visit Zanoba. He sees Zanoba and Julie panicking over the fact that blood is flowing from her vagina. Rudeus reassures them that there is no wound to heal and this was likely menstruation and to ask Ginger for help.

Cliff, Zanoba, and Rudeus have lunch together. They discuss the progress on the Magic Armor. Over the past one and a half years, there have been several iterations to the Magic Armor. It has been miniaturized and requires much less magic to power it. It currently performs at the level of a Saint class swordsman. They have also changed their Gatling gun to a shotgun. Firing off several bullets at once is helpful as a counter against Water God style swordsmen, who can parry magic itself. Zanoba has made little progress on his autonomous doll research, as he has devoted his time to the Magic Armor instead; Zanoba doesn't mind this, however.

They then discuss mass producing their Superd doll and picture book. The limiting factor currently is that they don't have a shop where they can sell their product. Rudeus immediately discounts having Linia run their shop. They consider hiring another slave to run their business.

Rudeus then goes home, accompanied by Roxy and Norn. Roxy and Norn are getting along well. When they arrive home, Lucy greets Norn, but continues to hide herself from Rudeus. Norn finds out that Linia is now their new maid. Norn and Sylphy wonder if Linia will join Rudeus's collection of wives. Aisha greets everyone and introduces Linia, who has donned a maid outfit, similar to Aisha's.

Chapter 5: Signs of a Family Falling Apart

At the office, Rudeus practices his magic for combat. Rudeus practices chaining his various techniques, such as stone cannon, quagmire, and electricity, as well as the forms Orsted is teaching him, developed by Dragon God
Urupen
. Orsted then arrives and gives Rudeus his next mission, with departure in three days.

Rudeus goes home and sees Linia looking dejected by the front entrance. He enters his home and is greeted by Lucy, to Rudeus's pleasant surprise. He finds out that Eris has gone to the school to teach swordsmanship to Norn. Rudeus goes to the backyard to find Aisha. Aisha is upset about the fact that Linia broke her favorite teacup. More than that, however, Aisha is upset at how Linia is doing a poor job as a maid, such as breaking dishes and getting her fur in the laundry, and the fact that she doesn't learn from her mistakes. Aisha is also upset at Linia's constant lighthearted tone, and how she never sincerely apologizes for her mistakes. Aisha asks Rudeus to kick Linia out and perhaps sell her to the Boreas house. As Linia is his friend, Rudeus asks Aisha to forgive Linia, which Aisha agrees to do for now. After dinner, Sylphy likewise tells Rudeus that Linia doesn't fit in with their household.

At bedtime, Rudeus is feeling horny as he hasn't had sex for over ten days. Roxy and Sylphy aren't available as they are on their period, and they have a rule that pregnant women can't have sex, so Eris isn't available either. Eris invites Rudeus to have sex with Linia. Rudeus considers it, but rejects Linia, to Linia's disappointment since she wanted to become Rudeus' fourth wife which would also erase her debt. Rudeus is concerned that if he has sex with Linia, it would only worsen the current family dynamics, on top of wanted to just be friends with Linia.

Rudeus reflects on how several household members are unhappy since Linia arrived. He considers that the reason Eris went to teach at the school was to escape the unpleasant atmosphere at home. Rudeus decides to find a non-maid job for Linia, tomorrow.

Chapter 6: Starting a Business

Rudeus tries to find a new job for Linia. He considers various possibilities such as having her help Zanoba or Cliff's research, become the merchant for selling the Ruijerd book and doll sets, become Norn's maid, or become an adventurer. He dismisses all those ideas as none seemed like a good fit nor would they allow her to generate enough money to repay her debt.

During lunch, Rudeus discusses with Cliff. Cliff suggests having Linia help with work at Orsted's office. Cliff wonders if the curse may have an odor component, which would prevent Linia from working at the office. Rudeus comes up with a new job for Linia, which is to recruit people to support his and Orsted's missions. He buys another building to become the new office, where Linia would work. He gets Aisha to supervise Linia, who reluctantly agrees.

Chapter 7: A Company Venture

Rudeus was given a mission where he needs to ensure that the knight
Lionheart
 and Princess
Geltraude
 of the country Twall are able marry each other, despite differences in their social status. In the original timeline, the king supports their relationship, and tries to make Lionheart into a hero. The king started a war and sent Lionheart to the frontlines, but Lionheart ended up dying. Rudeus proposes a plan to the king, where he kidnaps the Princess and the king sends Lionheart to save her. Rudeus, pretending to be a villain, battles with Lionheart, and then pretends to be defeated, therefore solidifying Lionheart's status as a hero and allowing him to marry the princess as he was given a title of nobility as a reward. The mission was a success and Rudeus heads home.

Back at home, he finds out from Sylphy and Lilia that Aisha has been spending a lot of time with strange shady looking people wearing black cloaks. Sylphy directs him to the building where Aisha is, and Rudeus goes to investigate. The building is one he doesn't recognize. Inside, are lots of people, all wearing the black coats. Rudeus is brought to meet Aisha and Linia. He discovers that they are the leaders of the organization, and notes that they are dressed like mafia bosses. Aisha tells Rudeus that in the month that he had been gone, Linia was able to quickly recruit over 30 people to their organization. With so many members, Aisha sold the old building bought by Rudeus, and rented the current building. From Nanahoshi's recommendation, Aisha had all the members wear a single uniform, which ended up being the black coat with a yellow rat symbol sewed in to signify Greyrat to build solidarity among the group. Next, Aisha considered what they could do with all these new recruits. As most members had no talents except for combat, they decided to form a mercenary company. This new business, under Aisha's careful direction, had many job requests for bodyguard work and generated lots of income. Rudeus is extremely impressed with all that Aisha has accomplished within a short time span. He notes that with this, it could be possible for Linia to repay her debt. Aisha reveals that a major part of her motivation for managing Linia's new business was to make sure Linia didn't fail and end up back at their home. The name of this company is the
Ruquag's Mercenary Company
, with Ruquag being Rudeus's pseudonym. It has 50 current employees and is a branch company of
ORSTED Corp
.

As Rudeus heads back home, Linia tells Rudeus that she received a letter from the Great Forest. In it is written a single line: "Grave Situation, Holy Beast-sama has disappeared! Urgent Search ASAP!". Rudeus therefore decides to go to the Great Forest to apologize for being the one responsible for the Holy Beast's disappearance.

Chapter 8: Revisiting Doldia Village

Rudeus goes to the Doldia village to explain the situation with the Sacred Beast, accompanied by Linia and Sacred Beast Leo. They use Perugius's teleportation circles to get to the Great Forest. On arrival, they discover that it's rainy season and the forest is submerged in over 5m of water. Rudeus makes a boat and they make it to the Doldia village after a few days.

Once they arrive, the villagers are surprised to see their Sacred Beast. They also recognize Linia, who is Gyes's daughter. They shame Linia for abandoning her duty to the village to become a merchant. Rudeus goes to meet Gyes, who is now the village chief. Rudeus notes that Gyes is much calmer now, compared to when they last met 10 years ago. Gyes is accompanied by Minitona and Terusena, who are hot-headed and remind Rudeus of Gyes's old self. Rudeus explains his situation, about how he is fighting a powerful enemy and summoned a being to protect his family, and Sacred Beast Leo ended up being summoned. Leo himself is able to communicate with the Beast race, and so explains that Rudeus's daughter Lara is special. It is revealed that Leo's purpose in life is to assist the person who will save the world. Leo believes that this person is Lara. Gyes expresses his surprise since he wasn't expecting this special person to appear for another 80 years. A possible explanation offered is that since Lara is half human and half elven, she will have a long lifespan and so may need protecting 80 years into the future. Gyes ultimately accepts Sacred Beast Leo's decision to live with Rudeus and guard his family. He asks Rudeus to bring Lara to the Doldia village for a ritual when she turns 15 years old.

The conversation then shifts to the reason for Linia living with Rudeus. Linia initially tries to lie, but Rudeus tells the truth about how she was scammed as a merchant, fell into debt, sold into slavery and was ultimately bought by Rudeus. Gyes then discusses who will go back with Rudeus to help guard Sacred Beast Leo. Although Leo is unlikely to require protection, it is the Dorudia tribe's duty to do so. Minitona and Terusena argue over which of them would guard Leo. Before any decision is made, Rudeus asks about where Pursena is. Rudeus is brought to the prison, where Pursena is currently being held.

Chapter 9: The Case of the Jerky Thief

Pursena returned to the village a half year ago. As a daughter of the Adoldia tribe's chief, she was a potential candidate to become the next village chief. Before becoming a candidate, she needed to become a warrior chief. With her advanced healing magic, she worked with the warriors and gained their trust. However, 10 days ago, there was an incident where Pursena was on duty to guard the warehouse full of meat, and she ate it all. The meat warehouse is meant to preserve food for the rainy season. Every night, it is guarded by a team of two people. That night, Pursena's partner was Kanalna. Kanalna was injured in battle, however, and so Pursena sent her home to rest. The next day, Pursena was found sleeping in the warehouse, with some meat around her mouth, and the stored meat eaten. Pursena's reputation dramatically fell. She was forced to resign form her position as warrior chief, she is no longer a candidate for village chief, and she was thrown into jail.

Pursena continues to insist on her innocence. Rudeus, having been previously falsely accused of a crime by the Doldia village in the past, agrees to investigate on her behalf. His investigations confirms that Pursena is indeed guilty. He does learn, however, that before the incident, there was a demon attack and Pursena had spent all day healing warriors and did not have time to eat that day. By the time her guard shift started, her hunger got the better of her. Rudeus sympathizes with how a single mistake has destroyed her dreams of being village chief. Rudeus returns with the results of his investigation and confronts Pursena. He is able to get Pursena to confess to her crime.

Gyes then re-opens the subject of the one person that will go back with Rudeus to become Sacred Beast Leo's caretaker. Linia requests that Pursena be Leo's caretaker. She suggests that if Pursena does her job well for 10 years as Leo's caretaker, that her crime may be forgiven. Gyes is initially reluctant, but with Rudeus also voicing support for this idea, Gyes accepts the proposal. Pursena, along with Rudeus, Linia, and Leo then return to Magic City Sharia.

Chapter 10: The Other Slave (Part 1)

Julie has been quietly sneaking off to the market at night, and she refuses to tell Zanoba why. Zanoba and Rudeus go to a shop that makes decorative boxes for dolls, where the shopkeeper,
Belfried
, explains that he wants his "girls" (dolls) to "sleep" (lie in) "beds" (boxes) befitting their beauty. Belfried mentions that Julie came to his shop with a doll so well-made that he offered to pay 200 Ranoan gold coins for it, but Julie ran out of the shop after he got overexcited. Zanoba, Rudeus, and Belfried come to the conclusion that Julie is unhappy with being a slave and wants money to purchase her freedom. Zanoba, Rudeus, and Belfried go talk to Julie in Zanoba's room, and Zanoba asks Julie whether she wants to stop being a slave.

Chapter 11: The Other Slave (Part 2)

The narration explains that Julie's parents were wandering craftspeople who bought raw materials, made weapons and ornaments, and sold them to get by. Although they were skilled, they had no talent for business, and by the time Julie was born they were already in crippling debt. Eventually, they had to choose between dying as a family or living in slavery, and they chose the latter. While Julie's parents were sold fairly quickly due to their skills, no one would buy Julie since she couldn't speak the human language and was too young to do anything. She realized that she was going to starve to death in a cage, abandoned by her parents; having lived her entire life with no happy memories, she gave up on finding happiness. When Zanoba and Rudeus appeared in front of her cage and Rudeus asked, "Do you want to die?" Julie was on the verge of saying yes, but changed her mind after seeing the serious look in Rudeus's eyes. Life as Zanoba's slave was very different from what Julie had envisioned, and while there was a lot of work for her to do, she was well-fed, could sleep in a warm bed, and above all, her master was kind to her. Zanoba treated her like a younger sibling, looking after her and talking about dolls all day. She came to enjoy doll creation due to the sense of accomplishment at getting better and the praise Zanoba would give her upon completing a doll. One day, she finished a doll, and noticed something weird about it; it was, by her and Zanoba's standards, a "masterpiece". Although she wanted to show it to Zanoba right away, she figured that Zanoba would be even more delighted if she presented it to him in a decorative box. She went to Belfried's shop, but realized that the price of a box was far higher than the amount of money she had on hand. Remembering that Belfried had a tendency to lower his prices for high-quality dolls, Julie showed him the doll, but his obsessive behavior scared her and she fled the shop, bumping into several boxes in her haste. Unable to go back, Julie decides to make her own box. When Julie hears Zanoba ask if she wants to quit being his slave, she assumes that he is angry about the damage to the merchandise in the shop and is going to end their relationship. Desperate to avoid being cut loose, Julie offers the masterpiece doll to Belfried to appease him (LN illustration 10), which shocks Zanoba and Rudeus. Although Belfried is eager to get his hands on the doll, Rudeus interrupts them and asks for an explanation. Zanoba assumes that Julie has betrayed him because she is unhappy with her circumstances, and desperately tries to make it up to her by offering her payment for the dolls she has made and granting her freedom. Julie realizes that Zanoba meant no harm and gives the doll to him, and the misunderstanding is resolved. Zanoba realizes that even though he is living a relatively simple life compared to his time in the royal palace, he is happy living with Julie and Ginger, able to devote his entire time to the dolls he loves (LN illustration 11). He then receives a letter with the Shirone royal crest, and laments that all good things must come to an end.

Chapter 12: The Next Battle

After returning from the Dorudia village, Rudeus wakes up early to do his normal training. He notes his family sleeping peacefully. He sees that Pursena slept in Eris's bed last night, where she was Eris's hug pillow, and so complains of rib/breast pain. At breakfast, Norn discusses with the family what she wants to do when she graduates. She considers becoming an adventurer. Her family members don't forbid her from pursuing this, but express their concern. After breakfast, Aisha and Pursena go to the Mercenary office to help Linia manage the company.

Rudues goes to see Orsted and reports on his past month's activities. Rudeus tells him about his new Mercenary company. Rudeus brings up the fact that Lara may be the savior. Orsted notes that in other timelines, the partner of the Sacred Beast was male, and that he defeated Demon God Laplace when he revived. Orsted did note, however, that Hitogami spent a lot of effort to prevent Rudeus's and Roxy's fate from intertwining. Rudeus speculates that perhaps his daughter has taken the original hero's place as the savior. Orsted concludes that Lara will likely be a major obstacle for Hitogami in the future. He reassures Rudeus that with the Sacred Beast's protection, Hitogami cannot easily harm Lara.

Rudeus goes to school to meet Cliff and Zanoba. He sees them arguing with each other. Zanoba reveals that he has received a royal command to return back to his home country. His brother Pax succeeded in a coup, executed his father and brothers and took the throne. Exhausted from the civil war, other countries might invade Shirone. Therefore Zanoba received a royal command to return to his country, and assist in defending it. Hearing this, Rudeus realizes that this is likely to be his next fight, and that it has come earlier than he predicted.

Summary

Chapter 1 : Zanoba’s Decision

Zanoba explains the situation to his friends: Cliff, Rudeus, Elinalise, Julie and Ginger. His brother Pax was exiled to the King Dragon Realm, gained their backing, and successfully initiated a coup in Shirone. He killed the previous Shirone king and the rest of the royal family, and became the new king of Shirone Kingdom. As a result of the coup, Shirone's military force has declined, and they worry that the countries to the north will take advantage of the situation and attack Shirone. Therefore, Zanoba was summoned by King Pax to return to Shirone to defend his home nation.

Cliff and Rudeus question Zanoba on why he wants to comply with the summon and return home. They warn him that this is likely a trap for Pax to have Zanoba killed. Zanoba admits he doesn't want to work under Pax. However, Zanoba reflects on how due to his lack of control over his own strength, he has ripped the heads off of several people, including his former wife, which precipitated a civil war. But despite all this, he was not punished. Zanoba therefore feels that he owes his country in return. Zanoba feels that he was spared punishment so that he could save his country in times of crisis. He acknowledges that if  he returns, he will likely die. Rudeus doesn't want his friend to die, so he announces that he will be accompanying Zanoba to Shirone.

Rudeus discusses this situation with Orsted. Orsted reveals that in his timeline, thirty years into the future, Pax started a coup and took over the throne. He then began questioning his own kingship, vacated throne and reorganized the kingdom into a republic. The Shirone republic became a major world power and was a hindrance to Hitogami. Orsted warns that Zanoba being summoned back is likely bait to draw in and kill both Rudeus and Zanoba, who makes Rudeus's equipment. Orsted wonders if someone in the King Dragon Realm may be Hitogami's apostle.Orsted announces that he will go to the King Dragon Realm to investigate for apostles, while Rudeus goes to Shirone to help Zanoba, despite it being a trap. Orsted asks Rudeus to avoid killing Pax, even if he's an apostle, as if he's killed Shirone cannot become a republic.

Chapter 2 : Bad Omens

Rudeus tells his family that he will go to Shirone. Lara then starts crying. Roxy sees this as a sign, and she decides to accompany Rudeus to Shirone; when Roxy announces this, Lara instantly stops crying. Rudeus reveals that going to Shirone is likely a trap set by Hitogami, but Roxy still insists on going. Rudeus and Zanoba prepare their combat equipment before going to Shirone. Rudeus brings both his bulky Magic Armor Mark 1, and the more manageable Magic Armor Mark 2b, as well as the shotgun cannon. They go to  Sky Castle to borrow Perugius's magic teleportation circles. Zanoba explains to Perugius his situation and why he is heading back to Shirone. Perugius also tries to convince Zanoba not to go back to Shirone, as he doesn't want Zanoba to die. Perugius enjoys Zanoba's company and their chats about art. Zanoba asks to borrow Perugius's magic teleportation circles. He also begs Perugius to temporarily lift the rule that bans all Magic Race, and to allow Roxy to enter Sky Castle so that she may also use the magic teleportation circles. Perugius reluctantly agrees, under the condition that Roxy not speak and not touch anything. Ginger goes ahead of the group to investigate Shirone Kingdom. She discovers that King Pax has 10 knights from the King Dragon Realm, and that one of them is one of the Seven Great World Powers, the Death God.

Chapter 3 : The Return to Shirone

The night before their departure, Orsted visits Rudeus's house for an emergency meeting. Orsted gives his predictions based on Ginger's report. Regarding Pax's 10 knights, nine of them are likely weak. However, the tenth knight is likely Death God Randolph Marianne, who is ranked fifth of the Seven Great World Powers. The Death God has the ability Sword of Luring, which entices an enemy to attack when he should retreat, and Sword of Hesitation, which forces an enemy to retreat when he should attack. Orsted reassures Rudeus that although he is a difficult opponent, Rudeus should be able to handle him, now that he understands his enemy's ability. Orsted advises Rudeus to attack from a distance. In terms of the Death God's backstory, Randolph Marianne is the grandson of the second North God. After beating the original Death God, he gained the title. He then was fed up with fighting and retired to become a chef in his hometown in the King Dragon Realm. He had no talent as a chef and became buried in debt. He was then picked up by a general of the King Dragon Realm, and became a knight of the kingdom.

Rudeus says goodbye to his family. Julie will be living with Rudeus's family, while Zanoba and Ginger are gone. Rudeus and Roxy then meet up with Zanoba at the city entrance. Cliff and Elinalise are there too, and they say their goodbyes. They go to Sky Castle. They say goodbye to Nanahoshi. They use the magic teleportation circle and arrive in a teleportation ruin on the edge of Shirone Kingdom, five days journey to the capital. The group arrives in Shirone. They plan to have an audience with the King tomorrow. Rudeus considers in his mind various outcomes from their meeting with the King and considers how he will eventually get Zanoba to return. Roxy sees that Rudeus is stressed and tells him to relax.

Chapter 4 : King Pax

Rudeus and Zanoba have an audience with King Pax. Pax questions them on how they arrived in Shirone so quickly, but doesn't pursue the matter when Zanoba refuses to give a clear answer. Pax also questions why Rudeus is present. Pax wonders out loud if Rudeus is there to kill him. Zanoba denies this. Pax introduces Death God Randolph Marianne. Randolph introduces himself; he explains that his main job is killing, but that his hobby is cooking, and that he's a nice guy. Pax asks Zanoba if they should let Rudeus and Randolph fight to see who is stronger. Rudeus readies himself for a fight. Pax then defuses the situation as he says he was joking. Pax says he no longer holds a grudge against Zanoba and Rudeus. Pax recounts how he was sent to the King Dragon Realm. While there, Pax worked on improving himself, developing his magic and physique. Pax then gained the attention of the King and was offered a reward. Pax asked for permission to marry the eighteenth Princess Benedikte Kingdragon. The king gives permission, under the condition that Pax return to Shirone, attain a high ranking role, and then  have Shirone send another prince as an exchange. Shirone Kingdom refused. This enraged the Dragon King, who sent his most able knights, Death God Randolph and the Order of Black Knights, with Pax to initiate a coup. They murdered the rest of the royal family, and installed Pax on the throne, which brings us back to present day. Zanoba asks why he was summoned if Pax has access to the Death God. Pax responds that the Death God is a loan from the Dragon King. Pax reassures Zanoba that he has no plans to exact revenge on Zanoba, and asks Zanoba to lend his strength. Zanoba accepts. Pax then gives Zanoba command over Fort Karon and tells him to stop the northern invasion.

Zanoba and Rudeus then leave the audience room. Zanoba feels that Pax has changed. Rudeus jokes that Pax may be manipulated by an evil god. Zanoba, however, asks if Rudeus is referring to the evil god he is fighting against. Zanoba refers to the dinner they had with Cliff, where Rudeus revealed that he was working with Orsted to fight Hitogami. Zanoba thought it was a joke at the time, but with Cliff working on an anti-curse device for Orsted and all of Rudeus's missions, Zanoba started to wonder if the evil god may be real. Rudeus then reveals the truth about Hitogami, how Pax may be manipulated by Hitogami, and that Rudeus is forbidden from killing Pax. Zanoba announces he will try to protect Pax from Hitogami. Rudeus worries to himself whether there is a trap, and whether Pax may change his mind and try to kill Zanoba. Rudeus thinks to himself that he will discuss this with Roxy tomorrow.

Chapter 5 : Fort Karon

Rudeus discusses with Roxy all his worries and concerns, such as the fact that he is suspicious of the king of King Dragon Realm and that he is uncertain about Hitogami's intent. Roxy reveals that new information from Ginger has arrived. Their force at Fort Karon is only staffed with 500 soldiers, while their enemy's force is nearly 5000. However, given that Rudeus and Roxy are Emperor ranked and King ranked magicians respectively, each of them could theoretically hold off over 1000 soldiers. They debate on whether Pax intended their placement to be a trap, given that they are outnumbered. Rudeus considers his current hypothesis on the identities of Hitogami's three apostles: one is the king of King Dragon Realm, another is someone from the group attacking Fort Karon, but the third person is still unknown. They agree that going to Fort Karon is likely a trap, but they go anyway as they wish to save Zanoba. They know that Zanoba will go regardless.

Rudeus relays to Zanoba about the fact that Fort Karon has 500 soldiers against 5000 attacking soldiers. Zanoba remains unworried as he knows he has Rudeus and Roxy on his side, each worth at least 1000 soldiers. He also points out that since they are defending a fort, they are in an advantageous position as it typically takes forces 3 times an occupying force to storm a castle. Rudeus warns that Zanoba is likely being used as a sacrificial pawn by Pax, but Zanoba remains undeterred. He is fine with the idea of being sacrificed and continues to insist that fighting for his country is his duty.

Roxy, Rudeus and Zanoba travel to Fort Karon. Ginger remains in the capitol. During the journey, Rudeus is anxious about the idea of entering a war, but neither Zanoba or Roxy are bothered. After 9 days of travel, they reach Fort Karon. They meet Shirone Knight Garrick Babiliti, the one currently in command. Zanoba informs Garrick that he will be taking over command, but given his inexperience, he will continue to rely on Garrick. Zanoba then gathers all the troops for a speech and introduction. Zanoba introduces himself as well as Rudeus and Roxy. He highlights their incredible power and successfully raises his troops' morale. Rudeus is impressed with Zanoba's show of leadership.

Chapter 6 : Preparations for War

Rudeus and Zanoba go outside of Fort Karon to the locations where they expect to be attacked. Rudeus spends time modifying the terrain with earth magic and setting traps to make it difficult for the advancing enemy. Rudeus assembles his magic armor, which is meant for close combat. Rudeus fortifies the fort. Roxy teaches magic to the soldiers and other staff at the fort. Rudeus notes that while Roxy and Zanoba are popular, others seem to be afraid of him and avoid him, which he suspects is due to the fact that he rearranged the battlefield so effortlessly. They have received support from King Dragon Realm, not through reinforcements, but by sending supplies, which include food, such as rice. They receive news that the enemy troops will arrive in approximately five days. They continue with their preparations. Roxy works on drawing magic circles which generate fire magic, meant for multiple soldiers to use. Rudeus thinks to himself that he will have to kill in this war, and reflects on how he has killed others in the past and it left a bad aftertaste. Rudeus confides in Roxy that he is reluctant to kill people. Roxy reveals that while she has never been in a war, she has no issue with killing others, based on her experience adventuring.

Chapter 7 : The Battle

Zanoba and a crew of 100 men had gone off on their own mission, which is apparently to kill or capture the enemy commander. The battle with the enemy had begun. The enemy started using magic to try to fill in the trenches and traps that Rudeus had built. Rudeus is able to easily counteract these attempts. The enemies then try to advance by building bridges over the traps. The Fort Karon shoot fire attacks at the enemy, using magic circles. The enemy tries to protect their own troops and counteract the fire attacks with water magic of their own. Because of this, however, Rudeus is able to see origin of this water magic, and therefore the location of the magicians. He easily eliminates the enemy magicians. With the enemy magicians gone, the Shirone forces are easily able to crush their enemies using magic, as the enemy no longer has a method to counteract magic. The Shirone easily win the battle with minimal losses.

Prince Zanoba then returns. Only 10 of his original 100 soldiers remain. However, they were successful in capturing the enemy's commander, who is a member of the enemy's royal family. With this, they hope to negotiate to end the war. While they were within the enemy lines, Zanoba reveals that he and his team were caught in Rudeus and Roxy's attacks. Zanoba tells Rudeus not to feel guilty about this and that any blame lays solely on him.

That evening, an assailant from the enemy came to try to rescue their royal family member. Rudeus is able to quickly stun the assailant and hand him over to the fort's soldiers. Rudeus is worries that he will be attacked this night by the Death God, but no attack ever comes.

The next morning, Zanoba and Rudeus interrogate their royal hostage. They learn that the northern enemy had been planning an attack on Shirone for some time, and the hostage denied any knowledge of Hitogami. Rudeus wonders if maybe coming to Shirone wasn't a trap after all and that Hitogami had nothing to so with this.

Chapter 8 : An Urgent Message, and Zanoba’s True Feelings

Ten days later, the enemy nation has offered a truce. Fort Karon sends a message back to capital about the victory, the hostage, and the possible truce.

Ginger arrives at Fort Karon, back from the capital. She reports that a local warlord Jade has risen up and launched a coup against King Pax, in the name of 11th prince Haruha Shirone. Jade has launched an attack at this time hoping that the battle at Fort Karon would go poorly, forcing Pax to send the Death God, leaving Pax vulnerable. This did not happen, but nevertheless, Jade felt that this was still the best time to attack.

Zanoba announces that he will return to the capital to defend Pax. Ginger and Rudeus are surprised. They point out that Zanoba has finished his duty of protecting his country, and to return back to Sharia with them. Zanoba reveals that his main motivation isn't just to protect his country, but to also protect Pax, who is his younger brother. Hearing this, Rudeus respects Zanoba's decision to remain in Shirone to protect Pax. Ginger strongly dislikes Pax as he had kidnapped her family as hostages in the past. She accepts that she cannot change Zanoba's mind. She asks Zanoba to promise not to die even if Pax orders it. Rudeus answers on Zanoba's behalf and promises to make sure Zanoba doesn't die.

Chapter 9 : To Pax’s Side

Rudeus, Zanoba, and Roxy travel back to the Shirone capital city Latakia. Rudeus wears his magic armor mark 1 on the trip, despite its magical power drain, so that he can avoid disassembling and reassembling the armor en route.

They reach Latakia after 5 days. At the entrance to royal castle, there were a large number of people, including soldiers, merchants and adventurers. Zanoba suggests that they enter the castle by a secret passageway, to avoid getting detected. He directs them to an underground passageway by the watermill. At Rudeus's suggestion, they then take a break, to relieve their travel fatigue.

They travel through the underground passageway. The passageway is narrow, so Rudeus swaps out the bulky, but powerful Mark 1 armor for the more portable, but less powerful Mark 2 armor. They go to the end of the passageway and open a metal door, whereupon they find a dead end. Roxy suggests that the passageway may have been sealed by an earthquake or intentionally by Jade's forces. So, Rudeus uses earth magic to tunnel through. They then find themselves in a cave, which Roxy identifies as being similar to a labyrinth. At Roxy's advice, Rudeus keeps digging a path until they reach another passage. They follow this passage until they find themselves in the room in the castle where Rudeus was imprisoned, many years ago, and where Zanoba and Rudeus first met. They search the castle floor by floor, but see no one. Not a single person. They eventually reach the King's room on the fifth floor and they see the Death God Randolph guarding the room.

Randolph is sitting on a chair, looking relaxed. He comments how having a room on the fifth floor is inconvenient and how if he were king, his room would be on the first floor. Zanoba asks about the state of the castle. Randolph reveals a red eye with six stars under his eye patch, and states that he used his eye to construct a barrier around the castle to protect the King. Everyone else who isn't dead has fled the castle. Zanoba tries to enter the King's room, but the Death God Randolph refuses to let him pass, stating that he was ordered by the king to let no one pass. Zanoba tries to force himself through, but Randolph easily pushes Zanoba away. Rudeus tries to defuse the situation. He notes to himself that since both Randolph and their side are trying to protect Pax, they shouldn't be enemies. Rudeus thinks to himself that it would a different matter if Randolph were Hitogami's apostle, but he feels that this is unlikely, since if this was the case Pax would be dead already. However, just to be sure, Rudeus asks Randolph if he knows of Hitogami. Randolph laughs and confirms that he does.

Rudeus now considers Randolph to be his enemy and prepares himself for combat. In response, Randolph draws his sword, which emits a green light. Rudeus muses to himself that he is only wearing the Mark 2 armor.

Chapter 10 : Wasted Effort All Around

Rudeus, Roxy, and Zanoba fight the Death God Randolph. They initially land a series of blows, and although Randolph initially pretends to be hurt, he shrugs them off. He lands a significant blow on Roxy, which she only survived due to one time use magic items. Rudeus recognizes that this battle is not winnable and instructs Roxy and Zanoba to retreat. Rudeus asks Randolph what instructions he's receives from Hitogami. Randolph reveals that while he has heard of Hitogami, he has never actually spoken to him. Rudeus realizes that he has misjudged and they apologize to each other for fighting. Randolph states that King Pax's "ritual" has now ended and so they may enter to meet him.

They enter Pax's room. They see Pax's wife, Benedict, laying in the bed and they can smell the scent of recent sex. Pax is standing in the balcony. Zanoba announces he is here to help and that they may retreat to Fort Karon. Pax rejects this idea. He monologues about how he had tried his best to be a good king and as evidenced by the current rebellion, his subjects still do not support him. Pax reflects on how none of his efforts are ever rewarded. He recounts up how when he was learning magic under Roxy, he excitedly showed her how he mastered intermediate magic and Roxy only sighed. Pax reveals that this was particularly devastating for him as he greatly respected Roxy and felt she was the only one to give him attention, and still his efforts were not recognized. Pax feels like a failure. The King of the King Dragon Realm gave him Shirone kingdom, but is ultimately not recognized as king by its people.

Suddenly, Pax jumps off the balcony. They try to catch him, but he hits the ground and dies. Pax had committed suicide. Rudeus and Zanoba are shocked at the sudden turn of events. Zanoba wonders if Pax's death was Hitogami's doing. Rudeus admits that it is possible.

Chapter 11 : Aftermath

Rudeus plans to cremate Pax's corpse, but Zanoba wants to bring Pax's body to the rebels, so that the revolt could conclude. They see that Randolph is carrying Benedict on his back. Randolph was aware of Pax's plan for suicide. He was instructed to then bring his wife Benedict back to the King Dragon Realm. As a group, they all travel back through the secret passageway. They see the Mark 1 magic armor on the other end. Randolph notes that if Rudeus had used this armor, that Randolph would have been in trouble. He further notes that contrary to Rudeus's assessment, Randolph was actually becoming worn down from their attacks. Rudeus wonders if maybe they could have won if they didn't second guess themselves, but decides it doesn't matter because the correct choice would have been to avoid fighting in the first place.

Rudeus questions Randolph on how he knows Hitogami. Randolph reports that he heard a story from one of his relatives, the demon lord Badigadi. In order to protect his fiancée, Badigadi stole the Fighting God Armor at the suggestion of Hitogami, and fought Dragon God Laplace. In the end, he failed to protect the fiancée, and the two struck one another down. Although Randolph feels this story is a myth, it is through this story had he has heard of Hitogami. Rudeus thinks to himself that he has heard the story of how the Fighting God and Dragon King had fought from both Kirishika and Orsted, but he also finds it strange that someone as lighthearted as Badigadi would do something like this.

Randolph indicates he will return to the King Dragon Realm. When Benedict gives birth, Randolph will then raise the child. Randolph then parts ways with the group, carrying Benedict.

Jade's rebels have taken over the castle. The rebels are celebrating their victory. Pax's corpse is displayed in towns square. Most people are indifferent. Pax's reign was short. He was neither hated nor loved. Seeing his dead brother's corpse, Zanoba is quite emotional. Rudeus wonders of he should have cremated Pax after all. Rudeus can see in Zanoba's face that he did indeed care for Pax. Rudeus ruminates on how he should have been able to save Pax and he wonders if Jade was actually Hitogami's apostle. Rudeus thinks to himself that it doesn't matter now, and all their efforts have been for nothing.

Roxy is depressed, now knowing how her failure to be encouraging as a teacher had a major negative impact on Pax. She admits to Rudeus that she did indeed sigh when Pax showed how he mastered intermediate magic. She admits she may have been comparing Pax to Rudeus, who was naturally gifted at magic. While she recognized she didn't do a great job as a teacher, she blamed it on the environment at the royal palace at the time. She didn't realize how her attitude had such an effect on Pax, until he mentioned it just before his death. Roxy cries. She asks Rudeus how she can continue to be a teacher. Rudeus comforts her. He reassures her that she will learn from her mistakes and will continue to improve as a teacher. Rudeus further states how Roxy had a major positive impact on his life as his teacher, and greatly contributed to his personal growth. Rudeus doesn't try to minimize the harm that Roxy had inflicted onto Pax, but encourages her to learn from her mistakes and to think of all the future students she may help, students such as himself. From the next day on, Roxy regained her vitality.

Ginger meets up with the group in the capital city. Ginger asks what Zanoba's plans are, going forward. Zanoba states that he plans to go back to Sharia. Ginger is happy to hear this. Zanoba indicates that he will renounce his position as part of the royal family. Ginger, however, still plans to continue to serve Zanoba, to fulfill her promise to Zanoba's mother. She doesn't care that Zanoba will no longer be royalty. Zanoba is reluctant, but Ginger continues to insist. Zanoba agrees for Ginger to continue to follow him.

Chapter 12 : Zanoba’s Chosen Path

Zanoba reflects to himself how in the past, although he loved dolls, he disliked humans. It was only until he met Rudeus that he discovered that he no longer disliked all human beings. A major turning point for him was when Julie entered his life. He initially saw Julie as an annoyance. However, as he cares about creating dolls, he took the time to instruct Julie on the art of doll-making. Before he realized it, he no longer saw Julie as an annoyance and grew attached to her. Similarly, before coming to Sharia, he used to see Ginger as a nuisance who would only scold him. When they reunited, he no longer saw her as a nuisance, despite her nagging being unchanged. In the past, Zanoba didn't understand Nanahoshi and her obsession with trying to return to her homeland. Zanoba couldn't relate to this, as he didn't have good memories of Shirone. But this slowly changed, as he slowly found himself longing for his home. So, when he was summoned by Pax, he immediately decided to go home to defend his country. After their victory at Fort Karon, Zanoba felt ready to return to Sharia, but a part of him still wanted to stay in Shirone. So, he lied about wanting to help Pax, as his brother. But after Pax's death, he had a flashback of when he and Pax were young, and how Zanoba ignored the ten year old Pax during a party. Zanoba regrets not speaking to Pax at that time.

Zanoba, Roxy, and Rudeus set off to return to Sharia. They go to the teleportation magic circle which brings them to Sky Castle. Zanoba and Rudeus greet Perugius and give an update on the events that occurred in Shirone. Perugius admonishes Zanoba for thinking of binding himself to a single country. He is happy to hear that Zanoba had renounced his royal status. Rudeus updates Nanahoshi as well.

They return to Sharia. Rudeus goes to meet Orsted to give him a report as well. Rudeus muses that will need to report his failure, in that he allowed Pax to die, who was an important player in Orsted's plans for the future. Zanoba wants to meet Orsted as well, to give thanks for the magic armor that saved him with his fight with Randolph and to apologize for its destruction. Rudeus enters the office and meets Orsted. He sees that Orsted is wearing a solid black face mask, which startles him. Cliff has produced a new revision of the mask. Rudeus reports on the events in Shirone. He confesses to Orsted that he failed to prevent Pax's death. Orsted postulates that the King of King Dragon Realm, Leonard Kingdragon was an apostle of Hitogami, and that the warlord Jade or a Shirone kingdom general was also an apostle. By manipulating these people, Hitogami cornered Pax and drove him to suicide. Hitogami likely manipulated the King Dragon Realm's King to assist Pax with claiming the throne, providing him the Death God, and putting the country in a good position, and then manipulated Jade to orchestrate Pax's failure. Rudeus apologizes for his failure. Orsted acknowledges he made a mistake as well. After killing Leonard Kingdragon, he acknowledges he should have went to Shirone kingdom. Rudeus wonders if someone could substitute for Pax in turning Shirone into a republic, but Orsted states there is no substitute.

Zanoba, who was standing behind Rudeus, expresses his gratitude to Orsted. Rudeus hadn't noticed Zanoba before now, but deduces that Orsted must have sensed Zanoba's approach, since he is wearing the black mask made by Cliff, to suppress his curse. Zanoba wonders if Orsted was trying to help Pax. Orsted reveals that he wasn't necessarily trying to help Pax, but rather he needed a man who would have been born in the country Pax would have created. Zanoba asks Orsted to explain. Orsted explains that Pax would turn Shirone into a Republic. After becoming a republic, Bolt Macedonias, a former slave trader rises to power and is given an important post by Pax. From his descendants, the Demon God Laplace is born. Now that Pax has died, Orsted no longer knows where Laplace will be born. Rudeus wonders if they can recreate various events to trigger Laplace's rebirth, but Orsted states that these ideas are useless as he has tried them before. Orsted states that Laplace must be killed in order to reach Hitogami. But while he can kill Laplace, this will consume too much of his magic power before his fight with Hitogami. He is near the end of his loop, before he is forcefully reincarnated, and so he doesn't have enough time after killing Laplace for his magic power to replenish. Orsted announces that this loop is a failure. Zanoba suggests that this loop may not actually be a failure yet. He suggests that they start gathering an army that can defeat Laplace, so that Orsted can save his magic power. Laplace won't revive for approximately another 80 years, so they have time to gather allies. Zanoba wants revenge on Hitogami, who killed his brother, Pax. Zanoba asks if Orsted would accept him as another subordinate. Rudeus supports Zanoba's idea. Orsted accepts Zanoba's plan to gather allies and accepts him as another subordinate.

Rudeus ruminates on his recent failure. He wants to make sure that his actions are advancing Orsted's cause, and not a detriment. Rudeus wonders that if his current self fails Orsted on this loop, would his self in future loops also be fooled by Hitogami, causing him to be killed by Orsted. Rudeus wonders if Orsted's kindness towards him is part of a cold calculation to scope him out for subsequent loops.

Chapter 13 : It’s All Right to Be Happy

Rudeus heads back to his home. Zanoba goes there as well to pick up Julie. At the home, Rudeus sees Eris practicing her sword swings. He worries that she is overexerting herself as a pregnant lady. Eris tells Rudeus that she actually gave birth to a baby boy ten days ago. Rudeus has mixed feelings about this; while happy that Eris gave birth to a healthy baby boy, he is disappointed that he missed the delivery. Julie and Zanoba have a happy and emotional reunion, and then leave. Rudeus has a happy and emotional reunion with the rest of his family. He meets his newborn son, Arus. To his whole family, Rudeus tells them about Hitogami and how he and Orsted are fighting Hitogami. He tells his family that Lara might be the savior, why he cooperates with Orsted, and other details. The whole family nods in support. Rudeus feels refreshed, having revealed one of his secrets. The only secret Rudeus now holds is that he is reincarnated from another world.

Rudeus reviews in his mind all the information related to Hitogami so far. In order to reach Hitogami, one must collect eh five treasures held by each of the five Dragon Generals. There is the Mad Chaos Dragon (already dead), Holy Dragon Emperor Szilard (possibly dead), Dark Dragon King Maxwell (possibly dead), Armored Dragon King Perugius, and Demon Dragon King Laplace (who is yet to reincarnate). The resurrection of Laplace is essential in order to get the five treasures. Laplace will be born as a baby. Orsted had originally planned to effortless kill Laplace as a baby. But now that Pax is dead and timeline is changed, Laplace will resurrect in an unknown location. From there, Laplace will gather followers to wage war on humanity. Although Orsted can kill Laplace, this would be tiring for him, which would negatively impact his ability to subsequently fight Hitogami. Therefore, Orsted announced that the current loop is a failure. However, Rudeus did not get the sense that Orsted had completely given up. Rudeus speculates that Orsted may have predicted the current situation. Orsted orchestrated Ariel to become king so that various sequence of events would allow Asura kingdom to survive a crisis 100 years into the future. This crisis is likely the war with the reincarnated Laplace. Rudeus speculates that Orsted planned for the Kingdom of Asura's forces to aid him in fighting Laplace's forces, therefore limiting Orsted's need for magic consumption. Another possibility is Rudeus's existence has disturbed the timeline such that Laplace's rebirth could not be predicted regardless.

From this point on, they will be slightly diverging from the history which Orsted knows. Laplace will be reincarnated in an unknown location. War will occur. If Laplace isn't defeated, Orsted can't reach Hitogami. Hitogami can't be defeated by an Orsted who has been worn down by his fight with Laplace. So, they will follow Zanoba's proposal. Rudeus will gather allies in preparation for a war which will take place in 80 to 100 years. Rudeus acknowledges, he'll likely die before the battle takes place. He will organize the Anti-Hitogami faction, gathering people to defeat Laplace and support Orsted.

Extra Chapter: The Death God and the Gluttonous Prince

In the imperial villa of the King Dragon Realm, Pax is telling Benedict a story about how he single-handedly took over a slave trading ring… or rather, about how his bodyguards did the work for him. Pax feels somewhat guilty about exaggerating his past deeds, but Benedict still thinks his stories are incredible regardless of their authenticity. Given that both of their reputations are the lowest of the low in the imperial villa, nobody else is willing to talk to them, so they have turned to each other for support. However, Pax’s diligence to his body training and studies is slowly but surely improving his image among the others. On their way to Pax’s room, the two smell a bizarre, pungent odor that ever so slightly stimulates their appetites. Going to the training grounds to investigate, the sight that awaits them seems to be straight out of a painting—a skeleton (Randolph) stirring a large pot, with five guards lined up as if awaiting their last meal. Pax demands to know what is going on, and the guards tell him: they didn’t properly secure their general’s saddle, and he fell off his horse during a training exercise. The general, in all his magnanimity, let them go without a punishment, and instead had Randolph treat them to a meal. Among the soldiers, there are rumors that Randolph is an assassin directly serving the general, doing his dirty work by taking out major political enemies. They are convinced that they are about to be executed by poisoning and start begging Pax to save them. While Randolph denies that he has any intention of killing the soldiers, Benedict gives Pax a pleading look, and Pax demands that Randolph serve him a portion first. He predicts that Randolph will back down since poisoning a prince would create an international incident, but Randolph eagerly begins ladling out a serving for him. Insulted, Pax refuses to back down and silently vows to send the King Dragon Realm into chaos from the grave. Randolph places a bowl of purple stew in front of Pax, whose sensory cortex is screaming that the substance in front of him is NOT MEANT TO BE EATEN. Summoning his resolve, Pax swallows a chunk of meat… and finds that it is surprisingly tasty. His tongue starts to go numb, and Pax laments that while he didn’t accomplish anything meaningful in his short life, at least his final act could be something to be proud of. Turning defiant, Pax orders Randolph to give him seconds, claiming that the stew would be wasted on the soldiers’ unrefined taste buds. The soldiers frantically leave the area while giving Pax grateful looks. Benedict also asks for a bowl of stew, and Pax accepts that she probably wouldn’t be able to survive the loneliness that would ensue after he is gone. The two of them finish the entire pot (LN illustration), upon which Pax asks Randolph when the effects will kick in. Randolph responds that they would take effect very soon, and Pax feels as if he is at peace—dying under a blue sky after eating a delicious meal wouldn’t be so bad. Randolph reveals his secret ingredient: sanshoku seeds, which are purple in color, cause tongue numbness, and have a strong sedative effect—perfect for dispelling feelings of frustration, anxiety, or depression. Although Randolph finds it unfortunate that he was unable to help the soldiers relax, he is elated that Pax enjoyed his food and offers to treat him to another meal. Pax agrees, and leaves the area with Benedict.

The flashback ends. Pax and Randolph are looking out over the Shirone Kingdom from the royal castle. Smoke is rising from fires lit all throughout the city, and people are gathering en masse below. Pax tells Randolph that he really thought that he was going to die back then, and Randolph responds that he would rather that Pax had taken that comment to the grave. The two reflect on how that was the beginning of their friendship and how the majority of people gathering below have not accepted Pax as their ruler. Despite becoming king, his only true allies are Benedict and Randolph. Pax entrusts Randolph with teaching his child swordsmanship and cooking in the event that he dies—to give Pax Jr. the best education possible, and to praise him, for Pax knows firsthand the pain of one’s efforts not being acknowledged. Randolph, sensing that Pax intends to kill himself, accepts Pax’s request. While he may not be a true “god of death / shinigami (死神)”, his inherited title is “Death(死) God(神)”, and the Death God before him would always honor a dying person’s last words. As Pax disappears into his bedroom, Randolph closes his eyes, whispering that he would much prefer that Pax didn’t die.

Light Novel Volume 2/Summary
============================

Prologue

He darted through the hallways; his pursuer was a "wild beast". The creature’s terrifying voice rang out as it chased him relentlessly. Its words booming throughout the manor made his legs tremble.

Rudeus
 was fear struck as he hid in the shadows, terrified. The whole scenario started an hour prior.

Chapter 1: The Young Mistress’s Violence

It was evening when Rudeus arrived in the
Citadel of Roa
. The carriage had reached their destination, the liege lord’s gigantic manor. Rudeus was startled by a voice that boomed from outside the reception room. A muscular man about fifty years old stormed in who, after a loud exchange, permitted Rudeus' stay at the manor, and then stormed out of the room the way he came in. The man was
Sauros Boreas Greyrat
, liege lord of the Fittoa region, and also
Paul’s
 uncle – the butler explained to Rudeus. Next, a man appeared in the doorway. He introduced himself –
Philip Boreas Greyrat
, the liege lord’s son. Philip then went on to elaborate about the young mistress Rudeus was about to tutor. Rudeus believed he had a chance to make her listen to him and explained a trick of his to Philip. This "trick" was to pretend to have the
Young Mistress
 kidnapped, with Rudeus helping him escape through his use of magic, reading, arithmetic, etc. to encourage her to want to learn these things on her own. Showing interest in Rudeus’ plan, Philip called the girl.

And so, Rudeus finally met the Young Mistress. Rudeus’ first impression –
fierce
. He was greeted with a strike to the face. Rudeus’ second impression –
violent
. Not waiting for a response, Rudeus slapped her back to make her aware of the pain. But to his surprise, she pinned him down. Rudeus managed to escape, however she came flying at him with the fiercest look Rudeus had ever known. Rudeus, fear struck, broke into a run. This was how she, like a wild beast, chased the terrified Rudeus around the manor.

Exhausted from the pursuit, the Young Mistress eventually gave up and returned to her room. Rudeus decided he won’t give up on this job and teach the violent girl a lesson. He went and asked for Philip’s cooperation on the plan he explained before. Philip, amused to see the result, immediately began preparation.

Chapter 2: All According to Plan?

When Rudeus opened his eyes, he found himself in the middle of a dirty storehouse with the Young Mistress. So far, the plan has been progressing smoothly. All that remained was for him to create a magnificent escape with her using his great intellect. But when one of the “kidnappers” came in to silence the Young Mistress, he was way too violent. There was something wrong, Rudeus came to realize, something went wrong with the plan and they ended up with real kidnappers. Rudeus now had to come up with a plan to escape without attracting trouble. He slipped out of a window he created with the Young Mistress to end up being greeted by an unfamiliar town that wasn’t Roa. Rudeus then made a proper promise with Eris, in order to get her home she must properly hire him, to which she agreed hurriedly.

The next morning, they reached Roa. At the sight of the liege lord’s manor in the distance, they let heir guard down. Suddenly, two men grabbed the Young Mistress and disappeared into the alleyway. Rudeus immediately blocked their escape. His opponents were the two men who previously kidnapped them. Rudeus created an explosion above the buildings to startle the kidnappers. He succeeded in snatching away the Young Mistress from the man holding her. With the Young Mistress in his arms, they were able to get away but, the other man threw his sword at tremendous speed straight at Rudeus. Rudeus froze and thought his life would end there, but right at that moment, someone flew in to deflect the sword – it was
Ghislaine
. She beheaded the men in an instant and the fight ended immediately.

They finally reached the manor and the Young Mistress had regained her spirits. She arrogantly announced she would hire Rudeus as per the promise and allowed him to call her by her name – Eris.

Side Story: The Aftermath and the Boreas Greeting Style

Rudeus learned the one pulling the strings behind the incident was the butler, Thomas. A perverted noble had caught his eyes on Eris and offered him money to kidnap her. The incident was, reportedly, resolved by Ghislaine’s involvement; Philip directed Rudeus to give all the credits to her instead to divert the problems Rudeus would face. As they were talking, Sauros turned towards Rudeus and, on behalf of Eris, asked if he would teach her magic. Rudeus told Sauros that she should learn to ask for the things she wants herself, and so he called her out.

Ordered by her grandfather, Eris stood in front of Rudeus to ask him to teach her magic. Eris, glaring coldly at Rudeus, made her request while imitating a cat-girl. To his shock, Rudeus could not process her behaviours and was scared of what might happen next. She was not cute at the least; not bashful, but she looked angry. Rudeus decided he would need to stop this weird custom before it causes trouble for him down the line. After an effort, the Boreas style of asking for favours was abandoned.

Chapter 3: Her Ferocity, Unabated

It had been a month since Rudeus took up the job of a tutor. Eris proved to be a very violent and a problematic pupil; though she would pay attention to magic classes, she always ran away when it came the time for the other subjects. Anyone who came after her would get punched; Rudeus wasn’t willing to get himself into such a situation.

Finally with the help of his other student, Ghislaine, Eris gave an effort to the other classes. Whenever Eris felt unmotivated Ghislaine recounted stories of her adventurer days, where she would highlight the importance of education in practical situations; Eris listened closely and it would always fire her up. To Rudeus, it seemed Eris very much so wanted to become an adventurer.

Rudeus was progressing well in swordsmanship under Ghislaine’s guidance, more so than he ever could under Paul. He felt a large part of his improvement was thanks to having a rival – Eris. Although she seemed far more gifted with a sword, an opponent of almost equal strength helped him propel up his techniques too.

At the end of each day, Rudeus spent time in his room preparing for the next day’s lessons and finally review his own magic textbook. In such manner, his days as a tutor passed rapidly.

Chapter 4: Staff Meeting and Sunday

Six months had passed and Rudeus organized a staff meeting with Ghislaine and Eris' etiquette teacher,
Edna Leylune
. Before the meeting he convinced Phillip to allow Eris to have one day of per week, and informed Edna of this change as well - effectively giving himself a day off as well with no reduction in pay. On their first day off Rudeus and Eris headed out to the mercantile district where Rudeus visited multiple shops to learn the prices of things he was interested in. Eris laughed at Rudeus for writing down the prices of these items, but when he instructed her on the importance of managing one's own wallet she listened and understood.

Rudeus also learns about the
Armored Dragon King Perugius
 and his impressive involvement of sealing
Laplace
 in the human vs. demon war 400 years ago after Rudeus saw his floating castle,
Chaos Breaker
.

Chapter 5: The Young Miss Turns Ten

Another year had passed in which time Eris became Intermediate-tier in swordplay in addition to her 10th birthday quickly approaching. This meant a large celebration party in which she would be forced to dance, resulting in all her lessons for a couple weeks being etiquette lessons. However, Edna was unable to teach Eris how to dance as she disliked moving to the rhythm of the beat as it was different from her own, but with some help from Rudeus and pretending that each step is dodging a sword attack or feint she was able to at least mimic the dance moves. During the party Rudeus used this same trick to help calm Eris down and prevent her from embarrassing herself. Overall it was a great party and at the end of the night Rudeus invited Ghislaine and Eris to his room where he presented them with their apprentice wands, and they ate food and drank together.

The next morning Rudeus ascends the stairs of the one place in the mansion he was not supposed to go, only to find Sauros getting busy with one of the cat-eared maids. They had a brief conversation in which Sauros says he was praying to an ominous red gem floating in the sky.

Chapter 6: Learning A Foreign Language

Rudeus reads a book giving an overview of this world's history. Around 15,000 years ago there were seven worlds each with their own people, but they all converged onto the current world when the others were all destroyed by an evil Dragon God who was later slain by his own commanders. Since then 3 Great Human-Demon Wars broke out, with the most recent being caused by the Demon God Laplace and his invasion of human territories. It ended when Laplace was sealed by a group of 7 heroes, Dragon King Perugius being one of them. A truce among humans and demons was created where any restrictions on travel for demons to continents primarily inhabited by humans were lifted and the two races can live in peace, on paper. Although in practice the demons are still persecuted in many human dwelling areas.

Rudeus also started to learn another of most common languages in the world, the Beast God tongue, spoken primarily in the nothern part of the Millis Continent where the Beast race has their largest settlement and the Demon God tongue, spoken on the
Demon continent
. After a year Rudeus turned 9 and was able to successfully learn the Beast God tongue from Ghislaine, and he got a reply from Roxy after sending her a letter to help him learn the Demon God tongue including a complete dictionary and notes about each demon race hand made by Roxy. She also told him that
the prince
 she is now tutoring bought a creepily accurate figurine of her, which unknown to her was actually made by Rudeus.

Chapter 7: Absolute Promise

Rudeus turns 10, and successfully learned the Demon God tongue as well as the Fighting God tongue, spoken on the
Begaritt Continent
. He is now only unable to speak the Sky God tongue and the Sea God tongue out of the most common languages. He is also approaching the Intermediate tier in swordplay while Eris had reached the Advanced-tier. Rudeus was also increasing his proficiency with magic through his continued creation of lifelike figurines.

Because Paul was disowned from the Notos Greyrat family another member took over being the head of the household, and would possibly send assassins towards Rudeus if they found out who he was. Because of this Rudeus was unable to have as large a party for his 10th birthday as Eris did, however she organized a surprise party for him where everyone in the manor attended. During the party Rudeus was given a magic staff,
Aqua Heartia
, an extremely expensive magical staff that makes it much easier to cast all types of magic especially water magic. The party ended with just Rudeus and Phillip left, where Phillip explains that he lost the battle to become the head of the Boreas Greyrat family to his older brother James. He has not given up on this dream though, and offered to let Rudeus marry Eris and help him seize control of the Boreas family, saying he would put Eris in Rudeus' bed that very night. Rudeus politely declined, not wanting to get involved in any political machinations.

After Rudeus left to return to his room he found Eris sitting there wearing a negligee, and told him she was there to keep him company since she thought he must be lonely and that today was a special day. Because of that she let him grope her a little bit, but Rudeus pushed too far causing her to get mad and beat him up. After a couple minutes she returned and promised him that in 5 years after he turned 15 that she would go all the way with him.

Chapter 8: The Turning Point

Roxy leaves her position as royal court magician and personal tutor of the 7th prince of the Shirone kingdom after he student turned 15 according to her original contract. She also did this in order to find out what was going on in the Fitoa Region due to the strange colors of the sky.
Dragon God Orsted
, Perugius,
Sword God Gal Falion
 and Demon Emperor
Kishirika Kishurisu
 also all noticed this disturbance in the sky, with Perugius sending out one of his 12 familiar,
Almanfi
 to investigate. This lead to Almanfi nearly killing Rudeus due to mistakenly thinking he was the one causing the disturbance when he was merely trying to show Ghislaine and Eris his Saint tier water magic. Before they could talk about what was going on a bright light enveloped the entire sky causing the entire Fittoa region and all its people to disappear.

Epilogue

Six months later Roxy arrived at the Fittoa region only to see for herself that the entire settlement truly was gone, and next to nothing was left of what used to be there being merely a field of grass now. Roxy learned that a mana calamity occured causing all residents of the Fittoa region to be teleported to random location all across the world. Many are still completely missing. Paul left a note saying that he has a search team of adventurers in the Millis continent searching for anyone affected by the calamity including Zenith, Lilia, and Aisha who are still missing, while Norn is with Paul, and that since he knows Rudeus is capable he will be searching for him last. Roxy made up her mind to help search for Rudeus and inform him of what happened by finding a search party and heading to either the Begaritt or Demon Continent.

Extra Chapter: The Forest Goddess

A side story about Ghislaine being teleported in the middle of the Ejin Forest in the middle of the Central Continent's Conflict Zone. There was a battle going on there where the newly formed Markien Mercenary Country was being surrounded by both the Dikuto Kingdom and the Broze Empire in their alliance to take down the new threat, and the Markien Mercenary Country staked their victory on one final ploy to send out 10 of their soldiers through the forest, which was known to be extremely dangerous so no one entered it, to assassinate the Dikuto Kingdom's king while dressed in the uniforms of the Broze Empire. This resulted in the company of 10 being saved by Ghislaine who was teleported there, and who assisted them in slaughtering their way through the Dikuto Kingdom base and eventually killing their king. Right before his death he ordered his army to break the alliance and attack the Broze Empire, thinking it was them who started it, allowing the Markien Mercenary Country to take advantage of the situation and beat both countries with their meager remaining army. This caused the leader of the company of 10 to create a good luck charm of Ghislaine's figure, with all his men following suit causing "Laine" to become the Markien Mercenary Country's Goddess of Protection lasting more than 100 years, all without her knowledge.

Summary

Chapter 1: Plans for the Future and Cliff's Concerns

Rudeus reviews his discussion with Orsted where they came up with 3 courses of action. The first is to use the Rude Mercenary Company for intelligence gathering. The second is to make connections with influential people with political power and warn them of the war that will occur in 80 years. Examples include Ariel, the next queen of Asura Kingdom and Cliff, the grandson of the Pope of the Milis religious order. The third is to gather warriors who will help Orsted to fight Laplace in his place. They plan to gather those whose fate is already to fight Laplace and who won't easily become Hitogami's disciple, such as Ogre God, Dwarf God, disciples of Water God Style and Sword God Style, North God Karuman III, Death God Randolph, and Ruijerd. Rudeus considers the fact that Hitogami will likely try to influence people within Rudeus's organization and disrupt their plans. Rudeus reasons that since Hitogami is limited only 3 disciples, the plan is to have a large enough organization that the effect of 1 or 2 betrayals doesn't cause significant disruption to their plans. Rudeus brings up with Orsted the need for a method of communication when they are separated. Orsted suggests creating a device similar to the Seven Great World Powers stone monuments and adventurer guild cards. Orsted intends to build the communication device himself. Lastly, Rudeus wants a method for transporting his Magic Armor Mark 1, which is quite bulky. He plans to use summoning magic, but he is currently unable to summon inorganic matter. Rudeus hopes that with some practice, he will be able to do this.

Rudeus visits Cliff. Cliff and Elinalise were having sex earlier in the day, when Rudeus tries to visit. Cliff has a haggard appearance when he greets Rudeus, which has been the case since his child was born. Elinalise greets Rudeus while breastfeeding her baby. Cliff reveals that he has received a letter from his grandfather in Milis. The letter expresses how the grandfather cares for Cliff's well-being and looks forward to Cliff's return; the letter also warns Cliff that there is conflict within the Milis religious order and that Cliff should prepare himself for this if he should return. Cliff indicates that his initial intention was to return to Milis after graduating and that he was prepared to deal with the scheming within the Milis religious order. However, now that Cliff has a family, he is concerned for the well being of his son Clive, as the Milis religious order readily targets the weak and Cliff isn't confident that he can protect his son. Furthermore, Cliff's grandfather is still unaware that Cliff has married an elf and Cliff worries about the scandal this might trigger, as some factions of the Milis religion persecute anyone who isn't human. Therefore, Cliff is conflicted. On one hand, he wants to return home, but on the other, he realizes that he would be exposing his wife and child to danger, and because of his wife's elf heritage, his grandfather might be put in danger as well. Rudeus doesn't know what the right decision is, either. Rudeus offers for Cliff to join Orsted's faction. Cliff would receive Rudeus' and Orsted's support and protect Cliff's family. In return, Cliff would prepare for Laplace's revival. Rudeus explains the plan in detail to Cliff and about their plan to prepare for the battle with Laplace 80 years in the future. Rudeus feels he's offering Cliff a good deal. Cliff asks for more time to think about the offer. Although Rudeus is confused as to why Cliff doesn't agree right away, he respects the request for more time to decide. Cliff plans to give Rudeus an answer at the graduation ceremony, which is in 2 months.

Chapter 2: The Zanoba Store

Rudeus visits Zanoba. As Zanoba is no longer a prince, he has sold off his royal possessions to raise money and bought a house near Rudeus. He lives there with Ginger and Julie. Rudeus pays Zanoba a salary for research and development on the magic armor. Rudeus enters Zanoba's home, to find Zanoba and Julie making dolls together. Rudeus asks Zanoba to resume their project to produce and sell Ruijerd dolls. Rudeus hopes that this will allow him to more easily find Ruijerd, partly so that he can recruit Ruijerd in the fight against Laplace, and partly to simply meet Ruijerd again. Another motivation for resuming the production of the figures is to draw in craftsmen, who may also have ideas for improving the Magic Armor, whose development has stalled. Zanoba and Julie agree to start mass producing Ruijerd figures.

Chapter 3: Cliff and the Institute of Magic Student Council

Cliff visits the staff at the university and submits his thesis, "Tools that suppress curses". The staff at Ranoa University are enthusiastic. They feel this research is going to be recorded in the history books. However, the top graduates are already decided and so although his thesis was the best of that season, Cliff will not be recognized as a top graduate. Cliff doesn't mind this. In the past, he may have thrown a tantrum, but over the years he has changed and no longer feels the need to have the title of the top graduate. Still, Cliff is dissatisfied because his thesis is only on "Suppression" and not "Removal",

He wants to return to Milis, but he doesn't want to endanger his family. He thinks on Rudeus's proposal of join Orsted, He knows that almost all his growth was thanks to Rudeus, but for some reason he doesn't like this fact. He never doubted that he himself was a genius, but when he says that phrase, he feels better about himself.

When he leaving the university, he finds Norn and the student council in a discussion over a Wraith who was draining the mana of the students. Norn is conflicted, as there aren't any adventurers or priests available with exorcism magic to defeat the monster, but she doesn't want to ask her brother for help. Cliff decides to help Norn. Together with the student council, they go to the basement warehouse. This warehouse has several relics. Due to a cleaning proposed by Norn, someone possibly destroyed the old seal which sealed the Wraith. The group finds the wraith and start to fight. The wraith controls various skeletons, whose skill is proportional to the skill of the person while they were alive. The student council group starts to fall apart. Cliff uses his magic eye, finds the weak point of the wraith and defeat the wraith with his magic. They discover that the wraith was born because hundreds of years ago, a teacher locked some students in a room, who ended up dying. The teacher then sealed the room.

Cliff and the student council make an honorary funeral for the deceased students. Cliff asks Norn why she didn't ask Rudeus for help. She answers that she wanted to do everything by herself, as much as possible. They then talk about their future plans. Cliff asks Norn if she will ask Rudeus for help in the future. She responds that she wants to use the knowledge that she's gained at school and to see her own limits. Cliff thanks Norn and in turn, she also thanks Cliff for helping her for all those years.

Lying in his bed at night, Cliff sees the face of Elinalize, and remembers when he first met her. Although she was different than what he expected, she also was more beautiful than expected. They talk and Cliff decides to walk with his own feet and to only ask for Rudeus's help only if necessary, as he don't want to grow dependent.

Chapter 4: Cliff and Zanoba's Graduation Ceremony

In the two months before the graduation ceremony, Rudeus and Zanoba worked on setting up their first store front. They were supported with advice from a member of their mercenary group, who used to own a store but failed. Rudeus reflects on how he was hesitant to accept advice from someone who failed, but decided to give him a chance. They set up their shop as a small warehouse in the outskirts of the workshop district. The small warehouse has enough room to carry their inventory, and it has an associated store front.

At the graduation ceremony, Cliff and Zanoba are lined up with the rest of the graduates. Zanoba was allowed to graduate despite recently dropping out, since he's a special student and Vice Principal Jinas was accommodating. There are about 500 graduates. The student council, led by Norn, are present as well. Brooklyn von Eruzais, a graduate from the royalty of Neris Dukedome, was recognized at the ceremony as a Graduate representative. Rudeus sees Cliff, who has a listless face. Rudeus notes that Cliff in the past would have been angry at not being chosen as representative. After all, Cliff's achievements at Ranoa overshadows all the other graduates. He achieved advanced rank in all four attack magics, advance rank in healing magic, advanced rank in detoxification magic, intermediate rank barrier magic, and advanced rank exorcism magic. On top of that, there is his thesis on suppressing curses. Rudeus looks closer at Cliff''s face and recognizes that he looks troubled. Rudeus speculates that this is because Cliff still hasn't decided on whether to accept Rudeus's offer to join Orsted.

After the graduation ceremony, Rudeus meets with Zanoba and congratulates him. Zanoba notes that although he thought the graduation ceremony would be just an annoyance, he actually enjoyed it. The graduation representative, Brooklyn von Eruzais, introduces himself to Rudeus and challenges him to a duel. Brooklyn acknowledges that he was only recognized as a graduation representative due to his family's influence and that his test results were always second to Cliff. Brooklyn has wanted to test his strength against Rudeus ever since he defeated Badigadi in one hit. Brooklyn explains that when he returns to his home country, he will inherit a position where he is responsible for his subordinates and so will not have the opportunity to test his own strength at his own convenience. Rudeus agrees to the duel.

Rudeus easily defeats Brooklyn. Brooklyn seems to have know this was how it was going to go, and graciously accepts his loss. Other graduates then gather and challenge Rudeus to duels as well. After that, Rudeus dueled with about 20 people. They all left feeling satisfied. The duels weren't tiring for Rudeus, but Zanoba, who was the referee, was tired. They then go meet with Elinalise and Cliff, who were watching the duels from the rooftop. Rudeus congratulates Cliff on his graduation. Rudeus asks Cliff what his plans are. Cliff states that he will stay with his family for the next year, at least until Clive stops breastfeeding. As it takes two years to travel from Sharia to the Holy Land of Milis, Cliff wants to return home two years after graduation, as he feels obligated by a sense of duty. Cliff plans to use the teleportation circles to shorten the travel time. In terms of joining Orsted's company, Cliff declines for now. He wishes to climb the ranks of the Milis order with his own strength, without Orsted's support. Rudeus understands. Rudeus is reminded of the people who challenged him to a duel earlier. It is the desire to test one's own ability. Once he stands at the top of the Milis order, Cliff will become Rudeus and Orsted's associate. After one year, Cliff will leave his family behind for an indeterminate period of time, until he is at the top. Although not happy, Elinalise has accepted Cliff's decision. Rudeus is conflicted. By respecting Cliff's decision, Rudeus risks having Cliff being in a position where he will be murdered, meaning that he will lose his connection to the Holy Milis Kingdom as well as the person best at studying curses. But Rudeus also acknowledges that by allowing him to struggle alone, this may spur personal growth in Cliff. Rudeus decides to respect Cliff's decision. Rudeus thinks to himself that it may be three years before Cliff rejoins them. In the meantime, Rudeus plans to get in touch with Ariel, and increase their mercenary force. Cliff and Rudeus finish their serious conversation. They all go celebrate Cliff and Zanoba's graduation.

Interlude: A Country Bumpkin Visits the City

Nina Farion, from the Holy Land of the Sword, receives a letter. She can read the fact that it comes from Isolte, but she lacks the literacy to read the letter's contents. Illiteracy is not uncommon in the Holy Land of the Sword. She finds someone educated to read the letter for her. The letters contents summarized the events over the last few years. Reida has died and Isolte has taken over the dojo. The coronation for Ariel will occur soon. There is a festival for one month before and after the coronation. Isolte invites Nina to come for the celebration. Nina immediately decides to go.

Arus, the capital of Asura Kingdom, is full of people who have come for the coronation. This is more people than Nina had ever seen before. She also learns that people are also here for the White Knight parade.

Nina meets a merchant. She learns about certain streets that are less crowded. Seeing that she is unable to read, the merchant offers to sell her a picture book and doll; the end of the book has a section for helping one to learn the characters. Nina reluctantly accepts. Nina notes that the doll is of the Supard race.

Nina sees Eris along with Rudeus and Lucy. Nina is shocked at the fact that Eris, who was regarded as a “beast” and “mad dog”, could get married and raise a family. Though not visible to Nina, Roxy, Sylphy, Zanoba, and Julie were nearby as well.

Nina decided against meeting with Eris and instead went to Isolte’s dojo. Nina meets Isolte and her disciples. Nina will be staying at Isolte’s home while in Asura. Isolte shows Nina their home. Nina is relieved at the fact that Isolte doesn’t seem to have a partner.

Isolte invites Nina to a small gathering. Nina agrees to go. Nina soon regrets accepting the invitation when she is forced to change into a dress and is led to a large mansion and realizes that the “small gathering” is actually a large party for nobles.

At the party, Nina goes to the bathroom, but then gets lost. She wanders the venue and sees a room with Ariel and Rudeus inside. She catches glimpses of their conversation and suspects that Rudeus is blackmaililng Ariel for sex. Nina intends to kill Rudeus and save Ariel. Before she does that, she notices Eris standing behinid her. Nina considers her chances of beating both Eris and Rudeus. Ariel and Rudeus then leave the room and greet Nina and Eris. Nina quickly realizes that Ariel wasn’t being threatened. Ariel explains that she was just negotiating with Rudeus. Ariel realizes that Nina was just trying to help her, and so Ariel thanks Nina and introduces herself. Ariel explains that this party was organized by herself and Rudeus.

At the party, Rudeus recruits allies for Orsted. He asks the party attendees to lend their forces to Orsted approximately 80 years in the future, when a certain person wakes up. Nina, like the other attendees, are puzzled by this request, but nevertheless nod and agree.

After the party, Nina was told to stay behind at the venue. Eris informs her and Isolte that this mansion, the party venue, has been gifted to Rudeus by Ariel. The three women, Nina, Eris, and Isolte talk to each other. Speaking with her friends as a group, Nina is reminded of the old days when they trained together.

In the time before Ariel’s coronation, Nina explores the city with Isolte and Eris. After the coronation, Nina returns to the Land of the Holy Sword. She reflects on her visit to Asura Kingdom. She had agreed to join Orsted’s camp for the war in 80 years. She thought of the uncharacteristically happy Eris and how she married Rudeus. On arriving back home, she is greeted by her cousin Jino Britts. Upon seeing him, Nina asks Jino if they want to get married. Within a few months, they got married.

Interlude: Coming-of-Age Ceremony

Norn is doing well as student council president. She is quite popular as president. She is progressing in her magic and swordsmanship. The Rudo Mercenary company is doing well, with Aisha, Linia, and Pursena in charge.

Norn and Aisha's 15th birthday is approaching. The 15th birthday is especially important as it marks becoming an adult.

Rudeus initially plans on throwing a big party, but Roxy points out that Norn would likely prefer a smaller event. Rudeus then tries to plan the party in secret with the rest of the family, but it is pointed out that the party doesn't have to be a surprise and there's no reason to keep the planning process a secret.

The family discusses their plans regarding gifts. Lilia plans to give Norn a handkerchief, and Aisha an apron. Sylphy plans to give Norn a book, and Aisha a quill pen. Roxy plans to give Norn custom-made armor, and Aisha a trowel (magic tool) for gardening. Eris plans to give Norn a sword belt, and Aisha a normal belt. Rudeus plans to give Norn a figurine of Paul, but is unsure of his gift for Aisha. The rest of the family assure Rudeus that Aisha will likely enjoy whatever gift he provides.

Norn was delighted about the birthday party. Aisha had a surprised expression and muttered "I see, so I'm an adult now...".

On the day of the event, Aisha and Norn went to the mercenary office and school respectively, as usual. Aisha returns from the office. She received birthday congratulations, but no gifts as the Beast race do not have this custom. Aisha asks to watch the party preparations. She just watches patiently. Rudeus wonders what she is thinking about. Possibly about what it means to be an adult, or possibly just judging their skills. The food and decoration preparations are then completed. Norn returns home, carrying lots of gifts.

The party begins with Rudeus giving a short speech. He speaks of what it means to be an adult, such as being responsible, continuing to learn, and to have a goal. Lila then gave a speech about when Paul and Zenith were young, and when Norn and Aisha were born. The gifts were then presented. Norn was happy to receive her gifts. Upon receiving her gifts, Aisha also was outwardly joyful, but Rudeus wonders if her smiles are fake. For his gift to Aisha, Rudeus gives her a Migurd pedant, a replica similar to one given to him by Ruijerd. Aisha thanks Rudeus. She didn’t show her “happy face”. She had a blank expression, as if thinking deeply.

After opening the presents, the family enjoyed dinner and the cake. More students then stopped by with gifts for Norn. Linia and Pursena, along with their mercenary group members, then stopped by, having brought along a recently killed wild boar as a gift. Their group wishes Aisha a happy birthday. Aisha accepts their gift and congratulations with a genuine laugh and smile. The wild boar was put on a fire to roast. Everyone enjoyed the feast, with the Beast Race from the mercenary company and stray students joining in. The party eventually ended and everyone left. Aisha muses to herself about what it means to be an adult. She still doesn’t know what it means, but admits that it doesn’t seem unpleasant. Rudeus replies that he doesn’t know the answer either.

Chapter 5: Growth and New Horizons

Rudeus has discovered how to effectively summon his magic armor by using bidirectional magic circles. Orsted has made progress on a communication device. Although not a telephone, it is a lithographic communication device. Anything drawn on the main lithograph is copied onto the sub lithograph. However, the device is heavy and consumes significant magic power so it works best as a stationary device. The first pair has been installed in Orsted's office and one of Ariel's private rooms.

In terms of Rudeus's children, Lucy is now 5 years old. She learns magic from Sylphy and Roxy and learns to swing a stick with Eris. As an older sister, she also gives attention to her younger siblings Lara and Arus. Lara, the future messiah, is now 2 years old. Sacred Beast Leo continues to always be by her side. Arus is now 1 year old. He loves breasts. He smiles with delight whenever he is held and pressed against a female chest. Whenever Rudeus holds him, however, he cries.

After Rudeus's graduation, they go to a tavern to celebrate Cliff's farewell party. Cliff plans to set off on his own to Milis and climb the ranks on his own. Once becoming an executive officer, Cliff plans to return for Elinalize and his son Clive. After the party, Elinalize pulls Rudeus aside and asks him to go to Milis to support Cliff. Although Rudeus previously promised Cliff that he wouldn't help him, Rudeus agrees with Elinalize that Cliff would likely require his help. Rudeus decides to go to Milis.

Rudeus returns home to Aisha, Norn, and Lilia who were already at home. They have received a letter from Claire Latreia, Zenith's mother. The letter was a response to Rudeus's letter which was sent five years ago, which reported Zenith's illness. The letter commands Rudeus to bring Zenith back to Milis, as well as Norn and Aisha. Rudeus is initially surprised by the delayed response, but then remembers that it would take at least two years for mail to travel each way to Milis. Aisha and Norn indicate with their facial expressions that Claire is an unpleasant person to deal with. Rudeus was already planning to go to Milis, so he states that he will go and bring Zenith. Aisha protests that she was planning to set up a mercenary group and Zanoba shop in King Dragon Kingdom. Rudeus replies that he feels that their priorities should shift to Milis, having received this letter. Norn outright refuses to go, as she wants to finish school. Rudeus asks if Aisha would accompany him and Zenith to Milis, where she can set up a mercenary group there. Rudeus tells Aisha that she does not have to meet her grandmother. Aisha therefore happily agrees to go to Milis. Lilia also agrees to accompany them to Milis. Rudeus wonders if Lilia is also reluctant to meet Claire, as Claire is likely an adherent of the Milis faith, which doesn't look favorably on polygamous marriages. They agree to set of dd in about one month. Reflecting back on Norn and Aisha's reaction to their grandmother Claire, Rudeus wonders what kind of person she is.

Aisha starts preparing the paperwork she will need to set up a mercenary group in Milis. Cliff was informed that Rudeus would also be heading to Milis, given the letter he received from Claire Latreia. Cliff didn't hate the idea of Rudeus coming along and in fact was relieved. So, Rudeus,   Lilia, Aisha, and Zenith will be heading to Milis, in addition to Cliff. Sylphy is staying home to manage the kids and housework. Roxy is staying home as well due to poor relations between the Demon race and the Milis kingdom. Eris was prepared to go, but Lilia strongly advised her not to go, as Claire is a "finicky individual" and would likely not get along well with Eris.

Just as the group were ready to leave, it was discovered that Sylphy was pregnant.

Chapter 6: Onward, to Millishion...

Sylphy is pregnant. In the past, Rudeus notes that he would have deliberated on whether to depart on the business trip. Rudeus runs around the garden with glee. Lilia, in contrast, is panicking. She is torn between staying to support Sylphy and with accompanying Zenith to Milis. While Sylphy does several supports, in the form of Roxy, Eris, and Elinalize, she also has three young children to look after as well. Rudeus debates staying home while Sylphy is pregnant, to prioritize his family over work. Zenith then suddenly grabs Lila's hand and leads them to Sylphy, placing Lila's hand on Sylphy's shoulder. It was as if Zenith was trying to ask Lilia to look after Sylphy, and trying to say that she would be alright on her own, so Lilia should stay behind. Lilia therefore agrees to stay home and asks Aisha to take care of Zenith in her place.

They head off. Rudeus brings the lithograph for communication. He also brings a summoning scroll for the mark 1 armor. He wears the mark 2b armor. Over the past month, Rudeus has heard a lot about Claire Latreia. In summary, she's extremely stubborn and strict. From Norn, her only memories of Claire are of Claire getting angry at her for not doing well enough in her studies. From Aisha, she was scolded by Claire for doing better than Norn. As per Lilia, Claire is someone who values lineage and the Milis doctrine. Rudeus is not worried, however, as Claire's description reminds him of Sauros Boreas Greyrat. He reasons that as long as he is civil, that he will be fine. Rudeus asks Cliff about the House Latreia as well. Cliff states that his house Grimoire and House Latreia are enemies. House Grimoire is pro magic race, while House Latreia is anti magic race. House Latreia also has produced several members of the Temple Knights. Cliff muses that with Rudeus's connection to House Latreia, that he will not eventually become his enemy. Rudeus reassures Cliff that he has no intention of being his enemy. They joke that one of Rudeus's kids can marry Cliff's kid, Clive, to solidify their friendship.

They use the teleportation circle in Orsted's office, which brings them to a forest approximately 7 days of travel outside of Milis. They buy a horse carriage at a city and arrive uneventfully at the capital of Holy Milis country, Milishion.

Chapter 7: Cliff's Homecoming

They arrive at the capital city of Milis, Milishion. Rudeus is amazed at the beautiful white palace. Cliff agrees, but wonders if the people who run it from the inside are "dirty", sleazy and unethical. They decide to take a carriage to Cliff's family's estate. After 10 years, Cliff has returned to Milishion.

They enter through the Adventurer's district. They see lots of people of different races. They then see Gisu.

Gisu is very happy to see the group. He tells them what happened when they parted in Sharia. Gisu, Talhand, Vera, and Shera arrived on schedule in Asura Kingdom. There, they sold the magic stones for a fortune. Vera and Shera retired from being adventurers with their share and returned to their home town. Gisu lost all his money to gambling and sank into debt. Talhand, seeing Gisu's terrible state of debt, sold off his magic gauntlets, which took his entire fortune to produce, to pay off Gisu's debts. Rudeus notes that they must have been very good friends for Talhand to help Gisu to that extent. Together, Talhand and Gisu traveled back to Milis. From here, Talhand returned to his hometown, leaving Gisu alone. Gisu has returned to adventuring.

Before entering the religious district, Gisu says his farewells and leaves on his own once again. As suddenly as he appeared, he suddenly departed. Before leaving, he asks Rudeus if he remembers Paul's words while they were in the labyrinth. Rudeus remembers.

They arrive at Cliff's house by sundown. To Rudeus's surprise, it is just an ordinary single family home as opposed to a large mansion. Cliff explains that his grandfather, the Pope, has a room at the headquarters, so this house isn't used. As it is already late, Cliff invites Rudeus and his group stay at his home, which Rudeus accepts. They enter the house and find the place very dusty. Rudeus volunteers Aisha to help with the cleaning, to Aisha's disgust. As a group, they clean the house and then have dinner.

Rudeus, Aisha, and Zenith all sleep in the guest room. Rudeus asks Aisha if she wants to be his maid for the foreseeable future, as Lilia wishes. Aisha is not sure. They briefly discuss who Aisha's future love interest could be. They plan to go to the Latreia house tomorrow. Aisha says that she will go as well, despite her dislike of Claire, to fulfill her promise to Lilia.

Chapter 8: The House of Latria

They enter the Latreia residence. Rudeus marvels at how large the house is. The guards immediately hurry towards the mansion the moment they see Zenith. Aisha again reminds Rudeus of the fact that their grandmother, Claire Latreia, is an extremely unpleasant person. Rudeus nevertheless feels that he will be OK as he has experience dealing with unpleasant people.

Their group is welcomed into the home. They wait for Claire in the drawing room. Rudeus notes that Aisha is dressed as a servant with her usual frilly dress. Rudeus invites Aisha to sit while they wait and Aisha hesitates, but reluctantly agrees.

An old woman, who Rudeus quickly identifies as Claire, enters the room. Rudeus stands to greet her, but is ignored. Claire is accompanied by Andel, who introduces himself to Rudeus as their family physician. Claire then reprimands Aisha for sitting down, as she labels Aisha as merely a maid. Rudeus quickly tries to defend Aisha, explaining that he told Aisha to sit down, and that Aisha is his sister and should not be treated as a maid. Claire responds people are identified based on their clothes and that those wearing a maid uniform will be treated as a maid. Rudeus asks why he was initially ignored. Claire ignored him as she couldn’t rule out the possibility that he was an imposter, and judged it best to not reply to his greeting. Claire acknowledges that Zenith is real and that she remembers Aisha. She asks Rudeus to prove that he is his grandson. Rudeus states that the fact that he has brought Zenith and Aisha and has her letter is proof enough. Claire’s eyebrows twitch. She responds that she is then not able to recognize him as a member of Latreia. Rudeus counter that that he is one of the heads of the Greyrat family and has no need to be recognized as being a part of the Latreia family. He explains that he has close ties with Queen Ariel and that he is a subordinate to Orsted the Dragon God. Seemingly acknowledging his social standing, Claire apologizes for her earlier impoliteness and properly introduces herself as Claire Latreia, wife of the battalion chief of the Temple knight party. Likewise, Rudeus gives himself a proper introduction to Claire.

They all take a seat and have tea. Rudeus invites Aisha to sit as well. Claire’s eyebrows twitch, but she does not protest. Zenith is being examined by the physician. Rudeus apologizes for being unable to cure Zenith. Claire dismissively replies that a village such as Rudeus’s hometown would likely have limited means to treat curses. Rudeus counters that he has actually had significant access to expertise in healing magic, through the healers in Sharia as well as through the help of both Orsted and Perugius. Claire doesn’t believe that Rudeus knows Perugius. She then abruptly changes the subject and asks how Norn is doing. Rudeus explains that she is enrolled in Ranoa Magic university, and that she was left behind so that her studies wouldn’t be affected. Rudeus tells Claire that Norn is doing well in her studies and is student council president, to Claire’s surprise. Claire then commands Rudeus to bring Norn to Milis after her graduation, so that Claire can find a partner for Norn to marry. Claire makes clear that the person that Norn marries is ultimately Claire’s decision, as the head of the family. Rudeus reflects on how the warnings were true about Claire being unpleasant.

The doctor finishes his examination of Zenith. He notes how Zenith’s body is healthy, and that she appears younger than her actual age. The doctor then asks Rudeus and Aisha various questions such as about Zenith’s diet, day to day activities, physical, and mental health. He tells Claire that he sees no issues with Zenith and that even her mind seems stable. Claire asks if Zenith can give birth to more children, which the doctor confirms is possible. Rudeus jokes that he feels they are planning his mother’s second marriage. Claire gives him a cold look. She states that in Milis, a woman’s worth is dependent on her ability to give birth.

Claire then abruptly changes the subject again and tells Rudeus to cut ties with the Priest of the Pope’s faction. She is aware of his friendship with Cliff. The Latreia have started to associate with the Cardinal’s faction, who wish to ostracize the demon race. Simply not supporting the Pope’s faction is not enough, Claire commands that Rudeus cut all ties with anybody associated with the Pope’s faction. Rudeus asks if he at least remain friends with Cliff. Claire refuses. She states that if he continues to associate with the Pope’s faction, he will not be permitted to stay in the Latreia house. Rudeus feels the situation is hopeless and tries to calm himself. He rationalizes to himself that he knew Claire had a difficult personality and that he knew his friendship with Cliff could cause problems with his relationship with Claire.

Claire commands Rudeus to leave Zenith here and to depart. Referring to Zenith, she announces that as long as “this thing” can give birth, Zenith can be married off. Claire intends to marry her off to the nobility of the Cardinal faction. Claire notes that Zenith’s healthy body is a blessing in disguise. Rudeus is livid at hearing these words from Claire, at how she treats her own daughter like an object.

Rudeus is not able to remember what happens next. He remembers shouting loudly, grabbing Zenith and quickly leaving the Latreia residence, easily pushing any guards aside with magic. He soon finds himself at the border of the holy district. When Rudeus’s anger settles down, he is comforted by Aisha with a hug. Aisha muses that they weren’t able to make a connection with the Latreia house for their mercenary company. Rudeus had almost forgot about this. He announces that he doesn’t want Claire’s assistance anyway. Rudeus decides to try to make connections with Cliff’s faction instead. It is now late, so they decide to once again lodge at Cliff’s house.

Chapter 9: Headquarters of the Millis Church

Rudeus returns to Cliff’s house. He sees Cliff hugging an unfamiliar woman. Rudeus initially assumes that Cliff is cheating on Elinalize. Cliff asks Rudeus why he has returned, as Rudeus had initially planned to stay at the Latreia house. Rudeus recounts his visit to the Latreia house and his meeting with Claire. Cliff tries to get Rudeus to consider the situation from Claire’s perspective. He has Rudeus consider that by marrying Zenith to nobility, she will be able to receive assistance. Rudeus acknowledges to himself that he didn’t consider this. Cliff offers Rudeus to stay at his home. Rudeus considers sending Zenith back to Sharia, to protect her from the Latreia. But Cliff suggests that it would be a pity to send her back so soon after finally returning to her hometown. Rudeus agrees that its reasonable to least let Zenith visit her hometown before heading back to Sharia.

Cliff introduces Wendy, the unfamiliar woman. She is a childhood friend of his, from when they lived together in the orphanage. She was hired to do housework at Cliff’s place (???).

Rudeus asks Aisha of her opinion on whether he should send Zenith back to Sharia at once, or to stay for a short while to let her visit her hometown. Cliff confirms that he feels his house will be safe from the Latreia. They ultimately feel that the chance of being harassed by the Latreia is low, and that they will remain in Cliff’s house. Cliff offers for Rudeus to meet his grandfather and make connections with his faction. Rudeus agrees.

The next day, they go to the Milis Church Headquarters. Rudeus is stopped at the entrance as he doesn’t have a license to enter, although Cliff does. Cliff enters and promises Rudeus he will make a temporary license for him. Rudeus decides to stroll around the grounds outside the building. Rudeus admires the Saraku flowers, a plant with pink colored flowers that bloom at the beginning of spring. He then sees a plump young lady with a frill dress. She is surrounded by 7 men who shower her with praise and address her as Miko-sama. They are wearing armor and Rudeus estimates that they are at least Advanced rank in sword play. The men turn towards Rudeus and ask if he is a follower of the Milis faith. When he doesn’t answer immediately, they unsheathe their swords and point it at him. They accuse Rudeus of being an infidel and heretic. Rudeus tries to apologize. They then decide to kill him. Rudeus continues to try to de-escalate as he doesn’t want to cause a scene and ruin the beautiful garden. Rudeus prepares his magic for combat when a female knight interrupts to ask what is happening. The men address her as captain and claims that Rudeus was inflicting danger to Miko. Rudeus retorts that this is a lie. The female knight then recognizes Rudeus and warmly welcomes Rudeus. The woman is Therese Latreia, Zenith’s younger sister and Rudeus’s aunt. The person who assisted Rudeus during his voyage from the Milis Continent to the Central Continent many years ago. Therese is the leader of these men. On her command, the men quickly withdrew their swords.

Rudeus chats with Therese. Rudeus tells her about his meeting with Claire. Therese tries to defend Claire, saying that there might have been a misunderstanding. Therese is in high spirits. She asks Rudeus how Eris is doing and learns that they are now married with a child. Therese is currently the Miko’s escort and manages these men. The Miko then joins the conversation. Rudeus introduces himself as Dragon God Orsted’s subordinate and as Eris’s husband. It turns out that Eris was the one that saved the Miko’s life over 10 years ago, when she set out to exterminate Goblins but ended up stopping an assassination. The Miko thanks Orsted for ultimately saving her life. But Rudeus clarifies that he and Eris actually didn’t know Orsted 10 years ago. But if she feels a sense of debt toward Orsted, Orsted would be able to express his appreciation in the future. Rudeus explains that Orsted has a curse that makes people hate him. The Miko stares at him and confirms he is telling the truth. She reveals that this is her power as a Miko. Rudeus asks her if Hitogami has appeared in her dreams. She denies that this has ever occurred and states it can never happen. Rudeus believes her and wonders if it may be somehow related to her power. The Miko then asks Rudeus to tell her more about Eris. Rudeus agrees but before he can do so, he is interrupted by Cliff calling out for him, presumably having attained a license for him. Rudeus and the Miko and her entourage part ways. They promise to meet again to talk about Eris. Rudeus entrusts a message to Therese to pass to Claire, that he will “carry the responsibility for my mother’s problem so interference is futile”. Therese agrees to pass on the message.

Chapter 10: The Pope, and...

Just before entry Rudeus was thoroughly scanned for any weapons. The church was designed like a maze. It was designed to defend against enemy invasions similar to a castle. Cliff guided Rudeus smoothly. He states that Rudeus can't use Magic here as it was guarded by a barrier of Saint or King tier.Cliff's grandfather, Harry Grimoire(Pope) had the appearance of a gentle old man with a magnanimous heart. Cliff introduces Rudeus, but the Pope had already done his fair share of research about his life and purpose for coming here. When Rudeus was in the middle of processing why the Pope knew so much about him, he didn't even react to him. This led the Pope to believe that Rudeus was a badass and capable of being called the right hand of Orsted. The Pope told about everything he knew about Rudeus from where he was born to how he ended up here. Rudeus corrected him about some details like how he was tutored by Roxy and also about how some of his fights were helped by his friends and that he didn't do everything alone. The Pope considered Rudeus to be quite honest.

The purpose of Rudeus for being here were mainly: 1. To Establish the Rudo Mercenary Group in Milis. 2. To get permission to sell the Superd figures. 3. To form an alliance with Orsted for the future. The Pope wanted Rudeus to make his intentions clear. Did he befriend Cliff to get these things and would he support Cliff from here on out? To which Rudeus stated that he wanted to help Cliff because of his request to let him grow on his own. Rudeus would abstain from doing anything to support Cliff unless he wanted him to until Cliff became a Strong Figure in Milis. The Pope was quite happy from Rudeus's answer as he thought Cliff had finally made a True Friend. The Pope agreed to the 1st Demand but hesitated about the 2nd as even though their side were the Demon Integrationists, the Cardinalists (The side which Latriea family supported) had more influence and the future Pope would also be from their side. So he wouldn’t be able to grant his demand as he didn’t have that power. Rudeus understood that the Pope subtly implied that for his 2nd Demand to be met, he would also have to support the the Pope’s side and defeat the Cardinalists first. Rudeus was conflicted that this would count as help for Cliff, even though it was a bit of a gray area as he was also doing it for his own sake. He thought about leaving it for another day as he didn’t have to do everything in 1 day.

Rudeus left the meeting, feeling tired after encountering two exceptional individuals from opposite factions.Rudeus thought about which side he would pick, it was easy for him to choose the Demon integrationists but he felt conflicted as Therese who had saved his life twice was from the other side, also he didn't had any problems with Miko(Blessed Child) either except his entourage; Even though he didn't like Latrieas specially Claire but he couldn't forget the debt he owed them for funding paul's search party and also for taking care of his little sister, So he decided to postpone deciding a side for the time being. Rudeus planned to meet Miko a few more times to better understand her abilities and determine if she was an apostle of Hitogami, although he knew it would be nearly impossible to deduce. He resolved to stop overthinking about apostles and deal with them as they appeared, as it could be anyone Miko, Claire, or even the Pope. Next, Rudeus decided to focus on setting up the Mercenary building. He intended to install a contact tablet and consult Orsted about the matter. Since Aisha was proficient in handling business affairs, he entrusted her with managing the details, such as selecting a location and attracting merchants. Once he had made these decisions, Rudeus headed home.

Rudeus was making his way to Cliff's residence, contemplating his food choices. Upon entering the house, he witnessed an unusual scene: Aisha was angrily yelling at Wendy, which was out of character for her. Concerned, Rudeus intervened just as Aisha was about to strike Wendy, urging her to explain the situation. Aisha struggled to find the right words, and Wendy stepped in to provide the details. Here's what had happened: Geese had arrived and claimed to be a friend of Zenith. Seeing Zenith in distress, he wanted to take her out of the house. Aisha added that they hadn't returned since then.

Rudeus felt a bit perplexed and requested Aisha to start from the very beginning. Aisha began by describing Geese's visit that afternoon to Cliff's house. Although Aisha hadn't personally seen Geese, she became convinced after Wendy described his appearance, way of speaking, physique, equipment, and the content of their conversation. Aisha had been away at the market to get supplies and, upon her return, immediately searched for Zenith but found no trace of her. This left Aisha on the verge of tears. Rudeus reassured her, believing that Geese might have lost track of time but trusted that he wouldn't allow any harm to come to Zenith, despite his lackluster combat skills. Rudeus decided to wait for a while, hoping they would return. When Cliff returned after sunset and learned about the situation, he scolded Wendy, albeit not severely as she had no ill intentions.

As dinner approached, Rudeus made the decision to search for Zenith. Worries flooded his mind, considering the possibility of Zenith being kidnapped by the Latria household or Geese getting into a fight. Aisha insisted on joining the search, suggesting they split up. However, Rudeus deemed it unsafe and took Aisha along. He equipped himself with armor and, lacking confidence in horse riding, carried Aisha in a princess-carry position, running faster than a horse. Rudeus couldn't shake off the fear of repeating a situation like Shirone's, while fearing his lack of knowledge and confusion between allies and enemy; He steeled himself for whatever lay ahead.

Summary

Chapter 1: Playing Dumb

''Note: This section is under construction and revision''.

Chapter 2: A Chess Problem

Rudeus, the next day, would meet with the Pope, where he explains to him about Zenith being abducted last night by the Latrias and seek help to find Zenith. The Pope, in return, would ask what Rudeus is willing to do for him. Rudeus responds, suggesting kidnapping the blessed child. Cliff tried to change Rudeus' mind, but Rudeus was angry because he couldn't let this go. The reason was that he couldn't let Zenith be treated like an object, as she couldn’t say no, and he wanted revenge against Claire. In the end, Cliff managed to change Rudeus' mind about the kidnapping and connect him with someone who could reach out to Claire. Rudeus would come to the realization that he should have contacted Therese first before approaching the pope.

Rudeus would try to meet with Therese by coming to the church garden every day, so as not to seem suspicious. The reason for this was that the Blessed Child rarely leaves the inner sanctum—only every few days is allowed to walk around the church garden. After finally meeting with Therese, she agreed to speak with Claire about the situation and even offered to talk with her father and brothers if Claire is reluctant to speak.

Extra Chapter: Therese Looks for a Husband

Therese has been visiting the Latreia mansion more often lately, and one day Claire asks her when she’s planning on getting married. Though Therese protests that the only reason she’s still single is because her mother hasn’t arranged a marriage meeting for her, Claire reminds her that Therese herself was the one who didn’t want to be caught up in a power struggle, and Claire was merely respecting her wishes. Resigned to the fact that she’ll never find a partner without her mother’s assistance, Therese agrees to go through a marriage meeting.

The candidate is Dusklight Moorkite, a 27-year-old templar. Having prepared for the worst, Therese is satisfied with his background heading into the meeting, but she freezes up upon seeing his face. It’s Therese’s coworker, Dust Box of Anastasia Keep. Anastasia Keep was formed as a group of anonymous knights to prevent foreign spies from targeting their families; thus, Therese didn’t know about Dusk’s true identity before the meeting. Although she realizes that the marriage meeting itself is jeopardizing their jobs, Therese decides to seduce Dust, pretending she doesn’t know him. Dust, sees through her act and rejects her advances, demanding an explanation. Therese says that she now has no choice but to discharge Dust from Anastasia Keep for the Miko’s safety… unless Dust gets married to her and protects her from any potential assassins. Dust says that it wouldn’t be feasible… because if he were threatened by assassins, he would slaughter all his family members so they wouldn’t become hostages. Therese, remembering that all the Anastasia Keep knights are Millis fanatics, cools her head, and the two agree to call off the marriage.

Rudeus and Eris arrive in the town of Hammerpolka in the Strife/Conflict/Warring States region after parting with Sara and the Amazonesses. On the lookout for the North God Kalman and Geese, they run in to Zoldat, who is facing off against a group of Milis Knights demanding that he hand over a Demonkind party member. Rudeus gets the knights to back down after realizing that they were acting on his request to track down Geese. Zoldat tells Rudeus about his clan's funding and how he spends his days tackling labyrinths and acting as a mercenary. Rudeus asks if he has considered retiring, to which Zoldat responds that someone needs to look after the new recruits. Zoldat then tells Rudeus that Kalman was indeed in the Strife/Conflict/Warring States region a few years back—he taught the new recruits North God style swordmanship despite not using a sword himself. Having learned that Kalman is no longer there, Rudeus gets ready to leave, but not before telling Zoldat that he'll always be welcome in Orsted Corp. should he ever need a job. Zoldat comments that Rudeus has come a long way from the time when he begged Zoldat to take him to a brothel and got so drunk that he wanted to kill himself. Eris demands to know what Zoldat is talking about, and Zoldat, not realizing who she is, retells the story of volume 7 chapter 6, complete with pantomime and sound effects. Eris and Zoldat then introduce themselves, and Zoldat, surprised, asks if Eris returned to Rudeus knowing that she had driven him to the verge of suicide. Eris runs out of the room; Rudeus realizes that Eris knew about his previous experiences, but she had never heard about just how cornered he felt firsthand. Rudeus says goodbye to Zoldat and goes to find Eris, locating her sprawled on the ground staring up at the sky. She states that she did something horrible to Rudeus by leaving him behind, but Rudeus tells her that he would never have met Sara or Zoldat if she had stayed. Eris tells him that she won't suddenly leave without telling him ever again. As the two prepare to leave, they notice some townsfolk staring at them; the townsfolk tell them that in their religion, the forest goddess "Laine" was searching for a red-haired woman, and telling her her whereabouts would bring about fortune and victory. Rudeus and Eris then locate the graves that Ghislaine made for Philip and Hilda, upon which Rudeus imagines what must have transpired when they were teleported. Eris says that her parents would have been happy to know that they got married, and Rudeus agrees that both would have been happy (for very different reasons). Rudeus decides to move their remains to a graveyard for Asuran nobility, where they are buried near a grave that reads "Here lies a ferocious lion." Returning to Sharia, Rudeus reports his findings to Orsted and learns that Kishirika has been apprehended.

Light Novel Volume 3/Summary
============================

Chapter 1: The Con Artist Who Claimed to Be a God

Rudeus
 wakes up while moving at at an incredible speed through the sky. After concentrating his mana he starts slowing down and eventually lands, then immediately loses consciousness.

He "wakes up", but realizes he's dreaming, and meets a man calling himself the
Man God
 in this dream. Rudeus immediately distrusts him, but the Man-God still gives him some advice. The Man-God says to rely on the person Rudeus will meet when he wakes up, and to do what he can to help him. He also learns that he is currently in the
Demon Continent
, which is a much harsher environment than his
original home
 and is very difficult to survive in.

Chapter 2: The Superd

Rudeus wakes up and meets
Ruijerd Superdia
, one of the Superd who
Roxy
 told him to avoid at all costs, but quickly realizes he is not nearly as fearsome as the stories portrayed him to be. Through his conversation he learns he truly is in the northeast corner of the Demon Continent, about as far away from Fittoa as one could be. Ruijerd promises to return him and
Eris
 back home. Once Eris wakes up she starts crying and trying to run away from Ruijerd, but her legs give out and she falls down, a common reaction according to Ruijerd. Rudeus is able to comfort her and make her realize Ruijerd is someone they should become friends with, and she eventually agrees.

Chapter 3: A Master’s Secrets

The next day Ruijerd leads Rudeus and Eris to the village he was staying at, a journey of less than a mile that took 3 hours due to Ruijerd stopping the group every 15 minutes to kill a group of monsters. The village turned out to be the Migurdia tribes village, the hometown of Roxy and thanks to the pendant she gave Rudeus they were cleared of their initial suspicions and allowed to enter the village, meeting Roxy's father in the process.

Chapter 4: The Foundations of Trust

Meeting with the village elder, Rudeus tells him who they are and how they ended up there, prompting Ruijerd to once again promise his assistance in getting Rudeus and Eris back home. This leads to Ruijerd, who is over 500 years old, telling the story of his people and how

they were an elite group of soldiers under Laplace during the Third Great Human-Demon War. During this war Ruijerd was his people's leader and forced his men to use the Devil Spears given by Laplace which greatly enhanced all their combat abilities making them nearly invincible, at the cost of corrupting their souls and turning them into the battle crazed maniacs of the stories who would kill friend, foe, women, and children without hesitation. After being tricked into attacking their own village, with Ruijerd killing his own wife and son but in the process having his Devil Spear broken by his son, he woke up from his battle crazed state. He did the same for the rest of his comrades, but the damage had already been done. The Superd race was then hunted down and persecuted for their crimes, with Ruijerd currently being unsure if he is the last of his people, or if they have a secret village somewhere.

After hearing the story, Rudeus decided to help Ruijerd clear the name of his people, to Ruijerds great surprise. This would allow Ruijerd to help Rudeus and Eris while on the road, and for Rudeus to help Ruijerd while they were in cities, since he was feared to the point of being unable to enter cities currently. This felt like the beginning of a good relationship to Rudeus, but he was a little anxious that he was doing exactly what the Man-God wanted him to.

Chapter 5: Three Days to the Nearest Town

The group of 3 get on their way towards heading back to the Fittoa region, and before leaving Roxy's mother and father gift a short sword and some Demon Continent money to the group. As they started the 3 day journey towards the nearest town Rudeus convinces Ruijerd to teach them basic survival and combat skills so that Rudeus and Eris could survive on their own if it came to that. Rudeus completely destroys a monster with a single shot, successfully slaying his first monster, and over the course of the night the group fights several different monsters including
stone treants
, a giant tortoise, an acid wolf, and a group of pax coyotes.

Over the course of those 3 days Rudeus started to better define the positions of each of the 3 members of the group with Eris as the frontline attacker, Rudeus as the backline supporter casting spells when necessary, and Ruijerd in a flex position to cover any blind spots. They start accumulating their experiences and Ruijerd also teaches Eris about maintaining her weapon. He also informs the group that the Superds spears are a part of their body growing up, and once they reach a certain age they harden and fall off, which is why the Superd as so attached to them.

Chapter 6: Infiltration and Impersonation

The trio finally arrive at their first Demon Continent city,
Rikarisu
, which is one of the three largest settlements on the continent. After creating a stone helmet for Ruijerd as a disguise, the group entered the city and headed to some market stalls to buy some initial supplies. Rudeus buys some dye for Ruijerd's hair and turns it blue, with the cover story that he is actually one of the Migurd but is pretending to be a Superd, in an effort to decrease any suspicions of him while at the same time hopefully spreading rumors that the Superd aren't as dangerous as they seem. He also bought a cloak with cat ears for Eris which to Rudeus' surprise she immediately liked.

Chapter 7: The Adventurers’ Guild

The next stop was the
Adventurers' Guild
 where the group of three registered as rank F adventurers and created a party with the name "Dead End" the name associated with the "bloodthirsty killing machine" Ruijerd. Before registering they announced to everyone in the building that Ruijerd was in fact a Superd, but because of the blue dyed hair everyone burst out laughing and did not believe it. After registering, the group narrowly avoided a conflict with another group of adventurers after they tried to trip Rudeus and the rest. Another bout of laughing ensued when the group left without taking on a single job.

Chapter 8: The Adventurers’ Inn

As it was getting dark the group decided to head towards an inn, and chose a newbie-adventurer friendly one. Inside the group met another newbie group of three called the
Tokurabu Village Toughs
 who tried hitting on Eris and got beat up in the process. After some worrying about the groups budget, as they only had about enough to last 2 weeks, and they wouldn't earn much through adventuring until they advanced their party's rank, Rudeus fell asleep. In his dream he meets the Man-God again who tells him to accept the quest to find a lost pet at the adventurer's guild.

Rudeus wakes back up in the middle of the night to see Eris staring out of their room's window. He goes over and eases her anxiety about getting back home safely, realizing that he was not the only one feeling such things.

Chapter 9: The First Job: The Value of a Life

After accepting the lost pet job, the trio find themselves in an underground room filled with dozens of "lost" pets, who had actually been captured by another
group of three
 in order to profit off the eventual Adventurers' Guild quests that would be posted to find them. The trio capture and handcuff the petnappers, and as Rudeus began interrogating one of them he kicked hard enough to fly across the room resulting in Ruijerd instantly slicing his throat with his spear, killing him instantly.

This event left Rudeus very shaken up, to the point of even being afraid of Ruijerd. Because of that Rudeus comes up with a whole speech about why Ruijerd should not kill people anymore no matter what, in order to disprove the claims that the Superd are a group of bloodthirsty killers. After some back and forth and Rudeus essentially pleading with him, Ruijerd hesitantly agrees.

Chapter 10: The First Job Completed

Then Rudeus goes on to interrogate the other two remaining petnappers, and learns about their operation. After some internal debate about what to do with them and whether he should just off them to prevent any rumors from spreading, Rudeus comes up with the idea to have the two, who are D rank adventurers and able to advance to C rank, advance to C rank and start taking on C or even B rank monster hunting quests, while Dead End (Rudeus' party) will accept their E rank quests, and the two groups will swap. This allows Dead End to slowly rank up while earning money equivalent to B and C rank quests. Ruijerd is strongly opposed to this plan as he does not want to team up with those he deems as evil, but thanks to Eris' shouting and explaining that this is for Ruijerd's own benefit and that Rudeus is smart enough to come up with good plans, he reluctantly agrees.

Afterwards the trio return to the client whose pet was lost, and return it, causing the little girl whose pet it was to become extremely happy. They then return to the Adventurers' Guild to collect their reward and successfully mark the quest as complete. One of the men who had previously laughed at Ruijerd for "pretending" to be a Superd comes up and has some small talk with the group, eventually offering his help as a rank C adventurer if they ever needed it, since he doesn't mind helping newbies, a man with horse head named
Nokopara
.

Chapter 11: A Smooth Start

The next morning Rudeus meets up with Vizquel and Jalil, whose party name is P Hunter, and were the two adventurers who were running the petnapping scam, and exchanged their first set of quests. The job Rudeus ended up picking out for themselves was to slay Pax Coyotes, and by killing a few and using the scent of their blood to attract more, they were able to kill over 100 in a couple of hours. And in only three days Dead End was promoted to rank E, thanks to P Hunter performing the lower ranked jobs for them.

After a few days of taking on these jobs the group started to earn enough money for them to upgrade their gear. Eris got a full set of light armor including a breast plate and some other small protective pieces, and Rudeus got a robe made from the hide of a Mackey Rat which offers some protection against stabbing weapons due to how tough it is. While they were purchasing these items Ruijerd was spying on P Hunter to see how they were performing their side of things, and they were approaching even F ranked jobs with a good attitude and diligence, making sure to mention and praise Dead End Ruijerd at the end of each job.

Chapter 12: Children and Warriors

After another 3 weeks Dead End hit D rank, but Rudeus wanted to continue milking the relationship with P Hunter as that allowed him to take on a B rank quest to slay a mysterious snake type monster in the
Petrified Forest
 a days journey away from Rikarisu. After arriving, Rudeus finds two other adventurer parties already there on similar jobs. The rank D Tokurabu Village Toughs, who they met earlier, as well as the rank B
Super Blazers
. The three groups decide that whoever slays the monster first gets the reward, but Ruijerd realizes that the three kids making up the Tokurabu Village Toughs are not nearly strong enough to survive in the petrified forest due to it being the home of many rank B monsters, and decides that they should tail that group to ensure their safety since Ruijerd always does what he can to protect children.

After a short while the Tokurabu Village Toughs run into an Executioner, the zombified remains of an adventurer, a rank B monster. They started running away from the Executioner, only to run into a group of rank B Almond Anacondas, and Ruijerd wants to rush in to help them immediately, but Rudeus holds him back to wait for the perfect moment to save them to have them be as grateful as possible to Dead End. However this backfires and one of the Tokurabu Village Toughs gets cleaved in half by the Executioner. This prompts Ruijerd to act to guarantee the safety of the other two, and in a matter of moments Ruijerd and Eris kill the group of Anacondas and Rudeus summons a large rock to crush the Executioner. After a heated exchange of words with Ruijerd being furious at Rudeus for stopping him and allowing one of the three children to be killed, and Rudeus feeling extremely guilty about his greed leading to that death, the leader of Tokurabu Village Toughs stands up for himself and says that he and his group were prepared to die the moment they accepted the quest, and the fault lies solely on them. This wraps up the discussion with Rudeus still feeling extremely guilty and making a note that he needs to think about his actions to make sure he doesn't make a similar mistake in the future.

Rudeus' group then Tokurabu Village Toughs to the entrance of the forest so they can bring their fallen comrade back home, and then they reenter the forest and find the mysterious snake monster, along with the six corpses of the Super Blazers. It turned out to be a Red-Hood Cobra, a rank A  massive snake like monster. Ruijerd says that he is more than capable of defeating the monster on his own, settling the debate of whether they should fight it or not. Rudeus uses his tandard opening move of using Stone Cannon, however the cobra was able to dodge it, but thanks to the endless slashes from Eris and Ruijerd the cobra grew tired and after multiple missed shots one of his Stone Cannon's finally landed and killed the cobra.

Chapter 13: Failure, Chaos, and Resolve

After returning to the Guild to complete their quests, they once again ran into Nokopara, who had realized the two parties were exchanging quests, which is against Guild rules and could get them banned from accepting all quests on the Demon Continent. He decides to black mail them to give him some money each month to keep him from telling the Guild, and after talking to the remaining members of the Tokurabu Village Toughs, he had proof that Rudeus, Eris, and Ruijerd, a D ranked party, were taking on a rank B quest while P Hunter was inside the city taking on a much lower ranked one.

After some internal debate of what to do, Rudeus decides to flood the entire city of Rikarisu, since it was built into a crater, but right as he starts casting the spell Ruijerd washes out the dye from his hair, reavealing that he truly is one of the Superd. After doing so he threatens Nokopara forcing him to not reveal that the group broke the Guild's rules, and then gets chased out of the city by the guards. Rudeus and Eris then collected their belongings from the inn and purchase the equivalent of a horse drawn carriage on the Demon Continent, a large lizard like creature, before leaving the city.

The two met up with Ruijerd outside the city, and Rudeus had a heart to heart conversation with him, where he doubled his resolve to help Ruijerd restore his people's reputation, and Ruijerd truly recognizes Rudeus as a warrior and trusts him. And the next morning they see that Ruijerd shaved his head, since his green hair was one of the most notable features about him and something people feared the most.

Chapter 14: The Beginning of Our Journey

As the group moves towards the next city, Rudeus calls a group meeting to discuss the plans moving forward. He mentions that while he is the group leader, the other two should come forward with any ideas they have to improve the group overall, and they decide the best course of action for now is to head towards Wind Port, the southernmost city of the Demon Continent where they can travel by boat to the Millis Continent, hike across there, and there travel by boat again to reach the Central Continent.

As the group travels, Eris starts learning the Demon God tongue, and Ruijerd starts to teach her more about the sword. They would have mock fights ending with her being sprawled on the ground with a spear at her neck. Rudeus attempted to participate too, but after a few rounds he realized that he wasn't learning much, while Eris had likely become better than Paul at this point. Rudeus also engages in a full on mock battle against Ruijerd, earning much praise from him, but because he started at close range he lost badly.

Over the course of a year the group steadily made their way towards Wind Port, and managed to reach rank A in the process. As they got closer, they also started encountering human warrior who came to the Demon Continent to train and increase their strength. All of whom who challenged Ruijerd to a duel lost handily. Even after revealing his name and identity some would continue to be respectful and Ruijerd would tell the tale of his people to them, while they would have looks of astonishment the entire time.

Light Novel Volume 4/Summary
============================

Chapter 1: Wind Port

Rudeus
 celebrated his 11th birthday a couple days ago, and the first thing they do once they arrive at
Wind Port
 is stop by the Adventurer's Guild. There, after
Eris
 gets in a brief scuffle, they learn about their nicknames. "Mad Dog" Eris, "Guard Dog"
Ruijerd
, and "Kennel Master" Rujerd who is Rudeus but his name has been messed up and he has a negative image associated with him, while Ruijerd is rumored to be kind hearted.

The group then heads to the port checkpoint, only to discover that in order to cross the border to the
Millis Continent
 with a
Superd
, they would need to pay 200 green ore coins, a massive sum that would take over a year to earn. Rudeus thinks that he could sell his staff or hire a smuggler as alternatives, but doesn't like any of those three options.

That night he gets more advice from the
Man-God
, which is to buy some food at a street stall and search the alleyways by himself. He agrees right away to follow this advice as he doesn't think he has any other better options.

Chapter 2: Missed Connections, the Prequel

After following the Man-God's advice to the letter, Rudeus ends up meeting
Kishirika Kishirisu
, and in exchange for the food he gave her, she gives him a
Demon Eye
. After explaining six different types he's able to pick from, Rudeus chooses the
Eye of Foresight
, which allows him to see the different branches of possible things that can happen a couple seconds in the future.

Chapter 3: Missed Connections, the Sequel

Realizing that he did exactly what the Man-God wanted him to made him want to tear out his demon eye and crush it, since he still doesn't think the Man-God is someone he should trust, but regardless he returned back to the inn they were staying at. After a week he was able to master the demon eye, and was able to see 1-3 seconds in the future depending on how much mana he used, as well as see completely normally if he wished. While he was doing that, Eris was training with Ruijerd all day.

After announcing that he was able to control his Eye of Foresight, Ruijerd suggested that he have a duel with Eris, so they could both see the results of their training. The result of that battle was Rudeus' complete win. He was able to see exactly what Eris was going to do, and even without using his magic he countered her and won. In his cocky state he even dueled against Ruijerd in a bare handed fight, but lost completely after the first exchange after seeing multiple possible futures and not knowing how to react.

That night Rudeus decides to sell his staff to earn enough for the boat's fee to the Millis Continent, but as he walks outside Ruijerd confronts him and tells him he is okay with the smuggling plan as it would lead to a better outcome. After they both agree on that, a man approaches them saying that he just so happens to be a smuggler,
Gallus Cleaner
. In exchange for smuggling Ruijerd, once they arrive in Millis, the group would set the other slaves being smuggled free since Gallus thinks they're more trouble than their worth, while his comrades disagree.

Side Story: Missed Connections, Extra Story

Roxy
 arrived at Wind Port along with
Elinaline Dragonroad
, a female elven tank, and
Talhand
, a male dwarven magician, both of whom were members of
Fangs of the Black Wolf
, the same adventuring party that
Paul
 and
Zenith
 were part of before they settled down in the Fittoa Region. The three just happened to meet on their way towards the Demon Continent are grouped up since it would be safer to travel together, since Elinalise and Talhand saw Paul's letter about helping search for his missing family members and agreed to help.

While trying to gather information on any who were teleported to the Demon Continent from the Displacement Incident, Roxy also sees Eris and Ruijerd sparring out on the beach, the same week that Rudeus was inside his inn learning to control his Demon Eye. But since she had never met the two before she quickly left after getting scared by Ruijerd's gaze and the group of three quickly left Wind Port to continue searching the entire Demon Continent, just as Rudeus and his group headed to the Millis Continent.

Chapter 4: The Sage on Board

Eris and Rudeus boarded the ship that would take them to the Millis Continent after handing Ruijerd over to the smugglers that would sneak him through. Through the journey Rudeus got to witness an S ranked party guard the ship from a giant octopus monster, thinking to himself that him, Eris, and Ruijerd were individually much stronger than each member of that party, but they achieved that rank through their teamwork, which Dead End was severely lacking. Eris also gets extremely seasick, with Rudeus needing to constantly cast heal on her to ease her pain. After a few more days they eventually arrived at the city of
Zant Port
 on the Millis Continent.

Chapter 5: The Demon in the Warehouse

After taking residence in a less than savory inn, the rest of them being booked for the three month long rainy season that would soon start preventing any travel, Rudeus headed towards the warehouse that was housing Ruijerd to pick him up as well as set the other slaves there free, as per his agreement with Gallus.

Rudeus arrived at the warehouse and after a long walk through multiple secret passageways and doors he arrived at the room where Ruijerd was being held. After a quick exchange about where the slaves were being kept, Ruijerd tells Rudeus that he will kill all of the guards and smugglers while Rudeus can save the seven beastfolk children who are the slaves they are supposed to set free.

Chapter 6: The Beastfolk Children

As Ruijerd quickly dispatched with all the guards, Rudeus found the group of seven children and healed their numerous wounds before leaving the warehouse. Just as they were leaving one of the seven said that there was a dog being held captive that also needed to be saved, so Rudeus went back to do that while Ruijerd led the children to the outskirts of the city where Rudeus would meet back up with them.

After rescuing the dog from a magic circle, Rudeus was then incapacitated by a group of beastmen who found the smugglers warehouse using a voice attack thinking that Rudeus was one of the kidnappers. It turns out the dog was also the beatsmen's
Sacred Beast
 Rudeus was then taken back to the beastfolk village as a criminal, while one of the other beastmen found Ruijerd and the kidnapped children. Through their conversation the beastmen learned that Rudeus was Ruijerd companion, and apologized for taking him into custody, but Ruijerd knew that Rudeus would be fine and prioritized returning the children to their parents and getting Eris before setting Rudeus free.

Chapter 7: Free Apartment

Five days had passed, with Rudeus being locked in a wooden cell the entire time. He could have easily escaped but he was waiting for Ruijerd to come back and for him to be absolved of his crimes. However on that day another person was thrown into the cell with him, a man named
Geese
. Seven days had now gone by, still with no word from Ruijerd and no sign of being let out of the cell. As Rudeus was getting more and more anxious and ready to escape on his own, he suddenly sees that the forest was on fire.

Chapter 8: Fire Emergency

After escaping from the cell, Rudeus and Geese see the entire village up in flames along with humans in battle gear chasing the beastfolk down, killing the adults, and kidnapping the children. Rudeus decides to help them even though they falsely imprisoned him for a whole week, summoning massive clouds above the forest to create a heavy downpour and put out the fires. Once the attackers noticed Rudeus doing this they started rushing towards him, but were quickly knocked out with his Stone Canon.

After clearing away the smoke the beastmen were able to fight much better and began to start pressing the human back. Along with Rudeus' help they continued slaughtering the attackers and rescuing the children who had been kidnapped, even saving the women who had stood guard by Rudeus' cell for the past week, with a look of great surprise on her face. Eventually the beastmen warrior and Rudeus ran into Gallus, who had planned this whole thing from the start. After he leaked the information about the warehouse with the kidnapped children, he planned for Rudeus and Ruijerd to distract the beastmen warrior who went to save the children, and him and his men would swoop in the village and kidnap the rest of the children while all the warriors were gone.

After Rudeus refused Gallus' offer to join him, Gallus quickly kills three beastmen warriors that attacked him all at once, leaving Rudeus worried if he can take on Gallus, who is Saint ranked in the North God Style. Just as Gallus started to take his leave since Rudeus had no plans to attack him, the Sacred Beast attacked him, giving Rudeus an opportunity to save the hostage and square off against Gallus with the Sacred Beast at his side. Gallus launched multiple fierce attacks against Rudeus, with Rudeus forced to defend the entire time with no chance to counter attack. Thankfully Geese threw a powder filled bag at Gallus flustering him and giving Rudeus enough time to cast explosion and knock Gallus out.

We then learn that the plan to kidnap the beastfolk was even more well planned and complicated with attacks being carried out against all the villages simultaneously, and the kidnappers managing to kidnap 50 children. They were just about to sail off when Ruijerd and the other beastfolk warriors who had not returned yet attacked them and saved the children. This is what was going on while Rudeus was in the cell for a week. Gallus was then handed to the Zant Port officials, and all the rescued children were returned to there parents.

Chapter 9: Slow Life in the Doldia Village

As thanks for saving the children of Doldia village, the village elder Gustav invited Rudeus, Eris, and Ruijerd to spend the rainy season with them since travel is nearly impossible. Through some conversation Eris learns that Ghislaine was born in this village, however she was extremely violent and someone unworthy of being respected, completely opposite from her current self. Rudeus tried to learn the unique beastfolk voice magic that was used against him to render him unconscious, but he was only able to do a much weaker version since it requires the specialized vocal chords the beastfolk posses. Ruijerd became great friends with Gustav, exchanging stories with him from "back in the day", and Eris befriended two of the younger beastfolk children. As the relatively peaceful days went by, three months passed and the rainy season ended.

Chapter 10: The Holy Sword Highway

The trio then head off for the capital of Millis, along with Geese who sweet talked his way into being able to join. They traveled along the Holy Sword Highway, which was a road that went straight through the Great Forest, and since it contained mana monsters would never go near it. Along the way Eris asked Geese to teach her how to cook, but he recounted a tale of how he taught
a women
 in his previous adventurer's party how to cook, and she used that to convince one of
the guy
s in that party to marry her, resulting in the party splitting up and Geese giving up being an Adventurer.

Rudeus also learns about the Seven Great Powers, which are the seven strongest warriors in the world, engraved on magic stones throughout the world that automatically update. In order they are the Technique God,
Dragon God
, Fighting God,
Demon God
,
Death God
,
Sword God
, and North God, with the top three all being missing, and the Demon God Laplace being sealed away after the
Third Human-Demon War
.

After a little over a month of traveling, the group finally exited the Great Forest and once again entered the domain of men.

Extra Chapter: Guardian Fitz

Fitz once again has a dream about what happened to them during the Displacement Incident, which was suddenly being teleported thousands of feet in the air, and barely surviving using all the magic they could muster and thanks to the teachings of their master who taught them about some of the fundamental principles of nature. This was the same person who fell from the sky and helped save
Ariel Anemoi Asura
 (in
the extra chapter of the previous volume
), causing Ariel to employ Fitz in Derricks place, since Derrick passed away and Fitz was more than quality being at least intermediate tier in all attack magic schools and being able to cast spells without chanting.

Ariel also started fulfilling Derrick's wish of her becoming Queen of Asura, as she was currently bolstering her allies behind the scenes, planning for a day 10-20 years in the future when those allies would have been planted in positions of power, enough to solidify her claim as Queen. That night one of the highest ranking nobles in all of Asura,
Minister Darius
, as well as the first Price, Grabel, were discussing Ariel's recent movements and decided that it was been to have her assassinated. Thankfully Fitz was able to stop this assassination attempt, nearly losing his life to poison but his silent casting of Detoxification magic saved him. The attempts at Ariel's life continued, forcing her to plan her escape from the royal palace under the guise of studying abroad.

Light Novel Volume 5/Summary
============================

Chapter 1: The Holy Country of Millis

The group arrives at the beautiful city of Millishion, and just as soon as they enter the city Geese says his goodbyes and leaves the group. After arriving at the inn Rudeus decides tomorow will be a free day for each person to do whatever they want, so that he would have enough time to finally write a letter back to Paul in the Fittoa region since he still doesn't know the extend to which the Displacement Incident has affected people. Eris decides that she'll go and hunt some goblins and Ruijerd says he's going to say hello to an acquaintance of his.

While heading back to the inn after buying some ink and paper, Rudeus see a group of what look to be kidnappers carrying a child in a burlap sack and running very quickly. Due to Dead End's motto to never abandon a child in peril, he decides to tail the group and rescue the child. After realizing that he had snuck his way into a crate of underwear, he revealed his location and alerted the kidnappers inside the building that he was there. He quickly took out four of them with weakened Stone Cannons to knock them out, but the group kept calling in reinforcements preventing him from being able to escape. Eventually a women in bikini armor and a sword began attacking Rudeus, with her large breasts distracting him and preventing him from doing anything more than dodging her attacks, giving enough time for the groups boss to come in.

Rudeus felt that the groups boss looked extremely nostalgic, but he couldn't place why. The boss was obviously extremely drunk while fighting against Rudeus, but was also skilled enough for Rudeus to give the fight everything he had just to keep up. Soon enough, the man even landed a slash cutting off the underwear Rudeus put on his head to hide his face, but this caused the man to stop fighting instantly, recognizing Rudeus, causing Rudeus to recognize that this man was his father, Paul.

Chapter 2: Paul's Story

We see the Displacement Incident from Paul's point of view. At the time of the incident he happened to be holding Norn, so both of them teleported together to the southern region of Asura. Thanks to Paul's adventuring habits he had a Asuran gold coin and his adventurers card tucked into the sheath of his sword, which he always kept on him. He quickly sped back to the Fittoa Region, taking two months to get back, and saw that everything had vanished once he arrived. Thanks to the butler under Philip, Alphonse, a refugee camp was already under construction, and with Paul's help it was finished within a month, recuing people across the country in the process. Afterwards, Paul headed to the other of the two largest countries in the world Millis, to set up base there and rescue even more people, while also searching for Rudeus, Zenith, and the rest of his family.

In the first six months Paul and the other volunteers had rescued hundreds of people affected by the incident, some had even been sold off as slaves and so needed to be bought back, or stolen when they couldn't be bought. Whatever needed to be done, Paul would do it to get them back. The next six months weren't nearly as good as the first. Most of the news was Fittoa residents who had been found dead, and fewer and fewer people were being rescued. The families of those found dead almost all blamed Paul for not finding them fast enough. And after another six months Paul had resorted to drinking to escape the thoughts of what had happened to his own family, since he still had no word on them.

Paul was also drunk on this very day, when suddenly his squad members told him that one of their warehouses was being attacked by a young magician.

Chapter 3: Family Squabble

Rudeus and Paul walk over to a nearby bar to talk after the fight. As Rudeus tells Paul what he's been doing the past year and a half Paul angrily yells at him to stop talking and informs him that while he was on his little adventure with a cute young miss and invincible bodyguard, Paul was searching for the thousands of displacement people including his own family. During their conversation tensions were high causing them to get into another fight which Rudeus easily won thanks to his demon eye and since had been Paul drinking even more. However Zorn stepped in between them to stop it. Rudeus was extremely shocked and angry at himself for not even thinking about how others could have been affected by the incident as well, causing him to leave the bar and go back to the inn, with him and Paul not having resolved anything, and Paul looking with disgust at Rudeus.

After a while Ruijerd and Eris arrived back at the inn ready to share the events of their happy day with Rudeus, but notice that Rudeus was extremely depressed. After some back and forth about what happened Rudeus tells the story of how he ran into Paul for the first time in a year and a half, and Eris says that she'll beat him up for what he did. Ruijerd tells Eris to not get involved in family squabbles, and after some hesitation comforts Rudeus to great effect, hugging him and helping him recover emotionally.

Chapter 4: Reunited

We get a look at Paul's perspective of his fight with Rudeus, and how he got so angry since Rudeus described his adventure as a walk in the park without any major issues or dangers. After explaining as much to Geese, who had found Paul and was trying to see what happened, Geese told him that he expected way too much of his 11 year old son who had never gone on an adventure before and was probably skipping all the dangerous parts of the story to prevent Paul from worrying as much about him. After a long conversation about how Paul was too quick to judge, he vows to come back tomorrow and fix things with Rudeus.

The next morning the two meet up in the same bar, with Ruijerd taking the irate Eris outside with him to allow the two to converse privately. Ruijerd's only words to Paul were "You have every right to say your piece. But the only reason that you
can
 is that you son is still alive". Paul and Rudeus both apologize to each other and begin sharing information about the state of the Fittoa region and what had gone on since the incident. Eventually they both felt the conversation was going nowhere and was extremely awkward, but the bartender came over to the pair, who were the only two inside the place now, and told Rudeus to at least look Paul in the eyes even though he had no idea what the situation was.

After doing so Rudeus saw the look of an extremely anxious and worried man who was on the brink of tears. This made Rudeus realize how Paul was feeling, similar feelings to how he had felt in his previous life, and caused him to propose to his father to pretend yesterday never happened. Paul reluctantly agreed, and the Rudeus runs into Paul's arms and says "Father! I've missed you so much!", and after a moments hesitation Paul responds and they both start sobbing. For a while they both stayed there like that, having fully made up, and reuniting for the first time in five years.

Chapter 5: Objectives Confirmed

Now that the father son duo were together again and had gotten past the awkward stage, they were freely joking around and discussing the events that had gone on in each others lives for the past 5 years, including an update on
Sylphie
 who was able to use even healing magic without an incantation, something Rudeus was still unable to do. Unfortunately she was still missing so her whereabouts were unknown.

Afterwards, Rudeus, Ruijerd, and Eris head back to their inn to discuss their plan moving forward, after having gained a lot of information from Paul, as well as a hefty sum of money intended for the safe travel of any Boreas household members, inclduing Eris. Rudeus decides to continue his journey to return Eris back to her hometown, even knowing that everything there has completely disappeared. And thanks to Ruijerd's acquaintance likely being a man of nobility, they were even able to obtain a letter of introduction to help avoid paying the astronomical sum of 100 king's coins for a superd to cross to the central continent. The group decide to spend a week in Millishion before heading off.

Chapter 6: One Week in Millishion

The next day, Rudeus goes to see Paul at the Fittoa Search and Rescue Squad's headquarters, but he's extremely busy after having spent the last month getting drunk every day, so Rudeus schedules a dinner with him four days later. During those four days Rudeus and the crew take on a B rank mission, to slay a Leaf Tiger, which was killed with one slash by Eris due to the group being used to the much fiercer monsters on the Demon Continent. Four days later Rudeus, who reluctantly allows Eris to join, both meet with Paul and Norn at the restaurant.

Eris was still mad at Paul for how he reacted to seeing his son, and Norn was still mad at Rudeus for punching her dad when in her opinion he hadn't done anything wrong. So the mood was tense for a while, but gradually evened out throughout the night, although Eris was still a bit hostile, and Norn still wouldn't look Rudeus in the eyes. And a couple days later a similar scene was reenacted as Rudeus set off towards the west end of the Millis Continent, while Paul continued working to ensure the Fittoa residents who were still in the Millis Continent would obtain safe passage back to their homeland.

Interlude: Eris The Goblin Slayer

Cliff Grimoire was an orphan in Millishion adopted by Harry Grimoire, a very high ranking member of the Millis Church. Thanks to his innate talents and the funding of his adoptive father he was able to obtain advanced rank healing, detoxification, divine strike, and fire magic, and intermediate rank in the other three offensive magic disciplines. Due to his immense talents and longing to be an adventurer, he snuck away from his home and registered. However he did not realize that since he was a newbie rank F adventurer no party was willing to accept him.

Today was Dead End's off day, where Eris went to go hunt goblins, and she just happened to run into Cliff looking down on other adventurers for not accepting him, and after intervening he started following her and tried to show off his power in front of her. Unfortunately for him, Eris was using Rudeus as her standard, and very few people in the entire world could compare to him in terms of magic capabilities.

Eventually, the duo ended up deep in the forest where they found the Blessed Child, an important woman in one faction of the Millis Church, being attacked by assassins from the other prominent faction. Eris decides to intervene immediately, slicing two of the men in half, as the other encircled her. Thanks to the single remaining knight protected the Blessed Child who helped Eris, she was able to break out of the encirclement and eliminate another of the assassins, while the last one got away. The knight introduced herself as
Therese Latria
, offering her assistance to Eris if she ever needed it, and quickly left with the Blessed Child.

It turned out that Cliff was actually the true grandson of the current pope of Millishion, who hid Cliff in an attempt to keep him safe during the current power struggle going on within the church, and the Blessed Child who Eris had just saved was a member of the opposing faction of the Pope. With this development not going the Pope's way, he decided to send Cliff away to study in
a foreign land
.

Chapter 7: To the Central Continent

After two months on the road, the group reached West Port, and their first stop was the customs office to try and secure passage to the Central Continent. After handing over the letter Ruijerd received, the duke in charge of the office met with the group, and we learn that Ruijerd's acquaintance was actually Galgard Nash Vennick, Commander of the Missionary Knights, one of the three holy military orders of the Millis Church. The duke in charge of the office detested demons however, and refused to let Ruijerd board the ship by claiming the letter to be a forgery.

After some moments of discussion and Rudeus trying to use Eris' Boreas Greyrat name, a female Temple Knight entered the office, and she just so happened to be the woman Eris saved from assassins a couple days prior, as well as Zenith's sister, Therese Latria. She used her authority to take the three under her protection, completely ignoring Duke Bakshiel. Thanks to that the group was finally able to obtains safe passage to the Central Continent, and Therese even provided Eris with medicine to help her seasickness.

Interlude: Roxy's Homecoming

At the same time as Rudeus set sail towards the Central Continent, Roxy returned to her hometown on the Demon Continent for the first time in many years. Due to her inability to understand the telepathy that every other member of her race was able to do, she felt very ostracized from her village. However after seeing her mother cry she spent three days with her parents, and was even able to relax around them towards the end. After leaving she went to Rikarisu, and after arrived confirmed her suspicions that Rudeus was the "Kennel Master" of Dead End that she had been hearing so much about on her journey, realizing they had crossed paths without even knowing it right when she arrived on the Demon Continent. Her, Talhand, and Elinalise decided to finish searching the northwest region of the continent for any displaced Fittoa residents however.

Extra Chapter I: Dragon Meat, Nanahoshi Style

The trio arrived at Eastport in the Dragon King Realm, and decide to buy some food at a restaurant that was emitting a great smell, one that Rudeus even found to be nostalgic. The restaurant was a bit rundown and shabby, and only had two items on the menu, but Rudeus couldn't resist his curiosity, and they all ordered Dragon Meat, Nanahoshi Style. Once the food was delivered, to Rudeus' shock it was a three piece meal very similar to a typical Japanese meal, which gave him high hopes for an excellent meal, but after tasting it he flipped out on the chef and had to be dragged out by Eris and Ruijerd since it was so below his standards.

Unknown to Rudeus however, the chef was Randolph Marianne, the Dead God, ranked fifth among the Seven Great Powers. And after his scathing review, Randolph decided to close shop and finally accept the offer of the High General of the King Dragon Realm, Shagall Gargantis, to join him.

Extra Chapter II: The Death of Ariel

A rumor started speeding around the capital of Asura that Ariel had died while traveling to the Ranoa University of Magic. In order to verify these claims an information dealer started retracing her steps and interviewed several men. The first was a man who worked at the last border checkpoint before leaving Asura, who had indeed seen Ariel and went against his order to keep her in town for a couple days to stall her and let her through immediately. It turns out that a few days prior some suspicious looking men in black clothing had crossed the border a few days prior, likely lying in wait for Ariel and her guards in the forest beyond the border.

The second man saw the fight between Ariel's guards and the assassins, and saw "Silent Fitz", Fitz's nickname, using beginner tier spells at perfect timings to kill the assassins and help the other guards who were struggling against them. However as the fight dragged on it was seven assassins versus Fitz and three other guards, and when all the assassins mobilized towards Ariel and a group of three maids after a fake-out that they were going towards Fitz, one managed to sneak through and decapitate one of the group of four right before him and the rest of the assassins were all killed. The eyewitness said it was Ariel, however the royal family has magical implements that allow for very good disguises, and the information broker later heard from another soldier stationed at the border that he saw Ariel no doubt about it leaving the forest after the fight.

This was the tale of how Ariel successfully escaped from the Kingdom of Asura and enrolled at the Ronoa Magic Academy.

Light Novel Volume 6/Summary
============================

Note: The following article is under construction

Chapter 1: Route Selection

Rudeus
 turned 12 as he arrived in the city of East Port in the King Dragon Realm, and after choosing an inn he held a group meeting to discuss which route they would take to get the the
Asura Kingdom
 in the northern region of the Central Continent. After some discussion they chose the safest route which should take about 10 months due to the other alternatives being much more dangerous and likely not saving any time.

That night Rudeus meets with the
Man God
 in his dreams again, and Rudeus receives more detailed information from the Man God about the location of his still missing family members in exchange for being less hostile towards him in the future. The Man God tells Rudeus to go to the Shirone Kingdom, where he will find both
Lilia
 and
Aisha
 after following some specific actions such as sending a letter and making sure not to use his real name. This also included seeing visions of the future through his Demon Eye, causing him to get extremely nauseous after he woke up. Not only that, but this worried Rudeus greatly, as he thinks the Man God likely gave him the last set of advice so that he would get the Eye of Foresight, allowing him to see these visions from the Man God, making him wonder just how all knowing and powerful this mysterious figure is, and what his true objectives are.

Chapter 2: Rice

The next morning Rudeus tells the group that they will make a stop in the Shirone Kingdom, and Rudeus is thankful that
Eris
 and
Ruijerd
 both agreed so fast without asking any questions. Unfortunately due to some problems with their carriage, the group had to spent an entire week in Wyvern, the capital of the King Dragon Realm which is the third largest country in the world. Amoung the good he saw in the city was rice, which he happily purchased and cooked himself to try to fulfill his dream of eating rice again in this new world. However even after adding a raw egg on top it was still less than a C in terms of taste compared to what he was used to in Japan, and that was being generous.

After leaving Wyvern and along the way to Shirone, Rudeus continued stopped by the Adventurer's Guilds and would use the name Dead End, which would hardly elicit much of a response at all anymore, since the threat of the Superd was nonexistent to the people living on the Central Continent. Rudeus also continued eating the rice produced by the various regions they traveled to, and different versions of a dish similar to Japanese fried chicken, all failing to meet his expectations. And finally after four months of this, the group reached the Shirone Kingdom.

Chapter 3: The Shirone Kingdom

As the group arrives in the capital of Shirone, Latakia, Rudeus starts another team meeting. Thinking about the Man-God's words, he creates fake names for each of them to use while in Shirone and buys supplies to sent
Roxy
 a letter since she was a court magician of the Shirone Kingdom the last time Rudeus wrote to her. After sending the letter he walks into some small alleys, and realizes he's seeing the exact scene the Man God showed him, with his younger sister Aisha being grabbed by two city guards. Rudeus thought that the guards did not look happy performing their duty, but he nonetheless saw Aisha crying and immediately helped her once she asked him for it, using his magic to catapult them into the sky to get away from the soldiers.

Chapter 4: There Is No God

After calming down from the traumatic events she just experienced, Aisha asked Rudues to buy some paper and a pen so she could write a letter to her father. After asking if she could ask anyone else for help, perhaps a brother, she says that she does have a brother, but her mom told her brother was capable of such advanced magic at a young age that she doesn't believe her, and found Rudeus' secret stash of Roxy's panties and thinks of him as a pervert. Rudeus can't blame her for thinking that, and so continues to hide his identity but says that he will help save Lilia.

Aisha tells Rudeus the details of her and Lilia were teleported to Shirone Kingdom's Royal Palace and were arrested, yet no matter how many times they tried to explain the situation they were not let free and were unable to send any letters. Through the conversation Rudeus learns that Aisha is really a natural born talent, and is extremely well spoken, well mannered, and knows a lot of useful information from her rigorous training under Lilia. After exhausting herself she fell asleep and a few hours later Ruijerd and Eris return but were unable to gather much information.

The next day a knight of the seventh price's imperial guard came to the inn Rudeus was staying at to guide him to Roxy. After reaching what he thought was Roxy's room, it turned out to be the seventh prince himself,
Pax Shirone
, and he was led into a trap. After entering the room Rudeus sees Lilia next to Pax, the prince, and then falls into the trapdoor that was set up causing him to be trapped inside a King tier barrier that prevents him from using any magic. Pax explains that he was holding Lilia and Aisha captive to lure Roxy to the palace so that he could then trap her, and force her to be his sex slave.

Pax then leaves Rudeus, but he was able to overhear his conversation with the knight who led Rudeus to the palace, Ginger, and learns that Pax is holding many of his knights families hostage to force them to do whatever he wants, which is why they are still looking for and trying to capture Aisha even when they are actually unwilling to do so, and are even falsifying reports claiming that the man who saved Aisha the previous day was a large brawny man. As Rudeus sits in captivity, he thinks about all the potential mistakes he made when listening to the Man-God's advice, and if things will truly work according to what the Man-God told him.

Chapter 5: The Third Prince

While Rudeus was trying to come up with a way to escape the King tier barrier, with absolutely no luck, the third Prince
Zanoba Shirone
 introduced himself to Rudeus. It turns out that Lilia still had Rudeus secret box containing a pair of Roxy's underwear that he stole, and Zanoba opened that box and noticed that the underwear were the same pair that Roxy was wearing in the statue of her that he bought. Zanoba thought that there must be some connection between Rudeus and the statue, and since he was absolutely obsessed with statues to the point of it being his only joy in life, he pledged his loyalty to Rudeus after discovering that he was indeed the creator of the figurine. Rudeus first order was for Zanoba to help him escape the barrier, causing Zanoba to tell Rudeus that he will be right back.

Chapter 6: A Speedy Resolution

Zanoba, as it turns out, was a Blessed Child. One who had a particular gift setting him apart from normal humans, abnormal strength. The strength to lift a full grown adult man up with just one hand and easily rip off his head even as a child, which he had done many times before giving him the nickname "Head-Ripping Prince". This allowed him to get Pax, bringing him to the room with the barrier with his hand on Pax's head, and threaten to rip his head off if he didn't release Rudeus, all so that he could save Rudeus, the wonderful doll maker. This plan worked wonderfully, and everyone was saved.

Rudeus also learned about how the soldier's families who were held hostage by Pax were rescued by Ruijerd, and that for all the trouble they caused both Pax and Zanoba were to be banished, under the pretext of studying abroad. Pax was sent to be a hostage in the King Dragon Realm, while Zanoba was sent
somewhere else
. And Lilia and Aisha were going to be personally escorted all the way to Paul by the soldiers who families were saved. Rudeus remarked that even though he felt like he was dancing in the palm of the Man-God to a  terrible tune, everything turned out perfect in the end.

Chapter 7: The Birth of My Little Sister, The Maid

At the small town inn, Rudeus and Lilia are sitting while Eris and Aisha talked about Rudeus and his capabilities in magic. Lilia thanks Rudeus for saving her back there in the castle, where he wants to give those gratitude to Ruijerd instead. Lilia asks Rudeus out of concern for Aisha, which he responds that she is exceptional at best. Lilia considers on letting Aisha go along with him but he does not want to as she is too young and she is too inexperienced. Lilia gives Rudeus the pendant given by Slyphy for his 10th birthday and Roxy's panties in the chest box, which Rudeus is thankful for. She hugged Rudeus behind her back, he tells her about her chest padded from his back while feeling smothered. Lilia says that he never changed at all with a small laugh she had.

Before Rudeus and his party departs, Aisha asked Rudeus a favor if he could take her along but Rudeus rejects her despite she wants go with him. Rudeus gives Aisha his forehead protector as a remembrance of him. Aisha talks about men wanting her body and making children to which Rudeus shrugs her off and tells her not to talk about those stuff. As she asks Rudeus about not mad at her for calling him a pervert, to which confuses him. She went back to the carriage and making a promise with him to see each other soon. Rudeus realize that Aisha tested him if she could trust him from her and her mother's rescue, calling her "a brilliant, clever little girl" while departing off from Shirone Kingdom.

 (
リーリャ
・
グレイラット
)
 is a maid of the
Greyrat household
. In her past, she was
Paul Greyrat
's classmate in a swordsman dojo before a crippling injury forces her to leave her position as a princess guard and she becomes a maid to Paul and
Zenith Greyrat
. After working through the revelation with the family, she is taken in as Paul's second wife and becomes closer friends with Zenith.

She usually wears a maid outfit, she wears oval-shaped glasses and hairband having lays on both sides.

Note: This section is under construction and revision
.

Personality

Most of the time, Lilia is emotionless because of her training in becoming a guard-maid, but shows more expressions after becoming
Paul Greyrat
's second wife and She also believes in superstitions like evil spirits.

Background

Lilia is the daughter of
Augusta
 and
Flute
 who owns a dojo of the
Water God Style
 in the Southern Region of Asura Kingdom. When Paul ran away from his home, he is taken in by Augusta with the intent of having him marry Lilia and take over the dojo because of his talent in the sword. But Paul refuses and when Paul is trying to escape, he ends up in Lilia's room where he rapes her before running away for good.






Lilia protecting Ariel from assassins



Lilia then becomes a guard-maid for the Silver Palace in
Asura Kingdom
. Usually doing a maid's job, but if there's anything that happens, they would pick a sword up to protect their master. Lilia faithfully accomplished her own duty. As a maid there were no complaints, but as a swords fighter, she only had average ability. Because of that, in a battle against the assassin who targeted
Ariel Anemoi Asura
 who was born not too long ago, from one moment of carelessness, she was slashed and injured on the leg by the opponent's short sword. Poison had been applied to the short sword. It was a poison specially made to assassinate royalty.

There was no antidote or
curing magic
 that could treat such a troublesome poison. The wound was immediately treated, thanks to the doctors trying out various methods to cure the poison, but even though her life was secured, there were side effects left from it. There were no problems in her everyday life, but she could never run or stomp with her full strength. The kingdom sacked her without hesitation. Lilia also accepted it. Losing her ability, it's a given to be sacked. Lilia left the capital. The mastermind behind the assassination attempt was not found. Lilia knew deeply of the rules in the concubine's palace and that she might become the next target. Or perhaps the kingdom purposely made Lilia leave to lure out the mastermind. She always wondered why she, who had no background, was accepted in the concubine's palace. Then she finally understood why: they only wanted to hire a maid who could be used and then discarded. Changing horse carriages, she arrived at
Fedoa
 on the far borders which had extensive agricultural lands besides the
Citadel of Roa
, the heart of this place where the ruler was living in, there were only extremely wide wheat fields, a quiet place.

Lilia intended to find work here. But being injured, she was unable to find a job based on strength. It's possible to teach sword dueling, but it's best to be hired as a maid, because the salary is higher. In that place, the number who can use and teach swordsmanship is high, but a maid who had been fully taught to handle house affairs is relatively uncommon. The salary will be higher when there is less competition. But getting hired by the ruler of Fedoa or any similar upper class noble is dangerous. The people of that level definitely had ties to the king. If they knew that she was a maid who worked for the concubine palace, there was a possibility that she would be treated as a tool for politics. And because of that, Lilia stayed far away. She didn't want to experience that kind of near-death situation again. Even though it was a little unfair to the princess, Lilia hoped to stay far away from the royals' contention for power. But if her salary was too low, there wouldn't be enough money sent to her family. Trying to find a safe job and guaranteed salary wasn't easy.

Lilia came across an advertisement note. In Fedoa's village of
Buena
, a lower class knight was hiring a maid. On the top of that, the note said it would give special priority to someone with experience in taking care of children and knowledge as a midwife.
Paul Greyrat
 employed Lilia without any fuss. It seemed that his wife
Zenith Greyrat
 was about to give birth, and he was very anxious. Lilia was fully taught in knowledge and technique for the princess's birth. Moreover, she was someone that he knew, and her birthplace was already known. Lilia was received with a warm welcome. Lilia's salary was more than what she had expected, and her wish was also achieved.
The child
 was born.

Plot

Infancy Period

After Lilia accepted the job as the maid of the
Greyrat family
 where she assists in giving birth to
Rudeus Greyrat
. But upon seeing Rudeus' face showing a perverted face, she take on an immediate dislike for Rudeus, thinking that he was a creepy child who made weird expressions especially when he was pressed against a woman's chest like he is possessed by an evil spirit. Despite getting along with Zenith, Lilia avoided Rudeus whenever she could, often turning the other way. Once, she had even found his box which had
Roxy Migurdia
's panties in it but she did not say anything about it.

Later in the volume, she had carried
Paul's child
, which was announced shortly after
Zenith Greyrat
's news that she was pregnant once more. It had come to a shock to everyone and she was willing to take the blame and get kicked out because it was she that had succumbed to temptation, and seduced Paul to bed with her but it is snowing at the time and travelling while pregnant is dangerous so Zenith was at a lost on what to do.

However, her attempt to shoulder the blame and move out was prevented by Rudeus who had made up the story that it was Paul that had taken advantage of her. It had left Paul in a precarious situation but it saved her to no longer have to move and Zenith was able accept her as a family member.

She had then felt indebted to Rudeus, the child she had always disliked, having no way to thank him because he was not obligated to do that for her, especially when he knew the truth clearer than anyone. He had saved her unconditionally and selflessly, saying that the child that was in her was still his sister.






Lilia and Aisha during the
Teleport Incident



Lilia, from that moment onwards decided to devote her life to serving him to repay her debt and also plans to raise Aisha to server Rudeus. She married Paul as the second wife as he was forced to take responsibility but she still remained the faithful maid of the Greyrats. Her child,
Aisha Greyrat
 was born a few hours after
Norn Greyrat
 healthily.

In
K417
, she was forcefully separated from the Greyrats due to the
Teleport Incident
 and was transported to the
Shirone Kingdom
 with her biological daughter.

Volume 6 - Juvenile Period - Homecoming Chapter

Lilia and
Aisha Greyrat
 officially reappeared and were declared alive and tries to get into contact with Roxy, not aware that she already left Shirone.

Approximately two and a half years after the happening of the
Teleport Incident
, it was told to
Rudeus Greyrat
 by
Hitogami
 that the mother and daughter pair were detained in the Kingdom. He immediately went to rescue them and was unfortunately captured by
Pax Shirone
.

Later, it was discovered that Lilia and Aisha had been transported right into the Royal Palace and were seen as foreign spies. They were sentenced to prison stay but by letting lose
Roxy Migurdia
's name, who had been a Royal Court Magician for a period of time in the
Shirone Kingdom
 and
Paul Greyrat
's name, they were spared and were sentenced to confinement.

When reports about the event had came in, they were to be free. However, the
7th Prince of the Shirone Kingdom
 interfered, capturing them once more and putting them into confinement. He had wanted to use Lilia and Aisha as bait to get Roxy back to the Kingdom and his attempts had not been fruitful because the news never reached Roxy.

During that time period, she had taught Aisha the ways of a maid, social etiquette and academic subjects in hopes that she would be competent to serve Rudeus, a method she thought was fitting because he had saved Aisha's life from having to live on the streets.

In the viewpoint of Rudeus, it was said that she had even taught Aisha who was only six in the arc to use her body (cuteness) to get what she wanted, saying that she did not need money to get the letter sent. Whether it was presumed that all letters or information about Paul would be paid for in advance or she was to seduce was not made clear.

When she had heard that Rudeus was captured, she had tried to save him but was only dragged away miserably by the guards. Due to her leg injury, she was less competent and could not hold against them.

She was later saved by Rudeus when Pax Shirone was arrested and when they reunited, she had presented him with the holy box that he very much treasured and received his heart-felt thanks. She had even asked if Aisha could accompany him and devote herself to him and was disappointed when he said that Aisha was better off with her parents than without.

She had reluctantly agreed to the situation, saying that Aisha needed more training before she was ready.

Power and Abilities

『Sword Techniques』






Lilia sparring in the Game



Lilia has attained Intermediate-ranked
Water God Style
 from training in her father,
Augusta
's dojo but it was not enough for her to be an instructor of the dojo. Because of this, Augusta has been training
Paul Greyrat
 who is talented in the sword and plans that he would marry Lilia so that they eventually inherit the dojo.

Trivia

Lilia apparently has a desire for Rudeus to show her daughter the same affection he shows to his wives.

It is later revealed in
Volume 9
 that the one Lilia protected and got injured for was princess
Ariel Anemoi Asura
.

Lilia lost her virginity to
Paul Greyrat
 when they were training at the dojo many years ago when Paul sexually assaulted her. In hindsight, however, she was glad it was to him rather than the fat nobles in the castle she worked at.

The Light novel version added the glasses for Lilia.

The names of Lilia's parents appear for the first time on a YouTube live stream about the
Mushuko Tensei

Mobile Game
.

 put them in check. Following their graduation, she ended up in debt and became a slave. Fortunately, Rudeus saved her by purchasing her, after which she became his maid.

Appearance

Linia has short, grey hair with a pair of cat ears and a tail of the same color. Like many females of her tribe, she has large breasts.

Personality

Linia is an arrogant, boisterous and frivolous person who likes to flaunt her authority to people beneath her. She is very impulsive and easily provoked, but is quick to submit to and flatter people who are much more powerful. She is also clumsy and tend to overestimate her abilities, which sometimes led her into trouble.

Despite appearing nonchalant, she does care about her friends, shown when she asked
Rudeus
 to take
Pursena
 as a caretaker of
Leo
.

Background

Due to the fact that the most recent two generations of the chief's family aren't bright enough, her
grandfather
 sent her to the
Ranoa Magic Academy
 along with Pursena, in hope that they would gain knowledge and wisdom in a place where their influence is less effective. However, because of her linage as a Royalty of the Beast Race, Linia was treated with great care and became pampered. Linia with
Pursena
 became arrogant and acted like delinquents, committing various offences like playing truant, bullying, and extortion. Many beast race delinquents joined their ranks, and their gang became the biggest troublemaker in the school.

In her second year,
Ariel
,
Fitts
 and
Luke
 enroll in the
Ranoa Magic Academy
 and gain greater influence than that of Linia and
Pursena
, which lead to them trying to beat the fresh-blood in order to gain back influence, but that failed miserably as
Fitts
 single-handedly defeated Linia,
Pursena
 and their gang. She and Pursena are humbled for good and shape-up to become model students after their temporary imprisonment in Rudeus's dorm. In contrast to the calm and collected Pursena, Linia is more emotional and hot-tempered.

Plot

After graduating she become a peddler selling goods from Asura to the North and vice-versa. However she gained her funds through loaning, eventually she found herself unable to pay her loans and thus she was taken into custody and turned into a slave. One day she escaped and run away, she was then found by
Eris
 and decided to help her. She was then picked up by
Eris
 to become her pet. She then later helps set up and joins the
Rude Mercenary Company
 to help pay off her debt to
Rudeus Greyrat
 after he bought her to stop her from getting sold off to an Asuran Noble.

Trivia

Linia ends her sentences with
Nya
 (ニャ), or
mew
 in English, a common trait among cat beastfolks in Japanese fantasy works.

There is a number of hints that she is fond of
Rudeus
. Whenever he sexually harasses her, she does not resist and occasionally even tempts him to do so.

Linia's (リニア) true name is Lineana (リニアーナ) and Linia is her nickname
. Her true name was first mentioned in
Light Novel Volume 4
 Chapter 9, but never seen again.

The total value of the fine alcohol that
Pilemon Notos Greyrat
 gifted to Ariel (the one Rudeus gifted to the Demon King Atoferatofe) is double the price he paid to buy Linia as a slave (300*10 Asuran Gold Coins).

Later on confirmed that's Eris's "domination" of her is simply hugging her until she bruises.

Luke Notos Greyrat
==================

Luke holding a sword to Ariel's throat.



Luke Notos Greyrat
 (
ルーク
・
ノトス
・
グレイラット
)
 is
Rudeus'
 cousin and the personal knight to princess
Ariel Anemoi Asura
 alongside court mage
Fitts
. Despite being connected to such major characters, he himself only has a minor supporting role; a womanizer and mediocre knight.

Appearance

Luke is tall, well-built and extremely good looking. He has brown hair and wears it in a combed back style. A standard Ikemen, or cool handsome guy.

Note: This section is under construction and revision

Personality

Luke is a playboy and, like the rest of the Notos Greyrat family, has a fetish for large boobs.

Although he plays around with most girls, he treats his liege, Ariel Anemoi Asura with utmost reverence, with her safety and well-being as his top priority.

Luke also treats
Fitts
 as a colleague and friend instead of a girl to fool around with.

Tricked by
Hitogami
, he considered Rudeus as his enemy and lost reason. However, Ariel was, in the end, able to bring him back to his senses.

Note: This section is under construction and revision
.

Background

Luke was born into the Notos Greyrat family as an Asura Kingdom high noble. He was tasked at a very young age into the appointment of being the Guardian Knight of second princess Ariel Anemoi Asura alongside Derrick Redbat.

He was very fervent in his duties as a guardian despite his frivolous attitude to girls and his mediocre skills. He was so loyal that he sacrificed himself for his charge when they were attacked in the garden by a terminate boar. Sword-less, he tried to protect Ariel despite knowing that he could not win, even after he saw Derrick killed in front of him.

After being saved by Sylphy, who was teleported to them due to the metastasis event, he continued to guard Princess Ariel with Sylphy who was Silent-Fitts.

Note: This section is under construction and revision
.

Plot

Luke Notos Greyrat does not appear many times in the first half of the volumes. However, starting with Volume 8, Luke takes a much larger role in the main cast. He serves as the primary knight to Princes Ariel, and a close friend and coworker to Sylphiette. During the earlier portions of Volumes 8 and 9, Luke primarily antagonizes Rudeaus, who he believes is a bad influence on Sylphy, and due to his status as the son of Paul Notos Greyrat, who is Luke's uncle.

During the latter half of Volume 9, Luke's opinion of Rudeaus change. Realizing the state of Sylphy's love for Rudy, he provides her with a powerful aphrodesiac in order to potentially heal his Erectile Dysfunction.

Tensions rise with Princes Ariel and her faction, and in order to potentially sway votes in her favor, Luke goes to Rudeaus to ask him to join them. Rudy had already pledged his alegience to Ariel and Luke for their assistance in both curing his illness, and allowing him to marry Sylphiette, essentially releasing her from her duty to them (Though Sylphy stays as one of Ariel's personal Bodyguards). Rudeaus accepts, and not much happens in regards to Luke until the begining of Volume 17.

During the events of Volume 17, Luke is visited by Hitogami, who tells him that he should be weary of Rudeaus's betrayal, along with general, vague, advice about keeping Ariel safe during their travels. It is heavily implied that Hitogami also tells him things about Pilemon Notos Greyrat, Luke's father, deceiving him about his father's position with Ariel's faction. This is understood as when Ariel's caravan was attacked by assassins in the second act of Volume 17, Luke is incredibly supprised and even a bit shaken by the Notos Seal being on the armor of their attackers.

In the Third Act of Volume 17, after being held hostage by the Water God, Luke watches his father being belittled by Princes Ariel. Pilemon's betrayal of her faction needed to be punished, so Ariel asked Luke for his blade to execute his father. At this, Luke snaps, going mad and taking the Princes hostage instead, holding his sword to her throat. Though it is not seen by the others in the room, he is holding the side of his blade there as to not hurt the princes. Eventually, when Rudeaus walks in, Luke tells Sylphiette that she would need to kill Rudy in order to save Ariel's life. Sylphiette refuses, and eventually, the tension lowers. Luke releases Ariel, and believes that his proper punishment is to be executed. However Ariel pardons him, and in turn, his father as well.

Power and Abilities

Despite being Princess Ariel's guard, Luke's skills are stated to be mediocre. However, he makes up for it with sheer loyalty, not hesitating to sacrifice his own life for his liege.

Trivia

In the web novel, Luke became the leader of the
Seven Knights of Asura
.

Luke was supposed to fall madly in love with
Eris
 and end up being a happy couple together in the original timeline. This was made impossible by Rudeus' involvement in the current timeline, but he still fell in love with Eris at the first sight.

Luke was the first person who danced with Eris at her 10
th
 Birthday

Because he doesn't possess strong fate, Hitogami is able to use him to see Rudeus' action in
Volume 17
.

Luke indirectly contributed in curing Rudeus' ED by giving one of his aphrodisiac potions to Sylphy.

Lunaria to Laplace

Lunaria
 (
ルナリア
,

Runaria
)
 is the
Original Human God
's daughter and the wife of the
First Dragon God
. She is also the mother of
Orsted
.

Personality

Laplace
 describes Lunaria as a caring and kind person who treats everyone around her like family despite initially being disliked by the Dragon Tribe who quesions why the First Dragon God would marry someone outside the Dragon Tribe. After a century or so, Lunaria was ever-benevolent like a goddess that when talking to her, everyone felt an unusual peace which lead to her being accepted and adored by all the Dragon Tribe like one of their own.

Background

"I did not love Lunaria, but she did her best for the Dragon World. She used her power as a scion of daughter to enrich the Dragon World."

-First Dragon God

Lunaria became the wife of the First Dragon God at the suggestion of the Human God. By the time Lunaria became pregnant, the First Dragon God realizes that she seemed more special than the
Dragon Tribe
 and grew to love her that he always spends time with her when he is home.
 When the First Dragon God brings Laplace to their home, Lunaria welcomes him and stays by his side, watching over him serenely but lets the servants take care of his other needs despite her own child is about to be born which makes Laplace view her like his mother as well.

"Fufufu. Husband, please give the child a name."

-Lunaria

For the next decades, Lunaria's belly would grow and Laplace would become a Dragon Warrior to which Lunaria arranges a celebration and would listen to his stories about the different dragons he has trained and is becoming known throughout the Dragon World for his accomplishments. Lunaria gives birth to Orsted when cooperation and peace is has been made by the other Gods to which the First Dragon God and Laplace are on the meeting. By the time they have returned, the celebration has already started and Lunaria presents Orsted to the First Dragon God who rushed to the mansion upon realizing what has happened and Lunaria asks that he names their son. The First Dragon God surprisingly did not give his son's name yet then the Five Dragon Generals also came and is impressed by the child that leaves them with a solemn expression and soon the other Gods also arrives at the Dragon World to give their blessings. When the festival is nearly over, Demon Emperor
Kirisis Calisis
 arrives and Lunaria welcomes her close friend with a smile and lets her see the child to which Kirisis states that he will become a smart and wise man in the future.

With the relationship with the Demon World steadily improving and no signs of conflict from the other worlds as well, this is seen as the peaceful era in the six worlds until the fateful day where Lunaria is found dead in a pool her own blood in the middle of her room.

Legacy

"I can't forgive the one who killed Lunaria. I'm still trembling with unprecedented rage... Even if we turn other worlds into enemies, will you follow me?"

-First Dragon God to Laplace

The First Dragon God and Laplace finds Lunaria dead in a fetal position protecting her child until the end.

At the sight of Lunaria's remains, the First Dragon God's roar is heard in the entire Dragon World and his fist covered with Dragon Battle Aura punches a hole that blew off a solid chunk of Dragon Roar Mountain.

The First Dragon God commands the Dragon Generals to search for the murderer but asks Laplace to stay and mourn with him.

A Dragon Tribe funeral is first held where Lunaria's remains is carried to the center of Kayos by family members namely the First Dragon God and Laplace to be placed on an altar where eulogies are recited and prayer for a safe rebirth.

Lunaria's remains are then brought to the end of the city to begin a funeral procession where her remains is carried by the Dragon God and accompanied by his son who is carried by Laplace moving in a clock-wise direction around the city.

The Dragon Tribe in the city performs the salute of highest honor upon seeing the procession and attend the funeral by assembling in its inner perimeter.

The First Dragon God brings Lunaria's remains to a building with walls filled with names of Dragon Tribes who died but Lunaria's name is carved on a stone tablet which is for special people in the Dragon Tribe.

The Dragon Tribe's funeral rites concludes with the remains being cast in to a hole that leads to the sky but a Human funeral is conducted next for Lunaria.

The First Dragon God brings Lunaria to the garden beside his mansion and burns Lunaria and together with Laplace, they buried her bones and ashes into the ground then planted a small sapling above will grow into a tree through the power of the dead and while the tree lives, the living would never forget the dead.

The Dragon Generals give their report from their investigation of Lunaria's murder which lists suspects from the other worlds to which the First Dragon God decides to confront them and wage war against the other worlds.

After the death of the Beast God, Heaven God, Sea God and Demon God which also destroys their respective world at the hands the First Dragon God, he orders the attack on the
Human World
 next that shocks the Dragon Generals on why he would attack Lunaria's home world and decides to stop the First Dragon God that resulted into a battle.

After the battle, the Human God struck the First Dragon God and admits that he plotted the death of Lunaria and how he manipulated them all to wage war on the other worlds and eventual destruction.

All living beings existing in the
Six-Faced World
 innately have mana in their body. Souls normally dissipate into mana after death and can get reincorporated into the environment. The only known exception to this is people from outside the Six-Faced World that have been summoned. Summoned people are incapable of holding mana inside their body, thus incapable of using magic.

Mana or magical power reserve of a person is generally believed to be inherited and the amount one has is determined at birth. Due to the existence of individuals with the
Laplace Factor
 (such as
Rudeus
 and
Sylphy
) having enormous amounts of aggregate mana that increased since their birth, they were considered to be the only exception. This is later proved to be incorrect and not linked to the Laplace Factor. All people are capable of increasing their aggregate mana amount by stimulating their mana from a young age (seen in
Julie
). The ability to learn silent spell-casting is also linked to practicing the skill at a young age.

History

Long before the
Great Human-Demon War
, the world was engulfed in an unceasing spiral of battle and chaos. During that time, in order to fight their enemies the
High Elves
 race entreated with the spirits of the forests to control natural inorganic elements like the wind and the earth. In this manner, the first magic spells were born. Modern form of magic took its form from humans imitating the spells used by the High Elves in battle and reworking them to convenience. Magic was mostly used only in battle and fending off obstacles. As a result, a large portion of the spells that came to exist are combat spells.

Mechanism

Conventional Spell-casting

Magic Spells

Magic Spells
 (
詠唱
,

Eishō
, alt. "Incantations")
, in this method, one recites a set of words to perform magic. Magic Spells acts as an activation trigger for magic, where uttering the words would create the effect without having to focus on the
Mana
 coursing through one's body. As such, magic spells are much less flexible than silent spell-casting due to a restricted amount of control one has while tuning the magic.

Magic Spells are the common method for using magic as it is relatively easy to use. A
magician
 typically uses magic spells from when they were a beginner all the way to when they became a master.

Magic Circle
 (
魔法陣
,

Mahō-jin
)
 invented by Demon Empress
Kirisis Calisis
, this method involves one inscribing patterns using a specialized ink or carved patterns to cast a spell. Magic circles cast the inscribed spell at a predetermined power whenever mana is poured into it. Because of this, magic circles have the least flexibility of all spell-casting methods, albeit being the easiest and fastest to use.

Depending on the kind of Magic and rank, a Magic Circle's can be larger but its work around is to create multiple layers of Magic Circles on a single plane to achieve a single spell.

Earlier, magic circles were widely used until one magician succeeded at greatly shortening incantations. But for the more complex rituals involved in Summoning magic, where greater efficiency wasn't attainable, magic circles remained the primary means.

Mixed Magic

Mixed Magic
 (
混合魔術
,

Kongō majutsu
)
 or Combined Magic is magic where the caster uses consecutive spells to alter or enhance the effects of a single spell. Spells such as Dry Steaming (Wind and Fire) and Frost Nova (Wind and Water/Ice) are examples of melded magic. Melded magic is exclusive to attack magic; these are familiar and easy to piece together with basic knowledge of science.

Truncated Spell-casting

Truncated or shortened incantations are very similar to conventional spell-casting; the caster recites a predetermined set of words corresponding the magic they are using. With shortened incantations, as used by
Roxy
 and Rudeus, cast times and flexibility are drastically improved over conventional casting. The casting of melded magic also becomes much easier due to the reduced downtime between incantations.

Silent Spell-casting

Silent spell-casting or Incantation-less spell-casting involves the caster manipulating mana itself in order to produce the desired effect. This method, unlike incantation and magic circles, does not require preparation for invocation as the caster only needs strong imaginative power to mold mana to their will.

It follows a process the caster calculates in their mind: First, the caster calls forth the shape of the spell they wish to use. Next, there is a window of time where they can add additional magical power to impact its size. Third, the velocity of the spell with which it will travel is adjusted. Finally, the caster releases the finished spell from their hand.

Silent spell-casting is a particularly unorthodox method of performing magic for almost no mages are able to completely skip the incantation. Since the process is convoluted and relies heavily on the caster's understanding of the spell, until the birth of Rudeus Greyrat, this method of spell-casting is not formally taught anywhere. However
Roxy M. Greyrat
 wrote a paper detailing the specifics of voiceless magic and began to introduce silence spell casting into standard magic curriculum, which helped give rise to many prominent mages.

Main Category:

Attacking Magic

Attacking Magic
 (
攻撃魔術
,

Kōgeki majutsu
)
 is comprised of spells that manipulate mana into tangible elements. The power, speed, effective range, and area of these spells are dependent on the amount of mana poured into them.

It is divided into four schools:

Fire
: Generate fire/heat.

Water
: Generates water and in extension, ice and steam (melded with fire magic).

Wind
: Manipulates gases.

Earth
: Generates earth, Manipulates earth and minerals.

Healing Magic

Healing Magic
 (
治癒魔術
,

Chiyu majutsu
)
 mainly comprises of spells used for healing injuries and removing toxins.

It is further divided into four schools:

Spell rankings are typically proportionate to the amount of mana necessary to cast the spell. There are exceptions however, such as with
Badigadi
 and
Orsted
, Rudeus's magic is considered to be of a higher rank despite using lower ranked magic as the base.

It has been stated that only 1 in 20 people is born with the capacity of using mana and of those, only 1 in 20 is capable of learning how to master it and becoming a mage. However, only 1 in a 100 of those is actually capable of becoming an advanced magician in only 1 element.

The magician's ranking title is determined by the most advanced spell they could cast.

Diseases

Since the Human-Demon Wars, there are also several magic related diseases that are known to exist and in time the denizens of the Human World became immune to it or a way to treat them has been discovered.

Magic Stone Disease

Magic Stone Disease is an extremely rare magical virus that turns that kills its host by gradually turning it to a purple magic stone starting from their feet and eventual death upon reaching half of their body at the very least.

Drain Syndrome

Drain Syndrome is a magical illness first found in Humans from the early ages into the Laplace Wars that affects a child born with out any magic capacity who absorbs magic externally and after accumulating it for 10 years, they will fall ill and die.

Trivia

The number of magicians capable of using shortened or silent spell-casting are very few because the method was previously unknown.
Roxy
,
Rudeus
,
Sylphy
 and
Moore
 were the few individuals capable of using the silent spell-casting method before it was popularized by Rudeus.

It is stated by
Future Rudeus
 that, "Magic in this world is omnipotent. Once you realize that, you can essentially do anything."

Many attack magics function by converting mana into physical substances. It appears that the materials manifested take a while to stabilize, as evidenced by the fact that projectiles from attack magic can be disintegrated by using manatite stone, but figurines created by Rudeus aren't affected
.

Magic Circles of the Sixth Floor
.

Magic Circles of the Sixth Stratum
 (第六階層の魔法陣)
Dai Roku Kaisō no Mahō-jin
) is the Twenty-first episode of the
second season
 (45th overall)
Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on June 2, 2024 and also the third episode of the
Labyrinth Arc
 for the Anime.

Synopsis

Rudeus
,
Paul
 and the other members of the
Fangs of the Black Wolf
 party successfully rescues Roxy, who somehow survives alone in the Teleportation Labyrinth for a whole month so they decide to return to the city of Rapan for Roxy to recover. Although he was concerned about Roxy's occasional aloofness, Rudeus enjoyed reminiscing about the past. Three days later, they once again enter the Teleportation Labyrinth and at an increased progress in conquering each of the floors!

Plot

At the Third Floor of the Teleportation Labyrinth, Roxy continue finding an exit while marking the walls of the path she walked as she battles or avoids the
Tarantula Deathlords
 she encounters. After stepping into a Teleportation
Magic Circle
, Roxy ends up at the same place that already has multiple markings. Despite being exhausted she still wants to pursue her dreams of being a teacher and to have a family like her
father

mother
. Still considering that death is imminent, Roxy steps in the Teleportation Magic Circle once again.

After using
Frost Nova
 on the monsters that cornered Roxy, Rudeus is relieved then embraces a surprised Roxy and breathes in her scent. She pushes him back since she smells but Rudeus doesn't mind. Roxy then thanks him and introduces herself, causing Rudeus to drop his
staff
 and throw up in shock.

The party decides to head back to Rapan for Roxy to recover where Talhand carries Roxy on his back while Rudeus follows behind her reminiscing how Roxy has not after not seeing her for over
10 years
. After Rudeus explains why he threw up, Roxy explains that she did not recognize the Rudeus she knew back then to the Rudeus she sees now which relieves Rudeus but also realizes that
Sylphiette
 must have been shocked as well that he does not recognize her in their
reunion
 and plans to apologize to her when he returns.

At the inn, Lilia, Shierra, and Vierra welcome the party back, and are relieved that Roxy has returned. Rudeus later sneaks up on Roxy's room who is still asleep to check on her.

Days later, Roxy apologizes for the trouble she caused, but Paul tells her not to be bothered by it and then tells her to thank Rudeus for breaking through the walls and saving her in time. Rudeus accepts Roxy's thanks but also asks him to call him "Rudy" like she used to as he still considers her to be his master. Geese then discusses his plan to enter the Teleportation Labyrinth in 3 days so Roxy would not be affected by a curse that will prevent her from entering the labyrinth but Rudeus thinks at that it is his original world's version of trauma. Paul then gives Roxy the
"An Exploratory Account of the Teleportation Labyrinth" book
 to study and the meeting concludes for the preparation of their next attempt.

As Roxy is reading the book, Rudeus is restless and moves around causing Roxy to call him that he is distracting her but asks him to explain to which Rudeus quickly agrees. As they read through the book, Rudeus notices that Roxy seems tense but concludes that she might be conscious of how tall he has become.

Back at the Third Floor of the Teleportation Labyrinth the party now with Roxy included, they battle through the hordes of
Iron Crawlers
, Deathlord Tarantulas and
Mad Skulls
 but Rudeus notices that Roxy seems to be looking at him then looks away then the latter calls to take a break as she is out of
Mana
.

As the party is taking a break, Geese continues studying the book while trying to figure out where the Teleportation Magic Circle to the fourth floor is located. After Roxy leans on Rudeus' back to rest, she also asks that they explore a Labyrinth together sometime in the future that Rudeus immediately agrees as Roxy goes to sleep.

The party then enters the Fourth Floor that looks more like a ruin than an ant nest where Paul confirms their plan with Geese to explore the floor for a bit before returning to Rapan. As Rudeus internally complements Paul to be reliable but Paul alerts him that a pair of
Armored Warriors
 are approaching. Rudeus declares he will use
Stone Cannon
 on them but Roxy stops him since they can use
Water God Style
 to counter his spells and suggests to provide support for now. After Rudeus tells them he will use
Quagmire
, Elinalise tells Paul which target to attack as the enemies sink due to Rudeus' Quagmire. As Paul and Elinalise engage the warriors, Roxy to coordinate their magic where she uses
Icicle Edge
 then Rudeus uses Stone Cannon that defeats the Armored Warrior battling Elinalise while Paul finishes off the other. Rudeus complements Paul who seems to be stronger but the latter dismisses it and urges everyone to move forward while passing Elinalise who chuckles at how Paul looks very happy for being praised by his son.

The party leaves the Teleportation Labyrinth and upon reaching the outside, they discuss what supplies they need for to deal with the armored enemies while Rudeus is wondering if Zenith will be okay with the pace they are going but notices Roxy looks at him but immediately looks away.

At Rapan, Rudeus and Roxy are together where they purchase the talfro root while discussing what other supplies they will need. Rudeus then tests out a sword that when he thrusts it, a shockwave is produced to knock back its target that Roxy mentions it will be perfect for Elinalise but they cannot afford it.

At the Pub, Roxy details her journey that shocks Rudeus that they
missed each other
 when they were at
Wind Port
 and Rudeus is glad that she was searching for his
family
. Roxy then tells her past on her time in
Ranoa Magic Academy
 then she was hired by Paul and she has changed because of her time in
Buena Village
 and affirms that they will rescue
Zenith
.

Next day, back at the Fourth Floor, Elinalise tests out her newly purchased
Gladius
 and is satisfied with its performance after cleanly cutting through an Armored Warrior. Having easily progressed through the Fourth Floor, Geese has already charted a map for the fourth floor and confirmed that the room they are on should have the Teleportation Magic Circle to the fifth floor and the party move forward.

At the Fifth Floor, Geese burns a talfro root like incense where its smoke causes the
Devouring Devils
 to run away and Geese is pleased by its potency and accuracy of the book, prompting Paul to decide not to return to Rapan and continue exploring.

At the Sixth Floor, the party is on alert since can sense the
Guardian
 is nearby. Geese is scouting the final room that has three Teleportation Magic Circles and mentions that this is as far the author of the book have reached so Rudeus volunteers to analyze the Magic Circles. Roxy questions if he has figured it out, but Rudeus has not yet. He mentions that
Nanahoshi Shizuka
 might be able to solve it. Roxy then asks if she is his girlfriend, which Rudeus denies, much to Roxy's relief. Rudeus then details his findings that one of the circles is a trap that leaves one of the remaining two will teleport them to the seventh floor as the party concludes that its like a coin flip chance to get there. When asked, Geese details that the party always fails at coin flips unless
Ghislaine Dedoldia
, who is currently at the
Holy Land of Swords
 makes the choice. This Rudeus volunteers to conduct further investigations before they decide.

At a glance, the room looks special but Rudeus believes that the floor doesn't end here. Paul disagrees, with nothing to base it on, but still encourages Rudeus to take his time. Paul then grabs Rudeus' shoulder, planning to tell him something, but after glancing at Roxy, he decides to tell Rudeus after they return to the inn. Rudeus presses Paul, but he still refuses, concerned it might hurt the party's morale. Instead, Paul tells him the different functions of his
two

swords
 that he cannot use only one due to their different roles. As Paul returns to the rest of the party, Rudeus realizes that the room is similar to the room from the ruins that he and Elinalise entered that has the
Teleportation Magic Circle
 to Begaritt Continent.

Rudeus then asks Geese to check if there are any hidden stairs and while initially in doubt, Geese also realizes that it is possible and begins to investigate. Geese brings out his short sword and begins tapping the floor with its pommel while his ear is on the ground and finds a hollow floor. After Geese confirms there are no traps, Rudeus destroys the said hollow floor with Stone Cannon, and the stairs are uncovered. Geese announces the finding, and the party rises to their feet in astonishment and amazement. They take turns slapping Rudeus' back in praise, while Elinalise remarks that the room is indeed the same as the ruins they entered before. Roxy also follows suit with a lighter tap. After Geese scouts the stairs, the party descends together, approaching the Teleportation Magic Circle, which is glowing in deep blood red.

Magic Spells
 (
詠唱
,

Eishō
, alt. "Incantations")
 are the various supernatural effects created by the art of Magic by utilizing
Mana
 residing inside a body. Magic Spells are divided into three categories, namely: Attack, Healing, and Summoning magic. Attack Magic has largest number of spells while Summoning has the least.

Melded Magic are a high-tier category where the spells are a composite of at least two or more Attack spells. Mastery of this type of spells require at least Advanced level proficiency at one school of Attack magic.

Special Magic are those type of spells which do not fit into the three main categories. This type of spell cannot be taught normally to a mage and its mastery is generally unique to a handful of persons.

Magic Stone Disease
===================

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Magic Stone Disease
, also known as
Petrification Syndrome
, is an extremely rare
Magic
 disease that turns the body of the infected into magic stone.

Background

Magic Stone Disease is known to exist in the
Human World
 since the Human-Demon Wars or earlier, when
Kishirika Kishirisu
 was ruling as the Demon Empress. She has knowledge of this disease, that is also passed to those who are given her
Identification Eyes
 in recent times
.

Cause

"I have no idea where the rat came from or when it got down there. Most likely, it sneaked into my luggage from the
Demon Continent
 or while I was in
Perugius
' floating fortress. It doesn't really matter where it came from, though."

-Future Rudeus

Rats are the main carriers of Magic Stone Disease because some of them have resistance to it but will eventually die eventually. These infected rats can be identified easily by their teeth that turns into violet crystal. Humans or other animals could also be infected by consuming the contaminated food eaten by these rats.

Infection

The pathogen of Magic Stone Disease is not airborne and infects orally, but it doesn't persist for very long and it disappears around a day, resulting in a very low infection rate. Moreover, it only infects pregnant women. When infected, the pathogen grows inside the fetus and proceeds to remold it into magic stone, which results in the death of the growing baby. At this point the mother also begins to exhibit symptoms of the disease, such as having fever and becoming bedridden. Finally, the body of the mother would start turning into magic stone (beginning from her feet), and she would also die in a few weeks if left untreated
.

Treatment

Magic Stone Disease is only curable by God Rank Detoxification Magic. The only book for the chant of God Rank Detoxification Magic belongs to the
Milis Religion
 in
Millishion
, where they have exclusive rights to it and is only made available for archbishop rank or above. Transcribing the book takes time since it is as thick as a dictionary, whereas stealing it would result in the perpetrators being labelled as the worst criminals by the Milis Religion and hunted down for life by Millishion's Holy Knight Orders
.

History

"The fact that after changing history this way, in the end a favorable future for him awaits... Thus I will make you change history, to a future that will be favorable to me."

-Orsted to Rudeus

Hitogami
 plotted to kill future
Roxy Migurdia
 and her unborn
child
 through the rat infected with Magic Stone Disease. Since pregnancy weakens those who have a strong
Fate
 that Hitogami cannot manipulate easily otherwise.

Cliff Grimoire
 identifies the disease and together with
Zanoba Shirone
, Rudeus infiltrates the Millis Church and steals the book of God Rank Detoxification Magic in hopes to cure Roxy.

Being hunted by the Holy Knights Order of Millishion resulting in the death of Cliff and Roxy still dies in the end, resulting to Hitogami's plan to succeed.
 .

30 years later,
Future Rudeus
 realized how Hitogami used the Magic Stone Disease to kill Roxy and travelled back in
time
 to warn his
younger self
.

Future Rudeus died after talking with Rudeus, who later went to the basement and killed the rat before it could infect the food Roxy will eat, and later sent its remains to the
Magician Guild
 for study
.

Hitogami confronted Rudeus in his dreams for the failed plan to kill Roxy, but agreed to a compromise if Rudeus kills
Orsted
.

Rudeus was defeated by Orsted and became his subordinate against Hitogami, while Orsted agreed to protect his family to ensure Hitogami is prevented from targeting Rudeus'
Family
.

List of Magic Potions

Mana Recovery Therapy (Magic Potion)

Five years after the final battle with Geese. Rudeus has been researching mana recovery to improve Orsted’s mana recovery rate. Eventually, he produced a potion that restored mana, but for some reason, Orsted’s mana didn’t recover.

Possibly because of the difference in the quality of mana between the human race and dragon race or an entirely different reason.

The potion itself was quite popular among the adventurers so their true intentions weren't completely in vain.

The mana potion became such a great success that the era of swordsmen being the strongest ended. Not only that, but it was helpful in improving the magician’s social status as well.

Aphrodisiac






Mushoku Tensei Anime - Season 2 Episode 12: It’s an image of the aphrodisiac tonic that Rudy and Sylphy drank when they were about to have intercourse.



It was made in the Fittoa Region. It's made from the petals of the Batirusu flower and Philip Boreas Greyrat had a monopoly on the purification method.

After the teleportation incident, the production of the product discontinued. Because the formula is a mystery and the Aphrodisiac is considered a rare product by the public. A single bottle cost fifteen Asura Gold Coins. After the mana disaster, the Aphrodisiac currently costs one hundred Asura Gold Coins on the high end.

Trivia

Atofe mistakenly thought that 『Magic Armor Mk I 』 was the Fighting God Armor but, later on realized it wasn't and comment that it has the power and speed equaling Fighting God Armor.

The
『Zariff's Prosthetic arm』has the strength to restrain Zanoba's Miko Power.

The Magic Stone of
『Arrogant Water Dragon King』is worth over 100 Asuran gold coins. The stone is worth over 100 Asuran gold coins.

Aphrodisiac is considered a rare product by the public. A single bottle cost fifteen Asura gold coins. After the mana disaster, the Aphrodisiac currently costs one hundred Asura gold coins on the high end.

Mana
====

Mana
 (
魔力
,

Maryoku
, lit. "Magical Power")
 is a form of energy that exists in
Mushoku Tensei
. It is the source of all
magic
 and is comparable to energy in our world. Mana exists in almost every aspect of the
Six-Faced World
.

Background

All living beings (
humans
 and other
Races
, including
Monsters
 and plants) have mana within their bodies. However, beings like
Nanahoshi Shizuka
 are unable to hold mana within their bodies since they have tripped into the world but this mana externally accumulates over time, until their body begins to react negatively to it which is referred to as
Drain Syndrome
.

According to the
Dragon Tribe
 researchers' hypothesis: a power possessed by every living creature permeates the Six Worlds which is called
Dragon Battle Aura
 by the Dragon Tribe while the Demons call it
Mana
 or Magic Power that is said to maintain a natural equilibrium within the Six Worlds. However, the power of the Six Worlds suddenly declined, creating significant imbalances. If the power diminishes significantly in one world, it'll absorb power from another world to compensate which results to the teleport incident, causing not only trees and animals but also people to disappear.

Mana Flow





Mana in the
Anime
 depicted as a yellow and orange matter flowing through the body



Like blood, Mana circulates throughout the body of every living being.

Because of the internal constant Mana flow (which, like
Disturb Magic
, disrupts the formation of other flows), it is impossible to materialize magic inside the body. Every living being in the Six-Faced World has a similar protection. The notable exceptions are Elinalise, who can transform the naturally accumulating mana in her body into a magic stone because of her curse, and those afflicted with Magic Stone Disease, which forcibly transforms their bodies into magic stones.

Magic

Magic is the manipulation of mana. It can be classified into the following: Attack magic (basic elements), Healing magic (buff/debuff), Summoning. Furthermore, unorthodox magic that is difficult to classify under the three main categories are referred to as unique magic (or original magic in cases of innovation, such as Electric).

It should be noted that while magic does seem to follow the law of conservation of energy, it demonstrably doesn't. Otherwise, Rudeus' mass would be equivalent to that of his body, plus the total mass that can be generated with his mana.

Mana Capacity

Mana capacity refers to the total amount of mana a person can store and use for
Magic Spells
 and
Battle Aura
. It's analogous to the concept of a reservoir holding water: the larger the reservoir, the more water it can hold, and the longer it can sustain the flow.

A person's magical power reserve, or mana, is generally believed to be inherited, and the amount one has is determined at birth. Individuals with the
Laplace Factor
, such as
Rudeus
 and
Sylphy
, have enormous amounts of aggregate mana that has increased since birth; therefore, they are considered the only exception. However, this was later proven incorrect; it is not linked to the Laplace Factor. Anyone can increase their total mana by stimulating it from a young age, as seen with
Julie
.

A person with a larger mana capacity can cast more powerful spells or a greater number of weaker spells before exhausting their reserves. This can be a significant advantage in combat situations, allowing one to sustain their attacks or unleash devastating blows.

Rudeus Greyrat
 possesses a massive mana capacity, estimated to be several times larger than the average magician. This allows him to cast powerful spells and perform feats of magic beyond the capabilities of most individuals.

Roxy Migurdia
 possesses a smaller mana capacity compared to Rudeus but excels in efficiency and control. This allows her to cast highly precise spells with minimal waste of energy.

Orsted
 possesses an immense mana capacity.

Individuals with the
Laplace Factor
, like Rudeus and
Sylphiette
, have enhanced magic aptitude and much greater mana capacity than most magicians.

Mana capacity is not the only factor that determines the effectiveness of a mage. Other aspects like talent, skill, and knowledge can also play a significant role.

The series does not provide a specific measurement unit for mana capacity, making direct comparisons between characters somewhat ambiguous.

Roxy Migurdia

Summary

While initially unimpressed by Rudeus's standing, Roxy begins his training to see his potential as mage. But with his agoraphobia from his old life still lingering, Rudy convinces Roxy to confine the training to the backyard instead where Rudeus using wordless magic convinces Roxy he would be worthwhile to teach. With Roxy's magic training in the morning and swordplay with Paul in the afternoon, Roxy also teaches Rudeus general knowledge of the world; Rudeus discovers that Roxy is from the magic race of the demon continent. Given her hair color, Rudeus' parents were probably afraid of her when she first arrived because her hair sometimes looks green under the sun, which would be similar to the Superd race- a dangerous and ferocious race from the last war. Despite Roxy's distaste for it, Rudeus decided to refer to Roxy as "Master" in his heart. Over the next two years, Rudeus continued his training under Roxy and improved his spells. When the family celebrates Rudeus' fifth birthday, overwhelmed by the love and celebration since his last had none of that on his birthdays. He receives an encyclopedia from Zenith, a pair of swords from Paul, and a wand from Roxy, who declares that it's time for his graduation exam outside of the House.

Trivia

When Rudy attempts to walk in on his parents having sex to mess with them, he spots Roxy outside their room. In the manga, she's silently spying in them; in the episode she's masturbating to the sound of their lovemaking.

Arc System work is credited in the ending for a few posters of the Guilty Gear Series which can be seen behind his bed, one featuring the character Dizzy and another featuring artwork from the back of box of the Dreamcast version of Guilty Gear X. Alongside these you can see a figure of the character Dizzy on his PC and brief game play of Guilty Gear XX once more featuring Dizzy fighting the character Ky Kiske.

The author stated that November 22 was when Rudeus dies in his previous life
, the same date that the first chapter of the Web novel (11/22/2012), meaning that he was bullied in 1992-1994, and in the flashback the bullies take photos of him with a flip cellphone, but the first flip cellphone with camera was the
Sanyo SCP-5300
, that was made in 2002.

Maxwell
=======

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

"We the Five Dragon Generals, have fought side-by-side for tens of thousands of years. One of us is gone. It is unforgivable if we don't avenge Crystal's death."

Maxwell to Laplace

Dark Dragon King
Maxwell
 is one of the
First Dragon God
's Five Dragon Generals who is from the Dark Dragon Tribe and in charge of hunting dragons and monsters that threaten Kayos and the Dragon Tribe cities.

Appearance

Maxwell has blue-silver scales, steel eyes and is much smaller than the average Dragon Tribe, giving the impression that he is small and flighty. He always have a wretched smile and speaks rather crudely.

Personality

Maxwell despite his looks is talented, hardworking and loyal. Maxwell is even more martial than
Chaos
 and when a situation occurs, he is always the first to jump into the breach but still prioritizes the safety of the
First Dragon God
 and fellow Dragon Generals when it comes to deciding a course of action.

Background

There were many who spoke ill of Maxwell behind his back. But those who knew him well never mocks him. Due to his hard work of exterminating monsters that appeared throughout the Dragon World, only few members of the Dragon Tribe are killed by monsters.

Plot

Maxwell presents his report on his investigation of
Crystal
's death on the meeting with the Dragon God and the remaining Dragon Generals and concludes that it was impossible for a gold dragon to kill Crystal leading
Szilard
 to consider that a demon could have killed him. When Chaos vehemently opposed
Laplace
 finding the killer Maxwell-who is unusually supportive of the idea, calms him down by explaining that the killer could be isolating each Dragon General one by one and suggests they move in pairs.

A few days later, Maxwell meets Laplace once again and introduces
Gora and Scrubava
 to assist him on the investigation. Laplace was in doubt of himself by this gesture but Maxwell praises him for the dragons he trained are used by his Dark Dragon Team was a big help and assures him that he will immediately aid him when the need arises.

Laplace meets with Maxwell after recovering from his battle against
Necrolia Nacrolia
 and informs him that Gora and Scrubava has died in battle. Maxwell attends another meeting where Laplace and Szilard gives their report then Szilard also confirms that he personally executed Necrolia to which Maxwell implied that he would have executed Necrolia himself if he is still alive. When the First Dragon God names Laplace to be Crystal's successor as Dragon General, Maxwell although initially shocked, he acknowledges Laplace's strength to defeat even one of the Eight Demon Kings.
 When the Dragon God's child is born, Maxwell goes all over the Dragon World to gather meat for the parade announced by Szilard which lasts for decades and like the rest of the Dragon Generals, Maxwell is also impressed by the child and left with a solemn expression.

Maxwell and the rest of the Dragon Generals accompanies the First Dragon God as he battles and defeats the Gods of the Beast World, Ocean World and Sky World one after another and resulting to the destruction of each world just by the power of the First Dragon God and the Five Dragon Generals.
 But for the Demon World, which is comparable in fighting strength with the Dragon Tribe and in addition, the Eight Great Demon Kings matched strengths with the Five Dragon Generals so the full force of the Dragon World's Dragon Warriors is brought to wage war on the Demon World. The war between the Dragon World and Demon World lasted for decades where its a a cycle of the invading army is repelled by the defending army and the defending army will invade in retaliation and be repelled back. During this time every innovation and technology is focused on winning the war where Chaos develops the Dragon Gate to weaken demonic power.

Due to the advancement of magic and technology, the war between the Dragon World and Demon World have caused massive casualties for both sides. The Dragon Tribe follows the Human God's suggestion to isolate the Eight Demon King one by one and defeat them which causes the
Demon God
 to appear in the battle field and duel the First Dragon God. After the First Dragon God defeats the Demon God, the Dragon Generals brings him back to the Dragon World while the Demon World begins to collapse.

Roxy Migurdia

Summary

In a town square, the Bard sings a story of Roxy.

Several years ago, a team of E-Ranked adventurers approach Roxy for recruitment needing a mage, only to turn them down as she is A-Rank; surprising them given her youthful appearance. As Bard swoons at her popularity with others her age, Roxy tries to correct her but stops thinking it futile. Seeing Roxy as a talented mage at a young age, she follows Roxy thinking it would be the start of an incredible story to tell, so Roxy voices her not being responsible for whatever befalls the Bard.

Later, Roxy partners with the "Triad" Adventurer team and starts to develop an attraction for team leader, Sam. After clearing a dungeon level, bard and Roxy learn from party member Dohn that, while Sam and Pamela are a couple, he is in love with Pamela yet wants her to be happy, so he refrains from imposing out of respect for her personal space. As the group gets rest, Sam tries seducing Roxy, but inquires to his being with Pamela. As Sam says not to worry, a Death Claw Tiger finds them and Sam runs out with Roxy in hand, leaving the other three as fodder to further his escape. Pamela wakes up to find the Death Claw attack, but when Dohn tanks the damage, Roxy lets go of Sam to defend the others and slays the Death-Claw.

Roxy uses Healing on Dohn, but after hearing Sam's disregard for them, she slaps him and calls him out. As Roxy dreamed of finding an adventurer in a labyrinth to rescue her and start a romance, she finds Sam is not that dreamt of adventurer, and tells Pamela what Sam did and tells her of Dohn's love for her. Leaving with righteous indignation, Roxy's exit is undercut by her tripping over a rock and the ladies seeing her panties; Roxy acts like it didn't happen.

In the present, Pamela meets the Bard, telling her that the group immediately disbanded, then she married Dohn and the two have been living well together since. Both talk about how thankful they are to Roxy's involvement, leading to Roxy elsewhere in the world to sneeze, sensing someone talking about her somewhere.

Miko of Memory
==============

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

The
Miko of Memory
 (“Blessed Child of Memory” in Light Novel), also known as the
Miko of Millishion
 is an unnamed young girl born with a special power that allows her to see memories by looking into people's eyes.

Appearance

The Miko of Memory has long, wavy blonde hair with bangs, and has blue eyes with a pink diamond-shaped pupil
.

Personality

The Miko is a kind and compassionate person, such that she willingly allow herself to be abducted by
Rudeus
 to aid his quest of saving
Zenith
, despite him knocking out her personal
guards
. Perhaps due to her ability to read minds, she is exhibiting a calm and understanding demeanor most of the time. However, she becomes shy and frightful when meeting the person she admires for the first time
.

Background

When it was discovered the Miko can see read people's memories, she had her name taken from her, and she was referred to only as the Miko-sama by her subordinates. She became the trump card of Cardinal
Leblanc Mcfarlane
 who was competing against Pope
Harry Grimoire
,
Cliff Grimoire
's grandfather for power, as she was a shrine maiden who possessed wondrous power which allowed the
Demon Race Expulsion Faction
 to regain its influence and resulting to a bloody power struggle within the Milis Religion. The Miko of Memory is often used for interrogations, however permission to use her power is regulated by the Cardinal that even the Royal Family of Millishion has to apply for permission to use the Miko's power.
.

Plot

Volume 5 - Juvenile Period - Reunion Chapter

During Eris's goblin subjugation accompanied by
Cliff Grimoire
 in
Millishion
, she saves the Miko and Therese from a group of assassins, who Cliff recognized were people who were his teachers.

Volume 8 - Youth Period - Special Student Chapter

It was mentioned that a few years ago in Milishion, there was an attempt on a Miko Shrine Maiden's life. Because this incident was the work of the Pope's faction, the internal struggles intensified.

Volume 21 - Young Man Period - Cliff Chapter

Of the little freedom she was allowed, the Miko frequently chose to come to the garden in the
Great Church
, and is always escorted by her guards. Ten years after being saved by
Eris Boreas Greyrat
, once she was about 20, she met Rudeus while out in the garden she usually frequented, and discovered that he was Eris' husband. She began to meet him frequently, and became friends with him. In the time, Rudeus was also conversing regularly with one of her guards,
Therese Latreia
, who was also Rudeus's aunt, about the situation with his mother.

Rudeus meets with the Miko once again and asks her to sign a petition to prevent the removal of Therese from being her guards to which he agrees and it was also said the Miko has a weak
Fate
. She said that she could live up to 30 years before dying due to assassinations and to prevent this, she requests to join the
ORSTED Corporation
 and became part of Orsted subordinates. Rudeus accepts her request and also throws in a Magic Beast to protect her who they later names Nurse and her life expectancy prolonged to at least 50.

The Miko meets with Rudeus who is accompanied by Eris and the tells her she wants to be a
Swordsman
 like Eris who she idolizes since saving her life. After following Eris' instructionss in swinging a stick, the Miko also sees Eris' memory on how she trained at the
Holy Land of Swords
 and begins training her body.

Powers and Abilities

Miko Power - Telepathy






The Miko of Memory reading Zenith's memories



When looking into someone's eyes, Miko is able to see one's "surface memories", memories that a person has in mind. This also extends to being able to see related memories to that subject, and the longer she stares into someone's eyes, the more of that person's memories she sees.

This power makes her perfect for interrogations, because when asked a question regarding a crime, it's impossible for someone to
not
 think of the question or its answer. This is often how her powers are used. This power also allows the Miko to see the memories of her subject even from several years ago but it also leaves her very exhausted afterwards
.

Trivia

She seems to have a weak Fate, as according to Orsted, in all timelines where
Rudeus
 didn't exist, she never reached past the age of 30 and usually died around the age of 10. It's likely that assassins were the cause of her death in these timelines.

Miko has an owl as a guardian beast/familiar summoned on behalf of her named Nurse. Rudeus mistaken her request as a naming Miko herself, and gave the name referencing the Eroge "Miko Miko Nurse".

After meeting with Eris in the church headquarters she wanted to become like Eris, so she started training and become more slim, though using sword or magic was prohibited.

Emblem of the Milis Religion seen through out the Holy Kingdom of Milis



Milis Religion
 is the largest religious organization in the world founded by Saint Milis that is found almost through out the continents where humans live.

Headquarters





The Great Church in the Anime



The Great Church is the main headquarters of the Milis Religion located in
Millishion
, Holy Kingdom of Milis,
Millis Continent
.  The current leader is Pope
Harry Grimoire
,
Cliff Grimoire
's grandfather.

Factions

The Milis Religion followed the scripture saying that "all
Demons
 should be destroyed" and rejected the Demon Race. But 300 years ago, a priest read its scripture that said: "All races are equal under Millis" and questions if the Demon Races are equal as well, which caused a division in the priests and causing the religion to split in 2 factions that are in a power struggle since then.

Demon Race Acceptance Faction






Assassins of the Demon Race Acceptance Faction



Also known as the Pope Faction lead by the current Pope
Harry Grimoire
 is the larger faction that has the influence among the majority of the general populace and the
Order of Instruction
. 50 years ago, the Acceptance faction influence rose after they put an end to the escalating conflicts with the
Beast Race
 and other denizens of the
Great Forest
, and for the next 30 years since then had complete control of the religion and Millishion's affairs. Despite being a religious organization, assassinations is still a method used by both factions especially towards the opposing faction's pope candidate.

Demon Race Expulsion Faction






Emblem of the Demon Race Expulsion Faction seen in even in the Commercial District



Also known as the Cardinal Faction lead by
Cardinal Leblanc McFarlane
 is the faction of the Milis Religion who zealously follows the old teachings of the Milis Church that the Demon Race should be completely expelled and has a close relationship with the
Latreia House
 and the Order of the Temple and at the peak of their influence, non-human races were strongly oppressed in Millishion which resulted many quarrels with the inhabitants of the Great Forest. While currently losing influence among the 2 factions for the last 30 years, this has changed when the
Miko of Memory
 was born and joins the Demon Race Expulsion Faction to become the candidate for the next pope. The influence of the Demon Race Expulsion rose to the point that even the Royal Family needs permission from the Cardinal to even use the powers of the Miko.

Legends

Necklace of Milis






Milis Religion Wedding Ceremony



Before heading to certain death, Saint Millis gave an ornamental necklace to her most beloved who gave him a kiss on his forehead and wished for his return. When Saint Millis was in danger, her beloved one offered the necklace to God who was touched by the exquisite necklace and beloved's love and intervenes to save Saint Millis.

This become a part of the Milis Religion wedding ceremony where a replica of the Necklace of Milis is a requirement of every Milis Church. The priest hands over the necklace to the groom who puts it on her bride. Then the bride kisses the groom on his forehead, a kiss of oath similar to the legend.

Holy Sword Highway






Blue Dragon Mountain Range's gap said to be made by Milis



"In these times of suffering, the righteous one endured. In these days of hardship, he cultivated strength."

Milis Holy Sciptures Atomos Chapter 12, Verse 31

During the war between humans and demons, Saint Milis plans to use his holy sword to defeat the demon army but this takes time to focus the attack. While Milis is preparing the attack, Peter Dolior the commander of the human army and Milis' closest friend fought to hold off the demon army and died in battle until Milis brings down his holy sword on the demon army. The power of the holy sword reached from Millishion, cuts a gap through the Blue Dragon Mountain Range, through the Great Forest, then across the ocean and struck the demon king that instantly kills him at the place now known as
Wind Port
.

The place where Milis launched the attack is now known as the Holy Sword Highway that is still bursting with
Mana
 from Saint Millis, so even if the surrounding area is flooded because the rainy season of the Great Forest, the road remains dry and further proof of that, there are absolutely no encounters with monsters.

Trivia

Milis Religion shares similarity with the
Catholic Church
 from the pope being its head to even its teachings.

 Map of Millis Continent



Millis Continent
 (ミリス 大陸
Mirisu Tairiku
) is the continent where the ratio of Human Race and Beast Race is 50:50, people living there follow
Milis religion
 similar to Catholics, and have a church but there are peoples who do not follow. In terms of marriage, they strictly follow the policy of monogamy.

It lies Southeast of the
Ringus Sea
.

Population

The population of Beast Race is almost the same as the Human Race. The Human settles in the West plains while the Beast Race is secluded in the eastern jungles.

The main languages spoken are the Human Tongue and Beast-God Tongue

Geography

In the north there's the Great Forest, in the south there's the Holy Milis Kingdom. Splitting those two regions is the Blue Dragon Mountain Range, with the Holy Sword Highway going straight through them from top to bottom with not a single monster on the Highway.

Holy Country of Millis

The second oldest and most powerful kingdom after the Asura Kingdom. It is the Holy Land of the world's largest faith - the
Milis Religion
.

Millishion

The capital of the Holy Country of Millis. It is said to be the most beautiful city in the world.

Great Forest

A huge woodland that occupies the northeastern half of the Continent. It is home to various races - the Beast Race resides in the northern part of the forest, Hobbits in the northwest, the Dwarves in the southwest, and the Elves to the southeast.

The forest has 3 months of torrential rain every year.

Dedoldia Village

The settlement where the Dedoldia Tribe lives.

Blue Dragon Mountain Range

The Blue Dragon Mountain Range is the border that separates the Great Forest and the Holy Country of Millis thus effectively separating the human and beast race territory. The Holy Sword Highway passes through by a gap in the mountain that is wide enough for 2 carriages to pass at the same time. Rock slides almost never happens here which is believed to be the divine power of
Saint Millis
 and one of the reasons Millis is worshipped very well.

Despite the namesake, Blue Dragons are almost never seen here since they fly all around the world, but they always return to the Blue Dragon Mountain Range for nesting and raising children. At the southern most base of the Blue Dragon Mountain Range lies a Dwarf town that is famously known as a blacksmith town because of its high quality and cheap swords and armor.

Holy Sword Highway

A road constructed by the Holy Country of Millis that crosses the continent, from West Port to Millishion and from Millishion through the Great Forest to Zant Port. Due to the story that the creation of the highway was from a single swing of Saint Millis' sword that sliced straight through the Blue Dragon Mountain Range, the Great Forest, and even cut down a Demon Lord on the Demon Continent, the road is eventually named "Holy Sword Highway". Despite the doubts on the story, the road is still bursting with
Mana
 from Saint Millis, so even if the surrounding area is flooded because the rainy season of the Great Forest, the road remains dry and further proof of that, there are absolutely no encounters with monsters even now.

Zant Port

A port located in the North of Millis Continent, where his ships travel to Wind port in the
Demon Continent
. Also known as Saint Port or Zanto Port. Before the start of the 3 months rainy season, the inns of Zant Port are usually booked in advance for a long period as travelling across the Great Forest is impossible because of floods.

Central Continent.

Millishion in the Anime



Millishion
 is a
Human
 city and capital of the Holy Country of Millis,
Millis Continent
 which is said to be the most beautiful city in the
Human World
 for its majesty and harmony.

Geography

Millishion is located in the of central region of Millis Continent and is bordered by the Blue Dragon Mountain Range from the north and beyond is the Great Forest while making possible to get a full view of the city just by looking at it from the Holy Sword Highway. The Nikolaus River flows from Blue Dragon Mountain Range to the city that is the main source of water for the sparkling blue Grand Lake at the center of the city. Flooding was a problem for the city in the past due to the 3 months of torrential rainy season until the creation of the Seven Magic Towers to perfectly control the water and projects a barrier around the city.

Background

On the final battle of the
Laplace Wars
, the final kingdom left behind in the human race is the Holy Country of Milis, who rallied its entire army to resist lead by the 7 heroes. But due to the beast races acting as a blockade in the Great Forest and ally of the demons, the 7 heroes convinced the beast race to ally with them instead by kidnapping their children and threaten them. After a short time, the 7 heroes led the Holy Knight Orders and the beast races to attack the Laplace army. After the fierce battle, 4 of the 7 heroes died, but the entire main Laplace army was completely routed, and successfully sealed the Demon-God
Laplace
. The only 3 survivors are, Dragon God
Urupen
, North God
Kalman I
, the Armored King
Perugius Dola
 and are called the [The three heroes who vanquished the Demon God].

Laplace was defeated, but the human race was also exhausted and it was impossible to continue fighting therefore, a treaty was signed
with the moderate faction's Demon King. The treaty removes the blockade from the
Demon Continent
 thus allowing the demon races to travel freely to other continents and the discrimination towards the demon races are all banned.
 Despite the treaty, the discrimination towards the demon races is still as deep as before especially between the Milis Religion's
Demon Race Acceptance
 and
Demon Race Expulsion
 factions who are in a bitter power struggle in Millishion to this day.

Areas

Millishion has multiple entrance in its districts but with the exception of the Adventurers District, entering the other district will put Adventurers through a certain amount of questioning and it can take quite a bit of time.

Adventurers District

Located in the south, the Adventurers District is the place where the Adventurers gather where all sorts of shops and inns aimed towards Adventurers. There's also a slum area, gambling place and the slave market is in this district rather than the commerce district. Near the district's entrance to the city, there are inns and stables that provides a service to take luggage to the inn for adventurers that are not in other towns.

Holy District

Located in the west, there is the Holy District where a number of places for those related to the Milis Religion is located such as the enormous Great Church and the Knight Orders has their headquarters in this district.

Residential District

Located in the north, is the Residential District where the section of private houses and blocks also follows the harmony of blue and green seen through out Millishion. This is the place where the family of nobles, knights and average citizens live but fundamentally they are all private houses in the residential district.

Commercial District

Located in the east, the Commercial District is where all sorts of merchants gather which has a large number of shops, but the structures are small. It's a place where many companies meet and widen their trade contacts together seen in any business district and services like Blacksmiths and Auction houses are here as well.
 The 2 factions of the Milis Religion is also shown here by posting the emblems of the faction they are affiliated with below their sign post particularly the Demon Race Expulsion who refuses to sell their wares to demons or even throw them out of their shop.

Points of Interest

White Palace

The White Palace is Holy Country of Millis' Seat of Power floating at the center of the Grand Lake and home of the Royal Family. The Seven Magic Towers encircling the White Palace protects it from floods and because of the barrier from the towers, no walls are needed.
 Unlike Asura Kingdom's Royal Family, The Milis Church holds most of the power so having an audience the Millishion's king is only for formality.

Adventure Guild
 Main Headquarters

The Adventure Guild Main Headquarters is a silver glowing two story building and is the largest building in the Adventurers District at the end of the main road. Being the main headquarters, it is also the largest Adventure Guild Headquarters in the world and the main lobby is larger than the banquet halls of the
Citadel of Roa
.
 Since there is no Adventure Guild Headquarters in the Great Forest, non-human adventurers like the elves, hobbit, dwarves and beast race uses either Millishion or Zanto Port as their base or take requests on either places and because of this, adventurers in Millishion regardless of race are treated without bias.

A permanent job request in Millishion is the Goblin-Subjgation Job that it is also stated on the request to not tear of the request on the board and simply bring the gathered goblin ears to the counter for 10 Milis copper a piece and it can be accepted by adventurers regardless of rank. Goblins are E-ranked magic beasts that are almost a rat-like existence in the
Human World
 and only appears in the forests or plains. Although goblins are weak, if they are left unchecked, they would steadily increase in population and start to attack nearby villages.

Great Church

The Great Church is the Headquarters and the center of faith of the
Milis Religion
, the world's largest religious organization which is a 4 storey building with a golden onion-shaped dome at the top and has 4 courtyards matching the 4 seasons respectively.

Magic Towers

Millishion has 7 Magic Towers that are huge
Magic Tools
 that encircles the city to control the water levels of the lake and prevent flooding in the city especially during the rainy season. The tower is so tall and massive that it takes several minutes to circle it and at close distance, the top of the tower cannot be seen. The Magic Tower houses the Magic Tool like a case and it is also by protected soldiers and a large scale barrier magic where faint symbols around the tower can be seen. Because of the tower being unique only to Millishion, it is also a famous tourist spot for the city's visitors.

Orphanage

The Orphanage is run by the Milis Religion where it is said to be the symbol of their prestige and authority. As such, there were no problems with the management and the orphaned children were able to grow without worries and eventually be adopted by their foster parents or those who reaches age 10 would enter school also managed by the Milis Religion. At school, they train for five years for either
Swordsmanship
 or
Magic
 that suits their talent where those who excelled not only studying but also in the sword ang magic would join the Holy Knight Order while the majority becomes Adventurers. Thus, many adventurers were alumnis of the orphanage and would occasionally return to the orphanage while greeting their former teachers and tell fun stories of their adventures to the orphans and Cliff at the time is among those orphans who longed to be an Adventurer.

Holy Knight Orders

"Don't say anything too dangerous, or else if those Holy Knights overhear it, they'll still capture you even if it's a joke you know?"

Geese Nukadia
 to
Rudeus Greyrat

Millishion's military has three knight orders and are said to be the second most powerful nation after
Asura Kingdom
. Under the leadership of the 7 heroes and the combined forces of the Holy Knights Orders and Beast Race, Millishion is the only human kingdom that survived the Laplace Wars.
 Assassinations of other knight order members are not unusual especially those opposing factions of the Milis Relgion.

Healing Magic

Summary

Visiting a market place in Wenport, Roxy reminds Elinalise that they need to gather intel but the elf is too keen on flirting, a continuous effect of her nymphomaniacal curse- handy for Elinalise with talkative men in town. Stopping for a bite to eat, Elinalise asks if Roxy likes boys, like Rudeus, earning a flustered reaction; and deflecting with a bad joke. As Roxy is enjoying her lunch, the food stall owner credits her new chef, a girl relocated by the Fittoa incident. The young girl recalls her initial fear being suddenly relocated, but how she was rescued and employed by the shop owner who knew Human language. As the shop owner and the girl hug familiarly, Elinalise awes at their love as Roxy notes her romantic side; Elinalise shares that she has a son and misses him. Seeing the girl happy, Roxy feels more encouraged that Rudeus is doing well given his studies and abilities. While Roxy wishes the girl and shop owner well, a sudden breeze blows up her skirt for the girl to gaze in awe, and runs away in shame. The crewman from the ship
(who returned Roxy to her cabin when she was seasick)
 walks by and stops long enough to meet the girl, recognizing him as her father. The two happily reunite, as Roxy continues running after her sacred panties provided another miracle.

Monsters
========

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Monsters
 are creatures that mutated from normal creatures in presence of
mana
, which pose threat to people in the world.

Overview

Monsters are the result of sudden mutations in normal animals. If they are lucky enough to grow in numbers, establish themselves as a new species, and develop intellect over the generations, they become fiends - a class of beasts that have intellect. But apparently, many creatures that possessed intelligence but still attacked humans are referred to as monsters; there are also cases of fiends growing more savage and brutal over the generations, reverting back into monsters. Due to the fact that monsters thrive on
Mana
, areas with higher mana density like the
Demon Continent
 or Labyrinths like the
Teleportation Labyrinth
 tend to have more powerful monsters.

As such, the
Adventure Guild
's Rank C and above requests are mostly subjugating a certain group of monsters or gathering parts of monsters for crafts and/or proof of kills. Adventurers usually have books on how to handle different kinds of monsters in their current region like <<
Fittoa
's Monsters, Ecology and Weaknesses>> found in the
Greyrat
 Household in
Buena Village
.

There are also plant-based monsters called Treants, which are typically ordinary plants that had sucked up too much magical energy and mutated into violent creatures. There are a considerable variety of specific monsters that fell into this broad category, but their basic patterns of behavior are very similar: they pretended to be normal trees and attack anyone who come too close. After some time, they produce seeds that grow into more of their kind

A Red Dragon attacking Orsted with its fire breath


Red Dragons are the most ferocious and dangerous among dragon species, and are regarded as the strongest monsters on the Central Continent. A single one is within lower S-rank, but they typically gather in hordes of several hundred. Of special note was their detection ability: they never miss anything that encroach on their territory, even animals as small as a dog. Since the mountain range is the place these creatures call home, it came to be known as the Red Dragon Mountains: an impassable mountain range that is a symbol of death.
While Red Dragons are formidable in combat abilities, they are terrible fliers that couldn't take flight from flat terrain. To fly, they needed to leap off tall cliffs or run down a long slope. Although the Central Continent had tall mountains, the land is mostly occupied by rolling plains and forests, thus it is rare for those living on the plains to be attacked by a Red Dragons. Granted, occasionally there would be individuals that gets caught in a turbulent wind and fall to the plains, bringing devastation to the area. When this happens, soldiers or adventurers would be called in to deal with the disturbance
. Forty A or S-ranked adventurers is the minimum recommended number of members for dragon slaying

The Luster Grizzly is one of the more common kind of monsters found in the northern region of the Central Continent. In appearance, it is basically a large bear with a white coat and a single black stripe that ran vertically down its middle. They move in sizable packs, and when winter drew near, they work together to build up huge collective stockpiles of food. At that time of year, their attacks on humans grew much more frequent.
They were comparatively mellow in the summer months, when they tended to hang around sources of water to mate. They couldn't see too well in the dark and move sluggishly at night, thus the standard method of dealing with a large pack is to find them during mating season and launch a surprise attack at night

Laplace
 deliberately mass producing and releasing them onto the continent to break the human defense there.
Succubus can release pheromones that smell like an intolerable stench to women and a charming sweet scent to men, which would cloud men's judgment and put them into uncontrollable lust. They would then bring a few victims back to their lair for consumption, leaving the remaining men fight each other to death, as charmed men would see other men as enemies. The only way to nullify the effect is using intermediate or higher level
detoxification magic
 or having sexual intercourse with a woman

At certain intervals, they would pause their journey to make a temporary nest, where they breed and replenish their numbers with the next generation. None of the individual ants are that powerful -- smaller ones are probably E-ranked, whereas larger ones could be D or C, but a group of thousands is a threat in high S range.

Armored Warriors are animated suits of rusty armor that makes light weapons ineffective against them and they have four arms, each holding a razor-sharp blade
. They can use the
Water God Style
 to counter both physical and magical attacks. Since they are considered undead monsters, they are weak against earth and
Divine Strike Magic
.

Devouring Devils are monsters with a large gaping mouth and razor-sharp fangs. It also had long limbs and pointed claws that enable them to scale the walls and ceiling, allowing them to penetrate the formation of an adventurer's party. They are quick and are capable of dishing out powerful attacks, but have low defenses. Their eggs are dark, oblong-shaped and coated in liquid, resembling cockroach eggs
.
The best countermeasure against them is to burn the roots of Talfro tree like incense. They hated the smell so much that they would descend from the ceiling and lay low on the floor, making them easy targets

Manatite Hydra is the guardian of the Teleportation Labyrinth and is stationed at the Magic Crystal that is said to be the center of the Labyrinth where he is usually seen dormant but will attack anyone who approaches but does not pursue them and returns to being dormant near the Magic Crystal if the intruders leave or are dead. It is a nine-headed dragon approximately twice the size of a Red Dragon. Its body is covered with sharpened emerald-green scales that can nullify magic attacks and cut the victim's body upon contact. It is capable of regenerating itself when one its heads is cut, unless the wound is immediately cauterized. Each of its heads is capable of attacking independently, and each head can unleash a powerful fire breath. To defeat the monster, all its heads must be cut off or destroyed, with the wounds seared to disable its regeneration. However, like most monsters, the hydra is intelligent and can bite off the seared neck to regenerate it. When he senses that he is in danger like when it has 3 heads remaining, it would go berserk and attacks frantically until defeated.
.
The last recorded encounter with Manatite Hydras dates back to the Second Great Human-Demon War, and the species were said to be annihilated by the explosion that created the
Ringus Sea
. The magic stone scales taken from the monster retain their ability to nullify magic attacks: by applying mana to the back of the stone, the front emits an energy wave that breaks down magic

 anime series originally broadcasted on April 7, 2024.

Synopsis

Rudeus is engaged to Sylphy, but he doesn't know the procedure for marriage in this
world
, so he consults Zanoba and Cliff. When Rudeus hears that his first priority is deciding on a house to live in, he is introduced to a large but cheap property by a real estate agent. It is said to be a haunted property where visitors die mysteriously due to a curse...

Plot

Rudeus is in his room, saying his prayers to the shrine that he just added a box inside it. At the Special Student Classroom, the other students notices that Rudeus is different to which Rudeus announces that his condition (ED ailment) has been cured. While some of the students congratulates him, Linia and Pursena are on guard since they can sense that he is in heat. Rudeus then meets Nanahoshi who got annoyed with him for talking about her crush.

During lunch, Rudeus consults with Cliff and Zanoba about what he needs to prepare before a wedding and he is advised that he needs a house so he goes to a listing agency to look for a house he can afford. Rudeus eventually finds a house that is unusually cheap but is rumored to be cursed since its previous residents were murdered after hearing noises at night so he asks Cliff and Zanoba to help in exorcising the house.

The three begin to search each rooms and floors of the house but no one is there so they decide to spend the night there where they take turns guarding while the rest sleeps. That night, Cliff hears a noise and wakes up Rudeus and Zanoba to search the house once again. Rudeus is ambushed by the "ghost" but Zanoba protects him and when Cliff and Rudeus tries to use their magic on it, Zanoba still hold the ghost in place despite being attacked, destroying his club and damaging his clothes. The ghost turns out to be a doll that can move and the one responsible for the murders so they brought it back to Ranoa Magic Academy to be studied which Zanoba volunteers to do the research.

With the "ghost" dealt with and renovations completed, Rudeus takes Sylphy to the new house and they tour every room until they reach the Master's bedroom, currently the only room that is furnished and has a large bed. Rudeus once again proposes to Sylphy who is still reluctant as she still has her duties as

Synopsis

Norn, who started living in the dormitory of Ranoa Magic University, has become a shut-in. Rudeus tries to somehow save Norn by identifying himself with his previous life, and heads to Norn's classroom. Rudeus is shocked by the words he hears from Norn's classmates... Norn, on the other hand, is also worried about how to deal with her older brother Rudeus.

Plot

At Ranoa Magic Academy, Rudeus is visibly angry upon learning that Norn has locked herself in her room and is seen walking with Linia and Pursena who tries to reason with him while onlookers are in awe as Rudeus passes by and finally reaches Norn's classroom and enters.

Rudeus explains the situation to Norn's classmates and asks whoever is responsible to come forward and apologize. A
Beast Race
 with a raccoon dog face, timid eyes and bob hair cut raises her hand and tells Rudeus that she compared Norn with Rudeus which made angered Norn then Norn's teacher also mentions she also talked to Norn after she did poorly and to follow his brother's example and try a little harder which Norn while holding back tears nods and said she'd do her best. The rest of the class also chimes in on doing the same thing causing Rudeus to realize that Norn hates being compared to Rudeus.

At the
School Yard
, Rudeus is still hurt by recent development as Linia and Pursena looks on then Sylphiette arrives and assures Rudeus that its now his fault. Linia and Pursena also encourages Rudeus who thanks them but still doesn't now what to do since Norn has a reason not to leave her room.

Rudes is walking on the hallway still deciding on what to do but is unable to do so but Sylphy, Linia and Pursena catches up with him and Linia mentions she has a plan.

That evening, the students are spreading word that Ariel is giving a speech at the dining hall despite being so sudden and they head to the School Yard to listen while Sylphiette informs Rudeus that most students have left and he sneaks in the Girl's Dormitory and enters with
Earth Lance
 where Linia is waiting for him and carries him through the hallway with a laundry cart until they reach Norn's room at the end of the hall.

Rudeus knocks and gives his name but Norn does not respond. Upon opening the door, Rudeus remember his past self but proceeds to enter and sees Norn still seated at her bed, covered with her blanket. Rudeus recalls his past life on how he ignores his older brother who visited his room to try and reason with him but was ignored and his brother eventually gave up on him.

While Rudeus is seated next to her bed, Norn reflects on how she became afraid of Rudeus since she met Rudeus who was hitting Paul and causing Norn to push him away and begins to hate him. When she arrives at Sharia, her impression on him got even worse on how he seems happy while their father is still on the midst of rescuing
Zenith

When Norn decides to live in the Dormitory, she was surprised that Rudeus allowed her and although she knows the reason, she felt sad and felt pain in her belly. Norn's situation got worse when she begins classes where she is constantly being compared to Rudeus and along with the pain in her belly leading to eventually causing Norn to stay in her room.

Norn then remembers her talks with Paul and Ruijerd where both assures him that he is not who she think he is. Norn then sees Rudeus who apologizes on what has happened and after hearing his words, Norn breaks down in tears and cries on Rudeus' chest after the latter sits beside her.

Appearance

Nanahoshi Shizuka
 (
七星

静
香
,

Nanahoshi Shizuka
)
, also known as
Silent Seven Stars
, is one of the people
Rudeus Greyrat
 saved from being hit by a truck in his previous life. However, in that moment, she was transported to this world some time after Rudeus, resulting in the
Teleport Incident
. Afterward, she was taken in by
Orsted
 and eventually became a successful entrepreneur whilst searching for a way back to Earth.

Appearance

Nanahoshi is a Japanese teenage girl with long black hair, described as being above average in appearance. She's more often seen wearing a white mask without any particular characteristics.

Personality

Due to her desire to go back home and her unattached attitude to the
Human World
, Nanahoshi tends to like being alone. She's serious when working and enthusiastic when it comes to things related to her old world. Before meeting
Rudeus Greyrat
, she spent all her time indoors and didn't like meeting people as she didn't want to grow attached to anyone in the world. Additionally, she maintained low contact to avoid the possibility of contracting unknown pathogens, and uses that to justify her isolation.

Background

Nanahoshi was saved by
Rudeus Greyrat
 in his former life's final moments and was teleported to the
Human World
 later known as the
Teleport Incident
 where she is transported in her original body unlike Rudeus who is reincarnated as a baby. After finding herself in the plains of Asura Kingdom, she meets
Orsted
 and with his help she learned the Human God language after a year, gained knowledge about the Asura Kingdom and was able to meet Perugius. During this time, Nanahoshi established business contacts, introduced innovations and products that are mainly for her convenience and benefits such as improving the food, clothing and soap for hair cleaning. Using Orsted's influence as the Dragon God for her backing, she is able to convince some Asuran merchants to arrange distribution routes for her products that allows her to have passive income so she could gain enough influence to search for her friends, and develop a way to return home.

Plot

Nanahoshi was first introduced in volume 6 of the LN/WN accompanying
Orsted
 when they encountered
Dead End
 on their journey to the
Fittoa Region
. After Orsted mortally wounded
Rudeus Greyrat
, she told Orsted to spare Rudeus' life, so Orsted cast healing magic on him.

Nanahoshi meets with Rudeus once again at
Ranoa Magic Academy
 where she establishes herself as a Class A Mage because of the sweeping changes she introduced in the Academy and is also a Special Student. After giving an explanation of her intentions, Nanahoshi, Rudeus and
Sylphiette
 begin researching on the cause of the
Teleport Incident
.

Nanahoshi is among the guests who attends Rudeus and Syphiette's wedding
 and for helping with her research on Summoning Magic, Nanahoshi allows Rudeus and his friends to accompany her when she goes to meet
Perugius Dola
 in his Sky Castle
.

Power and Abilities

Magic Abilities






Nanahoshi activating a Magic Circle for
Summon Light Spirits
 in the Anime



Nanahoshi has no magic power due to being from another world where magic didn't exist. This means she can't use magic or wear
battle aura
, though she can still use Magic Items, which work with their own Magic Power.

Summoning Magic

Due to her training from
Perugius Dola
, she has extensive knowledge in summoning and teleportation magic, having studied it as part of her research to go back to her and
Rudeus Greyrat
's original world.

Physical Abilities

For some reason, her body does not age; her hair never grows longer, and her nails keep the same length regardless of how much time passes, yet she still needs to consume food and pass waste, and could still get sick. Nanahoshi suspects that it's because she's from the future, or a different world.

Intellectual Abilities

It is shown that Nanahoshi is a very skilled negotiator and businesswoman, enabling her to setup many systems that monetize her knowledge from earth and even using the Magician Guild as a bank. As a result, she has multiple streams of income that make her very wealthy, allowing her to focus on her research. She also holds influential positions in several organizations and is Rank A among the Magic Guild because of her accomplishments and contributions that she was offered to be Rank S but she declines since her interests is to return home.

Nanahoshi is also a skilled researcher that she collaborated with Rudeus on several researches such as the development of the Magic Potion and Teleportation Magic formations which they kept in records at an Encrypted Memoir written by both of them in a cypher and most likely in Japanese Language.

Magic Rings

Unlike
Rudeus Greyrat
 who is reincarnated into the
Human World
, Nanahoshi has no Magic Powers so she uses Magic Rings to protect herself when
Orsted
 is not there. Nanahoshi possesses three magic rings that are
Magic Items
 she wears in her right hand. First worn in the index finger, through unknown means, prevents magic from working near the caster as shown when
Sylphiette
 failed to cast attack magic on her which triggers when she points the ring to a target. The second worn in the middle finger, creates an invisible barrier in front of her that prevents any physical attacks as seen when Sylphiette tried to punch her and like the first ring, it also triggers on a target she points at. The third worn on the ring finger, allows Orsted to know her location using a compass, when infused with magic.

Achievements

Achieved Rank A in the Magic Guild

Quotes

To
Rudeus Greyrat
: “I was probably summoned to this world in order to create a method for your descendants to kill the
Human God
 in the future. That’s why, as long as I don’t create that method, I won’t be able to return to my original world. My return magic will fail.”

Etymology

Nanahoshi
 means "seven stars" (七星).

Shizuka
 means "quiet" (静) (
shizu
) and "fragrance, fragrant" (香) (
ka
).

Trivia

Nanahoshi has a disease called Drain Syndrome. It's a condition that occurs when a human with little or no magical power naturally accumulates magical power over time, until their body begins to react negatively to it. Because of this, she must regularly drink tea made from Sokasu Grass, which will alleviate her condition by releasing the accumulated Magical Power through her waste. However this does not cure her condition, as she must continue to drink the tea from Sokasu Grass.

In the redundancy chapters,
Zanoba Shirone
 and
Rudeus Greyrat
 created an automaton modelled after Nanahoshi. It was almost identical to her except for the hair length, completed with even the naughty bits. It was created without Nanahoshi knowledge and consent, and later named
Anne
.

Volume 22 - Young Man Period - Organization Chapter

The final stages of the multiverse teleportation circle are being made as it was completed and she had Rudeus and Perugius test the device, With Perugius operating and controlling it and Rudeus supplying the magic power. After teleporting many objects and living beings much larger than her into her original world, the circle was ready to send her back to her home world. She decided to use the bath in Rudeus's home and stay the night. While She and Rudeus were drinking and she was wondering how much time may have passed since she was in this world, Rudeus told her that ten years have passed since the traffic accident and time may not have changed much in the other world. After hearing that, she figured out Rudeus's identity in the previous world. She was asked to keep it a secret since Rudeus was ashamed of who he was in that world and gave her a letter to deliver to his siblings from that world.

The final day came and they used the multiverse teleportation circle to send her back to her original world, but then a strange black colored light appeared and the attempt to send her back failed. The magic circle failed as if the power was absorbed somewhere else. Perugius was mad at Rudeus and started blaming Rudeus for the failure of the device, thinking Rudeus cut off his power. Rudeus then stated that he didn't cut off his power and in fact increased his power. After the confusion, they were able to determine that if the mana supply were cut off, the magic circle would have lost its light. Mana was definitely used, but it seems as if something was tampering with the process. They found a crack in the circle that should not have broken. Nanahoshi left the room and Rudeus went after her. After the failure at using the multiverse teleportation circle due to some type of interference, she developed a hypothesis that her friend,
Shinohara Akihito
, who likely teleported into the world in the future and saved a Miko that had the power to rewind an object's time. Nanahoshi hypothesized that he likely also met Orsted and created a device that would amplify the Miko's power. The reason why she was summoned to the world was to create the multiverse teleportation device and the reason she is unable to return now is because her future self is supposed to return to her world in the future with her friend. She then decided to have her time stopped so that she may live long enough to the future 50 to 80 years from now and use the teleportation to allow her friend to go back home as well.

Mushoku Tensei Sequel

Nanahoshi's fate is one of the major story threads that remained unresolved by the end of Mushoku Tensei, continuing to be kept in suspended animation by
Perugius
 to await
Akihito's
 arrival so she might go back to Earth. Because of this, she is likely to once again play a major role in the planned sequel series.

Note: This section is under construction and revision
.

Personality

Nina was initially a proud and conceited young woman who had idealistic and naïve expectations about life, very much like a frog in a well. She slowly changed after meeting and losing to
Eris
, and her later encounter with
Badigadi
 and
Rudeus
. During her training with Eris and
Isolte Cruel
, her paradigms were shifted as she learnt more about the true meaning of strength and the Sword God Style.

Her unusual calmness was judged by
Reida Reia
 to indicate potential in the
Water God Style
, albeit Nina is adamant on only practicing the
Sword God Style
. Like her father, she's also rather impatient and assertive, as indicated by her marriage proposal to Jino and swift invitation to her bedroom afterward.

Note: This section is under construction and revision
.

Background

Nina Farion was raised up in the Holy Land of Swords, being the eldest daughter of the Sword God, Gal Farion. She was a prodigy who attained Sword Saint rank when she was 16, and was speculated to advance to Sword King and Sword Emperor when she turned 20 and 25 respectively.

During her childhood, Nina is also forbidden to enter the Sword God Style Main House and formed a secret organization with Jino and the children of her age during their breaks from training but later gets disbanded when Nina and Jino became Sword Saints at the same time where their growth was considered to be quite fast.

Despite her being Gal Farion's eldest daughter, she was taught instead by Sword Emperor
Timothy Britts
. She has been practicing with the sword since a very young age, the Sword God Style being all she knew about the world.

Plot

Nina was introduced as an opponent for
Eris
 in Volume 8. Nina was angry that Eris pre-emptively attacked Jino before their duel even began, and vowed to kill Eris during her duel. When the duel began, Nina was able to break Eris's sword and expected the victory, but instead was beaten unconscious by Eris' fists and kicks. Being shamed in front of her peers, she began to hate Eris and began a rivalry with her.

Nina was unable to find time for her rivalry and to be in contact with Eris since seemed to be constantly busy with training with
Ghislaine Dedoldia
 and Gal Farion. Nina tried once to isolate Eris from the rest of the students but it failed since Eris shows no interest in making friends and barely talks to anyone. In another attempt to get back on Eris, Nina tells her that she would never find a man if she is always so dedicated to training, which Eris denies and says that she already had a man and their conversation turned Eris showing off her love story with Rudeus, which Nina envies and believes that she lost even in love. Nina comes to the conclusion that Eris must be lying and goes off to investigate Rudeus.

Nina is shocked by the information which easily floods in about Rudeus and his accomplishments; she starts to doubt the rumors and sets the goal to beat Eris by beating the man she looks up to and enslave him. Nina sets her goal and heads to
Ranoa Magic Academy
 to find Rudeus, and follows some Dedoldia beast men who were also looking to defeat Rudeus at the time. Nina is able to find Rudeus and finds that another Beast man has beaten her to the punch and challenges Rudeus, which he beats him within an instant to Nina's shock thinking that mages are weak in close quarters combat.






Nina vs Badigadi



Attempting to challenge Rudeus again, Nina finds him later to find that there are many more beast men challenging him and she is put in the back of the line. That's when Badigadi shows up and trying to cut to the front by challenging all the combatants in line already, for some reason Nina finds herself attacking the Demon King and is easily cast aside and her sword broken. Rudeus comes out and has his duel with Badigadi which Nina spectates and is shocked by the power he demonstrates. When Nina returns, she starts to understand the power that Eris strives to attain and resolves to become stronger... and carry another sword in case her sword breaks again.

When Reida and Isolte arrives at the Holy Land of Swords, Nina escorts them to Gal who discuss to them his plans on Eris' sword training. Nina asks if he can also join the training to which Gal permits and tells him to get Eris. After numerous sparring between Eris and Isolte where Eris could not land a blow on Isolte, Nina also spars with Isolte and she was able to defeat her. Noting her unusual calmness for a Sword God Style user, Reida asks Nina if she likes to train in Water God Style as well but Nina declines.  Gal and Reida then have an agreement that from dawn to noon, Nina, Eris and Isolte will train with their respective teachers then from noon to dusk, the three will practice and train together.

One month later, a strange triple deadlock has formed where Eris beats Nina, Nina beats Isolte and Isolte beats Eris. On one of the three's discussions, Eris reveals that her constant release of blood lust is actually a high level technique of the
Superd Tribe
 that
Ruijerd Superdia
 taught her, to which Isolte points out that Eris intentionally provokes her opponent to attack. During this time, Nina improves her sword technique with Eris and Isolte's help and grew close to them.

Power and Abilities

『Sword Emperor』
She has prowess comparable to Eris', if not slightly weaker. However, she possesses the ability to not emit any bloodlust or killing intent that is rare among Sword God Style swordsmen, which allowed Nina to repeatedly defeat Isolte, whom Eris struggled to even keep up with. She has become a Sword Emperor as of the Redundancy Chapter.

Equipment

Unnamed Swords






Nina Farion's equipment in the Light Novel



Nina wields a curved sword featuring a knuckle bow. She wears this sword horizontally across her back, secured loosely below her belt. Additionally, following her encounter with
Badigadi
, Nina carries a second, shorter sword, which is sheathed above her primary one.

Achievements

Sword Emperor

Quotes

"That's true. Please go easy on me."

Eris: "Nina, you read it!"

Nina: "Eh? I can't read words either."

Eris: "What? If you can't read words when you need to, then you'll be in trouble!"

Nina: "Even though you say that so arrogantly, you can't even read it yourself!"

Trivia

Nina was interested in Jino Britts, partly due to her finding out that Eris was not a virgin and not wanting to lose to her.

Nina casually proposed to Jino Britts, which he accepts and the two get married.

Like most people in the Holy Land of Swords, Nina cannot read.

Differences with the Light Novel:

In the light novel, the design of Rudeus' prison was a cabin with Iron bars.

In the anime, Gyes replace Gimbal, another beastman.

In the light novel, Gimbal was killed in the battle against Gallus. In the anime, Gyes was injured instead by Gallus.

A short scene where Rudeus checked if Gallus was unconscious or not after the battle was cut.

In the light novel, Rudeus doesn't fall unconscious after the battle.

A short scene that explains how the holy beast was kidnapped and the smugglers plans was cut.

Sauros execution is shown in the anime. In the Light Novel, it took place off screen and was only mentioned in the
6th Volume
.

・
グレイラット
)
 is the second child of
Paul Greyrat
 and
Zenith Greyrat
, the younger sister of
Rudeus Greyrat
 and the older half-sister of
Aisha Greyrat
. She initially had a bad relationship with her brother and an inferiority complex due to constant comparisons to her genius siblings. However, over time, she reconciled with Rudeus and grew out of her self-esteem issues.

Appearance

Norn has blond hair and green eyes.

As an adult, she is noted to be a beauty by her brother
Rudeus Greyrat
 and she has similar looking features as her mother
Zenith Greyrat
 while Norn had also inherited her mother's curvaceous figure.

''Note: This section is under construction and revision''.

Personality

Due to being teleported with only
her father
, Norn has a strong attachment to him and hates anyone that hurts him. Because of this, she initially hated
her brother
 after he got into a fight with her father. She has also shown to be quite stubborn, refusing the make up with him until years later.

Due to her father often being busy with work, she grew up to be an independent person. However, beneath her outer demeanor, Norn developed a serious inferiority complex due to constantly being compared to her outstanding siblings. Over time, this became so bad that she nearly became a shut-in, though she managed to pull through once she realized that her siblings loved her. Norn has shown herself to be a hardworking girl. It's just that she of prone to making mistakes under pressure. She is well-rounded person and prefers to separate
her family
 matters with her school life.

She is a devout believer of the
Milis Religion
 which is instilled by her mother's side of the family, and thus she strongly disapproved of Rudeus taking
Roxy
 as the second wife, since it's against that religion to have more than one wife. She later slowly accepts the fact that Rudeus has several wives. She seems to have a similar disposition toward may-december romances; having an obvious crush on
Ruijerd Superdia
, yet believing for the longest time that they could not be together due him being her peer by centuries.

Background

her family
 and attends the
Magic University of Ranoa
.

Like Rudeus, She has
Greyrat
 Nobility and Latreia Nobility blood in her.

Plot

Alternate Timelines

Orsted Time Loop

In a world where Rudeus does not exist, Norn became an
adventurer
 where she would also sing and dance as a fighting
Classes#Bard
. She also formed a party with fellow adventurers who have similar interests and journeys toward the northern
Central Continent
 and is by standards a Rank B adventurer despite neither her Swordsmanship nor Magic are outstanding. During one of her requests, her party was annihilated by a demonic
monster
 where Norn would have died but was saved by Ruijerd. To Norn, it was love at first sight and they begin to journey together.

Norn would repeatedly try to get close to Ruijerd but he ignores her advances until he discovered that the Superd Race had been wiped out by
Drain Syndrome
 and fell into despair. Norn devoted herself in caring for Ruijerd who is moved by her affection and they got married. They live together in a corner of the
Biheiril Kingdom

Rudeus
 from an alternate future, Norn avoids speaking with Rudeus who has become depressed and a drunkard after Roxy died and in the later years, she is barely mentioned afterwards leaving what happened to her is unknown.

Power and Abilities

Unlike her parents and siblings, Norn does not have any outstanding abilities. However, she manages to rise above her peers by sheer effort which earns the respect of her family and peers alike. In a way, Norn is a "jill of all trades, but a master of none," being able to use both magic and
Battle Aura
, but not specializing in either. Also, her lack of talent means she will likely never be able to rise above the intermediate level.

Physical Abilities

Norn is trained by Rudeus in using the sword after Paul's death and she attains
Intermediate Sword God Style
.

Magic Abilities

『
Healing Magic
』

Her rank is unknown, but she is at least Elementary level. Norn used a healing spell on
Cliff
.

『
Divine Strike Magic

Writer

Norn took interest in writing when she finds out that Rudeus is trying to make a storybook about Ruijerd who just started on the physical apperance of Ruijerd, Norn volunteers to help him since Ruijerd would tell her stories about the
Superd Tribe
 during their journey to Sharia. After her initial manuscripts, Rudeus sees Norn as a talented writer where her methods of presenting the story she is writing to be interesting.
 Through her adulthood, Norn has authored several books, that greatly affected the impression of those around her and also has been referenced by other books such as The Asura Kingdom's Dossier on Rudeus Greyrat.

==========================

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Information

Story

Relationships

Appearance

Family Members

Paul Greyrat

Norn has a great amount of love and respect for her father and was with him the longest out of the two sisters after the Metastasis Event scattered them, she was with him for most of that time.

Following his descent into depression, Norn remained respectful and understanding towards him and hated it when her brother Rudeus beat her father down during their first meeting. She refused to reconcile with Rudeus even after Paul admitted to being the one at fault. She ultimately wanted to go with Paul to save her mother, even though she knew she'd be a burden, because she didn't want to go to her grandmother, who she hates, or her brother, who she hates and fears. Regardless Paul sent her off to her brother's instead.

When news arrived that the rescue party was in need of help, but Rudeus didn't move to provide aid, Norn tried to go to their father herself despite not knowing how to get there or having the skills to even survive the trip, so Rudeus chose to go in her stead. When Rudeus later returned with news of Paul's death, she was heartbroken. The item she inherited from her father was his
favorite sword
 that she keeps in her room and would pray for her father from there. She has since begun training in swordsmanship under her brother and later his third wife Eris and also seeks to become an adventurer just like her father before her.

Zenith Greyrat

Zenith is Norn's biological mother and inherited lots of her features such as her hair color, body figure and her faith in the
Milis Religion
. Despite Zenith becoming unresponsive, due to being a Miko, Norn would still greet her as she leaves for school and would also talk about various things with her such as her life at school.

Rudeus is Norn's older brother whom she does not know of since he left when she was a baby and only hear stories and praises about him from his parents. When she first meets her brother in
Millishion
, he was violently beating up their father after their reunion. The results of this brought her to hate her brother, despite her father later telling her that he was also in the wrong and that they had reconciled. She didn't want anything to do with her brother, and when her father went to rescue her mother, she wanted to go with him instead, but she was instead sent to her brother's house in
Sharia
.

Her hatred for Rudeus turned to fear gradually during the trip partly because their guard, Rujierd, a close friend of Rudeus, constantly praised her brother, as did her sister Aisha. She feared that perhaps, as Rudeus once hit her father, he might be violent and hit her as well. Upon their reunion she found Rudeus returning after a night out drinking with his wife
Sylphy
, the exact image he once beat up their father for, and scorned him more. This reaches the point where she chooses to remain in the dorms rather than her brother's house, and she interprets his readiness to send her there as proof he doesn't want her around.

However, while at the magical academy, she finds several people praising her brother's personality and skills where she also gets compared to him most of the time. She learns that he's become something like the don of the school, assembling all of the delinquent students under him but is respected by everyone because he effectively brought order to this lot and keeps them from causing trouble. Finally realizing that her brother might not be the kind of horrible person she imagined, she becomes a recluse and refuses to leave her room. Rudeus himself sneaks into the girl's dorm to talk with her here, and they reconcile at long last.

When Norn tried to go and help their father who is still in the
Begaritt Continent
, despite not knowing how to get there or how to survive the trip, Rudeus went in her stead. He returned with a missing arm, news of their father's death, and their mother, who was in a mentally invalid condition. The shock of this greatly affected her, but she didn't speak ill of her brother after seeing his missing arm and realizing that it must've been caused by the battle.

She does take issue when Rudeus proposes making
Roxy
 his second wife, due to being a devout Milis believer and having previously proclaimed how she wanted an honest marriage like her brother and Sylphy did, however she was silenced by Sylphy herself, who notes that they aren't
Milis believers
 and is apparently okay with the arrangement. While this has disillusioned her a bit, it seems she's ultimately come to accept it over time as her brother's private matters. When
Eris
 later becomes Rudeus' third wife, she is staggeringly quick to accept it since it's already happened before.

She later asks Rudeus to teach her swordsmanship, and continues with it despite the harshness of his lessons. She states to him that her ultimate goal is to become an adventurer, and he notes that while he won't stop her he will be worried about her safety.

By the request of the Dragon God Orsted, she was bethrothed. Though initially somewhat reluctant, she gleefully accepted the arrangement at the mention of Ruijerd Superdia being her soon to be. As Rudeus prepared the wedding, she prayed, reflecting back on her past and on her relationship with Rudeus, whomst she akinned to fullfilling both the motherly and fatherly role in her life, as he was always with her and always supported her through thick and thin. During the ceremony, she cried about her gratitude towards Rudeus, fully accepting and loving him as her brother whomst she could always rely on.

Lilia Greyrat

Aisha Greyrat

Aisha is Norn's younger half-sister. Since young, Norn had constantly been compared to her, especially by her grandmother who told her that, as the legitimate daughter, she should always be superior to her. However, this proved to be impossible, as Aisha was a genius who could do anything she set her mind to. As a result, those around Norn constantly told her to be more like Aisha, causing her to develop an inferiority complex. On top this, Norn's personal relationship with Aisha was also not good, as the two often scuffled.

Unbeknownst to Norn, however, Aisha also had an inferiority complex toward her, believing that, as she was the legitimate daughter, their relatives loved her more.

Ultimately, after Norn overcame her inferiority complex, she and Aisha made up and are now on much better terms with each other and she would finally beat her at something many years later: being the first to get married.

In a deleted chapter about Aisha's affair with Ars, a child of Rudeus and Eris, she could never forgive her and was, together with Rudeus, strongly against the relationship. Though Rudeus reluctantly accepted the engagement, Norn has still not forgiven her.

Claire Latreia

﻿She does not seem to like her maternal grandmother﻿ due to Claire's strict attitude and education. During Paul's depression, Claire wanted to take Norn away from him forcibly but was talked down by her husband. Claire does love Norn, and had high expectations of her, but she ultimately failed to mold her in any way to her ideal image of a noble lady. She warned Norn not to become an adventurer like her mother, which finally insulted Norn enough to alienate her.

In truth Claire loves Norn and Zenith, despite outwardly appearing to hate Norn for being inferior to Aisha, and Zenith for disobeying her and becoming an adventurer. She wanted to tell Norn to just do her best and not compare herself to Aisha, but she failed to relay those thoughts. She also wanted Zenith to return and acknowledges that Zenith, contrary to her expectations early on, would've been a great mother to Norn if given the chance.

Ruijerd Superdia





Norn and Ruijerd's wedding



Norn first met Rujierd when he was escorting her brother and Eris back to the former's home. Still being fearful of her brother at the time after he got into a fight with her father, he was the only one of his companions who she felt comfortable around.

When Paul decides to have Norn to start living with Rudeus in
Sharia
, Norn vehemently refuses to go and runs away but she is saved by Ruijerd. Ruijerd agreed to be her escort to which Norn reluctantly agreed. From Ruijerd’s introduction, she develops an obvious crush, feeling like a fairytale princess rescued by her knight, enchanted by his smile and third eye bathed in sunlight.
 Over the course of their journey together, the shy Norn came to clearly rely on the protective Ruijerd and when she is unable to sleep Ruijerd would tell her stories about his past and the Superd Race. Ultimately though, the two were forced to part ways after their journey was complete. Norn, still scared of her brother, initially didn't want to be separated from Ruijerd, but he managed to convince her to at least give her brother a chance.
 Norn also begins working with Rudeus in restoring the honor and reputation of Ruijerd and the Superds and through the stories Ruijerd told her, she writes a book that helped the people learn the truth of Ruijerd's history.

Many years later and during the events of Biheiril Kingdom, Norn is deeply shaken by the news of Ruijerd’s condition, recalling their past together, his kindness, the stories he shared, and the comfort he gave her. Despite her overwhelming desire to help him, Norn chooses to stay with Lucy, who is distressed from being left alone. However, when Lucy learns the full story, she urges Norn to go help Ruijerd and so Norn finally decides to leave, determined to be there for Ruijerd, just as he had always been there for her.

Upon arriving at Ruijerd's house she nurses and looks after the sick Ruijerd. When Ruijerd recovers she's so happy that she hugs him and starts sobbing and hiccuping with a flushed flace. They stuck together in times of rest, Norn being taught many things by Ruijerd and Norn constantly looking to cook him food. When it was time to return to Sharia, the shy Norn wanted to give a memento to Ruijerd, but Ruijerd tells her that he'll never forget her.

In
K431
, Orsted orders Rudeus to arrange for Norn's marriage with Ruijerd much to Rudeus' surprise. After Rudeus talks to Norn, she immediately tells Rudeus that she accepts the marriage to make the arrangements immediately. The two got married in a Superd and Milis style wedding and had a child they named
Luicelia Superdia
.

Information

Story

Relationships

Appearance

She was born in the
Buena Village
 which was destroyed due to the Metastasis event. She then later moved to the Milis Kingdom with her father
Paul Greyrat
 and committed to Milis Faith there. She had attended school in the Milis Kingdom before she had moved to Sharia to live with her brother.

When she was 5, it was the first time she met her brother
Rudeus Greyrat
 who was seen plummeting her father to the ground. She instantaneously hated him and interjected the fight, officially ending it. From that point onwards to their reunion, she continues to hold that sentiment towards him.

She was often compared to others as a child and she disliked it. She was always told to be 'more like her brother' and 'to be better than her sister
Aisha Greyrat
' by her grandparents. She is seen to be suffering from an inferiority complex due to the constant comparison which caused her to have the mindset that she would not be better than anyone else.

When she was in her teens, she hated the decision of having to move in with her brother and his new wife
Sylphiette
. At some point in the Younger Sisters Chapter, she nearly became a shut-in in the dorms and was saved by her brother who understood what she was going through and offered her comfort.
 She shares a close attachment to her brother due to that incident, feeling like
Rudeus
 was just like her father
Paul Greyrat
.

From that moment on, her relationship with her brother became better and under his persuasion, she and her sister became on better civil terms. She and
Aisha Greyrat
 later becomes close friends with one another and are often seen together and helping one another.

She was then seen working hard on her academics, magic and swordsplay, becoming more forthcoming with her emotions. Under the careful tutoring of
Roxy
,
Eris Greyrat
,
Sylphiette
 and
Rudeus Greyrat
, she becomes more proficient and above average at those areas. Through that, she forged a closer bond with her sisters-in-law.

She assisted her brother in writing a book to clear the stories of horrors about the Supard Race that were partially true, which later turned out to be her own book. Her brother had complimented her on her gift for words which led to her writing several more before her death.

Throughout the story, she is seen to play some roles. She often helps out with the household chores and likes to dote on her nephews and nieces a lot.

The most prominent part about her was her becoming Student Council President of the Magic University of Ranoa, a feat that even surprised her grandmother
Claire Latreia
. She was seen as a calm and collected person who devoted herself to her duties.

In fact, she was so popular in terms of looks and dedication that she had a fan club that was later more organized thanks to her brother's work behind the scenes. She was adored by many and served as President for three years before she graduated.

After graduation, she became an office lady in a Magic Guild, sorting out paperwork and finances. Although that is her main job, she still helps her brother with the biddings he had been given.

Synopsis

Rudeus' younger sisters Norn and Aisha has arrived and begins to stay at the
Greyrat House

Rudeus, who is at a loss on how to treat his two younger sisters who are complete opposites of each other decides follow Paul's instructions and decides to send them to study at Ranoa Magic Academy, but...

Ginger
, they volunteer to escort Norn and Aisha to Sharia while Sylphiette accommodates the two and currently in the bathroom. After their discussions about
Eris
, Ruijerd mentions that he will be leaving tomorrow but assures Rudeus that he will return.

Next day, Rudeus sees Ruijerd and
Badigad
i staring at each other by their gate where the latter leaves upon seeing Rudeus. When asked, Ruijerd explains that they have a history long ago that Rudeus concludes it was grudges from the
Laplace War
 and invites Ruijerd to have breakfast with them before he go.

After breakfast, Norn wants to go with Ruijerd, still resenting Rudeus for attacking Paul back at Millis, but he tells her not to think about that and to rely on Rudeus and assures Norn that they will meet again. At the living room, Rudeus formally welcomes Norn and Aisha and he is given a lockbox containing coins and valuable items from
Paul
 for funds and two letters from Paul. Following Paul's request in the letter, Rudeus decides that his sisters go to school, but Aisha declines and claim that school has nothing to teach her while Norn also refuses as well, but they both agreed to take entrance exam.

That night, Rudeus consults with Sylphiette on Aisha wishing to be his maid to which Sylphiette doesn't mind since they are neglecting the house as they are always at school and its what Aisha wants, but she is also worried about Norn.

The exam result arrives and Aisha happily shows that she got a perfect score and Rudeus agrees let Aisha help with the house and talk with Sylphiette. Norn, who scored below average, wants to live in the
dormitory
, which upsets Aisha when Rudeus permits her under the impression that Norn is getting special treatment and that she is the daughter of a concubine, but Rudeus assures her that he doesn't see her that way and sees as her as his real sister.

Days later, Norn is about to leave the Greyrat House where Rudeus give him numerous advises and also tells Norn to return to the house in 10 days.

At Ranoa Magic Academy, Rudeus is worried upon seeing Norn who seems to be alone but is approached by Linia and Pursena and gives him a bag while telling him to open it when he is alone. While wondering the contents of the bag, Rudeus meets Luke and tells him to accompany him to the Student Council Office. When they arrive, Ariel tells Rudeus the activities of Linia and Pursena of forcing new students to give up their underwear, making Rudeus realize the contents of the bag and gives it to Ariel.

With the problem sorted, Rudeus, Sylphiette, Ariel and Luke sees Norn who is apparently lost so Ariel asks Luke to guide her while Rudeus looks on still worried.

At the school grounds, Rudeus scolds Linia and Pursena for their stunt where Norn sees them and is driven away by the two to which Rudeus tells them she is his sister and further warns them they will be punished if they pull a stunt like that again.

As everyone in school goes about their everyday life, Norn is alone in her dormitory room...

North God Style
===============

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

“North God Kalman I used a sword, but there is no need to stick to the sword.”

North God Kalman II

North God Style
 (
北神流
,

Hokushin-ryū
)
 is one of the three major schools of swordsmanship.

Characteristics

The main focus of this style is not on techniques or developing specialties, but rather on a method for staying alive and approaching a battle with the highest chance of winning. It relies heavily on the practitioner's adaptability and use of their surroundings. Consequently, this style uses many tricks instead of refined techniques.

This utilitarian style of swordsmanship includes non-sword fighting techniques, such as first aid and tracking, as well as the ability to fight while physically disadvantaged. Because of this, different North God Style factions have different approaches to battle, resulting in very disparate fighting styles among their practitioners. Practitioners may dual-wield swords or use non-sword weapons, such as battleaxes and staves.

Due to their adaptable style and reliance on tricks, they are a hard counter for
Water God Style
 because most of their peculiar tricks are hard to parry or counter. At the same time, however, this style is weak against the
Sword God Style
 because the latter is a straightforward style that aims to finish off opponents with one attack before being overwhelmed.

Many adventurers and mercenaries learn North God Style because of its versatility, which is necessary on unpredictable battlefields.

Known Techniques

Techniques of the North God Style are unique to their user except for a number of fundamental techniques.

Sword Throwing Techniques





A North God Style sword throwing technique



Sword Throwing Techniques: When a North God Style Swordsman is cornered or rendered immobile, they will throw their sword. The sword is flung at high velocity with the blade whirling violently. This technique has enough impetus to even cut magic fireballs. During
Eris
' battle against
Orsted
, she uses another variant of sword throwing technique she witnessed from Auber once. She trained to draw a sword from the scabbard with one hand as fast as possible.

Used by an unnamed thug,
Auber Corvette
 and
Eris Greyrat

Four Legged Form





Paul using Four Legged Form while dodging
Rudeus
' Rock Bullets in the Anime



Four Legged Form
 (
四足の型
,

Yotsuashi no Kata
, lit. "Quadrupedal Form")
: The user charges using their arms and legs similar to a beast race, making them a smaller target compared to moving in two legs while drawing their weapon when closing the distance to attack their target.

Used by
Paul Greyrat

Hazy Cross

Hazy Cross
 (
朧十文字
,

Oboro Jūmonji
)
: The moment both swords are swung and blocked, the user throws them away and draws the remaining sword to stop the enemy through a gap in the enemy's defense.

Used by
Auber Corvette

Teardrop Bullet

Teardrop Bullet
 (
落涙弾
,

Rakurui-dan
)
: It involves throwing a bag full of powdered spices at the enemy.

Used by
Auber Corvette

Ranks

There are seven ranks in the North God Style.

North God

The North God is the most powerful practitioner of the North God Style and leader of the school. Practitioners who are of Saintly level and above may call themselves a Saint, King, Emperor or God of the North God school. However, unlike the
Sword God Style
 and
Water God Style
 systems, the title of God rank can be assumed by more than one person as long as their strength and skills are approved by most of the practitioners of their faction. There are no clear qualifications for a practitioner to become a North God since the North God ranks have only been held by immortal swordsmen of the
Kalman
 lineage.

Due to the different factions in the North God Style, Kalman III hates the techniques from outside his faction but after battling Rudeus, he changed his mind become versed in all the techniques of every faction that he now teaches his student.

North Emperor

Trivia

The headquarters of the North God school is located in the Kingdom of Dragon King on the
Central Continent
.

Most of the North God Style practitioner have peculiar/unique traits that differ from one another, usually it's easy to know the trait just by knowing their nickname.

North God Style is regarded as the second strongest sword style after Sword God Style.

Due to the numerous factions of the North God Style, it is more lenient in granting the title of Kings, having slightly less than 50 known North Kings around the world
, way more than Sword Kings and Water Kings.

Most antagonist swordsmen appearing in series are North God Style practitioners.

The
author
 states that
Ruijerd's
 strength is equal to a North Emperor.

If you are afraid, Go over the mountains

Those waters that overflow,

They are like a blessing that heal my dissatisfied heart.

In my imagination, I see a place where no one has ever stepped.

If you have one compassion and love,

You will achieve it

The wind that knows silence

Bows a perch

And sings a song

Saying it won't show the same sky twice

While I was falling a sleep, I was wishing to last

If it's a dream, don't turn around

In my imagination, I see a place where no one has ever stepped.

One promise we make is an eternity

An overflowing pray

Let it heal

Good bye, good bye

The me from the past

Good bye, good bye

I won't leave my memories behind

In my imagination, I see a place where no one has ever stepped.

If you have one compassion and love,

You will achieve it
Si tu as peur, Va au-delà des montagnes

Ces eaux qui débordent,

Elles sont comme une bénédiction qui soignent mon cœur insatisfait.

Dans mon imagination, je vois un endroit ou aucun pied n'a foulé le sol.

Si tu as de la compassion et de l'amour,

Tu l'atteindras

Le vent qui connaît le silence

Tend une perche

Et chante une chanson

Disant qu'il ne montrera pas deux fois le même ciel

Pendant que je m'endormais, je souhaitais durer

Si c'est un rêve, ne te retourne pas

Dans mon imagination, je vois un endroit ou aucun pied n'a foulé le sol.

Une promesse dont nous faisons une éternité

Une prière débordante

Laissez-le guérir

Au revoir, au revoir

Le moi du passé

Au revoir, au revoir

Je ne laisserai pas mes souvenirs derrière moi

Dans mon imagination, je vois un endroit ou aucun pied n'a foulé le sol

Si vous avez de la compassion et de l'amour

Vous l'atteindrez

Wasururu koto wa nakare to daichi wo hau wa ikazuchi mune

You must not forget, the sound of lightning crawling upon the earth.

The sleeping stars awaken as well, raining down like arrows.

In the uncountable dark nights let us pray for the return of the thing which gives us breath.

This song, which knows the of the revolving time, I will endlessly give to you.

The small tears in the dried up field of vision, I will leave them as well, I will leave them.

Burn in an instant, bathe in the grains of fire,

If you survive, in the coming time,

The days of suffering and the hatred as well, you will receive the shining permission.

You will cross the endless cycle of life and death, child of the stars,

Follow your fate.

This song, which knows of the revolving time, I will endlessly give to you.

When you ask for saving from the truth of this world,

Make a prayer.

This song, which knows of the revolving time, I will endlessly give to you.

Without waiting for guidance, a prayer from the far past you cannot let be stopped, a prayer.

Among the noises of trees

I am holding my breath quietly
Even without knowing each others' names
I entrust you
A faint streak of light from the bushes in deep
It's like the warmth of a mother

Nature left behind by ancestors
It's written on my chest and is throbbing

Voice and sprit of the tree
I wish to hear you
Before I move beyond the mist
And get lost

A little stream of a dream
I scooped some and splashed them on myself
A leaf boat created a ripple
And sank all alone
A mind changes like wind and rain
I am washing my muddy heart

In my blurred memory in the distance
I found a feeling I almost forgot

Voice and a sprit of tree
Tell me words I am looking for
Before time merges to become me

More I get to know by tracing the silhouette

More confused I get
Along the untainted river flow

Voice and sprit of the tree
I wish to hear you
Before I move beyond the mist
And get lost

Heave and earth
I sing a song now, please listen
Before time merges to become me
I'll devote myself

Before I become someone

To those who have lost their way,

The voice of the plowed land

To the beginning of life

Bestow rain unto the sadness of the wastelands

Aah, let us grant thanks and prayers

To a single grain of the earth

Let us not make waste

Of the sadness and hatred

That eternity has entrusted

Unto this body

Aah, let us give thanks and prayers

To a single grain of the earth

Live vividly,

Oh inheritance of the departed

Swearing to share what little

Food and dreams you have

Aah, let us grant thanks and prayers

To a single grain of the earth

Aah, let us give thanks and prayers

To a single grain of the earth

Let the cry of a child's birth resonate

Let the whole world know

It's a gift from heaven

The amount of many lives

A baby who's burning a forest

Slept nights without being held

Received power

By giving up being able to touch love

Go to sleep, a mother's voice

Let it carry in a lullaby

Shut down, shut down the only curse

Don't wake up, go to sleep, go to sleep

A cute baby was born

In a small town

It's a gift from heaven

Equipped with knowledge

To live his life without struggle

To put food on his table

On the cloud

God's watching the future

Of power he's given randomly

Go to sleep, child of God

Separate yourself from troubles

But stay close to man's heart

Go to sleep

Accept your fate

Tears flow down everyone's eyes

Go to sleep, my child

No matter how you look

I love you, I love you

Feel safe

And go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep

I tore apart the drawn map

The world remains the same as that day

Once again

I blamed someone else

I feel disgusted

Will I keep pretending to wait for something like this?

Can I start over from here?

I felt like I could go anywhere

Where was the me from that time?

It's not about becoming an adult or anything like that

It's not about that

With just a little bit more courage

There was a tomorrow that could have changed

I couldn't even realize that

I wonder how many of those moments were there

I untied the knotted thread

The world remains as it was on that day

Once again

I just keep repeating the same things

I feel disgusted

Embracing selfish dreams and shattering them myself

What do I want to do?

Will someone someday tear apart this darkness for me?

Oh, my life

Our sense of justice is surely

Something that bothers someone else

It's not about it being unavoidable

It's not about that

If I could become a little stronger,

There would be a tomorrow to protect

Even the nights that have completely changed

I hope we can smile

Saying it starts from here again

Twisted emotions

Please don't come out

I'm sure I've already changed

Goodbye to you

For you

For someone

I wanted to become

An unending night's

Indestructible star

I couldn't become that

So we'll stay like this

With just a little bit more courage

There was a tomorrow that could have changed

I couldn't even realize that

I wonder how many of those moments were there

There's no forever

Before it all come to an end

I took a step forward

Accepting it

Praying

"I am already preparing and moving while thinking about what will happen in a hundred years time. What has happened and what will happen, everything is strategic preparation. Because of Nanahoshi and you, things have become distorted..."

Orsted to Rudeus Greyrat

Orsted
 (
オルステッド
,

Orusuteddo
)
 is the current
Dragon God
, a title given to the strongest member of the
Dragon Tribe
, and the sworn enemy of
"Human God"
.

Spoilers ahead!

Initially an antagonist, nearly killing
Rudeus
 twice due to his affiliation with Hitogami, he later becomes a major supporting character, after "Human God's" true nature is revealed.

Appearance

Similar to other Dragon Race people such as
Perugius
, Orsted has silver hair and golden
sanpaku
 eyes with an overpowering look.

He carries no visible equipment and wears a white coat adorned with fur.

Personality

Due to having the
curse
 of being hated and feared by all living things that see his face, Orsted has rather poor social skills and carries a somewhat distant attitude. When it comes to his objective, he is absolutely ruthless and would not hesitate from destroying anything on the way, no matter who or what. He would not hesitate to attack any apostles of
Hitogami
, usually without actually even taking the time to listen to them and has almost killed
Rudeus
 twice because of this.

However, he has an unexpectedly soft side to him, being patient and kind towards his comrades. Furthermore he has shown himself to be extremely kind towards children, especially Rudeus' children who are immune to his curse and thus don't fear or hate him. He is also very humble, preferring to refer to his followers as comrades rather than subordinates in spite of the vast power and standing differences. Orsted has an empathetic side as he profoundly apologizes to Rudeus for hiding the fate of the Superd Tribe from him.

He tends to become more emotional on topics that involve the
Dragon Race
 as he was quite angry at Rudeus when he mentioned the Dragon Race and spoke of
Perugius
. However, he does not get along with the other Dragon Race and seems to hate the Dragon Kings.

Background

Laplace: "A name"
First Dragon God: "Name?"
Laplace: "The name of your child?"
First Dragon God: "Orsted. This child's name is Orsted"

Orsted was born roughly
10,000~20,000 years ago
 in the Dragon World from the union between his father, the
First Dragon God
, and his mother
Lunaria
, the daughter of the Human God. However, at the time of his birth, his father had still not decided on a name for him yet despite his wife urgings to give him one.
 The world was split into six in this era, each home to a different race and ruled by a god: the human world, dragon world, demon world, beast world, ocean world, and sky world. However, at some point, Orsted's mother ended up being killed under mysterious circumstances. The
"Human God"
, claimed that the other gods had conspired against the Dragon God, resulting in his wife's death. Enraged, the Dragon God would wage a war of retribution against the other worlds.

The war ended up killing the other gods and destroying their worlds, with only the human world being spared his wrath and prompting survivors to flee there. However, after destroying the demon world, the dragon god's ward,
Laplace
, learned that the Demon God's wife had also been mysteriously murdered. Realizing that the person he thought had been Human God was, in fact, an imposter who had planned all of this, the furious Dragon God intended to go to war with the human world as well. However, at this point, his generals could no longer tolerate their liege's constant warmongering and turned on him, resulting in a battle so great that it left the First Dragon God getting extremely weakened while the dragon world began to collapse as well. Seeing this chance, Hitogami mortally wounds him.






Orsted defeating Gal Farion in the Manga



In the end, the First Dragon God was left mortally wounded whilst the surviving dragons departed for the human world. Though too weakened to kill the false Human God, the Dragon God managed to seal him in the
void between worlds
 before succumbing to his wounds. Before this happened, however, the dragon god used his power to send his son 10000 years into the future with a mission to kill Hitogami. He also ordered Laplace to await his son's arrival and develop techniques that can be used to kill Hitogami when the time comes. Upon sending his son to the future, the First Dragon god also finally decides on a name for him: Orsted.

On his journey in the
Human World
, Orsted battles and soundly defeats
Gal Farion
 who was at the time still a
Sword Saint
. Although Orsted completely defeats Gal, he spares him and let him go without missing a limb.

Achievements

Achieving the title of Dragon God, which is only given to the strongest member of the
Dragon Tribe
.

Ranking #2 among the
Seven Great Powers
.

Effectively being #1 due to the actual #1 being absent throughout the entirety of the Mushoku Tensei.

Mastering virtually every combat technique in the world, be it swordsmanship or magic, at God-Rank making him the strongest character in Mushoku Tensei.

Note: This section is under construction and revision
.

Quotes

Orsted:
 "You. Are you perhaps familiar with the name
Hitogami
?"

Orsted:
 "When you die, be sure to deliver a message to Hitogami for me. Tell him that the Dragon God Orsted will be the one to kill him."

Orsted:
 "Choose! Rudeus Greyrat! Side with Hitogami, and lose everything to me! Or follow me, and fight Hitogami together! If it's you, since it's you who is immune to my curse, then you should be able to choose with your own will!"

Rudeus:
 "From my view point, you seem to hold a great grudge towards Hitogami, what is the reason?"
Orsted:
 "Is there someone who does not hold a grudge against that piece of trash?"
Rudeus:
 "...That's true."

Orsted:
 "There are many who call themselves Dragon Kings. They live as they please with that tiny pride of theirs and die because of a foolish enemy. But you are different. Therefore, don't call yourself that, Rudeus Greyrat."

Orsted:
 "I, too, want to try fighting believing in my comrades for once."

Orsted:
 "Possessing the Fighting God Armor and the King Dragon Sword. I assume that you'll have no excuses when you lose with both?"

Orsted:
 "Choose. Become my follower or die."

Trivia

Orsted is so skilled and experienced in combat that he could take at least five different courses of actions in one second of prediction, making Rudeus completely unable to counter him even with the
foresight eye
.

The curse of being hated and feared by all living creatures does not apply to members of the ancient Dragon Race,
Nanahoshi
, Rudeus and Rudeus' descendants.

Orsted tends to give an intimidating gaze. When he met Rudeus and Nanahoshi, he also asked why they are not looking away (indicating they are unaffected by the curse, otherwise they would).

Orsted usually deals the killing blow to his enemies by punching a hole through their chest, earning him the nickname "donut maker" among some fans.

Orsted unexpectedly enjoyed the company of Rudeus's child,
Lucy
, giving her a shoulder ride when she was small and even taught her a trick to do magic when she had difficulties.

Even though he is ranked second in Seven Great World Power, Orsted is said to be strongest in the world, surpassing the Technique God.

Orsted often checks on Rudeus's family when Rudeus was out to make sure that they are safe.

He is the 100th generation of the Dragon Gods.

He stopped counting after 100 "returns" (+100 times * 200 years= +20,000 years old), however his actual age is unknown.

At the start of every loop, he spends 10 years training his body.

In one of his loops, he fought Hitogami in the Void World and lost.

Orsted has kept notes about how to replicate the effects of the helmet created by Cliff, so in future loops he can create it himself, however he said that he wouldn't be able to improve on it on his own.

Orsted has notes regarding the changes happening to the world due to Rudeus's influence, in the off chance of a future loop with Rudeus.

If Rudeus exists in future timeloops, Orsted intends to postpone obtaining the treasure of Mad Dragon Chaos, so that, Rudeus, Zanoba and Chaos can work together on the automaton that Rudeus and Zanoba invented.

As Orsted has been reincarnated in a human body like Perugius, he doesn't have wings on his back like the original Dragon race.

Knows of Rudeus's reincarnation as well that he is of the same world as Nanahoshi.

Mushoku Tensei

Volume 2 - Juvenile Period - Home Teacher Chapter

He appears for the first time in the Red Dragon mountain range, killing two Red Dragons in self-defense with one strike each. Noticing the abnormal mana gathering in the Fittoa Region as a precursor of the Teleportation Disaster, he curiously heads in its direction.

Volume 6 - Juvenile Period - Homecoming Chapter

Initially, he and Nanahoshi were walking by the Red Dragon Lower Jaw and accidently meet
Dead End
. After hearing that Hitogami visits Rudeus in his dreams, he fights against Dead End and easily defeats
Ruijerd
 and
Eris
 while holding back, and almost kills Rudeus after rupturing his inner organs. However, he was scratched by Rudeus' Stone Cannon after being caught off guard. He then spared and healed Rudeus per
Nanahoshi
`s request.

Volume 15 - Young Man Period - Human God Chapter





Orsted defeats Rudeus.



Under the orders of the Human God, Orsted was ambushed by
Rudeus
 who managed to damage him with magic powerful enough to utterly decimate the city-sized location of the battle, forcing the Dragon God to fight seriously. Summoning the "Godblade", he completely overwhelmed Rudeus by destroying the Magic Armor and slicing off his right arm, but then he faced Eris who managed to put up a fight against him due to her arduous training. Hearing the story about Hitogami's threat from Rudeus, he decided to make him his comrade in his fight against the
Human God
.

Volume 16 - Young Man Period - Kingdom Chapter

Rudeus learn more about Orsted, his history and his curses. He also explained to Rudeus about
Laplace
 and flow of destiny before moving over to their plans to defeat Hitogami. They decide on their first goal to make
Ariel
 the queen of Asura Kingdom, correcting the course of history which
Human God
 disrupted to gain an advantage over Orsted.

Volume 17 - Young Man Period - Asura Kingdom Chapter

He ordered Rudeus to help Princess Ariel and kill
Hitogami
's apostles who changed the flow of fate. He tailed Rudeus and his party from the shadows, occasionally appearing to advice and help. In the venue, he answers Rudeus' emergency call for help and easily kills Water God Reida. After the events in Asura Kingdom, he told Rudeus the real truth: Orsted is a looping existence that has experienced the world for more than 100 times and that Rudeus is a new existence outside the loops.

Mushoku Tensei 'Sequel'

By the time of Mushoku Tensei's end, Orsted's mission to kill
Hitogami
 is one of the major story threads that remained unresolved. However, Rudeus did see a vision where his and
Roxy's
 daughter,
Lara Greyrat
, helped Orsted and an unknown individual, presumably
Shinohara Akito
, enter the void between worlds to finally seal the malicious god. Thus, Orsted is likely to remain a major character in the planned 'sequel' series.

"I shall grant my child my every technique, and to him the ability to remain concealed until he could defeat Hitogami... but that will not be enough. He must find out what happened to Human God, and how Hitogami obtained divine powers in the first place. Until then, defeat is inevitable."

-First Dragon God to Laplace

Power and Abilities





Dragon God Orsted considered to be the most powerful being of the Human World



A descendant of both the
First Dragon God
 and
true Human God
, Orsted is a demi-god with potential surpassing mere mortals.
 He is the current holder of the Dragon God title, which is only given to the strongest member of the
Dragon Tribe
, who are themselves considered the strongest species. As a result of his kind's advanced lifespan and great power, along with being stuck inside a time loop, he has either mastered or has knowledge of virtually every form of swordsmanship and magic. He is also a quick learner, mastering
Rudeus'
 dual casting technique after just seeing it once.

Currently, Orsted is the strongest being in the
Human World
, having surpassed the Technique God, Demon God and
Laplace's
 original self.
 He is powerful enough to destroy the entire world according to
Hitogami
, being held back only by one weakness that forces him to be careful with how much of his power he uses at once: a slow mana-recovery. Every occasion where he does go all-out has ended in his overwhelming victory, defeating fellow God-Rank opponents like Rudeus,
Reida Reia
, and
Kalman III
 with relative ease. In one of his loops, he even managed to defeat the
Sword God
,
North God
, and a Demon Lord at once.
 It's said that if Orsted were to deliver an all out serious attack, entire continents would disappear.

Physical Abilities

Orsted's physical capabilities are unrivaled within the series, he easily defeated North God
Kalman III
 even when the latter was equipped with Dragon king sword Kajakuto, the magic blade that controlled gravity and the Fighting God armor; the same armor that withstood an attack that split a supercontinent into two.

His reaction speed is completely beyond any other character as he was able to perceive a lightning bolt from the sky and was about to run from its course; had he not been trapped by Rudeus. He was capable of casually reacting to and deflecting Water god
Reida Reia
's trump card, "Sword of Deprivation" before easily killing her.

As mentioned above, Orsted has mastered all styles of swordsmanship including the Sword God style, this allows him to use Longsword of Light, its variants and its equivalents in other sword styles perfectly. Infact, his mastery with Longsword of Light is such that he can recreate its usage without the need of a sword at all, using his own hands as swords instead.

His outstanding physical abilities has allowed him to perform feats such as killing 2 red dragons with one hit each. Defeating
Ruijerd
 in 10 seconds with just punches. Punching Rudeus several hundred meters away while he was wearing magic armor Mk. 1.

Stamina and Resilience

Orsted is never shown to be tired in his limited combat scenes. Has high pain tolerance and was not bothered by his arm getting cut off, that he even picked it up and used his own severed arm as a weapon.  He is able to withstood several of Rudeus' strongest attacks while he was donning the Mk. 1 Magic Armor that that is said to imitate the Fighting God Armor.

Also, being from the ancient dragon tribe, he can survive for about 100 days without food and go without sleep for 10 days due to their high resilience.

Combat Ability





Orsted using
Water God Style
 Flow against Eris



Most of Orsted's abilities and sword techniques are God ranked, the highest attainable. He tends to fight defensively to see how his opponent attacks, observes an opponent's attacks he has never seen before to learn the technique or spell himself
  otherwise he tends fight only with his bare hands and Saint Dragon Battle Aura when he knows the opponent's skill or technique they are using, giving the impression that he does not fight seriously but he gradually adjusts to using magic depending on how strong the opponent is. Orsted usually finishes off his opponent by punching a hole in their chest with his claws especially on apostles of Hitogami
 called Claw Technique, a part of the fundamental fighting style of the Dragon Tribe:
Teaching of Nail, Fangs and Wings


Saint Dragon Battle Aura

Rock Bullet breaking through Orsted's Saint Dragon Battle Aura
Orsted fighting with his bare hands and Saint Dragon Battle Aura to defeat
Ruijerd
1/2

The strongest unarmed fighting style that makes the least use of mana in combat. Created by the previous Dragon God
Urupen
 that protects the user from most magic spells and sword techniques. Orsted learns Saint Dragon Battle Aura from a secret note left behind by Urupen and with that information, he successfully learns his predecessor's greatest fighting style and mastered it to the highest level.
 On their first battle, Rudeus is able overcome the Saint Dragon Battle Aura to wound Orsted's hand using the intermediate rank spell Stone Cannon, which had it's power increased to a very high level with the abilities of Silent Spell-Casting.

As a testament to its toughness, Rudeus's Stone Cannon could barely break through Orsted's Battle Aura, despite being able to completely blow away strong opponents like Badigadi (who has a King Tier battle aura) and Atofe (whose battle aura should be even higher than Badigadi's).

For reference, Nina's Longsword of Light technique (when she was at the rank of Sword Saint) barely scratched Badigadi.

Intellectual Abilities

Orsted knows most if not all people in the world, at the very least those of great importance, including how and when they are born and from whom due to his multiple reincarnation time loops. Orsted would give Rudeus what seems to be odd missions on the surface (eg. rescuing an adventurer in a labyrinth, helping a merchant lost in the forest, going to the slave market to buy a slave to be sold somewhere else or even helping a young female dwarf thief called Tal Qi) but they are step-by-step preparations. Thus those people they help will be useful to Orsted in the future and making it the key to not only make sure that he is in his best condition for the [decisive battle] but also for Rudeus to establish a network of new contacts and friends.

In addition to his multiple reincarnation time loops, he knows how to battle against every kind of opponent such as crushing the lungs of a magician to prevent them from casting spells and can give advice on improving the Gattling Gun to combat Water God Style users. After
Ariel Anemoi Asura
 becomes the next Queen of
Asura Kingdom
, Orsted begins training Rudeus on different magic and tactics such as fire mage and swordsman strategies that are hard to defend against. With his knowledge of the ultimate attacks of all three sword styles and how to counter each one, Orsted also teaches Rudeus numerous techniques, especially from the
Sword God Style
, like what to be careful of and what to counter with that Rudeus made very good progress for only a year that he feels that he has been fooling around too much in the past.

Magic Abilities

Knows most
Magic Spells
 but because of his slow mana regeneration he rarely uses magic unless fighting a strong opponent.

Silent Spell-Casting

Orsted is among the few people who can use spells without the use of chants. Despite this, Orsted is puzzled that Rudeus needs to use the chant of a new spell being taught to him before he can use its voiceless incantation version.

Healing Magic

On his second battle against Rudeus and Eris, Orsted combines Silent Spell-Casting with Healing Magic that restores his severed arm and his wounds fully healed in an instant.
 After the battle, Orsted heals Rudeus' wounds that also restores the arm that was severed from the
Teleport Labyrinth
  which is classified to be at least King Rank Healing Magic. He has also healed the hole he put in Rudeus' chest. Although the rank of this healing magic is never confirmed, it wouldn't be far off to assume it is Emperor or God class.

Summoning Magic

Although the magic rank is not specified, Orsted is able to write a magic circle for Summoning Magic for a being to serve as a guardian of Rudeus' family against Hitogami. Almanfi describes the Summoning Magic to be "a complex technique" and when used with Rudeus' magic power, it is able to override the contract of Almanfi as
Perugius Dola
's familiar which Almanfi deems impossible.

Voice Magic

Magic of the Doldia tribe that uses sound. The user howls or roars to disrupt an opponent's balance like an electric shock and paralyze them. One of the only spells which cannot be replicated with a Magic Circle

Hypnosis Magic

Magic of the Nuka tribe that Orsted uses to put his opponent to sleep

Disturb Magic

Disturb Magic in the Anime
Rudeus using wind magic with his left hand while his other hand is sealed by Disturb Magic
Orsted using Disturb Magic against Rudeus in the Manga
Rudeus' right hand sealed by Disturb Magic
1/4

Disturb Magic (Ran Ma) cancels an opponent's magic by disrupting the magic and causing it to never take shape and scatter. Ran Ma only targets one part of the body. On Orsted's first battle, Ran Ma seals the magic on Rudeus' right hand but is able to use magic with his left hand.

Dragon Gate

Dragon Gate in the Anime
Dragon Gate absorbing the magic power of Nuclear Explosion
Orsted summoning Dragon Gate in the Manga
Dragon Gate, absorbing Rudeus' magic power
1/4

Orsted summons a gate engraved with dragon statues that absorbs the magic power of his opponent. When Dragon Gate is used against Rudeus, the gate cracks leaving some of the effects of Rudeus' magic to make a smaller explosion causing Orsted to remark that Rudeus' magic power is on the same level as
Laplace
.

Unnamed Presence Search Technique

Orsted can use an unnamed magic technique to search for presence of people in a certain radius(although it could be the case that the radius depends on the amount of mana he puts in). He used it in his second battle against Rudeus to search and quickly catch up to him. Also, he once used it to find Lara when she got lost in his office. Since he is quite mindful of using mana, it could be inferred that this technique uses negligible or minimal amount of mana.

Gravity magic

Reincarnation Technique

When Orsted dies while alive, or once 200 years have passed since beginning the technique, he is sent back in time to the winter of the year 330 of the Armored Dragon era, precisely to the northern forests of the
Central Continent
. He has executed this time-loop more than 100 times—but stopped counting after reaching that threshold. Technically, this is a time rewind—a loop that resets everything up to that point, erasing all prior events. What carries over between each loop are Orsted’s knowledge and skills. Physically, the first ten years of each loop are spent retraining and restoring his physique.

Effect

By falling outside the
world's natural order
, Orsted becomes undetectable by
Hitogami
, who thus cannot observe his present or future. Instead, Hitogami sees alternate, incorrect futures in which Orsted doesn’t participate.

Because the secret art remains constantly active—continuously consuming mana—Orsted’s mana recovers at a rate 1000 times slower than normal. For perspective, while
Rudeus
 can recover from a drained state in about 10 days under normal conditions, Orsted would take roughly 30 years to regenerate his mana. As a result, Orsted must conserve mana and cannot unleash his full strength freely.

Weaknesses

Slow Mana Regeneration

Due to the numerous Magic Circles placed on Orsted, he has extremely slow mana regeneration (he may not be able to replenish his mana capacity fully in 100 years) due to his unique situation of time loop reset via reincarnation slowing it down, making him reluctant to use magic as he is saving it for when he faces Hitogami.

Dragon Tribe Curse

"Ever since I was born, I was indeed shunned by all living creatures."

-Orsted

Orsted has a curse on him that makes all living creatures of the
Human World
 whether its man, beast, demon, etc., either hate him or fear him extremely. However, this is not a problem for people not of this world like Rudeus and Nanahoshi.

Although it is not directly implied to be a curse until it was mentioned by Hitogami, this effect of fear and hatred towards the Dragon Tribe is traced beginning from the
Six-Faced World
 Era where the Dragon Tribe waged war on the other worlds and after witnessing the First Dragon God kill the other Gods, and with it, the world that those Gods ruled is also destroyed and the denizens of that world to flee in fear to the Human World. Due to the final battle between the First Dragon God and Hitogami, this caused the Human World, now merged with all the terrain characteristics of the rest of the worlds to be beset with all sorts of natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes and lightning with plague all the denizens of the Human World with fear and loathing. This permeates throughout the world which resulted in all the denizens of the Human World to fear the Dragon Tribe especially the Dragon God.

Equipment

Orsted's Coat

Rudeus finding Orsted's Coat in the Anime
Rudeus wearing Orsted's Coat with the Curse Supressing Helmet
1/2

Orsted wears a white coat that has sleeves, reaches above his feet, a black fur-like trim collar and is adorned with several belt and buckle that is strapped above his torso and waist. The coat is made from the pelt of an ancient white dragon that carries an absurd amount of magic power, possesses high physical and magical defense. It also possesses self-restoration against aging and damage over time but because Ancient White Dragons are now extinct, it is a unique item. Rudeus describes the coat to be bulky but warm and feels nice which is similar to Red Dragon's pelt.

Curse Suppressing Helmet

A black helmet developed by Cliff that suppresses the curse that causes him to be feared and hated by everyone who looks at him.

『Godsword』






Orsted using Godsword against Rudeus



Godsword, also known as Godblade is a katana that Orsted summons by pressing his hands together, making Godsword materialize from his left hand after separating them slowly that he uses on his second battle versus Rudeus and later against
Kalman III
. A lot of
Mana
 gets consumed just by summoning Godsword. Rudeus estimates it takes around 15% of Orsted's Mana just to summon godsword. Using godsword Orsted can cut anything within several kilometers range(except certain magical items such as Yulian's cursed swords, Paul's tantou, fighting god armor, etc.). It also has a time restriction of at least 10 minutes which is the time it took for Orsted to defeat Kalman III even though Kalman III was using the Fighting God Armor and Dragon King Sword Kajakuto.

Curses

Orsted's curse affecting all creatures of the world
Curse on Orsted causing even dragons to fear him
1/2

According to Hitogami, Orsted was said to have 3 curses. However he only has 1 curse, and 2 of these "curses" are the result of the
First Dragon God
's technique used on him.

The curse of being hated and feared by all living creatures in this world.

The 'curse' of being invisible from Hitogami's view. In reality this is a result of the secret technique which allows him to "reset" when he fails a loop.

The 'curse' of being unable to go all-out in combat. This is later revealed to be a side-effect from the technique that the first Dragon God used on Orsted to send him forward in time and repeat the time loop until he beats Hitogami. It causes him to have extremely slow magic power restoration, thus he can't freely use magic and several of his techniques.

Laplace: "A name"
First Dragon God: "Name?"
Laplace: "The name of your child?"
First Dragon God: "Orsted. This child's name is Orsted"

The First Dragon God is Orsted's father. Although The First Dragon God is normally decisive on making choices, he didn't give Orsted his name near the destruction of the Dragon World then also grants him his power and knowledge to fulfill his wish and the wish of the
Dragon Tribe
 - the defeat of Hitogami.
 Since then, the succeeding generations of the Dragon God including Orsted has been making his preparations for his eventual battle with Hitogami and ensures that the original timeline that he refers to be ordained by
Fate
 to be followed.

Lunaria

-Lunaria

Lunaria is Orsted's mother. Lunaria protected Orsted in his infancy with her body when an unknown assailant attacks and her body is seen in a fetal position clutching Orsted.

Laplace

"The Demon Dragon General Laplace is the only one left of the first generation
Five Dragon Generals
. Laplace escaped the collapsing
Dragon World
 and drifted to this

, to carry out a certain mission, He became the second generation Dragon God."

-Orsted to Rudeus

The First Dragon God planned to raise Laplace as a son, a mix race of the Dragon Tribe and
Demons
 with the intent of eliminating the hatred towards hybrids which in turn prepare for Orsted's birth who is also a mix race of the Dragon Tribe and
Human
.
 Although it is implied that Orsted is aware of this and what has become Demon God Laplace, he is preparing for Laplace's reincarnation, the war against him in order to retrieve the relic in Laplace's posession that he needs to open the way to the
Void World
 and battle Hitogami.

Friends

Nanahoshi Shizuka





Orsted and Nanahoshi in the Manga



Orsted is the first person Nanahoshi encounters after being transported to the
Human World
 and assists her and adjusting to her new life. He recognizes Nanahoshi as "useful" and was very interested in her otherworld knowledge that he trusted her enough allow her to travel the world together and later introduces her to
Perugius Dola
 to begin her research on Summoning Magic.
 They later parted as Nanahoshi enters
Ranoa Magic Academy
 to continue his research but Orsted gave her a magic tool in form of a ring that allows her to summon him.

Subordinates

Rudeus Greyrat

Rudeus is Orsted's first 'subordinate' (Orsted considered him a comrade but Rudeus insisted upon being called a subordinate).

During the first time that they met, Orsted realizes Rudeus is unaffected by his
curse
 and is also bewildered that Rudeus is
Paul Greyrat
's son which to his knowledge Paul only has
two

daughters
. When Orsted heard the name of Hitogami from Rudeus, he thought that Rudeus was an apostle. As such, Orsted '
fought
' (a one-sided beatdown, really) against
Dead End
, which ended with Orsted having an overwhelming victory, where Rudeus is on the brink of death. However, as per the suggestion of Nanahoshi, he spared his life and heals his chest wound. After some years, Orsted
battles
 Rudeus and defeated him again, making him his subordinate after battling his Magic Armor. In the beginning, Orsted didn't really trust him, but as time passed, Rudeus becomes one of the few people that he can call a friend and in turn Orsted watches over his family.

Ariel Anemoi Asura

Orsted initially plans to make Ariel to be the Queen of
Asura Kingdom
 as he remembers in true timeline ordained by
Fate
, that if she becomes the Queen, it'll lead to the existence of a powerful person pivotal in the fight against Laplace

So he gives Rudeus his first mission, which is to assist Ariel on becoming queen.
 On their journey to Asura Kingdom, Ariel realizes Rudeus' intentions and asks him to meet with Orsted. Although Ariel is initially afraid of Orsted, Ariel willingly becomes his subordinate after hearing his plans and the future of Asura Kingdom.
 When Ariel becomes queen, she continues serving Orsted by sending him information about the Kingdom's activites such as the marriage of
Isolte Cruel
 and
Doga
.

Zanoba Shirone

"In that case, I would have you work under Rudeus and take orders from him. If you propose we make more allies, then that is what we shall do."

Pax Shirone
, Orsted concludes that the current time loop is a failure but Zanoba who wants to avenge his brother interjects and suggests that they gather allies in preparation for war against
Laplace
 which eventually lead to the establishment of the
ORSTED Corporation
 and Zanoba also becoming Orsted's subordinate who is also the co-developer of the
Magic Armor
 .

Kalman III





Orsted defeating Kalman III in the Light Novel



Aleksandar"Orsted-sama... But I'm still not yet qualified as a North God..."
Orsted:"That's exactly why you should train him. If you watch him and raise him all by yourself, you just might discover what it is about the North God Style you are lacking."

Aleksander becomes Orsted's subordinate after the Decisive Battle, wanting to learn about the truth behind a hero. After becoming Orsted's subordinate, he usually stays at the Orsted Corporation Headquarters, and has become quite doctile.

At Orsted's suggestion, Aleksander trains
Sieghart Saladin Greyrat
 in the
North God Style
 with the intent that he might become the North God in the original timeline who lost to
Sword God

Jino Britts
 and fell into despair but after training a child, he became the strongest North God in history. By being with one of Rudeus' children, Orsted considers the possibility for Aleksander to realize what makes Rudeus strong and perhaps become a more noble and stronger North God than in the one in the original history.

Greyrat Family

Rudeus' family with the exception of his children are still affected by Orsted's curse but agrees that Rudeus becomes his subordinate despite their mistrust towards him. Rudeus eventually asks Cliff to create a
Curse Supressing Helmet
.

Lucy Greyrat

Orsted has a soft demeanor towards Lucy.

When Lucy was young and met Orsted for the first time, she mistook him for her father, due to Orsted's white hair, which is similar to Sylphie's.

Lara Greyrat

As I thought, Roxy's child is special.

-Orsted after Rudeus' report of summoning
Leo
 to protect Lara

As part of the agreement for Rudeus to become his subordinate, Orsted gives him a scroll containing a magic circle to summon a protector for his family.
 Like most of Rudeus' children, Lara frequently visits the
ORSTED Corporation
 Headquarters and is also unaffected by Orsted's curse. For the case of Lara, Orsted feels unease towards Lara especially when he is target of her pranks which he doesn't mind. Out of all the people Orsted knows, Lara is the only person he has no idea how she'll grow up and also believes that this is the reason why Hitogami is afraid of her and even did much effort try to kill her before she is born.

Others

Hitogami

Before you die, give Hitogami a message:"Dragon God Orsted is going to kill you."

-Orsted to Rudeus

Ever since the death of the
First Dragon God
, Orsted's father due to Hitogami's machinations, the next 99 generation of Dragon Gods has lived their life to defeating Hitogami and is the sworn enemy of Orsted and the entire dragon race. Orsted hates him so much that he would fly into murderous rage upon hearing Hitogami's name.
 This hatred towards Hitogami also extends towards anything concerning Hitogami that he would repeatedly tell Rudeus to not to believe anything he says. Even Hitogami's apostles are also that target of his hatred that he would kill them on sight but Rudeus is able to convince Orsted to spare some of his disciples like
Luke Notos Greyrat
 since it might affect other people that are important in Orsted's plan like Ariel who is close to Luke after surviving together on their journey to Sharia after their exile. During his countless loops, Orsted continuously prepares to kill Hitogami by writing all the changes in history he was and was not involved with and memorizes all their outcomes to eventually prepare for his battle against him and would repeat the course of actions that benefits him.

Perugius Dola

"In this
world
 there are three people you should never fight:
Technique God
,
Fighting God
, and Dragon God. Among those three, Dragon God Orsted is the strongest and the most ruthless."

Perugius to Rudeus

Perugius and Orsted are both from the
Dragon Tribe
. Despite this, Perugius tends to not get involve with Orsted's motives as he prioritizes his upcoming battle against Laplace and also refuses to aid Rudeus against his
second battle
 against him but Perugius allows Orsted entry of
Chaos Breaker
 and usage of his Teleportation Circles.

second season
 (46th overall)
Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on June 16, 2024 and also the fourth episode of the
Labyrinth Arc
 for the Anime.

Synopsis

Rudeus and his friends are transported to the seventh floor and finally see Zenith! However, a giant Manatite Hydra, the guardian of the Teleport Labyrinth, stands in their way. The Hydra is a legendary creature thought to be extinct, a formidable enemy from the
Second Human-Demon Wars
!

Plot

At the Sixth Floor of the Teleportation Labyrinth, Rudeus, Paul, Roxy, Elinalise, Geese and Talhand are about to step into the Magic Circle after confirming they are ready. Despite Geese suggesting they can turn back for now Paul decides to move forward and everyone check their gear. At Rudeus' request Roxy gives him some of her
Healing Magic
 Scrolls and promises to support him to ensure he does not use the scrolls. After checking on everyone if they are ready, Paul tries to tell something to Rudeus but the latter suggests to save in until they return home and they all step in the Teleportation Circle to the seventh floor.

At the seventh floor, the party continues exploring and they reach a huge hall and they see the Labyrinth Guardian who happens to be a
hydra
 as Geese exclaims he never seen one before but Paul sees Zenith trapped inside the Magic Crystal as the hydra prepares to attack them. Paul attacks immediately despite Geese calling him out not to rush in, causing Elinalise and Talhand to commit while Roxy and Rudeus casts
Icicle Break
 and
Stone Cannon
 respectively to support them but both spells are nullified before it touches the hydra. Meanwhile, Paul dodges and attacks the hydra attacks and severs two heads. The hydra retaliates but Elinalise bashes the head aside with her
Buckler
 that halts the attack but is wounded in her left shoulder. She stabs with her
Gladius
 but it got stuck between the scales. The hydra attacks Paul and Elinalise again but Roxy uses
Flood Flush
 that causes masses of water to appear before Paul and Elinalise that and pushes them back from the hydra's attack range. Talhand follows up with
Earth Pillar
 above the hydra but it also got nullified as Rudeus notices hearing the high pitch sound indicating their spells are nullified and ponders on retreating. Roxy then calls out that the two severed heads have regenerated at high speed and calls out to retreat but an enraged Paul attacks again, causing Talhand to call on Geese who runs ahead and throws several smoke grenades to distract the hydra. Paul halts his advance as he cannot see his target just as Geese grabs onto him to force him to fall back who still refuses until Elinalise slaps him and they all fallback. Elinalise calls on Rudeus who uses
Deep Mist
 then Roxy calls on retreating back to the Magic Circle to the sixth floor.

Back at the Sixth Floor, Rudeus
heals
 Elinalise's wounded left shoulder then checks on Paul who is now seated by the wall and still enraged as he mentions that he really saw Zenith and tries to calm down at Rudeus' suggestion. But when Rudeus questions if Zenith is still alive, Paul angrily grabs Rudeus by his collar and berates Rudeus, causing Talhand to tell them to stop. Paul continues to tell off Rudeus on being so calm upon seeing Zenith but Rudeus points out to him that being mad won't solve anything as he internally reflects that he is indeed too calm and recalls his relationship with Zenith back in
Buena Village
 during his
childhood
 and hasn't seen her for nearly 10 years.

Rudeus then calmly reviews what they learnt but Paul grabs Rudeus' collar and chastised his reaction. Geese and Talhand forces them apart and Elinalise also chimes in to have a discussion while Paul sits down, still upset and everyone follows suit and sits in a circle. Upon seeing Roxy worried, Rudeus tells her that he is alright since this is not the first time he had a
quarrel
 with Paul so Roxy clears her throat and mentions she can help Zenith then Elinalise mentions she knows someone in a similiar situation and assures Paul that Zenith is alive but their immediate problem is the hydra. Geese adds that they have never seen a hydra that has those kind of scales before then Talhand points out the its high speed regeneration is a problem. Roxy explains that they are dealing with a
Manatite Hydra
 where its scales can absorb
Mana
 that she thought to be a fairytale and upon clarification, Roxy tells Rudeus that
Magic
 should work at point blank range, leaving the hydra's regeneration to be the only issue. Rudeus then tells the party that searing a decapitated neck with fire like
Heracles
 did in Greek Mythology should prevent its regeneration. Meanwhile, Paul continues to give angry looks. The rest of the party is willing to try it then Geese got Paul to accept. Paul who has now calmed down expresses his appreciation of what the party has done to find Zenith and asks them to help him one last time and the party encourages him. Paul then complements his son coming up with a plan unlike him who cannot be calm and charges head on then tells Rudeus to rescue Zenith even if it kills him.

With their strategy established, the party returns to the seventh floor where the hydra lies in waiting and Paul signals the battle to begin. Paul leads the charge while Rudeus uses his
Foresight Eye
 to predict the hydra's movements. Paul dodges every head attack and severs one of the heads then Rudeus aims his
Fireball
 at it but it also got nullified and concluding he needs to move much closer and Paul telling him to stay close behind him as the severed hydra's head regenerates.

The hydra continues its attack that are being
Tank
 by Elinalise and Talhand while Paul severs another head and signals Rudy to launch another Fireball at the severed head but the another head attacks Rudeus that is blocked by Elinalise who dashes in front of Rudeus to block with her Buckler and immediately decapitated by Paul. Rudeus immediately uses another Fireball at the newly decapitated neck and confirms that the seared neck did not regenerate. Paul is encouraged by this and decapitates another head and after Rudeus sears it, he heals Elinalise's injured shoulder after blocking a hydra attack meant for him. Paul and Rudeus follows through the strategy while Roxy follows Talhand to heal him while he is tanking but is got caught by one of the hydra head by his leg that Paul immediately severs. Roxy immediately heals Talhand who falls to the ground as the battle continues. The hydra suddenly bites off a neck that was seared causing Paul call it out and to prevent it from healing so Elinalise leaps to the severed head by the hydra and thrusts his Gladius to it then uses
Ice Smash
 on the head to freeze it then calls on Roxy who follows up with
Flamethrower
 on the frozen neck to prevent its regeneration.

The Hydra, with three heads remaining, is suddenly taking a deep breath which Paul notices and calls out that something is incoming. Rudeus, having battled a
Red Dragon

before
, is recognizing that the Hydra is using its Fire Breath and calls on everyone to gather to him. Once they do, Rudeus is using
Water Shield
 to summon a huge wall of water just as all the remaining Hydra's three heads use Fire Breath on them, but it is absorbed by the Water Shield. The Hydra eventually stops using Fire Breath, so at Rudeus' call, Paul resumes attacking to sever another head, which Rudeus follows up with a Fireball on the severed neck and does the same on one more head. This causes the Hydra to tremble and attack everyone at the same time, where Paul moves Rudeus out of its range, Elinalise dodges, and Talhand blocks the attack on Roxy. While the party is recovering from the attack, the final head attacks Rudeus, but Paul kicks him out of the way and gets struck instead. Rudeus, having recovered, finds himself face to face with the final head. He strikes the eye with his left hand, causing the Hydra to shut its eye and severing Rudeus' left hand just as he finishes casting 3 Stone Cannons that burst out from the Hydra's head, destroying the Magic Crystal that absorbs mana. The Hydra is frantically dragging Rudeus off the ground as he calls on Roxy, and she finishes off the final head with Flamethrower and collapses by its side.

Rudeus, still on the ground, sighs in relief that the battle is over but feels the pain in his left hand and uses
Shine Healing
, which closes the wound and restores his left limb except for his hand. Upon checking on Paul, he notices everyone is shocked into silence, and to his horror, sees Paul on the ground with his lower body missing. Their eyes meet, and upon seeing Rudeus, Paul wordlessly sighs in relief as blood comes out of his mouth and the light goes out of his eyes...

Moments later, the Magic Crystal encasing Zenith begins to crack and shatter as she falls to the ground still unconscious. The party is later seen leaving the Teleportation Labyrinth with Talhand carrying Zenith on his back. Roxy tries to talk to Rudeus, but like everyone else, she is at a loss for words.

At the Inn in Rapan, the party is welcomed by Lilia, Shierra and Vierra but when they are told that Paul has passed away, Lilia is shocked but remains silent while Vierra and Shierra weeps. Lilia then approaches and embraces Rudeus as he tells him to get some rest and she will handle things from here. At his room, Rudeus takes off his robe and lies down as he recalls the moment he burns the remains of Paul and goes to sleep.

Four days later, Rudeus and Lilia are watching over Zenith who is still sleeping and as Lilia wonders if she will wake up, Zenith opens her eyes to the relief of Lilia and helps her sit up. Rudeus calls on to Zenith who looks at him so Lilia introduces him but Zenith blankly stares back and utters incomprehensible words. Lilia realizes what has happened in disbelief while Rudeus is still stunned but also realizes that Zenith is now a husk, his heart shatters.

 because of its ability [Armor Break] where the harder the opponent's armor is; the sharper the cutting edge gets which is a rare ability that the seller was not able to identify and treated it like a dull butter knife that couldn't even saw through dried meat and practically sold for a few copper coins. The Armor Break ability is also mentioned in the book of [The Legend of Perugius] in Buena Village where a warrior in the book has a weapon with the same ability and because of this, Paul's attacks could easily kill Armored Warriors despite attacking with his offhand as long as he landed a clean hit.

Trivia

Paul begged
Philip Boreas Greyrat
 to help him to get a stable job a small while before
Rudeus Greyrat
 was born.

Among Paul's former lovers were
Ghislaine Dedoldia
 and
Elinalise Dragonroad
.

The full details of the incident that made party members of
Fangs of the Black Wolf
 resent Paul for years isn't revealed, but it was hinted by Elinalise that it involves Paul's romantic endeavor.

Toshiyuki Morikawa (Paul's anime Japanese voice actor) also voiced the main character's father in
Naruto
and
Bleach
.

Paul was the first character that obtained a new story in the
Mobile Game
.

Asuna Tomari is Paul's voice actor as a child in the Gaiden Story.

Paul carries his favorite sword all the time. According to other party members of Fangs of the Black Wolf, that sword is "the lost holy sword of Saint Millis", as it was crafted by inserting the blade of his existing sword into the hilt of the holy sword mock-up found in an ancient Millis ruin
.

The episode in which he died in the anime was shown on the same day as International Father's Day (June 16, 2024)

Paul Greyrat/Chronology
=======================

Information

Chronology

Gallery

When Paul's son,
Rudeus
, was about 3, Paul began teaching swordsmanship to him while
Roxy
 taught him magic. A few years later, some time after Zenith revealed that she was pregnant, their maid
Lilia
 also revealed she was pregnant with his child which caused some discord within the family. Rudeus' quick thinking prevented the family from falling apart and he ended up marrying Lilia as the second wife. After his daughters were born Paul saw just how dependent
Sylphy
 was towards Rudeus and felt that it wasn't good for both kids' futures. So after talking to her father he knocked Rudeus out during a sparring match, almost losing in the process, and sent him over to his
relatives
 to get a job as a tutor.

3 years after that he was caught up in the mana calamity and was transported with his daughter
Norn
. He spent his time in
Millis
 country helping out other refugees affected by the disaster and searching for his family. Eventually he and Rudeus reunited and he was initially happy to see him, but ended up becoming angry with his son while he was recounting what happened to him for his happy-go-lucky attitude as he though Rudeus was having nothing but fun while Paul himself was struggling as hard as he could to reconnect with his family, with absolutely no leads on finding Rudeus,
Zenith
,
Aisha
, or Lilia. He also thought that Rudeus wasn't trying hard enough to look for his missing mother. This angered Rudeus who threw out that he was fooling around with the women in his group. The two ended up getting into a serious fight which ended with Rudeus mounting his father and continuously punching him in the face. The fight was stopped by the arrival of Norn who demanded he stop bullying her father. After Rudeus left Paul went to go sulk in a bar where he met his friend
Geese
. After listening to Geese, Paul was able to make amends with his son and the two departed on good terms with each other.

Quite some time after Rudeus sent Lilia and Aisha to him, he is informed of Zenith's location by
Talhand
. He then made the decision to send his daughters to live with their brother so he could go save her and keep them out of danger, something Norn was against. After Paul and his group were having trouble rescuing Zenith, Geese sent Rudeus a letter asking for help. When Rudeus and
Elinalise
 showed up, Paul was in a pathetic shape apparently distraught over what he did when he was under the influence of a succubus. He believed Rudeus was a dream at first but he snapped back to reality when Rudeus said he had a child on the way. He was surprised to hear that he married Sylphy and at how quickly the two arrived to them. After informing the two that Zenith was trapped in a labyrinth, they went down and were able to rescue Roxy who got caught in a teleportation trap sometime before Rudeus and Elinalise arrived. Eventually they discovered the room that Zenith was in. She was trapped inside a giant mana crystal being guarded by a hydra. After a lengthy fight they were able to kill the hydra, but Rudeus had lost his left hand and Paul was snapped in half as he tried to save his son from the hydra's final attack. Paul looked up at Rudeus with a relieved look on his face before he died. Rudeus took some of his belongings before he reluctantly burned his corpse. He took a piece of his bone and placed inside a burial urn he created.

After returning home, Rudeus gave one of each of his things to his sisters and was intending to keep his armor for himself, but his amnesiac mute mother claimed it herself. Afterwords, he buried the urn in a cemetery which he goes to visit whenever he has some free time to talk about the things that's been happening around him and his family.

Zanoba Shirone
's younger brother and
Roxy
's former student.

The former Seventh Prince of the
Kingdom of Shirone
. After various problems related to
Rudeus Greyrat
, Pax was sent to study abroad at
Dragon King Kingdom
. Years later, he came back to the Kingdom of Shirone and initiated a coup to become the new king. A short time later, he committed suicide.

One of his future subordinates would have been a parent of
Demon God Laplace
's reincarnation.

Appearance

His first appearance as a child, he was shown to be quite round being short and with short limbs. Rudeus said that he looked like a hobbit and a dwarf pieced together.

Years later, when he returned from exile, he seemed more mature and a little more intimidating. He had lost some weight and gained muscle.

Personality

During Pax's introduction, he was a spoiled, abrasive and cruel person. He was also a sexual deviant, constantly forcing himself on girls he has power over. He seemed to be sadistic and has no regard for human life, as he has all of his servant's families held hostage, and boasted that he would execute Rudeus after raping Roxy as he watches.

It was later revealed that his vile personality was stemmed from deeply seated inferiority complex that developed when he failed to earn Roxy's approval. Desperate for Roxy's attention, he began to commit increasingly serious pranks and offences, which alienated Roxy further, forming a vicious cycle.

In an attempt to get a good life during his exile, his personality changed almost completely. He stopped being lazy and became diligent. However, his inferiority complex stemmed from being unloved and untrusted remained, which was exploited by
Hitogami
's apostles and led to his eventual downfall.

Background

Note: This section is under construction and revision
.

Pax Shirone is the Seventh Prince of Shirone Kingdom. Due to his position, it is difficult for him to become king, so not many people pay attention to him. For this reason, he manipulates people who do not want to take his side with threats.

Plot

Note: This section is under construction and revision

Volume 2 - Juvenile Period - Home Teacher Chapter

Pax studied magic for 5 years with Roxy as a teacher. Roxy constantly sets him on fire in order to stop his advances. Right before the Metastasis event, he threatens Roxy with attacking Rudeus if she doesn't stay as her teacher. Roxy doesn't care and leaves, while Pax is punished.

Volume 6 - Juvenile Period - Homecoming Chapter

In an attempt to lure Roxy back, Pax kidnaps
Lilia
 and
Aisha
. The goal is for Roxy to fall into a magical barrier so Pax can do whatever he wants with her.

The plan is completely ruined by
Rudeus Greyrat
 due to the fact that he happened to meet Pax's half-brother,
Zanoba Shirone
. Zanoba nearly kills Pax but is stopped by his other brothers.

Pax is arrested and Rudeus's family are released. In the end, the king exiles Pax and sends him to the King Dragon Kingdom so he doesn't have to assassinate him. Zanoba is exiled to the Kingdom of Ranoa.

Volume 19 - Young Man Period - Subordinates Chapter

During his exile in the King Dragon Kingdom, Pax decided to change and he did. He lost weight, gained muscle, and learned magic. He fell in love with the 18th princess,
Benedict Kingdragon
, but although he obtained good grades and attracted the king's attention, his exile status did not allow him to marry a princess. Because the Shirone Kingdom did not accept the King Dragon Kingdom's proposals, they sent Pax to take power by force.

Pax returned to the Shirone Kingdom along 10 skilled knights including one of the
Seven Great Powers
,
Randolph Marianne
 the Death God. With their help, he carried out a coup killing all the royalty. Pax became the new king, although the kingdom was weakened by the recent civil war so he decides to send a letter to Zanoba to ask for help. Zanoba says he will work with him but does not pledge allegiance to him.

Zanoba departs for Shirone Kingdom along with Rudeus and Roxy. Pax sends Zanoba, Roxy, and Rudeus to defend an important position. Meanwhile, there is a rebellion against Pax in the capital due to which he gets depressed, as the country won't accept him as the new king and locks himself in his castle and makes his wife pregnant. When the group gets to his room, they have an argument in which Pax releases all of his anger and feelings that he held back for years. He verbally attacks Roxy, who never complimented his progress always comparing him to Rudeus, while she can only bite her lip.

Pax admits that he cannot bear that much load and jumps from the fifth floor, dying instantly.

Securing the Throne of Shirone:
 Pax orchestrates a successful coup d'état, seizing control of Shirone with the support of the King Dragon Kingdom. He strategically utilizes the elite knights provided by King Dragon, demonstrating a degree of tactical planning and political maneuvering.

Winning Benedikte's Affection:
 Pax manages to win the heart of Benedikte Kingdragon, the sixteenth princess of the King Dragon Kingdom.

This unlikely pairing showcases Pax's charisma and his ability to connect with others on an emotional level.

Earning Randolph's Loyalty:
 Pax gains the respect and loyalty of Randolph Marianne, the Death God and fifth of the Seven Great Powers.

Implementing Reforms in Shirone:
 Pax, despite his flaws, demonstrates a genuine desire to improve Shirone. He dismisses corrupt officials, appoints more deserving individuals to positions of power, and takes steps to bolster the kingdom's defenses.

Pergius Dola

Redirect to:
Perugius Dola

Perugius Dola
=============

I have a request for those who read this book. There is a child of the Dragon Race who does not know his name in this world. Please tell this child his name... This child has silvery hair, and must be a nameless man by now. Please tell him, "Your real true name is Perugius." Perugius, son of Dora-sama, the Great Dragon King Dora

-Laplace

Perugius Dola
 (
ペルギウス
・
ドーラ
)
 is a high-ranking member of the
Dragon Tribe
, holding the title of "Armored Dragon King", and one of the Seven Great Heroes who sealed away Demon God
Laplace
 500 years ago. He currently resides in the floating castle Chaos Breaker, where he awaits the Demon God's revival.

His storyline is one of the major plot threads left unresolved when Mushoku Tensei ended. This storyline maybe resolved in the planned “sequel” series. The author has clarified that this
will not be a direct sequel
. Instead it'll be set within the ‘
six-sided universe
’ some 80 years in the future. There will be some characters returning but none of the main characters.

Appearance

Perugius has an appearance similar to
Orsted
, but does not have a curse of being hated. Perugius has gleaming silver hair, sanpaku eyes with golden pupils and an aura of nobility radiates from his entire body.

Personality

Due to the Laplace War, Perugius holds intense animosity against all Demon Races. However, he is not insufferably stubborn, willing to bend his own rule for the sake of people who earn his favor. For example, he gave Rudeus his blessing to sell
Ruijerd
 figures because Rujierd once helped in dealing the decisive hit against Laplace in the past. Also, despite his dislike in politics, he still offered his assistance to Zanoba when the latter going back to Shirone, by letting
Roxy
 travel through the sky fortress. Perugius often allows the main characters to teleport to various locations in the
Human World
, showing he is kindhearted beneath his serious face especially to those he has taken a liking or for his amusement.

Perugius loves art and takes pride in his collections. He's very interested in
Rudeus
' figurines, just like
Zanoba
.

Background

Dora
 spawns the egg of Perugius prematurely about the same time Laplace was battling the culprit responsible for
Crystal
's death. Days later, Laplace informs Dora of the capture of the culprit to the relief of Dora. Dora then presents Perugius' egg to Laplace and asks him to name her child but Laplace was reluctant since he does not know if its a boy or girl but Dora assures him that her child is a boy, so Laplace names him Perugius and becomes his God Father.
 After the
First Dragon God
 defeats the Five Dragon Generals, Dora asks Laplace to bring Perugius' egg to the
Human World
 and has not been heard
 until he was introduced by Dragon God
Urupen
 to the
Adventure Guild
 is given the title "Armored Dragon" like her mother. Working under Urupen, Perugius is in the party with
North God

Kalman I
, Twin Emperor Migus and Gumis during the
Laplace Wars
.








Perugius became famous after rebuilding the ancient sky castle Chaos Breaker, and challenged Laplace with his companions. In honor of his deeds a new era was named after the war called the Armored Dragon era.

His companion North God Kalman the first defeated and married Laplace's most feared demon lord,
Atoferatofe
. Kalman made Perugius and Atofe promise not to kill each other. After the Laplace campaign he spent some time as a guest of Asura Kingdom, as an equal of King Asura. During this period he came to describe the king as his friend, but he grew tired of court life and later moved a life of seclusion. He sits afloat Sky Castle [Chaos Breaker] and travels the world preparing for the Laplace's revival.

Plot

Mushoku Tensei

Volume 2 - Juvenille Period - Home Teacher Chapter

He, like
Orsted
 and
Kishirika Kishirisu
 noticed how the abnormal
mana
 gathering occurred at the
Fittoa Region
's sky that and as a result he sent his servant,
Almanfi
, to investigate and kill any suspicious person involved in it to prevent the seal on Laplace from being undone.

Mushoku Tensei Sequel

Perugius' quest to kill Demon God
Laplace
 is one of the major plot thread that remained unresolved by the end of Mushoku Tensei. Because of this, he is likely to once again play a major role in the planned sequel series, which is set around the time in which the latter is said to finally resurrect.

Power and Abilities

Summoning Magic and Teleportation

Perugius is widely seen as a first class expert in Teleportation Magic initially researched by Crystal and Summoning magic inherited from Dora.  He has teleportation circles throughout the world and is also able to summon people to his castle with the aid of a magic tool.  As such, he is an extremely convenient "taxi service" according to Rudeus.

Magic Circles

Aside from creating Teleportation Circles, Perugius is so knowledgeable in creating Summoning Circles that he is able to rewrite the Summoning Circle that Orsted gave to Rudeus to summon the
Guardian Beast
 for the protection of his family.

Dragon Gate

Perugius raises his hands while chanting to summon two Dragon Gates at once when he confronts
Atoferatofe Raibaku
. The ornate silver Dragon Gate Drains magic power similar to Orsted's Dragon Gate while the ornate gold Dragon Gate drains
Battle Aura
 rendering Atofe unable to fight back nor escape.

11 Ancient Spirits






11 Ancient Spirits in the Anime Teaser



Perugius is also able to summon 11 ancient spirits of high intelligence and power that stays with him as long as he lives.  Even if one of them were to be defeated, Perugius has the ability to re-summon them at his castle.

Almanfi of the Bright

Almanfi is the first of the familiars that is introduced in the series, he is described as loyal, respectful and knightly.  He has the ability to instantly travel anywhere in the world that has light, this ability makes him a scout of sorts to Perugius and is often the one that makes the first move in any situation. In terms of combat he was able to match blows against
Ghislaine
 a sword king, though he got defeated pretty quickly by the Water God, as such though never directly stated he should be around Low-King Level. At one point, Rudeus annulled Perugius' contract with Almanfi and summoned him as his own guardian by mistake.

Yuruzu of Atonement

Aside from Almanfi we do not know much of Perugius other familiars. Yuruzu has the ability to transfer vitality between two people, as such he is basically the healer of Chaos Breaker.

Sukeakoto of Time

Sukeakoto has the ability to stop time for the person he is touching, though this ability also stops his own time.
 But despite the time of its subject is stopped some functions are still working like when the effects of the time stop is cancelled, the subject will be very hungry.

Clearnight of Thunder

His power allows him to listen to everything that is inside Chaos Breaker and a special flute that is given to those who are granted entry to Chaos Breaker

Dotbath of Destruction

Upon being summoned by Rudeus, Arumanfi told him that Dotbath of Destruction will be able to "destroy" the contract between them.

Karowante of Insight

Karowante is able to determine a persons powers and also the condition of a sick person

The following familiars are shown to be with Perugius though their powers were not yet revealed.

Trophimus of the Wave

Harkenmail of Life

Gall of Earthquake

Furiousful of Fury

Paramount of Darkness

Armored Dragon King Hand Sword(Break)

Summons a light that can sever an immortal demon lord in two. On his latest confrontation with Atofe, Perugius initially uses Dragon Gate to drain her magic and Battle Aura then finishes her off with Armored Dragon King Hand Sword (Break).

Equipment

Chaos Breaker

Chaos Breaker is a sky fortress that Perugius rebuilt during the Laplace Wars and later became his home as well as a transport to travel around the world.

It is unknown if his armour has any significance, but he is always seen wearing it, showing his readiness for battle.

Achievements

He was one of the three heroes to defeat Laplace, alongside Ruijerd's help which he feels indebted to.

Quotes

To Rudeus: "In this world there are three people you should never fight: Technique God, Fighting God, and Dragon God. Among those three, Dragon God Orsted is the strongest and the most ruthless. Even though I respect your determination to protect your family, and am curious of that Human God... I do not want to get involved. Until Laplace revives, I don't plan on dying."

Trivia

Apparently he had a bad naming sense stated by Rudeus as he named Rudeus fourth child
Saladin
.

He swore to defeat Laplace for the sake of revenge to his 3 dear friends (
Urupen
,
Kalman I
, and
Kaunis Freean Asura
).

His English voice actor
Kenny James
 is most famous for being the current voice actor to
Bowser
 of the super Mario games.

Background

Born at the western edge of the
King Dragon Realm
 in a village bordering a dense forest. Her father was a hunter and taught her how to be one as well before he died due to an
Ibri Lizard
, while trying to find an Eant Flower, whose petals can cure Ibri disease. He was searching for this plant with the help of
Angelique Curenttale
's parents, who were apothecaries, to save his wife who had contracted the disease, which has a very high mortality rate after being infected for 10 days. Due to the circumstances of her parents' death, she felt guilty towards Angie, but soon grew extremely close with her and they became best friends.

However, at the last moment, Rudeus was able to fling the lizard away, and blow its head off with his Zaliff Guantlet. Rudeus walked with Angie while carrying Pham and headed back to her village. He cast multiple healing spells as he carried her to ensure she was safe and would not die, as Orsted had instructed Rudeus to save her.

Philip explaining his love of the Beast Race in the Anime



Like all of the Boreas Family, Philip has a love for the
Beast Race
.
 Philip can be a kind and lenient man, giving
Rudeus Greyrat
 a chance at a tutoring job despite believing that Paul is exaggerating. He usually presents himself as an elegant and smart gentleman, unlike his father
Sauros Boreas Greyrat
. He also has a more playful side that he won't shy from asking Eris to perform the "Boreas Greyrat etiquette" when they try ask Rudeus for a favor.

Despite losing to his brother during the power struggle to succeed the Boreas Greyrat family, he remained cunning and ambitious, always scheming in the dark to get back into power with the intent of using Rudeus to be the next head of the Boreas Family.

Rudeus describes Philip to be extremely resourceful and efficient, and is always having fun watching Rudeus move behind the scenes as he tries to do something. He also sees Philip to taking his fight to the inner Asura Kingdom.

Background

Philip, of the
Boreas Greyrat
 family, is Eris Greyrat's father and Cousin of
Paul Greyrat
. When Paul came to him asking for a job he made him a low ranking knight so that he would be able to provide for
his wife
 and soon to be born son. Philip became the mayor of the
Citadel of Roa
 after losing the bid to become the next head of the Boreas Family and Lord of the
Fittoa Region
 that was initiated by Sauros. As a result, Philip's two sons were taken from him to be raised by
James Boreas Greyrat
 as per Boreas tradition.

Plot

At the request of Paul, Philip hires Rudeus that he reluctantly accepted him to be her daughter's tutor where he shows interest on Rudeus' plan and arrange that they both be kidnapped.

After Rudeus' birthday party, Philip discusses his plans from behind the scenes to make Rudeus the head of the Boreas Family to that was previously impossible with Eris but Rudeus dismisses it as merely drinking chatter.

In the aftermath of the
Teleport Incident
, Philip and Hilda are teleported to the Conflict Zone at the southern part of the
Central Continent
 where they are captured and tortured to death.

Legacy

Eris: "If he were still alive and could see us now, I wonder what he'd think about it."

Rudeus: "I figure he'd be delighted."

Ghislaine Dedoldia
 is also teleported in the Conflict Zone but by the time she reaches Philip and Hilda, they are already dead

Ghislaine buries their remains up a hillock at the base of a tree, erected wooden grave markers with their names while grateful that she was taught how to write by Rudeus then travels back to Roa.

The
Princess Ariel Faction
 suspects that Philip is plotting to overthrow the Notos Family by using
Sylphiette
 who is teleported to the Silver Palace so they made their own countermeasures to prepare while he is still missing.

Paul mentions that Philip would always denounce him during their childhood but on Rudeus' 10th birthday, Philip sends Paul a letter with his intent of Rudeus to be married into the Boreas Family and become Eris' wife to which Paul replies that he can do what he wants

Paul later tells this marriage arrangement to Rudeus and they both concluded that Philip pulled a blind one over them as they both sigh.

Rudeus and Eris visits their graves in the Conflict Zone through details provided by Ghislaine and
Soldat Heckler
.

Rudeus and Eris digs up their bones to be reburied in Asura Kingdom instead of Fittoa Region which is still rebuilding.

Rudeus consults with
Luke Notos Greyrat
 who directs them to a graveyard created by the previous king which is marked: "Here rests the ferocious lion" and buries the remains of Philip and Hilda there instead of the Boreas Family Graveyard.

After graduating from
Asura Royal Academy
, Rudeus sees
Christina Greyrat
 to resemble Philip's figure or aura somehow but finds it natural since Chris is Philip's grand daughter.

Trivia

Appearance

The Playback Miko was born with a blank expression, similar to the dead.

Personality

Due to her fate of being forced to repeat the same life continuously, the Playback Miko realized her fate in every timeline would only be slightly different, and would always end in her horrible and early death. Each time she died, a new nightmare. Eventually, her mind breaks and she becomes a vacant and obedient machine with one continuous reel of her death playing.

Background

She was born in the
Armored Dragon Calendar Year 500
. Regardless of the timeline, the Playback Miko is born in a remote countryside and is shunned by adults and children alike. At the age of 5, soldiers would take her away. With some variation, she is usually captured, imprisoned, and passed between ruling powers until she dies at the age of 10, or earlier.

Plot

Volume 24 - Final Volume - Conclusion Chapter

A girl is born with the power to rewind time of an object to a maximum of 24 hours. She is able to divert death, and disease, as such, she is coveted by nations. Regardless of her abilities, no matter what she did, she could not change her fate. Over the course of centuries, she attempted to change her destiny, but could never end the hellish loop of her birth and death. Eventually, she would reach a horrible death, watching herself be beaten to death, eaten, massacred, and dying shackled as a puppet to the strong.

In one playback, she is used in a magic formation and a boy,
Shinohara Akito
 is summoned to serve as that Kingdom's hero. The boy was different and since she was able to understand him, her world changed. She becomes his interpreter and fell in love with him. But he was no hero but just a normal highschool boy o so during the battle with an enemy Kingdom, he was beheaded and by the time the Lilia found him, 24 hours have already passed and it was too late for her to revive him.

Due to the emotional impact of losing Akito, Lilia opened a rift in time and space in the past so that she and Akito could live together, and the world looped with the girl as the core. This rift appeared in the past (K400) in the skies of the
City of Roa
 where the boy had died. The Miko tried to summon a soul with a strong relationship with the boy, with the same wish as the girl who wanted to live together with him. But the power of the world was too strong for her. But after some time a stray soul from Japan passed through the rift and desided in the body of a baby named
Rudeus Greyrat
. (K407)

This soul changed the world, weakening its resistance. Lilia used all of her remaining power and summoned
Nanahoshi Shizuka
 (K417), causing the
Mana Calamity
 in the middle of Roa.

A few years after Rudeus's death (K481) the Miko was reborn drained from her powers, unable to loop again.

Summary

When Rudeus finds Eris in his room, she apologizes for his family not coming to the party. To make up for it, she came to his room to sleep with him. Thinking it over, Rudeus concludes how it was more likely that Philip and Hilda, so he initially refuses by telling Eris that he might do something perverted to her. Eris replies that she would be fine with "a little", Rudeus's awkwardness ramps up and he mistakenly gropes her. Fearing a classic punch, Eris instead does nothing trying to be accepting. Rudeus forgets himself and continues, until Eris grows uncomfortable and beats him up repeating "no!" with each hit. She leaves his room, angrily reminding him she said a little before calling him an idiot. Hurt and on the floor, Rudeus can't help but agree with Eris, realizing he was acting like events were dating sims from his old life, ignorant to Eris's feelings after she worked so hard to celebrate his birthday. Hating himself, he prostrates as soon as Eris returns through the door and begs for her forgiveness. She forgives him since it's his birthday, but she also tells him it's too soon to be doing what he had in mind, so she promises to try again in five years when they're both adults. After she leaves, Rudeus is happy that he didn't lose his connection with Eris, and looks forward to that day in five years.

Protection Magic
================

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!





King Class Protection Magic in the Anime



Barrier Magic
 is one of the four systems of
Healing Magic (magic category)
. It is a kind of support magic that creates a magical barrier to raise one's defense, to block movement and magic, or to invoke certain characteristics within the barrier’s area (i.e. nullifying magic activation
, increasing or decreasing regeneration rate
, distorting space
).

Background





Protection Magic in the Anime



Barrier Magic properties are divided into anti-physical and anti-magical. Anti-physical barriers were considered an
Intermediate-level
 technique, and upon reaching
Saint-class
 and above, the properties of both anti-physical and anti-magical barriers can be combined to create barriers with special traits
. Barrier Magic relies more on the usage of magic circles compared to chanting which requires a continuous flow of
Mana
 to maintain that is usually supplied by a Magic Crystal or other equivalent mediums. As such, the usual way to neutralize a barrier is by searching and destroying the magic crystal.
.

Barrier Magic is not well-known around the world, but it is very advanced in the Holy Milis Kingdom
. Normally, only
elementary level
 can be taught as Milis Religious Orders are the only ones who have the rights to teach higher level Barrier Magic
.

Perugius Dola
 is presently the world's best Barrier Magic user with
God-class
 abilities in this magic type.

When
Rudeus
 visits the Shirone Royal Palace, he is trapped with a King Class Barrier Magic that
Pax Shirone
 plans to use to lure
Roxy Migurdia
.

Barrier Magic Users

Perugius Dola

After the battle of Biheiril Kingdom,
Perugius
 accepted
Dragon God Orsted
's request and made the
God-class
  Barrier Magic (originally created in order to seal the
Demon God
) to seal
Badigadi
. This barrier magic sealed
Badigadi
's main body and 4 other body parts in 5 different places in Earth Dragon Valley. The barrier sealing the main body could not be destroyed unless all of the remaining 4 seals were destroyed first. The barrier was operating using the mana of
Badigadi
’s body, which was further amplified with the Dragon King Sword and Fighting God Armor as a catalyst. Thus making the barrier powerful enough that not even
Orsted
 could break out of it and giving it the ability to self-sustainedly operate almost forever.

Orsted

According to
Hitogami
,
Orsted
 can use the techniques and arts of all living things in the world, including Barrier Magic.

Shilard

Holy Dragon Emperor Shilard created a magical barrier surround each Teleport Ruin, which distorted the space inside it and hide the Teleport Ruin from the physical world. When a
magician
 places his/her hand on top of the nearby stone monument, reading the incantation while pouring mana into it, then the space around the stone monument will start to distort and change into the Teleport Ruin.

The incantation to open the magical barrier surround each Teleport Ruin:
"That dragon lived solely while following its faith. Nothing is able to escape from the grasp of those grand arms. The second dragon that died. He who possesses the most ephemeral eyes Dragon General of Lustrous Green Scales. Borrowing the name of the Holy Dragon Emperor Shilard, I now pierce that barrier."

Randolph Marianne

Randolph
 possesses the
Absolute Void Eye
, which can create a magical barrier around a large area. He used it in the siege of Shirone Royal Castle to construct a barrier around the entire castle, holding off the enemy's force, buying time for
King Pax
 and
Queen Benedict
.

Rudeus Greyrat

Rudeus first learned
Elementary-class
 Barrier Magic 『Magic Shield』 in class during his first year at
Ranoa Magic Academy
.
 He later reached
Intermediate-class
 Barrier Magic by training with
Orsted
.

Cliff Grimoire

When Cliff first met
Rudeus
 in his second year at
Ranoa Magic Academy
, he introduced himself as
Elementary-class
 but soon-to-be
Intermediate-class
 in Barrier Magic.
 In his fourth year, he used his Barrier Magic to help
Rudeus
 with the research on
Mana Absorbing Stone
.
 Upon Cliff's graduation from
Ranoa Magic Academy
, he had reached the
Intermediate rank
 in Barrier Magic.
 During the battle of Biheiril Kingdom, Cliff created various barrier magic circles throughout the forest of Earth Dragon Valley that was set to activate when
Badigadi
’s limbs were thrown into them to stop the limbs' regeneration.

Members of Anastasia Keep

The members of Anastasia Keep, the strongest group in the Order of the Temple who protects the
Miko of Memory
 are capable of using all
Advanced-class
 barrier magic.
 They utilized a
King-class
 barrier in an attempt to capture
Rudeus
, which was erased by
Rudeus
’s
Mana Absorbing Stone
.
 During battle, their signature barrier magic is the
Elementary-class
 『Magic Shield』, which takes the physical shape of a translucent shield and they used it in conjunction with the
Water God Style
 to stop
Rudeus
’s 『Rock Bullet』.

Barrier Magic in Holy Milis Kingdom

The Holy Milis Kingdom has been a country that's very advanced in
healing magic
 and barrier magic since the past. However, even in Holy Milis Kingdom, most of the people will only learn them until the
elementary rank
.

During the war against
Demon God Laplace
, the whole Milis continent was protected by a holy barrier, which, toward the final day of the war, made Holy Milis Kingdom the final kingdom of human race and humanity's last stand.

Holy Milis Kingdom's capital, Milishion, is constantly protected by a magic barrier projected by 7 magic towers. The magic barrier protects the capital from external threats as well as serves as the mean to control the weather.

The
Millishion Holy Knight Orders
 are the only ones who have the rights to teach barrier magic beyond the
Elementary-level
. Even if magicians can use higher tier barrier magic, they cannot teach them, or else they will be excommunicated from the
Milis religion
 and may face a heresy inquisition.

The Pope of Milis's office was protected by a magic barrier of at least
Saint-class
 or
King-class
, which prevent the usage of magic inside.

Barrier Magic in Ranoa Magic Academy

Ranoa Magic Academy
 is limited to only an
Elementary-level
 class on barrier magic. Even though the teachers can use higher tier barrier magic, they cannot teach them. Originally, even an
Elementary-level
 class on barrier magic was not allowed, however, after the year
K420
, provided certain conditions were followed, limited teaching was authorized. Because of such limiting circumstances, the focus of the class shifts more to the methods of how magical barriers can be broken instead.

Trivia

100,000 years ago
, there was a magical barrier that separated the 7 ancient worlds. The barrier was destroyed
10,000-20,000 years ago
 by the first generation Dragon God.

Pursena Adoldia

Pursena Adoldia
===============

Pursena Adoldia
 (
プルセナ
・
アドルディア
)
 is a member of the Doldia Tribe. Debuting at the
Ranoa Magic Academy
 alongside
Linia
, they were delinquents who terrorized the school until
Rudeus
 put them in check. Following her graduation, however, she was imprisoned by her tribe for stealing food. Fortunately, she was released by Rudeus, after which she became his maid.

Appearance

Pursena has long gray hair and red eyes, with a pair of drooping dog ears on top of her head and a fluffy tail behind indicating her Adoldia heritage. She is very well-endowed even by beast race standards, more so than Linia.

Personality

Pursena is abrasive and haughty, having the tendency to shift the blame away from herself when she gets into trouble
. Together with
Linia Dedoldia
, they are the two troublemakers in the
Ranoa Magic Academy
, but when it comes to fulfilling her dreams of becoming the Village Chief, she will do her best. In contrast to the hot-headed Linia, Pursena is more aloof and soft-spoken. Following Rudeus's victory over them in combat and subsequent imprisonment, she and Linia become more humble, no longer causing trouble and behaving as proper students.

She is a glutton when it comes to meat, constantly snacking on them wherever she goes during her school days. She is unable to learn how to control her appetite after graduation, much to her chagrin.

Background

Plot

After graduating and returned to her village, she became a warrior chief and quickly gained the trust of the other warriors with her healing magic. 10 days before
Rudeus
 arrived with
Linia
 and the
Sacred Beast
, she relieved a guard of their duty to guard the dried meat storage and her hunger got the best of her and she committed a felony by eating all of the food in the storage. She was then imprisoned until
Rudeus
 arrived and got a confession out of her. Since then she was designated as one of the
Sacred Beast
 caretakers.

Trivia

Pursena focused on learning healing magic when she was in
Ranoa Magic Academy
 because the Doldia tribe don't have many people capable of using it.

Pursena ends her sentences with -nano (なの) in the original text, and often swears in the form of "Fuck" (ファック). In the Anime this was replaced with "Nuuni", presumably the equivalent of said swear word in the Beast God tongue.

Pursena hates being called fat.

Later on confirmed that's Eris's "domination" of her and Linnia is simply hugging them until they bruise.

Races
=====

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

There are a variety of races that exist on the
Six-Faced World
. Around
20,000 to 10,000 years ago
, the War of the Gods resulted in the the fall of the other five worlds and all the survivors fled to the
Human World
 and settled in their suitable habitats. Consequently, the Human World is now populated by multiple Races
.

Humans
 (人族,
Jinzoku
) are the most dominant race in the world. Similar to humans on earth, the human race in the Human World have relatively weak physique, short lifespan and high intelligence such that most innovations in the world are the work of humans and have the most developed civilization compared to other races.
 They are the majority race in the
Central Continent
,
Begaritt Continent
 and
Millis Continent
. Humans on the Central Continent and Millis Continent speaks Human Tongue with slightly differing accents, whereas humans on Begaritt Continent speaks Fighting God tongue.

Most of the important characters in series are humans. Some prominent humans in series include:

Rudeus Greyrat

Eris Boreas Greyrat

Ariel Anemoi Asura

Elves (
長耳族
,
Erufu,
 lit. "Long Ear Tribe") are a race of people who currently live in the southern part of the
Great Forest
 in the Millis Continent. They are sometimes classified as demon race, but it was possible that they are new species that developed during the Chaotic Period. As their name implies, their most prominent physical characteristic is their long and pointy ears, which provides them with very good hearing ability. Other than that, they usually have a slim body, whereas female elves tend to be flat-chested. Their fertility is rather low, but they have very long lifespans, capable of staying in their prime for hundreds of years. They also have a very good sense of direction, able to navigate effortlessly even in difficult terrains like the Great Forest and deserts
.

It is said that magic was originally created by the High Elves, the ancestors of Elves. Long before even the Great Human-Demon War, when the world was engulfed in the unceasing spiral of battle and chaos, the High Elves, in order to fight their enemies, entreated with the spirits of the forests to control the wind and the earth. And thus, the first magic spells were born

. They are sometimes classified as demon race, but it was possible that they are new species that developed during the Chaotic Period. Dwarves are short in height: male dwarves have a stout build, whereas female dwarves are similar to young human females. They love alcohol and are highly tolerant against it. Their lifespan is longer of humans, capable of living for at least several hundred years
.

As a race of craftsmen and blacksmiths by birth, dwarves have naturally dexterous hands and high affinity towards earth and fire magic, but abhorred water and wind magic. They are adept in crafting weapons, armors and various arts, and the best craftsman would have the chance to ascend as the Ore God. Culture wise, dwarves would raise all children of the same generation together, and they would treat each other as siblings
. They won't get an official name until they are seven, and when they do, they receive a name that's fashioned after something they're good at, something they're attracted to, or something they like

There are a significant number of species, with very diverse range of physiology, abilities, and lifespan. Most Demon Race are bipedal humanoids that are radically different in appearance when compared to humans, but there are a few exceptions. Their primary language is Demon God Tongue.

When they were losing hope, the prince of Biheiril Kingdom and a few adventurers came to the Ogre Island to conquer the tribe and claim the rumored treasure. After seeing the sorry state the ogres were in, the party changed their mind and pledged to help the ogres to defeat the sea folks.

Story

Appearance

Randolph Marianne
 is the current Death God after defeating the
previous Death God
.

Appearance

Has a Skull like face, in the sense that his face is so sickly that his skin warps tightly around his face. This appearance might be due to his mixed blood as he's not particularly sick.

Personality

Randolph used to be battle-thirsty but after countless battles, he's fed up. Now, he enjoys cooking (despite not being good at it) and walks around yawning without a care, even in time of turmoil. Generally a pacifist but Randolph does not mind killing anyone he's ordered to or in self-defense.

He is very loyal to
Pax Shirone
 and
Benedict Kingdragon
 because they were the only ones who enjoyed his cooking and understood him.

Background

After retiring he returned to his home country and started working as a chef and restaurant owner but soon the restaurant became bankrupt, leaving him with a huge debt. He then started working in Dragon King Kingdom as a Knight to pay off the debt.

Power and Abilities

Sword of Bewitching
 (
幻惑剣
,

Genwaku-ken
)
: It is a style of swordsmanship that tricks the opponent and creates opening in combat. It consists of two different sets of techniques known as the
Sword of Luring
 (
誘剣
,

Yū-ken
)
, a technique that entices an enemy into attacking when they should be defending, and the
Sword of Hesitation
 (
迷剣
,

Mei-ken
)
, a technique that entices an enemy into defending or retreating when they should be attacking.

North God Style
: Trained in the North God Style to at least Emperor rank. Was skilled enough to be a candidate for the North God rank.

Absolute Void Eyes
: This
Demon Eye
 let him create an impenetrable barrier around a location with minor loopholes.

Master of Stealth
: Randolph is capable of appearing behind a person without a sound or whatsoever with a saying "God of Death is always behind you".

Psychological warfare
: Randolph makes up for his lack of overwhelming power by making suggestions mid-battle, causing distress to his enemies and allowing him to turn the tables.

Equipment

Gauntlets created by and purchased from
Tallhand
, with the Mana Absorbing Stone planted inside. This allows Randolph to overwhelm magic users, though has limited use, as the Mana Absorbing Stones consume as much Mana as they cancel out, making them less effective against a magician with large amount of mana like Rudeus.

Achievements

Defeated his predecessor, the Death God
Laxus
.

Ranked #5 of the
Seven Great Powers
.

Overwhelmed
Rudeus Greyrat
,
Roxy Migurdia
 and
Zanoba Shirone
.

Quotes

Note: This section is under construction and revision
.

Trivia

Dead End
 were the last clients of his restaurant.

Badigadi
 told him about
Hitogami
, not to trust nor make enemy out of him, a long time ago.

In light of things,
Hitogami
 might have instructed
Gisu
 to sell Randolph the magic gauntlet in hope the Death God would take down
Rudeus
.

Despite being part immortal, Randolph has not shown to have omnipotent regeneration nor tremendous magical energy like his elders, probably due to him only having 1/8th of Atofe’s blood.

In the side story "Jobless Oblige", Sieghart succeeded Randolph as the next Death God, implying that he either defeated Randolph or accepted his offer to succeed his position somehow.

His grandmother was also called Death God Knight and her connection to
Laxus
 is unknown.

Pax Shirone

Randolph liked Pax Shirone as a person, though he acknowledged Pax's shortcomings as a ruler.

After initially meeting Pax, they periodically dined together, Randolph offering Pax advice on swordsmanship and magic.

This unlikely friendship developed because Pax and his wife, Benedict, were the only people who genuinely complimented Randolph's cooking.

Pax's appreciation for Randolph's unique culinary talents, despite his fear of being poisoned, genuinely touched Randolph.

Randolph recognized that Pax was unloved by his people and had few allies, but he still respected Pax's determination to rule well and secure a future for Shirone.

He understood Pax's frustration with his subjects' rejection and his feelings of inadequacy as a king.

When Pax decided to commit suicide, Randolph was saddened but ultimately respected his decision, recognizing Pax's desire to die with dignity as a king.

He dutifully carried out Pax's final orders to protect Benedict and educate their unborn child, imparting his own skills and offering the child the praise that Pax never received.

Benedict Kingdragon

Randolph is fiercely loyal to Benedict and committed to protecting her. Pax entrusted Benedict's care to Randolph as a dying wish, and Randolph promised to fulfill that request, even at the cost of his own life. He safely escorted her out of Shirone Castle during the rebellion and planned to return her to the King Dragon Realm. He vowed to protect her until she gave birth and then raise her child, teaching them swordsmanship, culinary skills, and academics.

He respects her as Pax's wife and the future mother of his child. Although Benedict is described as quiet and inexpressive, even being considered a "half-wit" by some, Randolph treats her with respect and deference. He addresses her as "Her Majesty" and is mindful of her presence, refusing to discuss certain topics when she is around.

He seems to view her as a simple and somewhat naive person. He notes that she was likely mimicking others when she ate properly, having never received formal instruction on etiquette. He also comments that she will likely need his help in raising her child, as she probably won't be capable of giving them enough praise.

Hitogami

Randolph Marianne had never met Hitogami and had only learned of him through stories about a relative who had interacted with the Hitogami. While Randolph does not offer a direct opinion on Hitogami, his statements about his relative's relationship with Hitogami suggest that he views the Hitogami as a dangerous and manipulative being.

Randolph states that his relative, who he later identifies as the Demon King Badigadi, had "borrowed" Hitogami's power to defeat a powerful foe to protect his fiancée. This choice of words suggests that Randolph believes Hitogami did not give his power freely but rather exacted a price for his aid.

Randolph also notes that his relative had "a rough time of it" because of his association with Hitogami. This further suggests that he believes Hitogami's involvement in people's lives often leads to negative consequences.

He warns Rudeus to avoid interacting with Hitogami, saying that "it won’t end well for you either way". This suggests that Randolph believes Hitogami is a manipulative and dangerous being who uses people to achieve his own goals, regardless of their intentions.

Appearance

Volume 5 - Juvenile Period - Reunion Chapter

Randolph Marianne ran a struggling restaurant that served Nanahoshi-style dragon meat. Due to Rudeus' harsh criticism, he decided to shutter the family kitchen business and accepted the recruitment of Shagall Garantis, a general of the King Dragon Realm.

Youth Period

Randolph was originally a Dragon King Kingdom's knight, but was ordered to escort
Pax
 in his coup d’état, where he easily overpowered the nation's imperial knights. He served as Pax's personal bodyguard since then. He was present during
Zanoba's
 return but had no interest in it.

When Zanoba and
Rudeus
 came back from the front line, he had a fight with them due to being mistaken for an apostle of
Hitogami
, which ended in a draw. It's revealed, however, that he only attempted to help Pax out of personal interest, for he and his queen were the only two people to praise his cooking. He was absolutely fine with letting his assailants go.

After Pax's suicide, Randolph carried Queen
Benedict
 out of the siege, resolving to teach
Pax's son
 skill in the swords and in cutlery.

Young Man Period

Rudeus would seek Randolph's help in the final battle but having to protect Pax's son, he can't leave. However, he tells Rudeus that if he can protect Pax Jr. from being targeted by the Shirone Kingdom Royalty he would would help in other ways, as to take down Hitogami and avenge Pax. He also gives Rudeus 『The Bone Ring of Laxus』in case he needs to ask
Kishirika
 a favor.

Synopsis

After receiving a letter of invitation and Hitogami's advice, Rudeus decided to enter Ranoa Magic Academy accompanied by Elinalise where unique students called "
Special Students
" gather. When he arrives at the university, he faces a mock battle with one of the current students as an exam. His opponent is one of the Special Students named Fitts, who is a chantless magic user like Rudeus.

Plot

Rudeus
 arrives at the university, where his ability to silent cast is tested in a mock duel against another silent caster, Fitz, who Rudeus does not realize is
Sylphie
 in disguise. Rudeus easily defeats Fitz and is accepted as a student along with
Elinalise
.

After attending a speech by
Ariel
, who is the student council president, Rudeus attends his homeroom class. There, he reunites with
Zanoba,
 as well as meets his fellow classmates like Gyes' daughter
Linia Dedoldia
, beastgirl
Pursena
, and self-proclaimed magical genius
Cliff Grimoire
, who tells him he knows Rudues because of
Eris
, but hasn't seen her for a long time. He also learns Fitz is part of his class, but rarely attends.

After a brief encounter with Fitz, Rudeus meets
Luke
, who reveals he is also a Greyrat and Rudeus' cousin. Luke proceeds to tell him he's forgetful, indirectly mentioning that for not realizing Fitz's true identity as Sylphie, but Rudeus is oblivious to what he means by that.

Later, while Rudeus is on his way back to his dorm, Fitz accidentally drops Ariel's panties from a window, which Rudeus catches. The female students then confront Rudeus, accusing him of being a panty thief, and the dorm teacher attempts to punish him, but Fitz arrives to defend Rudeus, forcing the teacher and the mob to stand down by threatening them with violence and injury. She begrudgingly lets Rudeus go with a warning. Fitz apologizes for getting Rudeus into trouble, but Rudeus thanks Fitz for helping him, and Fitz decides to tease Rudeus by not telling him her true identity.

Rapan
=====

This article is about the City in Begaritt Continent. For the Chapter 100 Manga, see
Labyrinth City Rapan
.

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

"This city, wrapped in a whirlwind of chaos, is currently one of the largest and most prominent of the Begaritt Continent"

-Adventurer and Wandering the World Author
Bloody Kant





The Labyrinth City of Rapan in the Anime
Opening Theme 8



The Labyrinth City of Rapan
, also known as
Lapan
 is a city known for its numerous Labyrinth located at
Begaritt Continent
.

Geography

Rudeus and Elinalise arriving at Rapan in the Anime
The Labyrinth City of Rapan in the Manga
1/2

Rapan is a large earth-colored city sat in the midst of a vast desert, trapped in an enormous white cage that are actually made from bones of a
Behemoth
 where 12 of these bone pillars are enough to encase the entire city and has several oasis that makes the city unexpectedly verdant with life.

Background

When
Kalman II
 and his companions visited Begaritt, they battled a behemoth that was rampaging through the desert. After defeating it, they feasted on some of its meat and left the remains to rot and eventually become the bone pillars where Rapan is built that refuse to decay and a standing testament to the passage of time.

Ants and other
Monsters
 also feasted on the remains of the behemoth's flesh where if monsters devour other stronger monsters, they give birth to more powerful monsters. These mutant ants dug countless nests and the nests all mutated into labyrinths and the
Teleportation Labyrinth
 is among them.

As such, labyrinths make Rapan an alluring destination for countless
Adventurers
 from all over the
Human World
, looking to get rich quick that makes the city a stage where both happy endings and tragedies are acted out since then.

Economy

Various Rapan wares in the Anime
Various stalls in the sidewalks of Rapan
A merchant in typical bearded look and outfit of turban, flowing clothes
1/3

Rapan's economy is heavily dependent on Adventurers and the Merchants that buy or sell mainly
Magic Tools and Magic Items
 that are acquired from the labyrinths where they churn out in droves. Due to adventurers coming from all walks of
Races
 of the
Human World
, there is no standard currency used in Rapan and trading Magic Crystals is the most prominent means of trade where as long as your Magic Crystal stock is of certain quality, it is almost guaranteed it will sell at a high price that makes Rapan a land where merchants' dream come true.

Due to Rapan's remote location, the required knowledge of how to traverse and survive the desert and at least 6 months of travelling time come and go here, only a select few merchants make a habit of selling their merchandise to the
Central Continent
 for a more profitable and safer trade.

Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on December 12, 2021.

Synopsis

Rudeus and his friends have finally returned to the Fittoa territory. However, the village of Buena, his hometown, has become a wasteland, and the town of Roa, where the Boreas family used to live, has become a refugee camp for people caught up in the teleport incident. After reuniting with the butler Alphonse and Ghislaine, and learning about the current situation in the Fittoa territory and the Boreas family, Eris visit Rudeus after thinking alone.

Plot

Rudeus dreams of everyone he knows in a happy gathering. Then the dream turns nightmarish and he gets stabbed in his old form, in his old room. He wakes up with Eris beside him. Ruijerd asks him about "Human God" and Dragon God.

Rudeus reveals the nature of the "Human-God" to Ruijerd, and the fact that the Superd curse on him is gradually fading away.

The next day, Rudeus practices
Disturb Magic
 while traveling - in case he meets
Orsted
 again. Eris looks dejected after hearing this.

The party reaches the ruins of Rudeus' hometown, where he has flashbacks to his early life there. Ruijerd then announces that since Rudeus and Eris are strong enough that they do not require his protection anymore, he will take his leave. Ruijerd thanks Rudeus for helping him grow. They bid each other farewell.

Rudeus and Eris continues on to
Roa
, which is also in ruins. There, Eris reunites with
Ghislaine
 and her servant [Minor Characters#Alphonse|Alphonse]]. However, Alphonse reveals that Eris' parents were both killed as a result of the teleportation incident while her
grandfather
 was executed by the king. Alphonse also explains that another branch of the Greyrat family has offered to allow Eris to be married to
Pilemon Notos Greyrat
 as a concubine. Ghislaine has a heated argument with Alphonse. Eris asks them to leave her alone.

Rudeus noted his
mother
 is still missing and later finds confirmation that
Sylphiette
 was not found dead, but her location remains unknown to him.

That night, Eris enters Rudeus' tent and tells him she turned fifteen a few days ago. Rudeus don't want to take advantage of her current state, but she initiates sex with him.

The next morning, however, Rudeus wakes up to find that Eris had left with Ghislaine to an unknown location, which leaves him distraught and confused.

Reida Reia
==========

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Information

Story

Relationships

And yet, none of them had even tried to succeed Reida as the Water God. Calling themselves unworthy of the title, they'd left it in Reida's hands and content themselves with the rank of Water Emperor.

Reida Reia
 (
レイダ
・
リィア
)
, also known as
Reida Lia
 in the English Light Novel is the grandmother and master of
Isolde Cluel
 and
Water God
, one of the "strongest swordsman of the generation."

Appearance

Reida is an old woman with white hair and blue eyes who looked to be in her early sixties. Her looks are also stated to resemble Isolde's. She usually had a grumpy expression on her face and was normally the picture of a gentle, harmless old lady when casual. She also wore her sword at her hip.

In her early 50s, Reida had black neck-length hair that frames her with a single ahoge. She wore a uniform that gave a window view of her huge cleavage.

Personality

In her later years, Reida is a kind old woman with a fond disposition for children she knows, such as Nina. Even so, she can be sharp and scornful of others, such as when she rebuked Auber for failing in his duty and leaving her to clean up his mess. She seems to enjoy looking back to the past, with an air of nostalgia around her words and eyes whenever she spoke about the past. She also held a degree of pride in her title and used it to affirm the importance of her own position.

Reida was an attentive person who paid attention to her granddaughter Isolde's growth, whose confidence had grown excessive at one point, and decided that she stay in the Sword Sanctum to train further.

She stood calm and firm in her final moments against Orsted, sighing at the fact that she would have to fight such a powerful opponent before her death.

Background

Reida's real name is not revealed since it is the tradition of the
Water God Style
 since its establishment that those who become the Water God will change their name to Reida Reia for females.

In her early age, she had beaten up a noble, and in retribution she was knocked down by a crowd of nobles and about to get both hands cut off.
Darius Silva Ganius
 intervened and saved her. When she became Water King and got picked to be the royal sword instructor, she went to look for Darius to express her gratitude but by that point, he had already turned into a horrible human being. Later on, she had at least one son, whose children would later on become Water God style swordsmen themselves.

Reida also met
Paul Greyrat
 during her visit with her acquaintance
Augusta
's dojo and acknowledges Paul's talent in the sword but that he lacks desire in strength.

Legacy

In her final talk, Reida implied that Isolde will be her successor.

After Reida's death, Orsted immediately left the venue without naming himself and Isolde did not pursue him.

The nobles on the venue believes that Orsted is a subordinate of
Perugius Dola
 because of their similar hair color and eyes and gains faith on
Ariel Anemoi Asura
 becoming queen, who has the backing of the Armored Dragon King with a subordinate who can defeat the Water God with one blow.

Despite Reida claiming to be the sole perpetrator on the assassination attempt on Ariel, many nobles sympathized with her and Ariel did not want the Water God Style to become her enemy.

Power and Abilities

Reida Lia is a powerful swordsman who, by the time of current events, is an old woman past her peak physical years. Nevertheless, she still ranked as one of the strongest swordsman of the current generation. She had been a true prodigy in her youth, and her natural gifts were comparable to those of any Water God who'd gone before her.
 Even at an old age, a swordsman of particular skill could have seen that her relaxed bearing was only a facade and realize that their fastest attacks would fail to touch her.

She was shrewd enough to deduce that Gal Fallion wanted her to train Eris Greyrat in order to defeat another immensely powerful Water God style user, Orsted (though she initially assumed it was herself). She also immediately knew the three-way deadlock between Isolde, Nina, and Eris before they properly fought one another.

She is powerful enough that even in a direct confrontation between her and Armored (Mk. I) Rudeus, she would still have the advantage.
 She can also counter all of Armored Rudeus' magic from a distance; it would be impossible for even a powerful mage like him to kill her from a distance due to her
Battle Aura
.

『Water God Style』






Deprivation Sword Kingdom depicted in the Light Novel


As a former Water god, she was able to learn three of the five secret arts of the Water God Style, which is the bare minimum to be worthy of the title of Water God. She mastered the two
most difficult
 of the five secret arts, which led to the creation of a sixth technique that made others worthy of the title, content themselves with rank of Water Emperor, and left the title in Reida's hands for as long as she lived.

Blade of Deprivation/Deprivation Field
 - A Water God Style new/sixth technique, Reida combined the two most difficult secret arts of the Water God Style and managed to create this phantom art. The technique allows Reida to cut from any direction, be it up, down, left, right around her and even the slightest movement is instantly countered with a fatal blow. The move has quite a large range being able to hit anything within a room hosting a party for a large gathering of the most prominent Asura nobles. This secret art is so deadly that Orsted's only advice against it was "
to not let it happen
."

Quotes

Reida:
"Goodness... Orsted? The Dragon God? That's quite a grandiose attitude you're taking. Do you think she can do it?"

Gal:
"I think she can.
Eris
 does too."

Reida:
"I see That's fine then. Self-confidence is more important than anything."

Reida:
"Long time no see. Did you come to take this old lady to the afterlife?"

Orsted:
"Yes. You’re a disciple of the Man-God."

Reida:
“Disciple, huh… so you let me go the previous time because I wasn’t one then? My my, I'm gonna have to fight such an incredible opponent in my final moments..."

Trivia

She encountered Orsted once before the meeting that led to her death, but was allowed to live because was not a disciple of the
Man-God
 at that time.

Orsted has fought her multiple times in his previous loops, and thus is completely aware of her fighting style.

The name Reida is the feminine version of Reidar, a legendary swordsman of the Water God Style, and each new head of this style will inherit this name. It is tradition for Water Gods to change their name to Reida Lia for female or Reida Liadar for males.

Fujii Yukiyo is her voice actor for her younger version in the Mushoku Tensei Mobile game.

Relationships

Isolde Cluel

Isolde Cluel is Reida's granddaughter and student in the Water God Style. Though she is strict with Isolde, Reida also holds Isolde in high regard as the next carrier of the Water God Style. Isolde calls her 'Master' and mutually holds her grandmother with sincere respect.

Reida brought Isolde to the
Holy Land of Swords
 after being invited by Gal Fallion to train his students. During the battle for
Asura Kingdom
, Reida wishes for Isolde to cut her down after her assassination job is complete, and excludes her from involvement in the attempt to kill Ariel and the others. Isolde lamented her death over the next few days but did not begrudge Ariel nor Rudeus and co. for it.

Auber Corvette

You think you're gonna hurt the North God Style's reputation or something? Too damn bad. I'm cleaning up your mess here, boy! Hurry up and grow a pair!

Reida and Auber are acquaintances. Reida does not view Auber positively after his repeated failure to eliminate Ariel Anemoi Asura and Rudeus Greyrat. She condescendingly calls him a coward and his ambushes half-assed, and is visibly annoyed at having to clean up his mess.

Darius Silva Ganius

The girl’s first love ended then and there… but I wouldn’t say it turned to hate, exactly. Her gratitude and disgust cancelled each other out.

Reida's first love. When Reida was young, she was saved by Darius from some nobles who wanted to cut her arms off. She meets him again years after she becoming a Water King and instructor, but by then he became a horrible human being and forgot all about her. Her gratitude and disgust cancelled each out, but she nevertheless still fell a debt towards him which the
Man-God
 takes advantage of.

Orsted

Reida has fought Orsted in the past, who left her alive for the simple fact that she was not a disciple of the Man-God at the time.

Volume 13

Reida arrives to the Sword Sanctum with her pupil and granddaughter, Isolde Cluel, at the Sword God
Gal Fallion
's request letter to teach one of his students. Reida would normally tear such a letter but it piqued her interest since it was from Gal, who hates relying on others. She brings Isolde along because of how her student has grown conceited and is saddened that her skills have not grown at all. She is hoping that Isolde will be motivated to improve herself after fighting the Sword God's disciples.

Upon seeing
Nina Fallion
, she is nostalgically reminded of the past when Nina was a kid, but Nina doesn't remember her. However, Nina realizes immediately from presence alone that Reida is an extremely powerful swordsman. Reida tries to recruit Nina to Water God Style because of her humble and cool composure, to no avail.

Reida anticipated the deadlock formed between Sword Saint
Eris Greyrat
, Isolde, and Nina. She orders Isolde to stay at the Sword Sanctum to train with them for some time.

Volume 17





Reida using Blade of Deprivation as Orsted closes in on her.



Ariel Anemoi Asura
 reveals to the nobles of the
Asura Kingdom
 that she has the support of the Armored Dragon King
Perugius Dola
. After Ariel reveals Darius' crimes and is about to be arrested, Reida comes crashing down from the ceiling and unleashes her signature move, Blade of Deprivation. She instantaneously cuts in half two of Perugius' servants,
Almanfi
 and
Trophymus
, as they react to attack her, and nearly cuts
Rudeus Greyrat
's hand off for simply channeling mana into his ring to contact
Orsted
 (his magically-enhanced gauntlet broke while protecting him). Due to the auto-counter nature of her technique, this causes everyone near her to be incapable of moving a muscle (including Rudeus, Eris,
Ghyslaine
, Perugius, and his servants) and thus forcing them to a standstill.

After harshly berating North Emperor
Auber Corvette
 for his own failure to complete his mission, she orders him to kill Ariel, Perugius, and Rudeus while maintaining her technique. As everyone remains still, she creates a fake explanation for her actions: she was operating under pay from the King Dragon Realm and ordered to assassinate Asuran nobles. A horrified Isolde arrives to the scene, but Reida stops her in her tracks as well, adding in that a "novice knight" is to cut her down after the assassination job is finished. After sensing that Orsted is coming, she orders Auber to take Darius and escape but Ariel questions why. She then goes into monologue about how the
Man-God
 came to her in a dream and convinced her to repay her debt to Darius from long ago.

When Orsted arrives, Reida asks Orsted if he has come to kill her, and he replies in the affirmative. Orsted starts to move into her effective range, and she starts to counterattack. Her slashes grow much more powerful and faster but Orsted blocks all of her attacks using his bare hands and kills her with one blow to the heart.

Despite Reida claiming to be the sole perpetrator on the assassination attempt on Ariel, many nobles sympathized with her and Ariel did not want the Water God Style to become her enemy. Thus, the Water God Style training halls remained and Isolde's name was cleared too.

Orsted
 (a character in Mushoku Tensei) to keep his curse at bay.

Career

Magonote first started uploading his work on the user-generated novel publishing site,
Shosetsuka ni Naro
 in November of 2012. His first upload was the web novel "Mushoku Tensei".
The series quickly gained the support of readers, hitting number one on the site’s combined popularity ranking within 1 year of publication.

He was inspired by works uploaded on Syosetsu. He loves fighting games and cream puffs

His favourite ramen is Chashu (braised pork-belly ramen)

Rifujin na Magonote's furigana is written as "Magonote Sodo (Sword)" (マゴノテ ソード)

Rikarisu City
=============

This article
lacks information
 and requires expansion. Please
expand this page
 to include missing information to help improve the article.





City of Rikarisu



The
City of Rikarisu
 (リカリスの町 -
Rikarisu no Machi
) is one of the three largest settlements on the
Demon Continent
, located in the Biegoya Region. Rikarisu sits in the middle of an enormous crater, the rim of which forms a single continuous wall around the city currently serves to protect the city against marauding
monsters
.

At the time of the
Great Human-Demon War
, it served as a home base for the forces of the Demon Empress
Kishirika Kishirisu
. Even now, it is sometimes referred to as Old Kishirisu Castle.

Description

There are only three entrances to the city, all of which are cracks in the rim of the crater. The walls of the crater are tall enough that one would not be able to make their way over them unless they could fly. Near the entrance to the town were the merchant related inns, related stables, and stores which are all connected.

The buildings are not as tall as the ones built in human settlements in the
Central Continent
 but there are just as many of them. The buildings are not built with architectural taste but rather as passable facility for living in, as a result a majority of the houses look homespun and similar. Most of the facilities near the entrance were stables and inns that clearly catered to traveling merchants and adventurers similar to the
Citadel of Roa
.

At the very heart of the city stand the ruins of Castle Kishirisu, half-destroyed during the events of
Laplace War
. Imposingly thick outer walls surround the broken black-and-gold castle itself, a sight that offer visitors a constant reminder of the Empress's faded glory and demonkind's violent, painful past.

Chronology

Story events regarding the City of Rikarisu.

Entry-Level Adventurers arc

Rudeus, Eris and Rujierd arrive at the city, and after declaring themselves as the adventurers party

Atoferatofe
 who now resides on the kirishu castle all of them with the objective of also finding Kirishika, upon finding Kirishika they are taken by the guards to Kirishu castle where they meet Atofe and

The sea is populated by the

Notable Places

Devil's Cave
: A labyrinth that sits in the middle of the Ringus Sea. It is brutally difficult to even reach this labyrinth and due to its location, it is impossible to resupply once arrived. Given its depth and the fact that slow-paced exploration is almost impossible, it has earned the reputation as one of the toughest tests an adventurer can face.

Trivia

There are many pirates who rule these waters between the continents.

Plot

WIP

Rudeus engages in a talk with the "Human God"
He asks for the location of
Zenith
,
Lilia
, and
Aisha
.
He also asks for the location of
Sylphy
,
Ghislaine
,
Philip
, and
Sauros
.
"Human God" asks for Rudeus to trust him if his information turns out useful.
Rudeus says he'll consider it.
"Human God" shows a scene of Aisha Greyrat, but Rudeus must not reveal his real name.
"Human God's" next advice is to write a letter to someone Rudeus know in the palace of Shirone Kingdom. If he does so, he can rescue Lilia and Aisha from the palace.

Rudeus exits the dream world and finds himself seasick onboard a ship. Rudeus wonders at "Human God's" motive in getting him a
demon eye
.

<<
Dead End
>> disembarks onto the
Central Continent
. They travel by river. Eris tries to interest Rudeus in an
onigri
 - rice being a new food item to her. She seems puzzled at why Rudeus is not showing the same level of excitement.

The team enters the capital of Shirone Kingdom. Eris is visibly excited. Eris asks about Rudeus' master but he still seem distracted. Rudeus reveals that he learned that part of his family is held captive in the kingdom. Eris learns that he has a second sister that she was not aware of (She met
Norn
 in
Millishion
). Eris and Ruijerd agree to help.

Rudeus writes a letter to his master
Roxy
, and entrusts it to a employee of the inn. A young girl is partially shown to be gripping a letter hard as Rudeus walks away.

Rudeus wanders the market. He senses that he was being followed. A partially view of a female was shown to be running after him. He leads her into an alley. Armed men are also shown to be following the same direction. Rudeus runs around a corner and raised stone magically to seal the path behind him. There are sounds of a struggle, so he dispelled the stone wall, and sees a young girl in a tussle with two armed men - one of them holding a letter in his hands. They declare themselves soldiers from the palace. The young girl protested that they stole her letter. Rudeus sinks the two guards in
Quagmire
. The guards summon for help and Rudeus escapes with the girl with his magic.

Rudeus is aware that the young girl is his six year old Sister Aisha. He introduces himself as "Shadow Moon Knight". Aisha asks for his help in sending a letter to her father to let him know that her mother is being held in the palace. Rudeus makes vague suggestions on who can help her: a description of Roxy; a possible brother. Aisha says she has a un-dependable brother, which stings him. Her brother is a pervert. He reveals his alias to her - "Pet Owner of <<Dead End>>". He pledges to rescue her mother.

Rudeus asks his team to help with keeping his real name secret. Eris and Ruijerd end the talk by immediately embarking on an attack on the palace. Rudeus reins them back in lieu of Roxy's reply.

Morning came and someone called out to Rudeus. He quickly covers the sleeping forms of Aisha and Eris with a blanket, and answers the call. The  lady identifies herself as Ginger York, affiliated to the Guards of the
Seventh Prince
. She asks that he follows her to the palace. Supposedly Roxy wants to see him.

Roxy Migurdia

Summary

On a ship bound for the Demon Continent, Roxy gets seasick and is returned to her cabin by a crewman, where she dreams a memory. Leaving Shirone after the massive light in the sky, Roxy was immediately worried for Rudy and traveled East only to find paved flatlands where once stood villages. In despair over losing the Greyrat family, her extended family, she is advised by the coachman to head to the refugee center to learn more. There, she encounters a suicidal man and another Fittoan who returned after a long trek back, the latter sharing how the event was deemed to be a rare magical calamity that teleported everyone caught in the light around the world, many of which died where they landed.

Directed into the makeshift town to the temporary Adventurer's Guild, Roxy finds Rudeus, Zenith, Lilia and Aisha on the list of the Missing persons but not confirmed deceased. Remembering about Norn from Rudeus's letters, Roxy finds Paul's flyer addressed to Rudeus explaining that Norn was in his care while the other three were still missing, and that all information about them was to be forwarded to the Adventurer's Guild in Millis, leaving Rudeus alone knowing he can fend for himself. With the latter half of the message addressed to anyone reading to help find his family, Roxy's reads mention of the "Fangs of the Black Wolf" and realizes Paul was on the legendary S-Rank team. Once Roxy voices how she believes in searching the Demon or Begarid continents, she finds she reached the same conclusion as two other adventurers: Elinalise Dragonroad and Talhand.

Deducing Roxy in a Migurdian adventurer, they introduce themselves and since they were each planning to search the Demon continent, Roxy joins them due to her originating from there. Once their party is formed, they set sail, and Roxy is nudged awake by Elinalise once they reach port. Making landfall, Roxy ponders how Rudeus could be doing, knowing that he was a prodigy and he is most assuredly alive given his talent, thus Roxy swears to find Rudeus being that she is his master.

Roxy M. Greyrat
, born
Roxy Migurdia
 (
ロキシー
・
ミグルディア
)
, is one of the deuteragonists in the
Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation
 series. She is a talented
Migurd
 mage, and a former
magic
 tutor. Because she can't use telepathy, she leaves her village due to feeling isolated from her peers. Unable to make a stable living as an adventurer, she becomes a travelling tutor and eventually becomes
Rudeus
' teacher. In the aftermath of the
Teleport Incident
, Roxy helps
Paul
 to search the world for survivors.

Appearance

Roxy is shown as a short statured adult woman in her physical teenage appearance between 15 or 16 years old. Her complexion is like sand but paler, and has long blue hair tied in 2 braids that reach below her waist. Her eyes match the color of her hair. Her hair color sometimes appears green in sunlight, which makes people distrustful or even afraid of her because of the similarity between her and the
Superd Tribe's
 green hair. She wears a long-sleeve white and gray button-down shirt with black edges, matching her short black skirt that shows off her beautiful, well-worked legs. On top of this stood out a large light brown layer, with the edges sinking into white and being outlined by black. A black hat rests on her head. In the center, a gold line rounded the circumference of the garment while 2 other wider white lines were painted on both sides.

The tip of her hat wilts lazily downwards while the flap stood erect in the air. Easily the most telling was the staff she carried around her, the blue gem at the tip of it glistening almost unnaturally in the sun.

As a
Migurd
, she has a rather child-like body, which causes several people to mistake her as a teenager rather than a normal sized adult.

Personality

Roxy is a calm and collected person with a wise outlook on life, yet always seeking to improve herself. She is very intelligent, able to piece together information and make rational deductions.

She was a rather headstrong person in the past, running from her tribe to roam the world as an adventurer.  She also openly defied her
teacher
 in the
Ranoa Magic Academy
 after learning his greatest magic. However, various incidents that happened afterwards and the encounter with
Rudeus
 greatly humbled her.

She has a bit of a clumsy side, making her prone to mistakes during unexpected and tense situations. She also has a complex with her petite figure, often laments her figure as unattractive and tends to get annoyed when someone mistakes her as a child. After seeing the family life of Paul and his family, Roxy begins to hold an idealistic outlook in romance and dreams of having a fateful encounter with the love of her life in a labyrinth and to start a family and become a teacher.

Background

Roxy is born to
Rowin Migurdia
 and
Rokari Migurdia
 of the
Migurd Tribe
, part of the
Race
 in the
Demon Continent
. However, she was born without her race's special ability to communicate telepathically, so her parents taught her how to talk normally. Throughout her childhood, she would often always feel annoyed and isolated with her race's silent conversation and ran away from her village after being impressed by a
Magician
 who visited her village one day.

Roxy becomes an
Adventurer
 to get some money in order to leave the Demon Continent where she joins the party
Rikarisu Gang
 with
Dale
,
Nokopara
 and
Blaze
 but the party eventually disbanded after the death of Dale. She stayed with
Bloody Kant
 for a time until when Kant gives her a letter of recommendation for
Ranoa Magic Academy
 and later heads to
Sharia
 to become a student in the Academy. Upon reaching Advanced Rank Water Magic, Roxy became a student of
Jinas Halfas
 and became a Water Saint. After graduating, Roxy left the Academy without saying a word to her teacher and went to
Asura Kingdom
 to look for work but is unable to find one even when she gradually moves toward the border and is at a loss. Roxy eventually found a job request for a
Magic
 Tutor and she hired by
Paul
 and
Zenith
 to teach
Rudeus
 about magic for two years.

Achievements

These are the current achievements that Roxy gained through her adventure, action, and training:

Chant Shortening

Water King Class Magician

Able to create Fire Saint Class scrolls

Teacher at the Ranoa Magic Academy

Shirone Kingdom Court Magician (Formerly)

Quotes

Roxy:
 "I, it was love at first sight."
Rudeus:
 "With whom?"
Roxy:
 "Eh?"
Rudeus:
 "It couldn't be dad?"
Roxy:
 "No, it's Rudy, when Rudy came into the Labyrinth to save me."

"Well. I thought after meeting Rudy, marrying Rudy, now having Rudy's child, how I'm the happiest girl in the world. But, because of that... if you die, then I will become the most unfortunate girl. Well, this is a little embarrassing to say, but... Please let me be happy."

Trivia

The hat Roxy wore as an adventurer was gifted by
Bloody Kant
, the author of "
Wandering The World
" and the one who taught her magic initially. It was replaced by a gift from
Rudeus
 and
Sylphy
, and finally gifted to
Lara
 when she left the household.

Roxy is the first Goddess that Rudeus worships in his exclusive religion, being the Goddess of Wisdom. Her holy panties are currently enshrined in the basement.

If Rudeus' previous life is taken into account, Roxy and Rudeus are of the same age.

Roxy does not like the taste of alcohol since she believes that it is dry until she visited
Kurasuma Town
 where there are sweet alcoholic drinks. Then, she would often be seen drinking in everyone at any chance.

Roxy likes sweets so much that she once sworn not to return to the
Demon Continent
 again, because the Demon Continent doesn't have any sweet food.

There are three things that Roxy had difficulty dealing with since childhood: green peppers, children, and
Superds
.

When she was a child, she was so scared of Superds that she would wet herself when she heard about them. The fear still lingers on when she becomes an adult.

A running gag in the
anime
 when Roxy is communicating with Rudeus via letters is
Pax Shirone
 grabs her chest and Roxy unfazed, retaliates with a Voiceless Fire Magic leaving Pax burnt but mostly unharmed.

In all previous loops where Rudeus doesn't exist, she became
Sylphy
's teacher and never married anyone.

Roxy's fantasy of meeting her fated lover in a labyrinth was fulfilled when Rudeus rescued her in the
Teleportation Labyrinth
.

According to Rudeus, in bed Roxy is the technical type, she looks to her teacher
Elinalise
 for advice and wisdom, Roxy offers alternatives to improve her performance(positions). She is always researching and improving.

Roxy’s Staff Information:
 It’s a unique and strong staff Roxy obtained thanks to her friends in the Ranoa Magic Academy.

The material of the wand is made from a rough and bony wood that comes from a tree called 『Elder Torrent』that grows in the large forest of the Eastern region of the Mills Continent.

Elder Treants are an advanced subspecies of the Lesser Treant, born from the nourishment of the fairy spring. They are capable of using water magic. Their arms could be used as material for high quality magical staves.

The tip of the staff is adorned with a magic stone in the shape of a small crystal that comes from a nameless slime monster in a labyrinth near the border of Ranoa.

Roxy’s staff increased her water magic almost twofold. While other magic element spells were marginally increased.

The opposed elements like fire are halved. Her staff was so incredible that her friends wrote research papers about the staff’s capabilities.

Roxy’s Staff Background:
 After entering the Ranoa University of Magic, Roxy realizes the limits of her mana capacity when attempted to cast Saint Rank Water Magic Spell Cumulonimbus and failed. Because she doesn’t have large enough mana pool.

So she commissions her classmate Louis who specializes in staff manufacturing to craft her a new staff. But the materials for the staff cost twenty gold coins and the magic stone itself cost fifty gold coins.

So she decided get magic stones by killing monsters in a labyrinth near the border of Ranoa. By applying for adventure quests.

She try get in a temporary adventurer party, but it is a double booking and they refused her for the voluptuous woman magician instead. Afterwards her Dedoldia tribe roommate Lene forced her to partner up in an underground fighting arena.

Roxy didn’t want to participate until Lene allowed her take all the prize money.

After they won the match, Roxy asked Lene’s help with killing monsters in a labyrinth and agreed to offer her strength so she can obtain a magic stone. Eventually after working together to kill a small slime monster inside the labyrinth.

Roxy was able to get the main magic stone that’s near its core. When she finally obtained the magic stone, Louis created Roxy’s new staff.

Rudeus Greyrat is Roxy's disciple and later her husband. Roxy first met Rudeus in
Buena Village
 to become his home tutor. On Rudeus' 5th birthday, she gave him a magic wand. She was also able to help Rudeus overcome his fear of going outside, which led Rudeus to respect Roxy and treasure her "holy relic" (panties). The anime goes a step further, where she mentions how Rudy spied on her bathing. Roxy didn't admonish him for it, suggesting she was flattered he found her attractive.

After the
Teleport Incident
, they almost cross paths, but they wouldn't see each other. Years later they finally reunite when Rudeus decides to go the
Teleportation Labyrinth
 where he saves Roxy which made her fall in love with him that is seen afterwards where Roxy would make various attempts to be close to him or would always look at Rudeus. After the battle against the
Manatite Hydra
 that resulted in his Paul's death while saving Rudeus, he falls into depression but Roxy consoles him by sleeping with him. After that, they would eventually marry and Roxy would become his second wife. She later gives birth to Lara Greyrat and Lily Greyrat.

In an alternate timeline, Roxy dies due to
Magic Stone Disease
 under the manipulation of
Hitogami
, which causes the
Rudeus
 of that timeline to fall into depression and bent on revenge which also causes the death of the rest of his family. Realizing that he cannot reach Hitogami in his lifetime, Rudeus travels back in time to warn his younger self on what will happen and gives his diary to him before passing away.

Lara Greyrat

Lara is the first daughter between Rudeus and Roxy. Lara's mischievous personality tends to worry Roxy and will always tell her to apologize or reminds her of manners. This worry remained for years and before Roxy noticed, Lara has grown up to which Roxy believes that Lara will eventually calm down just like she did at her age. Roxy is also aware that Lara and her future role in the battle against Hitogami and would worry what will happen to her afterwards but later thought that worrying about it is pointless
 so Roxy would set her up in matchmaking sessions or even introduce jobs to her but these had no effect on Lara. When Lara decides to suddenly go on a journey, Roxy is the most worried of Lara that she repeatedly glances at the window that Lara might return.

Lily Greyrat

The Second daughter between Rudeus and Roxy. She's an airhead and has no interest in anything other than Magic tools and Magic Items. She would later join Zanoba's company and inherit the
Magic Armor
 research from her father, in addition to the production of an All-Purpose Magic Armor. Lily also has topographical disorientation, making her prone to getting lost even when walking back home. She later moves out of her parents' home and into her own place, but still resides in Ranoa.

Rokari Migurdia

Her mother. Roxy thought her mother saw her as a burden but when she visited her parents after the mana disaster, Roxy viewed her as someone who truly cares. Her parents would explain how difficult it was for them to learn to speak vocally. Yet, they did it because they did not want Roxy to feel alone. They didn't want her to leave the tribe, but was not against it when Roxy decided to explore the world as they themselves know she could never truly feel like she belongs in the tribe. When Roxy returns home and Rokari brought up Rudeus as a potential partner, Roxy blushes and dismisses the idea. When Roxy and Rudeus brought Lara to visit her grandparents and discovers that she retains the tribe's telepathy ability, Roxy suggest to leave Lara with her grandparents so she can has a sense of belonging.

They didn't want her to leave the tribe, but was not against it when Roxy decided to explore the world as they themselves know she could never truly feel like she belongs in the tribe. Rowin is the reason for Roxy's fear of the Superd, as he would often scare her to do things (ex: don't leave the village or they will come eat you) with horrible tales of this demonic tribe eating children. It'd scare Roxy to the point of urination. Growing into adulthood, she still gets nervous while hearing the name Superd or facing Ruijerd. Rowin is shown to be very protective of his daughter; as upon their first meeting, Rudeus suggests Rowin to give Roxy's hand in marriage, the later flat-out refuses. When Roxy and Rudeus brought Lara to visit her grandparents and discovers that she retains the tribe's telepathy ability, Roxy suggest to leave Lara with her grandparents so she can has a sense of belonging.

 at
Millishion
. However Claire advises her to be careful should their be abnormalities that appear on their children indirectly referring to Lara. But when Lara finds the golden locket Claire lost, she admits that she was mistaken and and tells her Lara is just fine. This caused Roxy to think that she can get along with Claire even though she hasn't known her for long and may never meet again after her meeting

Future

It's no good to overestimate me. Victory is something that you grasp by always being modest, you know?

- Rudeus Greyrat

Rudeus Greyrat
 (
ルーデウス・グレイラット
,

Rūdeusu Gureiratto
)
 is the main protagonist of
Mushoku Tensei
. He was an overweight 34-year-old Japanese NEET who is reincarnated into another world after being hit by a truck whilst saving
some

kids
. Realizing he wasted away his previous life, he resolves to live this new one to its fullest and the series revolves around how he impacts his new world all whilst slowly growing out of his reclusive ways.

Appearance

Rudeus stands at around average height (175cm), has a muscular body despite being a magician, and his looks weren't that poor when his family members are asked. He was born with light brown hair and green eyes. However, he later has
Kishirika Kishirisu
 switch out both of his original eyes for
demon eyes
, causing them to be heterochromatic. Like his father,
Paul
, Rudeus also has a mole underneath his left eye and follows his ponytail hairstyle.

He is also always seen wearing gray robes but rarely covers his head during his time as an
adventurer
. At a young age, he is careless about the outfit he wears due to traveling the
Demon Continent
. He has worn the same gray robes when he entered
Ranoa Magic Academy
 which has many cuts and hems from his countless battles that makes him look like a delinquent. During his 20's, he begins to pay more attention to the clothes he wears that even
Perugius Dola
 mentions that he started to wear some decent clothes.

Following his second fight with
Orsted
 and later the final battle against
Hitogami's
 faction, Rudeus' hair temporarily lost its color from mana exhaustion. Fortunately, in both cases, the roots were unaffected, causing his hair to grow back to normal over time.

Personality

Because of his experience from his former life, Rudeus is careful not to get carried away and become arrogant. As a result, he is extremely self-aware and humble because he does not want to revert to his old self.
 After reincarnation he is more willing to be kind, helping his friends and protecting
his family
 whenever needed, where in the past he would have scoffed. Due to being considered a genius, who is capable in many fields at a young age, people have high expectations of him. Rudeus is also very polite to others, often making them uncomfortable especially to those who knows of his father's notorious reputation.

Having the morals of his past life, he hesitates with the thought of killing someone. He also has a calm personality who never lets go of his smile no matter how much abuse or violence he went through but he displays aggression and blood lust to anyone threatening his family. As a descendant of the Notos
Greyrat Family
 who likes pretty girls and big breasts, and also by influence from his previous secluded life, he is extremely perverted that he tends to touch his wives even in public, but he never makes a move on anyone other than his wives. He is also loyal to his friends that he always takes care of them to a great extent. As such, Rudeus is quite feared but is respected and loved by the people of
Sharia
 and to some extent even the most famous or powerful
beings
 of the Human World either fears or respect him.

Apart from carelessness in his outfit, Rudeus also loves cleanliness that he remodeled one of the rooms of his
house
 in Sharia to be a huge bathroom which is only made by the upper nobles of Human Kingdoms and he also bathes almost everyday.

Even with very high
magic
 capacity and high potential in battle, he often lacks the confidence to fight his enemy and his legs trembles when confronted in battle
 but manages to overcome this after surviving his
first battle
 against Orsted whose killing intent is significantly intense compared to what he encountered afterwards even when fighting against a
Red Dragon
.
 When facing a stronger opponent he knows he cannot defeat, he prefers to talk himself out of battles which also caused him to earn various titles related to this.

Rudeus also greatly values his family and friends that it affects him greatly when he is in bad terms with them like when he had a squabble with Paul
 and when Roxy forgotten him when they reunited at the
Teleportation Labyrinth
 that he threw up on both occasions.

Background

Rudeus was a 34-year-old NEET otaku in his previous life. As the fourth child of five children in a well-off family, he was praised as a bright student in elementary school considering his age. In junior high, he joined the computer club and and saved up his allowance to assemble his very own computer. However, he was so focused on tinkering his computer that he neglected his studies, causing him to fail the entrance exam of his preferred high school. As a result, the only school that would take him was a low-quality one, filled to the brim with delinquents.

Upon entering his new high school, he soon became a victim of severe bullying following an incident: he stood up to an upclassman who cut in front of him during lunch. However, this person then proceeded to beat him up, hang him up naked, nicknamed him "Pencil Dick", and took and distributed pictures of him in his state all whilst no one, not even the teachers, came to his aid. This event caused him to drop out of school and isolate himself at home, having developed a phobia toward the outside world as a whole. His family tried to encourage him to go back to school, but he brushed them off. There was at least one classmate whom he had a good relationship with who came by everyday to deliver homework. However, he pushed him away too when he also tried to get him to return to school. Now truly alone, he slipped futher into being a Hikikomori as time went on, taking an interest in some subjects on occassion only to quickly drop them once he saw that there was already someone better at it than him.

He continued being a shut-in, living off his family, for twenty years. However, this unhealthy lifestyle finally came to an end after both of his parents had passed away from old age and he refused to even attend their funeral. This ended up being the last straw for his siblings, prompting them to kick him out of the family home and disown him. Homeless and penniless, he wandered the streets aimlessly while reflecting on his life until he came across
three

high
-
schoolers
 arguing on a road. Seeing a truck heading toward them at high speed, he mustered all of his strength to run over and managed to push one of them away to safety. Unfortunately, this caused him to get hit instead, killing him. The next time he opened his eyes, he found himself reincarnated as the newborn Rudeus Greyrat in the
Human World
. Realizing he had been given a second chance, he declared he would live this new life to its fullest.

Quotes

Rudeus:
 "Hey, Eris."

Eris:
 "What?"

Rudeus:
 "Can I grope your tits?"

Rudeus:
 "Aisha... Norn... I'll help you anytime you need... If you are in trouble,, don't hesitate to rely on me... You might think I'm unreliable, but no matter what, I'll do everything in my power..."

Rudeus:
 "I think Pax is a jackass. But he should be able to change; I've changed. There isn't anyone who cannot change."

Rudeus:
 "Some people just prefer to see a more dramatic world. Fact is stranger than fiction. Reality is strange, helpless and disappointing."

Rudeus to Claire:
 "And what if she gets pregnant? Will you bear it? Will you consider bearing it? Even if she does give birth, what about Zenith's intention? What about my feelings? What do you think will become of the children that are left behind? What do you know about a person's mother! What do you know about your own daughter! Substantially, what's up with this function! Means of treatment? A machine to give birth? Don't joke around!"

Sylphy:
 "This time, Rudy won't be here for the birth?"

Rudeus:
 "No, I'll be here, in the house."

Sylphy:
 "But... Rudy..."

Rudeus:
 "I'll be here."

Rudeus:
 "I will protect Sieg even if the Sky Fortress falls."

Rudeus:
 'Eris, I want to go to bed with all four of us like this, is that fine?"

Achievements

These are the current achievements that Rudeus gained through his adventure, action, and training:

Capable of using unofficial God Class magic (Nuclear Explosion).

Water Emperor Class Magician.

Saint Class Magician in Fire, Earth, Wind,
Healing
, and
Detoxification Magic
.

Voiceless Incantation with attack magic

Conquerer of Legendary Labyrinth

Destroyed an Immortal Demon King

The most powerful mage in Ranoa University

The Dragon God's Subordinate.

Hero (by defeating
Atofe
).

7th rank of
Seven Great Powers
 (Quagmire) by defeating
Kalman III
.

Trivia

Rudeus' name before reincarnation remains unknown. Even when mentioned by
Future Rudeus
, it is muted out.

Rudeus can speak multiple languages (Magic God Language, Beast God Language, Fighting God, Human Language) by the time he was 9. Which he learned when he tutored
Eris
. He wanted to learn Heaven God and Sea God languages but could not find any learning material. He managed to find a book from the sea race in volume 7.

Rudeus and his three wives have a strand of cowlick (ahoge) on top of their heads.

He named his right and left leg Tindalos and Baskerville. He also named his right arm Hulk and his left arm Hercules.

Currently, Rudeus is both founder and sole member of the religion he created which has 3 Goddesses.

Rudeus founded a fan club for his sister (
Norn
), he was eventually kicked out three days later due to him taking a bath together with her.

All of Rudeus' wives ""seem"" to get pregnant right before he goes on a journey to somewhere.

He has a tendency to always overestimate his opponent.

Incidentally, although he is Emperor Ranked in Water Magic, he has mostly used Earth Magic in combat.

After the incident where
Hitogami
 attempted to have
Roxy
 killed with an infected rat, rats are deemed top priority enemies in Rudeus' household. They must be killed on sight, corpse incinerated while wearing gloves and face masks, and have their ashes disposed outside of the city
.

Rudeus was given the title "Hero" for defeating Demon Kings.

Initially he refused to call himself a hero when
Badigadi
 mentioned it, but accepted the title later on after defeating
Atofe
.

Even though Rudeus is unable to wear
Battle Aura
, he has attained a Saint-class combat ability of a swordsman with his 『Magic Armor Mk II B 』 and God-class power with 『Magic Armor Mk I 』(The latter one was stated by Atofe).

A
Miko from the future
 who had the ability to control time revived Rudeus into his current reincarnated body.

He does not feel fear towards
Orsted
, and strangely, neither do his children.

Rudeus was born with the "
Laplace Factor
". This means that his development as a fetus was influenced for him to become a potential vessel for the Demon God
Laplace
 to be reincarnated in, resulting in his abnormally large
mana
 capacity. This is also why it was this body that he was reincarnated in, as it did not have a soul of its own and would have otherwise been
stillborn
.

His hair also turned white due to mana strain but his hair has a little bit of color left so he was able to restore his hair color than losing it like Sylphy (from the battle of Orstred)

Rudeus likes to joke he "has two wives and a husband and children," referring to
Eris
 as his "husband." He also jokes that instead of Eris being a part of his harem, he is part of hers, including
Pursena
 and
Linia
 as her "other wives".

--To be revised--

Age 7: He realizes how his magic growth has become stagnant after learning that Roxy has become a <<Water King>> ranked magician from one of Roxy's letters. He decided that he needed to attend
Ranoa Magic Academy
, but Sylphiette overheard this and cried that she didn't want him to leave her, so he decided to bring her with him. He asked Paul if he would help pay for their tuition, but Paul declined, stating that the tuition for the both of them would be too much. Rudeus countered this by saying he would be willing to work to earn Sylphie's tuition, since his family couldn't afford to send the both of them. Paul agreed to this, and stated that he would try to find him a job.
Ghislaine
 then arrives by carriage and is greeted by his family, at which point Paul asks Rudeus how he would feel if he were told not to see Sylphiette anymore. Shortly after, a fight ensues between Rudeus and Paul over this, and Rudeus is knocked out. Rudeus then wakes up in a carriage and reads a letter from Paul, stating that he is to be sent to his
uncles
 home with Ghislaine to become a tutor for
Eris
, his cousin, and that he is prohibited from returning home or sending letters for 5 years.

Volume 2 - Juvenile Period - Home Teacher Chapter

When he was 7 years old, he started tutoring/taming <<Mad Dog>> Eris to make her know mathematics, science , language and magic. He succeeded and established a good relationship with her.

Sometime before Rudeus' 10th birthday, he was also shown to have learned 3 new languages.

Together with Ruijerd and Eris, they formed a party <<Dead End>>, as adventurers to improve both Ruijerd's reputation, and the Superd as a whole. They became well-known throughout the Demon Continent. Rudeus obtained the nickname <<The Owner of Dead End>> or <<Kennel Master>>. (Subtitle/Anime only)

Volume 4 - Juvenile Period - Voyage Chapter








Later, Rudeus met
Demon Empress Kishirika
 and attained the demon eyes of foresight, following Hitogami's advice. These eyes allowed him to see few seconds into the future, and he used them to defeat Eris in a sparring match.

While on the ship to the
Millis Kingdom
, Eris got extremely sea sick and he had to take care of her, all while resisting his urge to take advantage of Eris' weakened state sexually. Oppai Sennin, the image of a wise old hermit, often appears in his mind when he is tempted by breasts. He also took care of his 'business' and became a sage on the ship in order to prevent himself from attacking Eris.






Rudeus in all of his glory



Immediately after arriving from the sea voyage, he and Eris went to retrieve Ruijerd, but due to the child kidnappings by the smugglers, they could not let it go unpunished and had to rescue the beast children. After rescuing the beast children, Rudeus had to separate from the party so that he could rescue the Sacred Beast on a cat girl's request while Ruijerd escorted the children to safety. As a result of a misunderstanding, Rudeus was incapacitated by
Gyes
, and taken to the village where he was stripped naked and placed in prison.

After a few days in prison, where he was kept naked, Rudeus got a new cell mate
Geese
, and he greeted him in all of his full glory, and asked for Geese's fur vest since it was cold not wearing clothes. The fur vest turned out to have bugs, which he then disposed of. As Rudeus was still itchy from the bugs, he asked Geese to scratch his back for him.

After being freed, Rudeus spent a few days in the village.

Nanohoshi

Hitogami
 told him if he goes to <<
Ranoa Magic Academy
>> it would solve his problem of impotency, and advised him to research the cause of Metastasis event.

Sylphiette

Also Human God warned him that he'd regret it if he went. With encouragement from Norn and Elinalise he resolved himself to go and ignore the Human God's advice for the first time. Luckily before he departed Nanahoshi gave him the light spirit scrolls as well as the location for a teleportation magic circle to the Begaritto Continent that could be used, he used teleportation circles to travel there extremely fast making his trip there in one and a half month where it could have taken him 2 years.

Rudeus, Cliff, Aisha, and Zenith arrive in Milishion. They meet Gisu after Zenith stands up in the moving carriage and points at him. They head towards Cliff's house in the Religious District and Rudeus along with Aisha give Cliff help in cleaning the house which was very dusty. Afterwards they ate dinner with the leftover food.

Rudeus takes Zenith to the Latreia House along with Aisha. He tells Aisha to sit down with Zenith while they are waiting since they are family and Aisha should be treated as a guest as well. When his grandmother Claire arrives, he greets her, but he is ignored and Claire heads straight to see Zenith and has her physician, Andel Berkeley, take a look at her condition all while ignoring Rudeus. They angrily question why Aisha, a mere maid, was sitting down and then Rudeus explained that he told her to since she was his sister. Claire explained that people are treated based on their clothing and that Rudeus was ignored since many people have claimed to be her grandchild and she didn't know Rudeus. Claire then asks for Rudeus to prove his identity. Rudeus told Claire that he has brought Zenith and Aisha and that he has the letter. Since it wasn't enough proof, Claire told Rudeus that he could not be considered a member of the Latreia House with just that. Rudeus did not mind since he was there as the head of the Greyrat Household in Sharia. Rudeus explains that even though he has inherited the kinship of a large part of the four feudal lords of Asura, he did not have the rank of nobility. He also explained that even if he held a high rank that bowing to his grandmother as a greeting after meeting her for the first time would be a natural thing to do. Rudeus also explains that even apart from his rank of nobility, he is personal friends with the newly crowned Asura Queen Ariel and is the subordinate of 『Dragon God』 Orsted who is ranked second of the seven major world powers. He also warned them not to make light of who he is because of his connections. After Rudeus proved his social position, Claire apologized for previously ignoring him. Rudeus told them that he has tried everything to help Zenith's condition and Claire calls Sharia a village-like place since compared to Milishion it was not as advanced in Healing magic. But Rudeus retorted by saying that even if Sharia was not as advanced in Healing Magic, he was able to have Orsted who knew all magic and Perugius who was knowledgeable in summoning magic help him. Claire then asked about Norn and Rudeus told Claire that Norn was currently studying in Ranoa Magic University and was at the top as the Student Council President. Claire told Rudeus in a commanding tone to bring Norn after her graduation and that a suitable person would not be found in a backwater country like the Ranoa Kingdom and that she would choose a suitable person for marriage if a suitable. That conflicted with Rudeus' ideology of giving Norn the freedom to pick her own path, but he told Claire that he would take responsibility for Norn to keep the peace. Rudeus answered many medical questions posed by Andel and Aisha answered any questions that Rudeus did not have the answer to. Since Zenith appeared younger than her actual age and was still able to have children, Claire wanted to have Zenith remarry even if she were to get many divorces and they were essentially treating Zenith as a tool to create children and not as a person which infuriated Rudeus. They also told Rudeus to cut his ties with Cliff and when Rudeus would not do so, they told them to leave, but leave Zenith with the Latreia House. After Claire expressed her desire to use Zenith as a tool to give birth and have her remarry and referring to Zenith as a thing and not a person, Rudeus blanked out and all he remembers is yelling. When Aisha called out to him as if cheering him on, Rudeus' mind was brought back. Claire attempted to get some guards to take Zenith, but Rudeus knocked them away and left the house with Zenith and Aisha. Rudeus realized he was hungry and then decided to head back to Cliff's house.

He meets the Miko who was saved by Eris long ago. His mother gets kidnapped by Claire. He gets attacked by the Order of the Temple and in the confusion he winds up kidnapping
Miko
. He returns to use Miko as a bargaining chip to get Zenith back. He explains his side of the story and they sentence Claire to ten years in prison and while they were going to take Claire, Zenith stops them and slaps Rudeus. Miko explains Claire's side of the story and Rudeus and the Latreia family reconcile. He recruits Miko into Orsted's camp and gives her a bracelet with a Dragon God symbol and a summoning scroll for a guardian after Miko reveals to them that Zenith never actually lost her memories or her mind and that Zenith was of dreaming since she was constantly using her Miko power of Telepathy. Gisu had Aisha give Rudeus a letter with Gisu admitting that he has been an apostle for Hitogami the entire time and next time they meet he will have properly gathered forces to defeat Rudeus. Rudeus feeling paranoid that he might be assassinated since Gisu could have easily come at him or his family with a poison knife while they were sleeping so Eris came to guard Rudeus. Before they went back home, they visited Miko so that Miko could finally meet Eris again. Eris did not remember Miko, but Miko said that she wanted to become like Eris and then Eris made a wood sword for Miko to practice sword swings with.

Side Story: The Truth of Santa Claus

Rudeus plan to give Lucy a gift during a fictional Christmas as a Santa Claus. But, in the end Orsted came and personally give Lucy and present as Santa Claus.

Volume 22 - Young Man Period - Organization Chapter

Rudeus arrives back home and gives Lilia and the rest of the family a summary of what has happened at Milishion. Rudeus meets Zanoba and they talk about improving the Magic Armor. Roxy asks Rudeus if she could help with the armor and Rudeus welcomes her help and notes to himself that if she was a part of the team, the Armor could be improved 100 times better. He later meets with Orsted and they discuss about how to gather forces to defeat Gisu and prevent certain pieces from becoming enemies.

Rudeus later goes to the Ouryuu Kingdom and meets with Death God Randolph to recruit him, but was turned down due to him needing to protect Benedict and Pax Jr. He later meets with the King of the Ouryuu Kingdom and was able to save little Pax from future threats by the Ouryuu Kingdom giving Pax Jr. or having assassins potentially aiming for him by the Kingdom by letting Rudeus deal with any issues that may arise between the Shirone Kingdom and Little Pax. Rudeus also able to further other parts of his agenda as well during the meeting using his connections and later on after meeting Randolph again, he was given a ring that would allow Rudeus to get a favor from Kishirika.

Rudeus travels to the Demon Continent with Eris and Roxy to gain Atofe as an ally. Passing through the front gate peacefully, they meet with the Demon King and offer gifts of alcohol. One is a hundred year old alcohol from the Asura Kingdom given to them by Ariel and the other is an extremely rare one that makes Atofe extremely excited. That rare alcohol <<Dragon God Jewel Spirit>>(Aleschneil) is a type only made by the dragon tribe and was given to them by Orsted. The last time Atofe had her hands on the alcohol was when it was gifted to her by Urupen for her wedding with Carl or Kalman I the first North God. She then had a duel with Rudeus and party. Atofe surrendered after Rudeus attacked with the Gatling gun from the Magic Armor MK I. He gain the <<Hero>> title for defeating Atofe. They all then had a banquet.

Two months after recruiting Atofe, while recruiting many of the other demon lords quite easily due to both hearing Rudeus as a <<Hero>> who made Atofe surrendered and the outrageous reputation of Atofe, Roxy requested to visit her home town and Rudeus took the opportunity to bring Lara as well so that they could all travel to Roxy's hometown to visit Roxy's parents and tell them of their marriage.

Nanahosi tried to return home with newly created magic circle, but ended up in failure, and then going into a deep sleep.

Rudeus learns from Kishirika that Gisu is in a forest.

Volume 23 - Young Man Period - The Decisive Battle Chapter

Rudeus is in a meeting where they make plans to corner Gisu.

Rudeus goes into the forest and finds out that there's a Supard village hiding within it. Rudeus fights Vita, wins, but in return, the Supards illness hastens causing the Supards who are sick to collapse. To find the cure Rudeus contacts many of his allies but to no avail until Cliff teleports to the village and uses his demon eye to figure out what the illness is and how to cure it. Cliff uses the Sokasu grass (the same thing Nanahoshi used to slow down the Drain Syndrome) which had the Supard race get rid of the remaining Vita(as Vita had been stopping the sickness from getting worse however died as a result of fighting Rudeus) in their system(Vita's real form is a blue slime//had to crap the slime out of their system). In order for the subjugation to no longer go into the forest and try to fight the demons (the invisible wolves), Rudeus apeals to the king to which the king hands over 2 soldiers in order to see if what Rudeus says is true. Rudeus guides the 2 soldiers to the Supard village and they said that they would like to tell the King of the truth. When going back, on the bridge that Rudeus made, the 2 soldiers take off their disguise rings and show who they are (Kalman III and Gull Farion. They slice off both of Rudeus's arms and he falls from the bridge, to where the Earth Dragon is.

Saved by Doga. Grew black arms from black lump of meat that came from black box given by Atofe.

He defeats North God Kalman III and becomes one of the "Seven Great World Powers".

On Ogre Island while celebrating peace Gisu came with Badigadi with his Golden Armor to attack. Rudeus with support from friends and family was able to get to his trump card the MK-0, and fought Badigadi with it.

Volume 24 - Young Man Period - The Final Chapter

Rudeus/Future dies at the age of 74.

''Note: This section is under construction and revision''.

Mushoku Tensei Sequel

Despite the story of Mushoku Tensei ending with Rudeus' death at age 74 in the year 481, several story threats remained unresolved and will likely be taken up in the planned sequel series:

Orsted's
 mission to kill
Hitogami
, who is still alive at the time of Rudeus' death.

The revival of the Demon God
Laplace
, who was said to reincarnate around the time the sequel series seems to be taking place, and
Perugius'
 quest to kill him.

The fate of
Nanahoshi Shizuka
, who chose to be put into suspended animation to await the arrival of her friend,
Shinohara Akito
, so they might go back to Earth together using the teleportation magic circle she and Rudeus developed.

The destiny of Rudeus and
Roxy's
 eldest daugther,
Lara
, who is said to be the Hero who, together with
Leo
, would save the world from an unknown crisis.

Rudeus Greyrat/Future
=====================

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

"There are three things you should do. Consult with Nanahoshi. Send a letter to Eris. Doubt Hitogami, but don't oppose him. That's all."

Rudeus to his past self

Future Rudeus
 is the alternate future self of
Rudeus Greyrat
.

Appearance

He is tall, well-built and cool-looking man. He was born with brown hair, He also has slightly mismatched eyes, because he switched one of his eyes for a demon eye.

Appearing as an old man from the future to
Rudeus
 after using time travel magic. He is missing the bottom half of his body from below his stomach and is missing many organs as a result of his magic not sufficient in allowing him to make the large time jump in one go.

Personality

Future Rudeus became dejected with the death of
Roxy
 and always spent his time drinking and sleeping with different women. He was afraid to sleep with
Sylphy
 since he thought that he will just end up venting his frustration on her, which only caused to further drive her away.

After the death of Sylphy, his personality took an easy 180 and changed drastically. A person who would try his best to protect his marriage vow was lost. He would become so twisted that he's not above rape. A person who was once a pacifist and disgusted at murder, was lost. Bent on revenge, the only thing he cares for is to get revenge on
Hitogami
, and he hurts many people on his path of revenge.

Background

Future Rudeus was
Rudeus
 from the future, he came back into the past to prevent the actions that led to what happened to himself. After the events of the demon lord
Atofe
, Future Rudeus was visited by
Hitogami
 who told him to go downstairs and check if there was something off in the basement, which he did and found nothing. What happened though, a rat infected with
Petrification Syndrome
 that was roaming about in the basement was unleashed into the house and infected some leftover food, which Roxy later ate. Roxy became sick, and regular Detoxification magic wouldn't work, only God-tier Detoxification magic would work. Thus future Rudeus,
Cliff
, and
Zanoba
 snuck into the Church to learn God Detoxification magic, which ended up being a whole book, and was too long to remember, so they ended up having to steal it. However they were easily found, but they were able to make it out with the book. Cliff was poisoned during the escape, and died a few days later.

When future Rudeus returned, Roxy had already succumbed to the illness and died. This devastated future Rudeus and set him on a dark path. Around this time,
Eris
 came back after 5 years of training, but Rudeus thoughtlessly drove her away. Sylphy tried to comfort him desperately, but Rudeus refused it due to a heavy drinking habit, and ended up sleeping with a whore. Sylphy found out about this when he came home and smelled like another woman, and stopped talking to him, and eventually left him to rejoin
Ariel
, that was on her way to the
Kingdom Of Asura
, after
Hitogami
 supposedly influenced
Luke
 to propose the idea.

When Rudeus finds out
Sylphy
 left, he goes to follow her hoping to apologize and make up, but finds that
Sylphy
 followed
Ariel
 back to the kingdom, and after having a hard time at the border, he was smuggled in by
Tris
, Rudeus heard a rumor Ariel was planning a coup, which he at first chose not to believe, then he found
Sylphy
 and
Luke
 murdered by
the Water God
 and a
North Emperor
, who were royal guests at the time, while
Ariel
 was captured during the attempted coup.

Rudeus starts killing indiscriminately and changed to be bent on the revenge of
Sylphy
,
Roxy
, and all others who were killed unfairly.
Eris
 would come again and again only for him to drive her away again and again. Eventually
Zanoba
,
Julie
,
Ginger
 and
Aisha
 were murdered by the church of Milis, and future Rudeus personally massacred all templar knights in Ranoa.

Going down on this path, Rudeus hunted anything
Hitogami
 related, including the likes of Demon Kings, and it is implied that he killed a lot of people, weak or strong, in his quest to learn more, only to learn nothing. Before he knew it, he was an old man and when he finally found the information on how to defeat
Hitogami
, he learned that he would not be able to do it in his lifetime. Finally at the end of his life, he was able to learn how to time travel and traveled back to the past before
Roxy
 died, and informed his past self of all of this information.

Unfortunately the time travel trip left him missing a lot of organs and mana, thus he died to his injuries, but not before giving
his past self
 advices and a guilt-ridden diary.

Legacy





Orsted and Rudeus discussing the diary's content



After conducting an autopsy on Future Rudeus' body, Rudeus burned his remains and places the ashes in an urn to be buried in the same place with
Paul Greyrat
.

Rudeus confirms the truth in his words by going to the basement and kills the magic stone disease infected mouse that has violet crystal teeth that would have killed Roxy and the
baby
 in her womb.

After sealing the mouse's remains in a box made from Earth Magic, Rudeus sends it to the Magic Guild for study.

By heeding the advise to not oppose Hitogami, Rudeus is able to negotiate with him on the condition to kill
Orsted
 and also receive advise from him on how to make the Magic Armor described on Future Rudeus' diary.

By consulting with
Nanahoshi
 and showing her the diary, Nanahoshi agrees to cooperate with Rudeus, able to theorize the reason on why she failed on returning back to her original world and also advises Rudeus to consult with Orsted.

By sending a letter to Eris, she is able to join Rudeus on his second battle against Orsted, clear the misunderstanding between them and become his wife.

After becoming Orsted's subordinate, Rudeus shows Orsted the diary and is able to make plans on making
Ariel Anemoi Asura
 the next
Asura Kingdom
's queen and discover the fate of
Tristina Purplehorse
 after the
Teleport Incident
.

Through information from the diary, Rudeus is able to convince
Ghislaine Dedoldia
 to ally with Ariel and help uncover who is behind
Sauros Boreas Greyrat
's death.

The diary also contains information about mercenaries hired by
Darius Silva Ganius
 such as
Auber Corvette
 and
Reida Reia
 who are also Apostles of Hitogami.

Power and Abilities

『
Demon Eye: Foresight
』

It's a
Demon Eye
 that
Kishirika
 gave to Rudeus for giving her food. It allows the user to see a certain amount into the future. But it is hard to adjust the focus point, the farther he looks into future the more possibilities appear.

The
Demon Eye
 is activated using Rudeus' magic power, the more he inputs the farther he can see into future.

『Voiceless Incantation』

Rudeus is one of the few people capable of using voiceless incantation. He cannot use chantless incantation for healing magic. A normal Magician takes at least 5 seconds to cast a simple spell, and for higher level spells its 30-60 seconds. Rudeus can do it almost instantly no matter the difficulty of the spell.

『Magic』

While Rudeus is a pacifist and doesn't like fighting in general, when he does, he is a formidable opponent. Most of the spells he uses a lot, like Stone Cannon, have been stated by
Badigadi
 to have emperor level of power. Initially, during his childhood, he trained under Water Saint Magician Roxy to become a Water Saint Magician himself. However, he eventually shifted to using earth magic, relying on the easy versatility and power of spells like Stone Cannon and Quagmire. His efforts eventually landed him the epithet of "Quagmire". His total magical power has been stated by
Orsted
,
Kishirika
,
Badigadi
, and
Perugius
 to be similar to that of
Laplace
.

Future Rudeus was strong enough to look down on Demon King
Atofe
, which almost became his downfall as her retainer Moore also turned out to be formidable.

『Time Travel Magic』

Through the dragon god research, Rudeus was able to figure out a way to propel himself to the past, though ordinarily that requires an insane amount of mana. Unfortunately it was a one way trip, and he succumbed to his injuries.

『Gravity Magic』

He demonstrated the ability to use gravity magic by closing a door and lifting an inkwell. He can also fly using this magic by lowering the gravity.

『Electricity Magic』

He demonstrated the ability to use electricity magic. When his fist quivered and encircled it with cracking coiling purple lighting.

Afterward, he struck the desk and purple lighting scattered through the surrounding area with bright light and quickly faded. Leaving a burn mark on the desk.

『Electric』

Realizing that『Lightning』might be a bit overkill as a single target spell, Rudeus weakened the King-class Water magic. Rudeus was able to use Voiceless incantation to create a miniature thundercloud, compressing it, and designating a target for『Lightning』. In order to distinguish it from the normal overpowered spell, he named it『Electric』. The Electric strike is hard to avoid and can numb the nervous system, making it a very useful spell against people who can wear Touki. It is effective against the Immortal Demon Race as demonstrated in the battle against
Atofe
.

『Howling Magic』- Voice Magic

Howling is a type of magic that can locate or paralyze enemies by using sound as a medium, but dark future Rudeus can only use it to surprise or scare opponents; he name this new ability voice magic. He probably learned it from
Gustav Dedorudia
.

『Nuclear Explosion』

Rudeus created in a desperate attempt during his fight against
Orsted
. By focusing a tremendous amount of magic power at a designated area, he creates a huge explosion around his pinpointed target and leaves behind a mushroom-like cloud similar to a nuclear explosion.

『Ran Ma』- Disturb Magic

It is a unique magic that Rudeus learned from observing
Orsted
 in their first fight, it works by interfering with the magic of opponent disturbing it and preventing it from working. This is a very rare and possibly difficult technique as
Sylphiette
, a talented mage in her own right, had a lot of trouble learning it, and had not heard of it either.

『Light Spirits』

Rudeus can make a light spirit scroll to use them to summons bright light spirits as a source of light.

Initially used by Rudeus to log the events of his life but later uses it as a reference point to travel back in time just before his younger self could go to the basement and convinces him to hear him out and to read the diary.

Achievements

Created powerful spells, such as Gravity Magic, Electricity Magic, Voice Magic and Time Travel Magic.

Be able to go to the past to change his fate, making a turning point for his younger self's later life.

He even managed to increase his healing magic to Saint Rank.

Trivia

Although he succeeded in going back to the past, but most of him (organs) didn't make it through due to insufficient mana.
Rudeus
 mused that he could've avoided the problem by segmenting his time travel, allowing his mana to recover in between
.

He was arrogant contrary to what
Rudeus
 always says that it would cause him if he becomes arrogant.

Rudeus
 believed that Rudeus(future) was really himself because future Rudeus introduced himself with his name from his past life, and making various pop culture references that only people from modern earth could possibly know.

He and
Eris
 had a love and hate relationship where she would beat him within inches of his life but would also save him from the shadow in a pinch. In the end, they never properly made up and Future Rudeus regretted it, telling
his younger counter
 part to make a point of apologizing to
her
 first.

Abilities

Rudeus is a powerful magician born with a strong
Laplace factor
 which is one of the reasons for his great magical power besides his intense training at an early age. As he was reincarnated from another world, he is immune to
Orsted
's curse. This is a trait that is inherited by his descendants.

『Voiceless Incantation』





Rudeus discovering Voiceless Incantation



Rudeus is one of the few people capable of using a voiceless incantation, and even rarer as a person who can use voiceless incantation with melded magics.
 He cannot use voiceless incantation for healing magic due to his lack of understanding in regards to how
mana
 is manipulated to heal. A normal Magician takes at least five seconds for a simple spell, while for higher-level spells its thirty to sixty seconds. Rudeus can do it almost instantly no matter what difficulty of the spell, with the exception of healing magic. Rudeus needs to use the chant of a new spell being taught to him before he can use its voiceless incantation version which puzzles Orsted.

An interesting feature of Voiceless Incantation is that you can put a large amount of mana in a spell to increase it's effectiveness to your desire. This way, Rudeus was about to use Emperor-Leveled magic without his own knowledge

『Demon Eyes』

『Foresight Eye』

Demon Eye Foresight used in combat in the Anime
Demon Eye in the Anime
Demon Eye in the Manga
1/3

It's a Demon Eye that
Kishirika
 gave to Rudeus for giving her food replacing his right eye. It allows the user to see a certain amount into the future. It is difficult to adjust the focus point; the farther into the future he looks, the more unreliable it becomes.

The power of Demon Eyes are adjusted according to the amount of mana poured into them. The more mana Rudeus inputs into the Foresight Demon Eye, the farther into the future he can see. Rudeus is able to fine-tune the eye to see 10 seconds into the future reliably.

Experienced warriors can negate the Demon Eye's usefulness in battle by making split-second decisions, forcing the eye to see multiple futures. This is learned when Rudeus duels
Ruijerd
.
Badigadi
 is the only exception due to his own acquired abilities in the past that negates all demon eye to ever work against him making him invisible to the eye. The eye can also act as a conduit for another being's power as
Hitogami
 was able to show Rudeus a vision of where to find
Aisha
 and
Lilia
 through his eye. Another weakness of the eye is that it does not pick up sounds and as such,
Gyes
 was able to incapacitate Rudeus using
Howling magic
.

Overuse or losing control of the eye may cause the user some sort of pain and nausea as a result of overloading the brain. This is shown when Rudeus felt a moment of extreme nausea after Hitogami used the eye to show him a vision of the future, or when he originally received the eye and it took him a while to learn to control it since it would give him a double vision.

『Clairvoyant Eye』

It's a second Demon Eye that Kishirika gave to Rudeus for giving her a donut when she is captured by
Atofe
 replacing his left eye. It allows the user to see far away. However, the "focus point" is difficult to control. Rather than acting as a scope, the Clairvoyant Eyes seem to change the perspective of one's vision, with the amount of mana determining the distance from the user.

While Rudeus is a pacifist and doesn't like fighting in general, when he does, he is a formidable opponent. He is capable of casting magic simultaneously in both hands as well as cast melded magic in an instant. With his scientific knowledge from his previous life and creativity, he always strives for developing more efficient magics for himself to use. Most of the spells he uses a lot, like
Stone Cannon
, have been stated by
Badigadi
 to have an Emperor-class level of power. Initially, when he was a child, he mostly used water magic. However, as an adventurer, Rudeus primarily used earth magic such as Stone Cannon and his namesake, Quagmire to hinder and slow down his enemies. His total magical power has been stated by Orsted, Kishirika, Badigadi, and
Perugius Dola
 to be greater than that of Laplace. He was able to create a nuclear explosion, an extension of fire and air melded magic similar to that of the firework used in
Roa
, in his fight against Orsted. According to Orsted, this magic could be considered God-class magic [citation needed]. Rudeus also uses Earth Magic to make figures which
Zanoba
 and
Perugius
 takes interest in.

Nuclear Explosion

Unofficial God-class magic (stated by Orsted) that Rudeus created in a desperate attempt during his fight against Orsted. By focusing a tremendous amount of magic power at a designated area, he creates a huge explosion around his pinpointed target and leaves behind a mushroom-like cloud similar to a nuclear explosion. During the second confrontation with Orsted, he managed to destroy a village with this magic. Even with Orsted opening the First Dragon Gate to tremendously lower its power, the explosion was still packed with power similar to Laplace. It is hinted that this is a Fire-type magic.

Unique

Disturb Magic

It is a unique magic that Rudeus learns after observing Orsted in their first fight and works by interfering with the magic of the opponent disturbing it thus preventing it from working. This is a very rare and difficult technique as Sylphiette, who is a talented mage in her own right, had a lot of trouble learning it.

Dry Steaming

Dry Steaming is a melded magic of fire and wind originally developed by Rudeus to dry wet clothes with a risk of damaging the fabric.

It is a variation of Stone Cannon originally developed by Rudeus. The stone is hollow thereby exploding at the point of contact.

『
Saint Dragon Battle Aura
』

Saint Dragon Battle Aura is a fighting style that was created by Dragon God
Urupen
, who was considered to be the weakest Dragon God due to having the lowest magical capacity ever and rose to become the strongest with this fighting style. It involves defeating an opponent using the minimal amount of magical power. It is described as a fighting style by Rudeus that combines magic arts and the real world martial art Wushu. Rudeus is currently being taught how to use this fighting form by Orsted. This fighting technique is the best fighting style for Rudeus due to it's great compatibility with the 『Magic Armor』, making the 『Magic Armor』 performance more potent, efficient, and useful during combat. It should be noted that it is a fighting style and not a type of battle aura as Rudeus lacks the ability to use actual battle aura.

『Tactics』

He has been noted by others to be a battle genius. During his first fight with Paul, he was smart enough to trap Paul's leg to restrict his movements. During his time as an adventurer, he was known for his skill with Quagmire and trapping opponents with earth magic before attacking. After training with Orsted, he became more aware of his tactics and was able to perform the strategies more efficiently since he was conscious of them. In the case that he is trapped by a high level barrier magic that restricts his magic, he will use the Manatite stone to destroy the seal and use a combination of Quagmire, Mist, and Electric to slow down or disable his opponents before using a summoning scroll to summon his trump card, the Magic armor MK I, to defeat his enemies should the need arise for the fire power. Taking stories and legends from his previous world, he was also able to come up with a strategy to defeat a hydra that could regenerate its heads.

Equipment

『Arrogant Water Dragon King』 (Aqua Heartia)

An expensive staff gifted to him by Eris on his 10th Birthday.

The material of the wand is made from a rough and bony wood that comes from a tree called 『Elder Torrent』, that grows in the large forest of the Eastern region of the Mills Continent. The Wand will







become a subspecies after it drinks from the Faeries' Spring. The tip of the staff is adorned with a large Magical stone that is the size of a fist that comes from a stray dragon located in the Begaritt's continent. The maker is from the Asura kingdom palace's Magic team, a wand-maker(Rod Director) called Chein Procyon. A wand's rank is determined by the wood and the Magic rock, both of which are A ranked materials. The Magic Stone alone is at least worth over 100 Asuran Gold Coins.

The wand has a lot of sentimental value to Rudeus, as Ruijerd was able to see how important it was to Rudeus and convinced him to not sell it so that they could take Ruijerd to the Mills Continent the legal route; instead, Ruijerd agreed to enlist the services of a smuggler even though they would be getting involved with people who would harm children, which is against Ruijerd's warrior code. Rudeus commonly calls it his friend and has a few nicknames for it. Although his power has outgrown the staff's abilities, he will still occasionally use it during important battles. The Staff is normally kept in his room as a decoration due to Rudeus who usually uses 『Shotgun Cannon』 as his main weapon.

Arrogant Water Dragon King is given to
Lara Greyrat
 when she leaves the house along with Leo.

『Mana Absorbing Stone』

A stone made from the
Manatite Hydra
's body. From Rudeus' testing of the stone, there is a front and back of the stone. When mana is applied to the back of the stone, a high pitched sound would ring out and the front of the stone will emit magic canceling wave that is similar to 『Ran Ma』. The stone does not actually absorb mana and its magic breakdown power is similar to the Disturb Magic; however, the stone also requires an almost equal amount of magic power to negate attacking magic. But, the stone is more effective than 『Ran Ma』 due to its capability to cancel completed magic. Magically created objects like dolls that have their mana stabilized will not be destroyed by the waves, but magic attacks that do not have their magic stabilized will be destroyed. Magic Circles will not be destroyed by the stone, but the barriers created will. By inserting the stone into the 『Zariff's Prosthetic arm』, it can be an effective tool at the cost of magic-less effective from that arm.

『Zariff's Prosthetic Arm』

From Zanoba's research of the doll left by the previous owner of Rudeus' house, Zanoba with the help of Cliff were able to create an artificial prosthetic arm. With the chant, "『Oh Earth, become thine Arm.』", the magic tool can be activated, and can be deactivated with the chant 『Oh Arm, return to Earth』. It can also allow the wearer to feel tactile feedback from the fingers and even has the strength to restrain Zanoba's Miko Power. The arm can also fly out as a Rocket Punch. It was used as the replacement of Rudeus' left hand that was lost in the fight against the Manatite Hydra and continued to function as a Rocket Punch gauntlet, after all of his limbs were restored by Orsted's King Class Healing Magic, until its capabilities were replaced by the second version black 『Magic Armor』. He still wears them as gauntlets and he has one for both hands.

『Dragon Tribe's Robe』

It is a grey robe worn by Great Sage Titiana 1,000 years ago. It is made of the Death Adder Rat's skin and was sewn together using a thread imbued with magic. It has considerable magic resistance and is highly blade proof. The weight of the wearer is reduced by half and it is possible to move like the wind.
Rudeus
 received it from
Orsted
 in volume 17 before going to
Asura Kingdom
 to assist
Ariel
 to become the queen.

『Dragon God's Armlet』

Its crest was engraved by Dragon God with the ability to block
Hitogami
's future foresight from seeing the future of the wearer, effectively blocking Hitogami's view of Rudeus's immediate surroundings.
Orsted
 gave it to Rudeus after they started working together.

『Magic Armor』

Magic Armor 『MK. I』

The prototype created under the joint cooperation of Zanoba and Cliff. It’s height is a little less than 3 meters. The right hand was affixed with a Stone Gatling Cannon and the left hand was affixed with a shield and a Magic Absorption Stone.

Although its mana consumption was quite high, it was considered to hold defensive and offensive power similar to that of the Seven Great World Powers, It was specifically created in order to fight Dragon God Orsted, though it was still kept in use after that. It was destroyed by the Fighting God during the Battle of Biheiril Kingdom.

Magic Armor 『MK. II』

It was a complete set that could be separated into arm parts, leg parts, and torso part. It was a jet-black armor and helmet. A smaller version of the『MK. I』.

If worn, it could provide physical ability similar to that of a Saint Ranked swordsman.

Magic Armor 『MK. Zero』

The decisive battle weapon of Rudeus created for the Battle of Biheiril Kingdom. It is a stronger version of the『MK. I』, although it consumes double the mana.

Magic Armor 『MK. III』

The Magic Armor used by Rudeus during his last years. Its height was a little more than 2 metres and its ability was the same as the『MK. I』.

This Magic Armor became the basis for the mass-production of the All-Purpose Magic Armor Series later on.

『Summoning Scrolls』

Each scroll has a one time use and can be used to summon the 『Magic Armor Mk I 』. He also is able to create scrolls that link to hidden locations, in the event he needs to make a quick escape.

『Gatling Gun』

A weapon that Rudeus had Roxy with one of Roxy's friends developed, after taking Hitogami's suggestion to create a magic tool that shoots magic that only Rudeus can handle, for the fight against Orsted. This weapon is able to fire off 10 of his standard 『Stone Cannon』 per second. Rudeus only uses this weapon in conjunction when wearing the 『Magic Armor Mk I 』. Rudeus defeated
Atofe
 using this weapon by three steps:

In the first step, Atofe's armor was smashed into several small pieces.

In the second step, Atofe's shoulder was torn to pieces.

In the third step, Atofe's upper half of the body became full of holes that were blown off and separated from her lower half.

After Atofe realize that 『Magic Armor Mk I 』 wasn't the Fighting God Armor, she pointed out the difference in color and that the 『Gatling Gun』 didn't exist at that time.

『Shotgun Cannon』

A weapon that Rudeus developed after taking Orsted's suggestion about the Gatling gun to make it fire multiple stone cannons in one shot to counter Water God Style practitioner. This weapon is currently replacing 『Arrogant Water Dragon King』 as his main weapon when not wearing 『Magic Armor Mk Il』. Rudeus stated that this weapon is a very user-friendly weapon.

『Lithograph Stone』

Based off of the seven powers stone created by Technique God, Orsted created a stone that would allow long-range communication through writing on the Large Stone. Anything written on the main stone will appear on the sub-stones. Having a main and a sub-stone for the other person's main stone will allow for long-range communication. The stone also requires a bit of magic to actually use so it is not a widespread tool.

『Scroll Vernier』

The second Roxy made machine. A tool that was mounted on the back of the MK II. It has a bulky steampunk look to it that carries folded scrolls ready for activation. If a button near the waist is pressed with magic power, a corresponding slot with a scroll is automatically activated. There are 5 slots by each hand with a total of 10 types of scrolls.

『The Bone Ring of Laxus』

The Ring was given to him by Death God Randolph to show to Kishirika to gain favor. Kishirika told Rudeus to keep it since it may be useful. The Ring was originally owned by Death God Laxus who created the ring to kill the
Dark King Vita
. The ring works by using the death of the person the ring's holder relied on the most to break the illusion. The spiritual form of the Ring is a dirty black skeleton with a crown. The ring would not activate without the Ring's holder having experienced such a death. For Rudeus, that death was Paul's and an image of Paul's death appeared in each dream showed by the Vita. The ring caused Dark King Vita to self destruct and die. The ring broke after fulfilling its purpose.

『Atofe-hand』

A gift from
Atoferatofe
 given to Rudeus, a wooden box that contains flesh from Atofe. After getting both of his arms cut off by North God
Kalman III
 and former Sword God
Gal Farion
, Atofe-hand attached itself to Rudeus. It looks obsidian black and is hard as stone, Rudeus describes it as stronger than Zariff's Prosthetic Arm.

『Wooden Pendant』

Paul Greyrat is Rudeus' father in the
Human World
 who trains him in the basics of the
Sword God Style
 and teaches him to protect the weak. Initially, Rudeus didn't see Paul as a father figure and instead saw him as a close friend who has the same perverted interests while Paul sees Rudeus like himself when he was younger.
 When Rudeus asks Paul to look for a job for him so he can earn money for him and Sylphy to study at
Ranoa Magic Academy
, Paul sees that Rudeus is making Sylphy to be too dependent on him and decides to separate them but is also aware that he cannot win against Rudeus when it comes to talking so he decides to fight him and knock him out before sending him to the
Citadel of Roa
.

When they reunite after the
Teleport Incident
 they had a falling out, but they reconcile soon after. He later joins him together with the former members of the Fangs of Black Wolf to reach the final floor of the
Teleport Labyrinth
 in the
Begaritt Continent
 to save Roxy and Zenith. During the final fight with the final boss Hydra, Paul saves Rudeus from a surprise attack after they are under the impression that it is dead, and was cut in half from his waist. He died knowing his son was safe. His death had deeply affected Rudeus.

 After the
Teleport Incident
, Rudeus continue to search for Zenith where he would build his reputation on each city in the Northern
Central Continent
 by helping out fellow adventurers and in returns, ask them to spread his name with the chance that Zenith will recognize him since his ability to use chantless incantation is a rare ability among magicians and they could find each other.

When Rudeus discovers that Zenith is in the
Teleportation Labyrinth
, he joins the
Fangs of the Black Wolf
 rescue her and they find that she was trapped in a Mana Crystal in the labyrinth guarded by a
Manatite Hydra
 for almost 6 years. After she had been rescued, she was thought to have lost all of her memories and emotions, which causes Rudeus to fall in to despair and depression after Paul's death and now having an invalid mother. Despite this, Rudeus brings her back to
Sharia
 where she would find a way to cure her even consulting with
Perugius Dola
 to help him.

During their trip to the
Millis Continent
, they came across the
Miko of Memory
 and through her power, it was revealed that she is capable of perceiving what is happening around her and knew what happened to her husband Paul and her life with Rudeus and his new family. Later on, it was revealed that she became a Miko and her inability to speak and her being expressionless were caused by her being in a dream-like state but still conscious of her surroundings and that she is happy with how Rudeus is looking out for her how she spends them with her grandchildren.

After that, an incident happened at school where everyone started to compare her to Rudeus which caused her to seclude herself in her dorm, Rudeus, after sneaking into her dorm room, had a little talk with her. Seeing how anxious he was trying to talk to her reminded her of their father's anxious expression which made her quickly forget her hatred towards him.

We were victims of Laplace's plot! The Superd are no race of monstrous beasts!

Ruijerd, to
Rudeus

Ruijerd Superdia
 (
ルイジェルド・スペルディア
,

Ruijerudo Superudia
)
 is the former leader of the Superd's Warrior group who once served under
Laplace
 with unwavering loyalty. He was accompanying
Rudeus
 and
Eris
 but left in search of his people. Under manipulation, Ruijerd killed his son, who was able to free him from Laplace's control. Following the annihlation of his species, Ruijerd travels the world to dissolve the stigma against the Superd race.

Appearance

Ruijerd is tall for an average
Superd
, muscular build, handsome and shared their distinctive features such as porcelain white skin and emerald green hair with a red gemstone on his forehead. He wears a brown tribal vest that only covers his back and sides, fully displaying his frontal torso and arms.

Moreover, he is distinguished by his smooth oval chin and a long scar that trails from the right top corner of his forehead across his glabella to the left end of his cheek.

When Rudeus bleached his hair, it became a different color. However, Ruijerd later shaved his head bald and wore a headband to cover the gemstone on his forehead.

He now wears the necklace gifted to him by Rudeus around his neck.

Personality

"A warrior protects children and treasures their comrades"

Despite having a scary demeanor, Ruijerd is very kind and fatherly. He always helps children no matter what the circumstances, and would go berserk when people try to hurt them.

Ruijerd follows a very strict warrior's code of honor that he would go to extreme lengths to fulfill his promises. He is also described as rather stubborn, having a very adamant sense of justice that he won't tolerate even minor crimes during his debut regardless of how it may look like to those surrounding him which also causes misunderstandings of his intention.

Background

Ruijerd was born to a pair of Superd warriors in a town in the Babinosu Region. Being a talented and hardworking warrior, he was elected as the war chief of the Superd warrior group that served as
Laplace
's elite force in just a few decades, an achievement that's almost unheard of. He also married Luwelia, a female tribe member that took care of him like an elder sister since childhood, and gave birth to his son Luiweld
.

However, Laplace betrayed their loyalty by ordering them to take up the cursed pitch black Devil's spears into battle in favor of their birth spears, which put them into a mesmeric frenzy that caused them to mindlessly slaughter those around them, including their own family. After giving his son a fatal wound, Ruiweld managed to destroy the Devil's spear and finally wake Ruijerd from his stupor to realize the truth.

In the moment of despair from his actions, Ruijerd had considered committing suicide to atone for his sins, but ultimately decided to exact vengeance on Laplace for the cruel fate befallen his people along with everyone of the warrior group. After several years of hiding and biding his time carefully, he finally got his revenge when he turned the tide of the decisive battle between Laplace and the three heroes, by striking Laplace's weak point
.

Although Laplace was defeated, there was no way to change the things that had already transpired, and the horrible reputation of the
Superd Tribe
 had already taken root which caused even stories about the Superd that kills friends and enemies alike to frighten children have circulated even to the
Central Continent
. After exacting his revenge, he now has a goal of restoring the honor and fixing the reputation that the Superd race has.

Plot






Rudeus and Eris meeting Ruijerd

Rudeus
 and
Eris

Demon Continent
 in the aftermath of the
Teleport Incident

Dead End
 and joins the
Adventure Guild
 to use the money they earn to travel back to the Central Continent where Ruijerd is given the alias "Watch Dog".

"I'm sure you have your own complaints, but those complaints can only be said while your son is alive."

-Ruijerd to
Paul Greyrat

When they reach
Millishion
, Ruijerd reaches out to his contact to secure a passage out of

 which resulted in their defeat but they somehow survived the encounter.






Ruijerd, Norn and Aisha meeting Rudeus



Ruijerd saves Norn who was being confronted by two men and threatens them, causing the men to leave. As Norn vents her frustrations about her family, Ruijerd reflecting on his own pitfalls as a parent, he empowers Norn that she should work harder to overcome her weaknesses, Norn moved by his positive words asks his name, Ruijerd introduces himself, his headband falls revealing his third eye as
Roxy
 and
Lilia
 arrive at the scene. Following the aftermath, Ruijerd meets with Paul who was initially reluctant to let Ruijerd to escort Norn and Aisha to Rudeus in
Sharia
 but eventually consents so Ruijerd became Aisha and Norn's bodyguard on their journey.

Six months later, Ruijerd delivers Paul's daughters to Rudeus in Sharia as promised, yet he is disheartened to learn that Rudeus didn't marry Eris, seemingly crestfallen by the news, he advises Rudeus to reach out for Eris as he believes she's suffering from warrior disease.

The following morning, Rudeus wakes to an unexpected sight with Ruijerd and Badigadi locking tense gazes, Badigadi backs down once Rudeus comes into view and disappears. After that they have breakfast, Ruijerd prepares to depart to resume his search for remnants of his lost kin, with Rudeus, Norn, Sylphie and Aisha escorting him to the town's exit to see him off. As they reach the city's exit, Norn clings tightly to the hem of Ruijerd's vest,  Ruijerd comforts and assures her that their paths will cross again, that she should rely on her brother from now. With warm and hearfelt goodbyes exchanged, he entrusts the children and Rudeus to Sylphie and bids them farewell.






Ruijerd and Rudeus reunion



Seven years later, Ruijerd is spotted by the Rude Mercenary Company in the Biheiril Kingdom, buying medicine and wearing thick robes with a hood to hide his eyes. Fearing that Ruijerd may be in danger from Geese, Rudeus assembles a team to intercept Geese and recruit Ruijerd.

Ruijerd is found in a remote village within the Forest of No Return in the south, living among his tribe, whom Rudeus describes as exceptionally beautiful. At first, Ruijerd was wary and didn’t recognize Rudeus due to his disguise, but after revealing his face, the two shared an emotional reunion. Ruijerd had finally found his people and was no longer alone.

Ruijerd and Rudeus continue their conversation at Ruijerd's house, one of the largest homes in the village owing to his distinguished position. At the same time, Rudeus is struck by how empty the house feels. Rudeus brings up marriage but Ruijerd assures him the past doesn’t weigh on him anymore but he simply hasn't found a partner. Afterward, Rudeus recounts everything that transpired since their separation, including Paul’s death, his encounter with his future self, his marriage to Eris, and his alliance with Orsted, among other things.

Rudeus asks Ruijerd to join him in the future battle against Laplace, however, Ruijerd hesitates and ultimately refuses without explanation. Ruijerd then takes Rudeus into the forest, revealing a grim truth: the plague in the Superd village was never cured, only curbed. The supposed recovery was a lie he told the village elders. He removes his forehead guard to reveal a blue jewel marked with ominous markings, proof that he is possessed by
Abyssal King Vita
.

, Rudeus gave the necklace to Ruijerd.

Superd Spear: The spear of the Superd will get sharper and harder every time it is used in combat. It was originally his son's and is slightly shorter than usual.

Quotes

To Rudeus:
 "We were victims of Laplace's plot! The Superd are no race of monstrous beasts!"

To Rudeus:
 "After my complete recovery, I'll become your strength."

To Rudeus:
 "Fighting is a necessity. It's been like this since the beginning of time, it's immemorial."

To Rudeus:
 "Yes. So don't you start crying."

To Paul:
 "You may have your grievances, but those only matter when your son is still alive."

To Norn:
 "Face him up without running away, you are family after all."

To Norn:
 "If you want to be with someone, you need to get bigger, stronger, more impressive."

To the Superds:
 "Do you want us to go extinct?! Rudeus brought that man here, and I trust Rudeus. If you have complaints, save them until after I’m dead."

To Rudeus on Orsted:
 "Appearances can be deceiving."

Trivia

Ruijerd's spear is the last memento of his son Luiweld. It is slightly shorter than usual because Luiweld has a smaller stature than regular warriors
.

Ruijerd's original spear is staked at his son's grave.

During the Laplace War, Ruijerd was deployed with a squadron of elite Superd warriors to infiltrate and scout the Central Continent's defenses. During their mission, they clash with the Dragon God
Urupen
 and his comrades repeatedly, slowly being cornered with every encounter. In order to shake them off they draw lots and one of Ruijerd's partners acts as a decoy, sacrificing themselves to ensure the team's survival. In recognition of this warrior's valor and strength, the Dragon God erects a grave in their honor. Hundreds of years later,
Dead End
 would discover and unearth that site.

Ruijerd is so skilled at "Chinchirorin" that he crushes
Geese
 without ever losing, leaving
Geese
 convinced that he's cheating.

Ruijerd's daughter would be the last
Superd
 warrior that would deal the final blow to
Laplace
 in other loops. Ruijerd is fated to marry
Norn Greyrat
 in many loops.

Kissed
Rudeus
 (Through Possession by
Vita
)

In Orsted's previous loops where Rudeus didn't exist, Ruijerd never met the surviving Superd race in
Biheiril Kingdom
, where they would have been killed by
the plague
.

After learning this, Rudeus finally realized the reason
Hitogami
 told him to help Ruijerd was because Hitogami plotted Ruijerd's death by having him travel to Biheiril Kingdom and encounter the surviving Superd after Rudeus' journey back home and contract the plague that would kill the entire Superd race in order to prevent
Laplace
's death, which is required by
Orsted
 in order to obtain Laplace's treasure for reaching Hitogami.

Ruijerd and Rudeus in the Anime



"He's strong, clever and a warrior worthy of respect."

-Ruijerd

Rudeus first meets Ruijerd after the
Teleport Incident
 where he is instructed by
Hitogami
 to help him. Although Rudeus is initially suspicious but not afraid of Ruijerd, he is not dangerous according to his intuition and he begins to talk to him which baffles Ruijerd on why he is not afraid of him despite being to aware of the
Superd Tribe
's reputation. They would travel together with Eris back to the
Fittoa Region
,
Asura Kingdom
 For the next three years where they became close comrades.
  Ruijerd is deeply grateful for Rudeus whose influence reshaped his worldview by expanding his perspective and helping him move past the foolish thoughts and rigid mindset that once defined his existence on the Demon Continent. Ruijerd's trust in Rudeus is second nature as he's willing to follow his judgment by taking a potentially dangerous medicine created by Cliff despite his tribe's protests and the inherent risks. Futhermore, one of the reasons Ruijerd desired to marry Norn was to establish a familial bond with Rudeus.

Icefall Treant

 in the Milbotts Region ruled by the Notos Greyrat Family. Her father was a hunter from whom she learned how to use the bow.

When a horde of monsters attacked her hometown, Sara's parents tells her to stay behind but later learns that they both have died, leaving Sara to survive on her own by selling the fur and meat.
 Sara later learns that the Notos family refused to send their soldiers, because of that she lost her parents, which lead to her hatred of the nobility in general.

Plot

Mushoku Tensei Volume 7






Sara and Counter Arrow Party



Sara and her party first met a depressed
Rudeus
 in a carriage that was traveling to Ranoa Kingdom. She became angry at Rudeus when
Suzanne
 was being nice to him but Rudeus does not want to talk about himself. Later on, Rudeus joined her party after Suzanne recruited him for a Rank A quest of killing
Grizzlies
 for their hide that Rudeus plans to do alone.
 When Rudeus first joined, Sara's very unfriendly toward him and immediately shoots down any suggestions he makes about party formations because she thought him to be a runaway noble playing as an adventurer, but after many shared experience where he helped the party, she started to warm up to him.

When the party took on the quest to gather
Snow Drake
 scales in the Galgau Ruins, at one point in it, they were rushed by a pack of agitated Snow Drakes forcing Rudeus to try to hold them off with his magic. In doing so, he was too slow to run away from them, luckily, Sara inspired her party to come back to help him and they end up complete the mission, although much less successful than they would had liked due to
Soldat's

party
 interference. In the aftermath party, when a drunk Soldat confronted Rudeus, Sara was quick to jump to his defense.

Later on in the winter season, when Rudeus was not in the party, Counter Arrow took on a mission during a blizzard which made them get lost into the territory of the hostile
Snow Buffaloes
 in Trier Forest. She was separated from her party while running away from the Buffaloes. Sara built an ice cave to shelter from the cold but she got captured by an
Icefall Treant
 to suck out her lifeforce. She would have died slowly if not for Rudeus setting out immediately to find her after hearing the news from her party members. Due to this experience, she grew quite close toward him - going out together and sharing their past experience with one another.

After a date where she got drunk and told Rudeus to bring her back to his room, they ended up trying to make out. But due to the fact that he had ED, it became an awkward experience and she ran away after it, embarrassed and angry, thinking that it's because of her that Rudeus couldn't do it. Afterwards, she tried to come back and make up with him but discovered that he had been going to the prostitutes, misunderstanding him, slapping him, and telling him off, she ran away again. After she calmed down thanks to some advice from Suzanne, she realized that she might have been in the wrong and went to meet Rudeus, unfortunately he had already moved with Soldat's party to another place by then.

Citadel of Roa
. After exchanging stories of what they have been doing, Sara invites Rudeus to dinner and to his surprise, Sara is now married and the restaurant is owned by Sara and her husband.

Power and Abilities

Physical Abilities

Sara stands out for her sheer raw talent that is comparable to Eris.  In combat, her battlefield awareness and agility is top notch that is already in the level of an A-Ranked Adventurer.

Archery






Sara's archery skills in the Anime



Sara is a prodigy for her talent in the bow who has a lot of potential despite the bow being an inferior weapon of choice compared to magic and the various sword styles. She can shoot down monster after monster with perfectly placed arrows even at long range making the disadvantage of carrying arrows seem irrelevant. She can also make her own bows and arrows using raw resources and has the best eyes in the party to scout an enemy over a hundred meters away.

Equipment

Bow

A bow made by her.

Magic Earring






Sara using her Magic Earring



Magic Earring is a
Magic Item
. Its ability activates when the user stabs the end of the feather into the opponent. This will cause the target to be caught in an illusion for a short time, useful for emergencies.

Trivia

Sara is one of the new characters introduced in the Light Novel. She doesn't appear in the Web Novel.

Sara is similar to
Eris
 in many ways - both of them are highly talented combatants, initially hostile towards
Rudeus
, being tsundere in personality, and offered Rudeus their virginity (although Sara failed due to Rudeus' ED). They are even same in age.

Despite not being one of Rudeus' wives, some fans still consider her one of Rudeus' harem members, nicknaming her "Blonde Mama".

Cover Characters

Rudeus Greyrat

Summary

Using magic, Rudeus was able to evade Paul's surprise attack having witnessed Paul's strength when defending the village in the past. Rudeus always simulated how to fight him and is grateful to him for being a strong role model. Without knowing his father's motives, Rudeus uses magic to create a stone sword for him and used liquefaction on one of Paul's shoes to momentarily trap him. When Rudeus attempted to repeat the magic on the other foot, Paul easily escaped and rushed against Rudeus, who used "Bomb Blast" to try to gain distance, but Rudeus' evasion proved futile as Paul appeared in front of him. With Rudeus' desperate attack with his stone sword met by Paul's Water God Sword style parry, Paul knocks Rudeus unconscious. As Paul catches his knocked out son, he voices how proud he is of Rudeus for his keen battle sense.

After the match, Ghislaine arrives to talk with Paul as the semi-unconscious Rudeus hears their conversation and learns that Paul and Laws, Sylphie father, were worried because their children were too dependent with each other. Seeing their friendship may hinder their growths in the long term, Paul decided to send his son with some relatives for five years. Paul leave a letter to Ghislaine, while Rudeus begins to lose consciousness.

When Rudeus awakens, he finds himself in a carriage with Ghislaine, and discovers Pauls sent him to the Citadel of Roa, Fittoa's largest metropolis, and arrive at the Mansion of the city ruler, the manor of family Boreas Greyrat. After meeting with the lord of the city, Sauros Boreas Greyrat, and his son, Philip, both Paul's uncle and cousin respectively, Rudeus receives confirmation to the contents of Paul's letter: Rudeus is to be a magic tutor for Ghislaine and Philip's daughter, so that Rudeus will have enough money for the magic university in five years. Philip warns Rudeus that his daughter is a problem child, but Rudeus thinks that can handle it. When Rudeus try to enter to her room, he receives a punch to the face from the young girl, angry that someone younger is going to be teaching her.

Seven Great Powers
==================

Seven Great Powers motif in the
Anime



The
Seven Great Powers
 (
七大列強
,

Nana Dai-Rekkyō
)
 refers to the seven strongest warriors in the world, a selection of seven people that came to exist following the end of the
Second Human-Demon War
.

History

Establishment

When the Second Great Human-Demon War came to a conclusion, a person known as the
Technique God
 came up with the name. At that time, Technique God was considered to be one of the strongest people in the world. Technique God selected six more people and declared them to be the strongest in the world.

Post-Laplace War

The title of the Seven Great Powers was well known until the Laplace War. All original Seven Powers participated in the Laplace War, with the exception of Technique God. Among them, three were killed, one went missing, and another was sealed away. The Dragon God was the only one who came out of the War with a definite living-status. After hundred of years, with those at the bottom swapping spots and the top four having unknown status to the people, the title fell out of use.

Monuments





A Seven Great Powers monument in the Holy Sword Highway,
Millis Continent



In order to spread the name of the seven strongest across the world, stone monuments were scattered around the world in places where
mana
 concentration was high. The monument is of knee-height and a single character "7" is inscribed at the middle in the Fighting God language. The seven respective motifs of the Great Power surround the "7" character starting with the rank one motif being situated above the "7" character then sequentially going clockwise are the rest of the Great Power's motif. The stone automatically updates itself when a new Power enters the ranks with their respective motif.

Trivia

It was believed the Technique God created this system so that he could find people capable of defeating him.

After the
Laplace War
, people began to doubt whether the Technique God even really existed at all.

Even though the Seven Power holders are said to be the absolute strongest of the world, there is further division within the group. The first four ranks (1-4) are referred as the "upper" ranks and the remaining three ranks (5-7) are referred to as the "lower" ranks. There is a very large difference in strength between the fourth (Demon God) and the fifth (Death God).

The ranking only changes when someone on the ranking is defeated or dead. As a result, the ranks are not directly correlated to their combat prowess.

The Technique God holds the #1 position despite
Orsted
 being stronger, because he is missing and not defeated.

Randolph Marianne
 is said to be weaker than the Sword God, Water God and North God due to staying out of combat for a significant amount of time
, yet he still holds a higher rank.

Prior to Demon Dragon King Laplace being split into two different beings, the Seven Great Powers ranking system had not yet been established. As such, Laplace as the Demon Dragon King is not part of the Seven Great Powers, yet takes two separate seats as two different beings after the creation of the ranking system.

Rudeus Greyrat is the only person who does not have the title of "God".

======

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!





The Magic City of Sharia in the Anime



The Magic City of Sharia
 is a human city located at the Kingdom of Ranoa, the largest country of the northern region in the
Central Continent
 where Rudeus settles down along with his family after he became a student at the Ranoa Magic Academy.

Geography





The Magic City of Sharia during Spring



"Far to the north of
here
, is a country called Ranoa."

Roxy
 to
Rudeus

Sharia is located at the northern part of the Central Continent where it frequently snows throughout the year. It is also bordered by the Neris Kingdom in the northwest, Basherant Kingdom in the northeast which are part of the Magic Triumvirate together with the Kingdom of Ranoa. To the south is the
Asura Kingdom
 where it is separated by the Red Wyrm Upper Jaw mountain range and at the far west is the
Holy Land of Swords
.

Background

Aside from the Magician Guild Headquarters being located here, Sharia is mainly built for magical research where the Magic Triumvirate of Ranoa, Neris and Basherant poured tremendous amount of resources to build a grand city at the edge of Ranoa. Technically, Sharia is part of Ranoa but it is intentionally built at the border of Ranoa near the other 2 triumvirates where the Ranoa Magic Academy, Magicians Guild Headquarters and Neris Magical Implements Workshop are merged into the city which makes Sharia the center of the Magic Triumvirate Nations. While the Ranoa Kingdom alone wields the same kind of influence and power as the Shirone Kingdom in the south, the combined forces of the Magic Triumvirate is considered to be the hidden fourth power of the
Human World
.

Economy

Aside from the trading of magical goods between the 3 nations, the Magician Guild have monopoly on the sale and production of magic resistant bricks that are designed to repel mana and even withstand a large-scale magical attack. Due to the magical bricks to be very expensive, even for a wealthy nation like Asura only uses them for its capital and not even the Holy Kingdom of Milis nor Dragon King Realm uses them for their walls. As such, the process of their creation is a well guarded-secret.

Areas

When looking at a map, Sharia's design is based from the city of
Millishion
 in the Holy Country of Millis,
Millis Continent
. Technically, Sharia is part of Ranoa Kingdom but parts of the city are territories of the other nations of the Magic Triumvirate which was done intentionally since the main purpose of Magic Triumvirate alliance and building of Sharia is for research and magical advancement and everything about magic is stored in Sharia.

Student District

Located at the east, the Student District is centered by the Ranoa Magic Academy and is surrounded its facilities and lodgings for students.

Workshop District

Located at the west, the Workshop District are full of artisan workshops and dwellings of its crafters with the Neris Magical Implements Workshop is at the district's center.

Lodging District

Located at the south, the Lodging District which welcomes those entering Sharia, including adventurers and has different kinds of inns to accommodate them depending on their rank.

Commerce District

Located at the north, the Commerce District where stores are lined up side by side separated by the large and winding main road with the Trader's Guild nestled in the middle.
 The Commerce District is also the location of various cafe and restaurants for nobility, reputable Slave Markets, stores for clothes and other necessities.

Points of Interest

Ranoa Magic Academy

Ranoa Magic Academy Emblem in the Manga
1/2

Ranoa Magic Academy is the largest magic university in the world that surpass even the professors of the Asura Royal Academy that occupies a vast tract of land in Sharia that was built for the purpose of magic research.

Magician Guild Headquarters

The Magician Guild Headquarters is located at the center of Sharia where all the magical research are kept such as production of
Magic Tools
 and Scrolls. One of the heads of the Magician Guild is also the principal Ranoa Magic Academy and because of this, graduates of the academy are granted membership and ranks in the Magician Guild depending on their contributions or research submitted while at the academy.

Rankings

Unlike the Adventure Guild's ranking system which progresses on the number of missions completed, the rankings granted by the Magician Guild is more focused on the recognitions and merits of a member's achievement or magical research accomplishments.

Adventure Guild

Like in most major cities, Sharia has an Adventure Guild branch located at the Lodging District. During times of emergency, such as an attack of a Demon Lord, the leaders of the Magic Nations also calls on Adventurers to respond to such emergencies to buy time while their main forces assemble to subjugate the threat.

Slave Market






A Sharia Slave Market in the Manga



Buying and selling slaves is an accepted practice in the
Human World
 although in the
Millis Continent
 and the southern Central Continent, it is a quiet affair but in the nations of the Northern Central Continent like Ranoa, it is legalized and key part of the economy. Sharia has 5 Slave Markets located at the Commerce District where slaves of most races are sold to be bodyguards or even cannon fodders during war.

Rude Mercenary Company Headquarters

The Rude Mercenary Company is a subsidiary of the
ORSTED Corporation
 where its main headquarters is located at the Third Street of the Lodging District and its members are known for their uniform of black coats with a yellow rat emblem which is their symbol of unity along with their manners. Due to Sharia being relatively peaceful,
Aisha
 established the company to be a bodyguard business that is contracted by the Knights of Ranoa, head of the Magician Guild and the Magic Tool Workshop after 14-15 from the start of business and serves as the neutral faction among them.

Magic

In terms of magic, Sharia has knowledge of most spells up to the King Rank in Attack Magic that are held by ranking members of the Magician Guild and taught in the Academy. But in terms of Divine Magic and Barrier Magic, the
Milis Religion
 owns the rights and forbids the teaching the magic until
K420
 where Sharia is granted permission to only teach the basics of Barrier Magic so instead the class is more focused on how to break through barriers.

While teachers of the academy can use and teach Intermediate Barrier Magic, it was illegal to do so and if they got caught, the
Order of the Temple
 would hunt them down and put them on trial.

Military






Unnamed Leader of Sharia's Knight Group(left)



Sharia is protected by a small unit of soldiers from the Magic Triumvirate stationed in the city to protect their magical assets but in times of emergencies that could result to incalculable damage, the rulers of the triumvirate dispatches their knight groups to intercept the threat that is lead by an unnamed captain for the knights stationed at the city.
 The Order of the Temple stands in direct opposition of the Ranoa Magic Academy and everything it represented but are not willing to start a war over it.

Diplomacy

In terms of relationships with other kingoms, Sharia aside from their agreement with barrier and detoxification magic, is neutral to their dealings with the Holy Kingdom of Milis despite the opposition of the Order of the Temple. Due to their focus on magical research, Sharia also values
Rudeus
 from an alternate future as long as he is useful to them even if it could lead to war against Asura Kingdom and Milis Kingdom.

Plot

Volume 22 - Young Man Period - Organization Chapter

He did not actually appear in the volume, but was mentioned by Nanahoshi. Nanahoshi created a hypothesis that he was also summoned to this world, but was summoned into the future where he saved a weak fated Miko that was destined to die. That Miko had the power to rewind an object's time and Akihito possibly saved that Miko and met with Orsted as Nanahoshi did to create a device that would amplify the Miko's power to change the past. If the future is changing the past, the future would take precedence and be the reason why Nanahoshi can't go back to her world since she may have been summoned by Akihito during the Metastasis event so that she can create the Multiverse teleportation device and go back to her world with him in the future. Since her future self that went back with Akihito can't exist if she went back to her world in the present, Akihito's influence interfered with the device when she was attempting to go back home.

In Rudeus's inner monologue, he summarized the details of the proposed future. Akihito collaborated with Orsted and was able to determine the reason why he would be unable to win against Hitogami. Akihito altered the past with the saved Miko's amplified power which may have been the reason Hitogami saw a vision of Rudeus's descendants with Orsted and an unknown man killing Hitogami and that the unknown man might be Akihito. Then in order to go back home, he caused the Metastasis event that summoned Nanahoshi so that she would create the device that would send them back to their world.

Epilogue: Prologue Zero

In the most recent life of the
Rebirth Miko
, he was summoned by magicians using a magic formation that tapped into the Miko's powers as a Hero to save the Kingdom from war. After being summoned, he was the only person in all of the Rebirth Miko's lives to have ever asked for her name. Since a Miko are only called Miko as their name and lose their actual names (Unless they are Royalty), the Rebirth Miko is a special case that has remembered her name to be Lilia. Since Lilia the Miko was the only one capable of understanding Akihito, she was assigned to be his interpreter and freed from her usual constraints as a Miko. He without knowing has made Lilia fall in love with him. During the battle with an enemy Kingdom, he was instantly beheaded and by the time the Lilia found him, 24 hours have already passed and it was too late for her to revive him. In her despair and wishing with all of her power, Lilia opened a rift in time and space in the past so that Akihito and her could not just live, but to live together. That rift created an opening for Rudeus's soul which happened to be near Akihito in the other world to be reincarnated. More of Lilia's power was exhausted to culminate in a rift that caused the Mana Calamity that summoned Nanahoshi to the world. As a result of Akihito meeting Lilia in a previous loop, he caused a change in the world that resulted in the events of what happened in Mushoku Tensei and the exhausting of Lilia's Rebirth Miko powers and Lilia's last life.

Relationships

Family

Rudeus Greyrat

Rudeus Greyrat is the main protagonist of
Mushoku Tensei
 and is Sieghart's father. As a child, Sieghart listened to his father's stories about 'Cheddarman' and being an ally of justice, values he will still bring way later into his older years. Like many of the kids in the Greyrat family, Sieghart deeply respects him but also believes that his father has no expectations of him. This is because Rudeus raises his children freely which the kids misinterpret as him having no expectation for his children when in truth it's actually the opposite. He is simply too lenient in raising his kids, but he still cares deeply for them especially Sieghart during his time being unemployed at home. Sieghart knows nothing of this and as a result, he tends to avoid his father and only talks to him sparingly. He tries his best to please his father by doing what he thinks his father wants and when he fails, he felt that he disappointed him. Sieghart only knew the truth about his father's intentions and feelings after he and his father had a heart to heart the night before Sieghart leaves Sharia to find Pax.

After they both graduated, Pax announces that he will return to Kingdom of the Dragon King, receiving some land and eventually developing it to be it's own independent kingdom. Pax asks Sieghart to join him and help him, but Sieghart silently refuses. They then parted ways. After some time, Sieghart decides to find Pax and assist him with his goals, and they reunite again.

Kalman III

Aleksander Ryback, the North God, took Sieghart in as a disciple since a young age. As his master, Sieghart respects him deeply and takes many lessons from him. Sieghart continues to train with him and eventually receives the title of North Emperor.

Sariel Anemoi Asura

Six-Faced World
===============

The
Six-Faced World
(六面世界
Roku-men Sekai,
 lit. "Hexahedral World") is the setting where
Mushoku Tensei
 takes place. It is a world in hexahedral form where all beings live on its planes. It exists in a die-shaped structure with a total of six faces, each face is constituted of one world ruled by one God each, with another seventh world of nothingness inside the die-structure.

History

In the un-recordable times, before the Six-Faced World was created, there existed the powerful "maker of worlds" simply known as the
God of Creation
 (創造神 -
Sōzō-shin
). He felt he was slowly dying and would not last for much longer, so he tasked himself to create one last world before his time was up. However, he realized he did not have enough power left to build a stable world; the new world that he had created was severely deformed and unbalanced so he decided to create yet another world. It ended up as another distorted world, nonetheless he kept going until he finished making six worlds: the Dragon World, the Demon World, the Beast World, the Ocean World, the Sky World and the Human World, with a seventh Void World of nothingness at the center.

They were all distorted worlds which would soon collapse on its own, so The Creator stuck the six worlds together and was finally able to achieve stability. In this manner he established the Six-Faced World where each world supported the balance of the others. Still not content, The Creator decided to carefully manage the worlds until the inhabitants can settle and stabilize. With his remaining strength, he divided his body into six alter ego's and descended onto their respective worlds.

Soon after, as a result of their divine origins and diligent effort to make their world prosper, the ego's came to be respected as "Gods" by each world's inhabitants. In the Dragon World, it was called the Dragon God; in the Demon World, the Demon God; in the Beast World, the Beast God; in the Ocean World, the Ocean God; in the Sky World, the Sky God; in the Human World, the Human God. At the creation of his new six-sided world, The Creator ceased to exist and from him came the new Gods that came to be known throughout the Six-Faced World.

The Seven Worlds

Dragon World

The
Dragon World
 (龍の世界
Ryū no Sekai
) is the world of dragons ruled by the Dragon God, where the sky and the land are reversed. It was inhabited by a race with enormous power. The
Dragon Race
 were once primitive species who were not able to develop civilization due to their harsh environment and rogue dragons but that soon changed after Human God lent the knowledge of the humans to the Dragon God. The Dragon Race taught inhabitants of the other worlds how to manifest
Battle Aura
.

Demon World

The
Demon World
 (魔の世界
Ma no Sekai
) is the world of demons ruled by the Demon God, full of miasma and noxious mist. It was inhabited races with extraordinary physiques. Similar to the Dragon Race, the
Demon Race
 were once primitive due to their harsh environment where demonic beasts roamed and reliance on their extraordinary bodies, but the world soon changed into an orderly style after the Human God lent the knowledge of the humans to the Demon God. The Demon Race taught inhabitants of the other worlds how to reinforce a weak body in order to use Battle Aura efficiently.

Beast World

The
Beast World
 (獣の世界
Kemono no Sekai
) is the world of beasts ruled by the Beast God, with dense forests and mountains. It was inhabited by races with keen senses and powerful talons. The
Beast Race
 taught inhabitants of the other worlds how to capture and tame monsters and wild beasts.

Ocean World

The
Ocean World
 (海の世界
Umi no Sekai
) is a world of water ruled by the Ocean God. It was teeming with life, inhabited by races with gills, fins and scales. The
Ocean Race
 taught inhabitants of the other worlds how to purify water and methods of storing it.

Sky World

The
Sky World
 (天の世界
Ten no Sekai
) is a world of rocks floating in the sky ruled by the Sky God. It was inhabited by a winged race who flew freely in the sky. The
Sky Race
 taught inhabitants of the other worlds how to study and predict weather.

Human World

The
Human World
 (人の世界
Hito no Sekai
) is a world of flatlands and prairies ruled by the Human God. It is inhabited by a race with weak bodies but brilliant minds. The
Human Race
 taught inhabitants of the other worlds about the importance of reading, writing, communal living, social order et cetera and gave the light of civilization to the races. After the fall of the other five worlds, all the survivors fled to the Human World and settled in their suitable habitats. In this manner, the Human World is now filled with a variety of races.

Void World

The
Void World
 (無の世界
Mu no Sekai
) is a pure white world of nothingness formed when the God of Creation stuck together the six worlds in a die-structure. It later served as the connecting path for moving from one world to another as it is in contact with all the worlds. It is also the channel for summoning and teleport magic. This pocket of space is where
Hitogami
 exists.

Trivia

Earth lies outside the Six-Faced World.

Trivia

In the TV version, when Gyes explain to Minitona the past of Ghislaine, they show that both of the eyes of young Ghislaine are normal, even though it is stated that she was born with the magic eye and she didn't obtain it like Rudeus.

Succession
 (嗣ぐ)
Tsugu
) is the Twenty-fourth and final episode of the
second season
 (48th overall)
Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on June 30, 2024 and also the fifth and final episode of the
Labyrinth Arc
 and Season 2 for the Anime.

Synopsis

After six months, Rudeus returns home to where Sylphy and the others are waiting for him. He talks about what happened in the
Teleportation Labyrinth
, Paul's death, Zenith's condition, and more. He also talks about Roxy... What will Norn, Aisha, and Sylphy's responses be...?

Plot

At Sharia, Rudeus, Roxy, Elinalise, Geese, Talhand, Zenith, Lilia, Shierra and Vierra are walking towards the Greyrat House where Rudeus suddenly starts running and Geese wonders if he really misses his wife that badly. While running, Rudeus realizes what Hitogami's
warning
 that he will regret going to
Begaritt Continent
 meant while concluding that
Paul
's death made him feel sad but not regret.

Rudeus enters the house and calls for Sylphy, but no one comes to greet him in the hall. He then checks the living room and the kitchen, calling their names, but no one is there. Rudeus is in disbelief about what is happening, but he hears footsteps and rushes toward them. He sees Aisha, who is surprised to see him. Rudeus asks Aisha if she is hurt; she answers him but is shocked and questions what happened to his left hand. Rudeus asks about Norn and Sylphy. Just as Aisha answers, Sylphy, who has just entered the house, calls for Rudeus. Sylphy assures Rudeus that everyone is alright, much to Rudeus' relief. As Sylphy welcomes Rudeus with an embrace, the rest of the party arrives outside the door, witnessing the scene as Roxy looks away.

Everyone is then seated at the dining table or the living room in silence until Aisha arrives with Norn from Ranoa Magic Academy who greets Rudeus upon arriving and is relieved to see Zenith. Rudeus begins to talk but Norn asks where Paul is so Rudeus tells him that he passed away while everyone is silent or looks away that leaves Norn in shock. Rudeus then places Paul's gauntlets,
Beloved Sword
,
Short Sword
 and the jar containing his ashes on the living room table. Norn questions how this has happened but Rudeus apologizes, causing Norn to further question him but stops upon seeing Rudeus lost his left hand and tries to contain herself as Aisha holds onto her shoulders. After Rudeus explains events of how
Paul died
 and Zenith has lost her memories, Norn confirms that Rudeus gave his all and begins to cry that no one could have saved Paul if Rudeus cannot as Aisha and Sylphy comforts her.

After Norn finishes crying, she asks if she can have Paul's Beloved Sword to which Rudeus agrees but tells her what it means to hold a sword like Paul told him when he gifted a sword to Rudeus on his
fifth birthday
 that surprises Lilia and Norn gratefully hold onto the sword. To everyone's surprise, Zenith suddenly pick up Paul's gauntlets and embraces it in her chest without saying a word and still having an expressionless face. Still not knowing if Zenith will recover, Rudeus tells everyone that Zenith will be staying with them and Lilia will look after her. Aisha then asks about dividing the chores of the house to which Lilia tells her that they will talk about it later then Norn tells Aisha not to hold back so she embraces Lilia in tears who also returns the gesture.

Outside the Greyrat House, Geese tells Rudeus that the rest of them will be looking for an inn but declines Rudeus' invitation to stay in the house for the night. Rudeus then thanks everyone for helping Paul all this time, to which Shierra wishes they could have been more useful, while Vierra tells him they will still be in town and to inform them where Paul's grave will be placed. Geese then cheers up Rudeus while Talhand tells him that it's Paul who should be the one thanking them, not Rudeus. Elinalise then says she plans to see Cliff but still blames herself for being unable to prevent Paul's death. Rudeus has no intention of blaming her. She then looks at Roxy, tells Sylphy that Rudeus loves her, and takes her leave with Geese, Talhand, Shierra, and Vierra. Rudeus then tells Sylphy he has something to tell her, and after glancing at Roxy, Sylphy accepts, and they go back inside.

Back at the living room, Lilia takes Zenith upstairs while everyone else stays behind. Rudeus then tells them that he wishes Roxy to be his second wife. Rudeus then explains how Roxy
saved
 him from grief after Paul's death. Rudeus then gets down to his knees, bows and apologizes to Sylphy for not keeping his promise. Norn approaches and berates Rudeus on how Sylphy is worried and misses him while he was away. Despite forgiving Rudeus on letting Paul die since he lost his left arm, Norn grabs Rudeus by his collar for his unfaithfulness. Rudeus defends Roxy's action, but Norn isn't having any of it, so Rudeus reminds him of what happened to her when she locked herself up in her
dorm room
. Although Norn is grateful for what Rudeus has done, she is a devout follower of the
Milis Religion
 that does not allow having two wives and points out how Roxy looks younger than her. Roxy tells her that she is a grown woman, but Norn continues to berate Roxy and accuses her of being shameless and taking advantage of Rudeus, causing him to get angry but manages to restrain himself. Roxy then faces Norn and agrees that she has been shameless, apologizes and begins to leave.

Rudeus tries to stop Roxy from leaving in her state, but Sylphy calls out to Roxy first and stops her. Roxy, in tears, turns to face Sylphy. Norn questions Sylphy's action and urges her to let her go, but Sylphy thanks her for worrying and states she can speak for herself. Sylphy then confirms that Roxy helped Rudeus, but Roxy admits she had ulterior motives. Sylphy acknowledges this and says she would not believe otherwise, adding that she would have done the same thing if their positions were reversed. Sylphy tells Roxy that she is aware Rudeus will eventually bring home another woman and has already realized this based on how Roxy looks at Rudeus. Roxy apologizes, but Sylphy brushes it off and tells her how Rudeus always talks about her with praise. This made Sylphy jealous, but after seeing Roxy, she sees her as another woman who loves Rudeus and welcomes her, saying that both of them will be supporting Rudeus from now on.

Outside the house, Rudeus and Norn are sparring with wooden swords. Norn still does not accept what has happened, as Rudeus tells her off for swinging too wildly. Sylphy reminds Norn that Rudeus is not a follower of Milis, and even Paul had two wives. She asks Norn if she would say the same thing to Lilia, who was Paul's second wife. Realizing this, Norn apologizes to Aisha, who had said nothing throughout the entire conversation, and because she offended her. This causes Aisha to mention how Norn does not think before speaking and runs off. Norn gets upset by that statement and chases after her, while Rudeus, Sylphy, and Roxy talk about how Norn feels while waiting for her family to return home. Sylphy then reveals that their child will be born in a month. Roxy tells her she will wait until her baby is born, then she will marry Rudeus.

A month later on a day with heavy snow, Sylphy gives birth where Lilia and Aisha handles the delivery and to her relief, the child does not have green hair, which is why she was bullied in her
childhood
 due to the animosity towards the
Superd Tribe
 who also have green hair. At Sylphy's request, Rudeus carries the baby and he sheds tears of joy after Sylphy tells him that she is their baby.

At the graveyard for nobles, Rudeus approaches Paul's gravestone and after cleaning the snow from it, he pours drinks on two glasses, tells Paul that his child is born and wishes that he could see it and after remembering how Paul protect him with his life, he tells him that their child's name is Lucy Greyrat and he married Master Roxy, like Paul he also have two wives and realizes this is what Paul was trying to tell him back in the Teleportation Labyrinth that Paul knows Rudeus loves Roxy, that Roxy also loves Rudeus and wanted to teach him how to prepare for that. Rudeus then wonders if Paul would think of marrying Elinalise or
Ghislaine Dedoldia
, but realizes that knowing Paul, he wouldn't give it much thought. After reflecting on his life so far in the
Human World
, he realizes that he is still a child with memories of his previous life and now that he has a child, he needs to grow up fast and still make mistakes on the way as he grows up and wonders if this is how Paul did it. After promising Paul he will work hard and finishing his drink, he takes his leave and promises to bring the whole family on his next visit.

As scenes of Rudeus' friends are shown, Rudeus is determined to fulfill his vow of living a life with no regrets.

Summoning Magic

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!





Summoning Magic in the Manga



Summoning Magic
 is a category of Magic that allows its user to summon creatures and transport it to its caster.

Background

Six Faced World Era

Summoning Magic has long existed since the
Six-Faced World
 Era where smaller scales of
Teleport Incidents
 occur that causes
Monsters
 to appear in various worlds causing the
Gods
 of each world to blame and be suspicious of each other. To prevent this from escalating to a war, the
First Dragon God
 forbids the use of Summoning and Teleportation Magic because it might be abused and the
Dragon Tribe
 would take the blame since they are capable of anything without the regard of consequences.

But despite the restrictions, the First Dragon God also assigned
Magic
 Research to each of the Five Dragon Generals and Armored Dragon General
Dora
 is given the research of Summoning Magic. After
Crystal
's death, his research on Teleport Magic is also assigned to Dora where she continue his study on both Magic at a research facility in an unnamed mountain faraway from other cities in the Dragon World in the Dragon World to avoid collateral damage incase of an accident and the researchers working with Dora are the elderly of the Dragon Tribe who are aware that they are at the end of their lifespan and has accepted death should they disappear.

Laplace Wars

During the Laplace Wars,
Perugius Dola
, one of the Seven Heroes who battled Demon God
Laplace
 used Summoning Magic that brings the
Chaos Breaker
 into existence to the
Human World
 that he used as his Fortress in battle. Perugius also summons 11 Spirits to aid him in the war and Laplace was eventually sealed, making Perugius' accomplishments a legend throughout history where the new era is named in his honor, The Armored King Era.

Details

Summoning Magic allows users to call forth creatures or elemental sprites with ease, requiring minimal magical control to learn. However, while it is accessible to most mages, it is difficult to wield effectively due to its reliance on the caster's mana. Summoned beings measure their master’s strength by their mana reserves, growing in power based on how much the caster can provide. These entities are also sustained by the caster's mana, meaning that mages with insufficient reserves risk quickly exhausting themselves or losing control. As a result, although Summoning Magic is easy to learn, it demands immense mana from the master.

**Summoning Magic** is divided into two types: **Fiend Summoning** and **Spirit Summoning**. Fiend Summoning involves calling forth highly intelligent monsters from other realms, offering them compensation such as mana, treasures, or services in exchange for their loyalty and labor. These fiends serve their summoner based on the terms agreed upon, and their power often reflects the summoner’s own mana capacity. On the other hand, Spirit Summoning uses raw mana to create beings called **Spirits**, which are entirely constructed from the summoner’s magical energy. Unlike fiends, spirits have no existence outside of the caster's mana and will, and their strength is directly tied to the caster’s magical reserves. Both types of summoning require minimal control to learn but place a heavy strain on mana, making them easy to access but difficult to fully master.

spirits are like programs which do what they where summoned for

Spells

''Note: This section is under construction and revision''.

Methods to summoning

user must make a summoning circle and than the user must provide magic power to the circle while doing so must image what type and appearance of what they want to summon or the user can make a summoning paper which can summon a specific summon mostly used in battle or when a summoning circle is unavailable

Superd Tribe

Superd
======

Redirect to:
Superd Tribe

Superd Tribe
============

The
Superd Tribe
 are a tribal race of infamous warriors from the
Demon Continent
. Due to the tales of their fearsome rampage without distinguishing ally from enemy in the war four hundred years ago, they are loathed and feared by all races.
 They now reside inside a forest in the Biheiril Kingdom, where they are know as "The Forest People" by a local village.

Background

The Superd were once an honorable warrior race and since the early stage had been subordinates of
Laplace
, a hero of who won the authority back from the
Human
 race and unified the
Demon
 Race. Due to the Superd warrior group's extremely high combat prowess, they became Laplace's elite force who specializes in suprise attacks and night raids which also causes them to be treated with both fear and respect.

During the middle period of the
Laplace Wars
 where the invasion of the
Central Continent
 began, Laplace gave the Superd Tribe spears, commonly referred to as "Devil Spears" which looks like the Superd's own spears but painted in ominous black. Some of the Superd rejected the spears as if they are forsaking their own soul but Ruijerd forces everyone to wield the spears as a sign of loyalty. But they were tricked by Laplace during the war. By using
Demon Spears
 instead of their own natural spears, they went berserk and killed everything in sight, as they could not differentiate between friend and foe.

Appearance

Their distinctive characteristics are their emerald green hair and a unique oval-shaped red gemstone embedded in their foreheads.

They are born with a tail, which eventually hardens and falls to become their spear as they grow up.

Abilities

Third Eye

Similar to the
Magic Power Eyes
, it detects
mana
, such as in living beings.

Spears

Superd are exceptional spearmen known throughout the world. The spears they use are unique in that they are actually their tails. Superd are born with tails which slowly harden as they age until they fall off. Because of this, Superd have a very personal relationship with their spears, considering them their souls.

Longevity

Superd are among the longest living races in the series, remaining in their prime even after over 500 years. It was known that some elders that fought the Second Great Human-Demon War were still alive when Laplace recruited the Superd warriors prior to the
Laplace War
.

Known Superd

Ruijerd Superdia

Luwelia Superdia

Ruiweld Superdia

Luicelia Superdia
 (Half-breed)

Village Chief

Rydelios Superdia

Trivia

Superd are so badly discriminated that the transport fee for them to cross the ocean is drastically higher than other races. It costs 200 Green Ore Coins (￥200,000 or US$2000) to travel from
Wind Port
 to
Zanto Port
, and 100 Royal Notes (￥5,000,000 or US$50,000) to travel from West Port to East Port.

Their culture is similar to the
Migurd
's.

Ruijerd Superdia

Summary

In a far-off land, a Superd slays a creature while looking for someone in particular.

Back in Roa, Rudeus effectively masters the Beast language under Ghislaine's guidance, all for the day when he meets catgirls in the Great Forest; confirming to Ghislaine that he is indeed a Greyrat. Rudeus then confirms he master Battle-God and Demon-God languages, the latter of which was possible by his master Roxy, who sent him a personally crafted textbook for his understanding. While praising Roxy and mentioning the figurine he made of her, Rudeus's stomach grumbles and Ghislaine tries to keep him out of the kitchen while the staff finishes setting up the surprise by asking about his Water Saint magic. Rudeus brings up his strongest spell, Cumulonimbus, and how it would likely flood Roa, that to safely use it would require driving 2 hours out of town to use it. As Rudeus enjoys seeing Ghislaine gets flustered, a maid enters to announce everything is ready.

At the banquet hall, House Boreas greets Rudeus for his 10th birthday party, who fakes crying how happy he is for the celebration having eavesdropped on Eris a short while earlier. But because of how well he acted, he hug Eris in a move to try to calm her down while thanking her; this only makes her blush more. Sadly, Sauros bought his acting too well and declares war on House Notos with the aim to install Rudeus as head. Once Philip had his wife and a couple beast maids calm Sauros, he explains to Rudeus how Paul was disowned by the Notos family, the House Boreas family rival. If they were to learn of Rudeus being fostered in the Boreas house, it could be misinterpreted as them raising the next head of House Notos.

While wanting to avoid a misunderstanding, Philip still starts to becomes conspiratorial planning Rudeus's ascension, until Eris calls attention. Having readied Rudeus's gift, she asks him to guess and he incorrectly guesses his father to be the surprise. However, Paul had to fight a surge in monsters and Zenith had to tend to Norn with a fever, so his family couldn't make it. While Rudes puts on a brave face, internally not surprised circumstances prevented his family's arrival, the Boreas maids and Eris think he's only putting on a brave face. Surprising everyone in the room, Hilda comes up to "comfort" Rudeus feeling sad for his family not coming, and moves to have him wed Eris. Awkward and red, Eris tries to talk herself out of it until Philip simply commands Hilda to tend to Sauros. Philip praises Rudeus's ploy of gaining sympathy from his father and wife.

With that out of the way, Eris invites Rudeus to return to the festivities and the family enjoy hosting his birthday. As they enjoy, Rudeus remembers and cherishes the feeling of family he has around them. Later in the evening, filled from the feast, Rudeus returns to his bedroom, and is rather confused as he finds Eris in his bed dressed in evening wear.

Roxy Migurdia

Rudeus Greyrat

Ruijerd Superdia

Summary

Recalling Roxy's old lessons of how the Superb were fearsome, yet is met by a good warrior with troubled eyes, Rudeus greets him kindly to start a conversation. Rudeus introduces himself and the warrior, Ruijurd Superdia, reciprocates, before asking why Rudeus isn't afraid of him. Moving to sit next to him, Ruijurd confirms he did save Rudeus and Eris, having seen them fall from the sky and killing predators coming at them. Rudeus affirms it would be rude to recoil in fear of his savior, and Ruijurd is surprisingly happy by that, grateful to meet such a strange kid.

As Eris wakes up, she goes into a full panic seeing Ruijurd and apologizes for whatever as she is afraid of being eaten given the stories she was told as a kid. While Ruijurd is unfazed by such a normal reaction, Rudeus feels that people wouldn't be so afraid if they simply talked to him. To get her to change her view, Rudeus plays to her pride to get her to greet Ruijurd, and she gets over her fear of him. As Ruijurd and Eris chat, Rudeus remembers his meeting Man-God in his astral projection. Having been following Rudeus for a while, Man-God wants to help Rudeus with advice and help him along. However, remember false friends form his first life, he refused to believe Man-God until he ultimately decides to go along with it with Ruijurd, but distrusts further involvement.

Around the camp fire, Rudeus updates Ruijurd on how he and Eris came to the demon continent, with Ruijurd noting Almanfi's involvement could mean Perugius's investment in the event. Ignorant to Pergius, Eris gleefully stands up to teach Rudeus, telling the history of humans at war with demon races who served the Demon-God, Laplace, as seven heroes united to face and seal Laplace; three of the heroes survived, Perugius among them. Ruijurd adds that Perugius is adept at summoning, so he likely sent Almanfi to stop whatever unpredictable event was going to happen. Recalling Perugius's name from a story book as a baby, Rudeus grows homesick and worried for his family, liking to believe they're doing OK.

Given the distance traveled, Rudeus and Ruijurd etch a map in the dirt to show Eris how far they travelled from Roa in the Fittoa region of Asura Kingdom; a distance Rudeus calculates to be equal between Las Vegas to Paris in his head. With it being nighttime, Ruijurd tosses them a blanket so they can sleep while he guards. With Eris worried for her parents and Ghislaine, Rudeus holds her close and swears to bring her home. In awe of Rudeus's dedication, Eris gleefully heads to bed leaving everything up to Rudeus. While Eris sleeps, Rudeus vows to bring her home safe, as Ruijurds looks over at him.

Sword God Style
===============

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

"A 『Sword God』 isn't something that you can become simply by memorizing a skill or something, you know? Even though someone special like me didn't get special treatment, why is there a need to treat Sword Saints that way?"

Sword God Gal Farion

Sword God Style
 (
剣神流
,

Kenshin-ryū
)
 is one of the three major schools of swordsmanship, and considered to be the strongest.

Characteristics

The motto of the Sword God Style is "Victory goes to he who moves first."
 This style of swordsmanship emphasizes speed and aggression, focusing on striking down the opponent first. As a result, many practitioners become short-tempered and belligerent. To react swiftly, practitioners are discouraged from wearing heavy armor and are encouraged to wear light clothing for maximum mobility.

Because the philosophy is to defeat the enemy with a single blow, this style usually leaves its users inept at defense with no counterattacks. Consequently, Sword God Style practitioners have difficulty fighting
Water God Style
 practitioners, who are adept at defense and counterattacks.
 Conversely, Sword God Style can overwhelm
North God Style
 because North God Style practitioners mostly rely on the environment to fight.

Known Techniques

Longsword of Light





Ghislaine using Longsword of Light in the Anime



Longsword of Light
 (
光の太刀
,

Hikari no Tachi
)
: The ultimate technique of the Sword God Style.
In this technique, the sword is held steady with both hands, and all the force of the sword is put into a single swing. This technique is extremely difficult to evade or defend against due to the speed of the slash, which can reach the speed of light when fully mastered, and the power to cut a heavy-armoured enemy in half.
The existence of this technique is the reason why Sword God Style is called the strongest of the three schools.

Light Reversal

Light Reversal
 (
光返し
,

Hikari-gaeshi
)
: The only known technical countermeasure against the Longsword of Light.
In this technique, it is a requirement for the user to have exceeding reaction speed; before the enemy's Longsword of Light reaches its maximum velocity, it is countered by the user's own Longsword of Light by cutting off the wrist of the enemy.

Eris Greyrat

Longsword of Silence
 (
無音の太刀
,

Muon no Tachi
, lit. "Longsword of Absolute Silence")
: An advanced technique of the Sword God Style.
This technique is a slower variant of the Longsword of Light where the blade is swung at a velocity beyond the speed of sound. A characteristic of this  technique is that leaves no sound behind.

Arm Chop

Arm Chop
 (
腕落とし
,

Ude Otoshi
)
, fully known as
Sword God Style - Initial Strike
, Arm Chop is one of the basic techniques of the Sword God Style. The user aims at their opponent's forearm to slice it off or if they are wearing armor will break the bones of their arm which in both cases loses their ability to use their weapon on that arm.

Ranks

There are seven ranks in the Sword God Style.

Sword God

The Sword God is the most powerful practitioner of the Sword God Style and leader of the school and as such he oversees training and operations of the school. Practitioners who are of Saintly level and above may call themselves a Saint, King, Emperor or God of the Sword God school. Similar to the system of
Water God Style
, there can be only one swordsman of the God rank while the there can be multiple practitioners who can assume the rank of Sword Emperor and below.

"You've gained the title Sword King, but I already have nothing to teach you. I'll give you the proof of mastery. Though it'd also be fine to jump you straight up to Sword Emperor but... you'd have to fight Ghislaine here. If you want to jump up to Sword God then you'll have to kill me."

Gal Farion to Eris

When a swordsman of the Sword God school defeats a Sword God, he can assume the title of Sword God - the strongest and the head of the school. If the Sword God dies for any other reason, the next strongest of the Sword God school will assume the title of Sword God. Therefore, a generational change of Sword God means a civil war in the Sword God school.

Sword Emperor

Sword Emperor rank is attained when two Sword Kings battle against each other with the Sword God as the witness and the winner is promoted to Sword Emperor.

Sword King

Practitioners with rank Kingly level are granted special titles by the Sword God and is given a Sword from his collection as proof of mastery.
 Judging from
Gal Farion
's sword collection, Ghislaine is the only Sword King before
Eris
,
Nina
 and
Jino
 ascended to the position
.

Sword Saint

A standard Sword Saint is being able to completely control their
Battle Aura
 and to be able to use the Longsword of Light but there are exceptions like Eris who attained this by defeating Jino and Nina despite being unable to use Longsword of Light but still granted the rank by Gal.
 When a Sword God Style practitioner reaches Saint Rank, they are given a dark leather jacket that has a white fur trim collar and a pair of white belts on each end of the sleeve similar to what Gal, Ghislaine and later Eris are wearing
.

, spears are said to be weapons of the devil and long-handled weapons are not favored, and bows with limited attack power cannot be used against strong people due to the existence of
Battle Aura
, so swordsmanship was emphasized and developed.

Three Major Schools

There are three schools of swordsmanship that are mainstream in the human world. Only those who have studied one of the Three Major Schools are called Swordsmen; in other schools, even if they use a sword, they are not called Swordsmen but Warriors.

 during which her hair turned white from
mana
 exhaustion, she became
Princess Ariel
's personal bodyguard under the alias
Fitts
.

Appearance

In her youth, she had short green hair and elfish ears. Her tomboyish appearance initially made Rudeus believe she was a boy.

After the
Teleport Incident
, her hair became white. Although she grew to have a more feminine body, her slender appearance combined with her apparel made her look more masculine. She also now wears white Gloves as her permanent accessory starting from Season 2.

Spoilers

After her marriage with Rudeus, she began to let her hair grow longer and wear more feminine clothing. Due to her elfen heritage, her body ages slower in comparison to humans.

Personality

Due to being constantly bullied, Sylphiette was very shy and meek when she was a child. She was very dependent on Rudeus and she break down crying when Rudeus tells her that he plans to leave to study. After Rudeus was forcefully sent away to act as

' home tutor, she resolved herself to learn and train in order to support Rudeus in the future.

When posing as Fitts, she put up a front as a cold knight in public, appearing silent, serious, and intimidating. She appears to be helpful, reliable and knowledgeable to Rudeus, which in turn made it easier for him to ask her for advice. However, deep down she was still very insecure, too afraid to confess her true identity to Rudeus.

After getting married, she is demure, supportive and accommodating towards Rudeus. As the story progresses, she gradually becomes more confident and assertive. She is deeply loyal towards her friends, but her utmost loyalty lies with Rudeus and the family. She is known as the 'housewife' in the Greyrat household.

Despite being gentle and accommodating towards Rudeus, she is very prone to jealousy towards other women that get close to him, even though she doesn't actively act on it. However, she would readily accept women that truly love and loved by Rudeus into the family.

Background

Childhood

Syphiette is the only child of
Laws
, a half-blood
Elf
 who works as a hunter and her mother who is part
Beast Race
 in
Buena Village
,
Fittoa Region
 in
Asura Kingdom
. When Syphiette was a child, she was always bullied for her being a hybrid and having emerald green hair that is the same hair as the
Superd Tribe
. Her parents tried to protect her such as her mother cutting her hair and making her a stitched pants for her to run away easier while her father petitioned the children's parents to stop targetting her daughter but to no avail.

Plot

Meeting Rudeus






Syphiette successfully learning Voiceless Incantation from Rudeus in the Anime



The bullies would throw mud balls or rocks at her sometimes and kick her too, causing Sylphiette to be resigned to her fate until
Rudeus
 saved her from the bullies and they became friends with Rudeus calling her Sylph. During their time together, Rudeus teaches Sylphy about math, how to read and write and most importantly the use of
magic
, voiceless incantation and everything she wanted to know. Meeting Rudeus is an upheaval of her everyday life causing the bullying to eventually stop and they would play and practice magic together. During their magic practice, it is revealed that her Fire Magic is weaker than her Wind and Water magic because she is afraid of fire unconsciously  because she accidentally burned her hands when she was 3 years old.

When Sylphy sees Rudeus unconscious and tied up by
Paul Greyrat
, she uses a voiceless intermediate ranked magic at Paul who easily avoids it but the speed, power and being a voiceless incantation surprises Paul of what Rudeus has taught Sylphy. Laws tells her the situation and she accepts that they will be apart and continues practicing her spells and training her body as Rudeus did everyday.
 Sylphy tries to get information on where Rudeus went from
Zenith Greyrat
 who refuses to tell her but teaches her
Healing Magic
 and discovers she is able to use voiceless incantation with healing and it is her strong point as well. Sylphiette then approaches
Lilia Greyrat
 to know where Rudeus was taken but like Zenith, she did not tell her anything but taught her etiquette and manners of the nobility. During Rudeus' 10th birthday, Sylphy carves a pendant made from wood to serve as a good luck charm similar to what her father wears to be delivered to Rudeus then the
Teleport Incident
 occurred.

Silent Fitz

Sylphy is teleported on the sky above the Silver Palace and struggles to break her fall with magic and somehow survives with bruises and fractured legs only to immediately battle a
Terminate Boar
 that is about to attack Princess Ariel. Sylphy seeing the boar immediately uses her strongest magic to kill the boar then uses voiceless healing magic on her fractured legs and finally collapses in exhaustion due to expending her mana. Sylphy wakes up and realizes her hair has turned white then is questioned on where she came from and who taught her magic. Despite Syphy's unbelievable story that she is from
Buena Village
 in the
Fittoa Region
 and she learned magic from Rudeus, Ariel insists on Sylphy becoming her new guardian to take the place of
Derrick Redbat
 who died protecting Ariel from the terminate boar and be always by her side to which Sylphy accepts on the condition that she pardon her crime of entering the Silver Palace without permission and help her find her family and friends. As news of the Teleport Incident spread, Sylphy's story becomes more believable and she is clearly not a noble as she only learned some etiquette of the nobility from
Lilia Greyrat
 while trying to find out where Rudeus was taken.

In addition, rumors of the
granddaughter
 of
Sauros Boreas Greyrat
, Lord of Fittoa has changed so much because a boy who tutored her have been circulating, which leads to speculations that  because they are the same age that they were the same person, but also gives doubt on her becoming Ariel's guardian since the Boreas Family supports Prince
Grabell Zafin Asura
's faction. But this doubt comes to an end after Sylphy defeats
Nights Eye Crow
, an assassin known to have slain many nobles for the past decade who attacks Ariel.  After this, her nightmares of falling from the sky after the Teleport Incident also stop. Since she rarely spoke and could use voiceless incantation, eventually Sylphy became known as "Silent Fitts" as he continues to protect Ariel from numerous assassination attempts, eventually leaving the
Asura Kingdom
 with Ariel to study at the
Ranoa Magic Academy
.

On their journey to
Sharia
, Fitts accompanies Ariel with 15 nobles that gets assassinated when one is isolated due to multiple ambushes on the way. The final ambush comprising of around 10 swordsmen, 1 magician and 1 healer at the Red Dragon's Upper Jaw was crushed by Fitts thanks to the chantless magic combat techniques that Rudeus taught her and the ambushes stop after crossing the border. By the time they reach Sharia, Ranoa Kingdom's capital, five of them remained: Fitts, Ariel,
Luke
, and the servants
Elmore Bluewolf
 and
Kleene Elrond
.






Sylphiette confirming that Rudeus is her childhood friend



After entering
Ranoa Magic Academy
, Sylphiette defeats
Linia Dedoldia
 and
Pursena Adoldia
 then along with Ariel and Luke becomes part of the Student Council where they plan to recruit allies in helping Ariel's bid for the throne of Asura Kingdom. Years later, rumors about Quagmire Rudeus begin circulating and Sylphiette confirms that Rudeus is indeed her childhood friend from Buena Village so Ariel leaks the information to Vice Principal
Jinas Halfas
 who sends a letter of invitation for Rudeus to Ranoa Magic Academy.

Achievements

These are current achievements that Sylphiette gained through her adventure, action, and training:

Voiceless Incantation.

Water Saint Class Magician.

Princess Ariel's Personal Guard (Formerly).

Quotes

Sylphiette
: "I will follow Rudi. I do not know what the result will be. We may fall into some serious problems, and may end up being killed by
Orsted
... But even at that time, I'm going to support Rudi. That way we will remain married for life."
 Sylphiette to
Luke Notos Greyrat

Sylphiette
:
"Well I think, I wanted to be like
Eris
."

Rudeus
:
"Eris?"

Sylphiette
:
"Yes. To be able to stand in the same position as Rudy and fight together. On an equal footing, helping each other and protecting Rudy's back. I think I want that kind of relationship."

Rudeus
:
"......"

Sylphiette
:
"But Eris, and also Rudy are so far away that I can never hope to reach it. I've realized this. So, I gave up on this goal and will protect Rudy's back in another way."

Rudeus:
 "What is it Sylphy, my lovely wife?"

Sylphy:
 "Don't stare at Ariel-sama too much or I'll pull your ear."

Sylphy:
 "I know that! But Rudy is moving with the thought of protecting us! For us, to not hold our head down and appreciate his efforts is like exposing our ugly side! I do what I must do, rather than saying anything that would annoy him or cause any misdirection, I take his side because I will support him from behind!"

Luke:
 "If you want to help Ariel-sama, then kill Rudeus. If I said that, what would you do?"

Sylphy:
 "I choose Rudi. I know it's a bad choice for Ariel-sama, but if I'm forced to choose, I cannot turn my back against my husband or my child."

Trivia

Sylphiette's green hair is a result of her having the
Laplace Factor
 in her, which grants her aptitude towards all forms of magic and a large amount of magic power.

Sylphiette's originally green hair
turned white due to the stress
 caused by the Mana Calamity as well as using all of her magic power.

Sylphiette is one of the three Goddesses that Rudeus worships. The blood-stained piece of the sheets from the time when Sylphy gave her virginity to Rudeus to cure him of his ED is kept in a box and enshrined in the basement of the mansion. She is the Goddess of Love in Rudeus' religion.

Sylphy's journey after the teleportation incident greatly differs in each adaptations:

In the
Web Novel
, a long and detailed debate among nobles of Ariel's faction happened before deciding to make Sylphy pose as a male guard magician, and her bond with Ariel began to deepen after Ariel's failed sexual assault.

In the
Light Novel
, Sylphy is quickly made into a guard magician with identity concealed, in order to act as a deterrent.

In the
Manga
, Sylphy lost her memory after crash-landing into the palace, and only regained them when she fought off the assassin Nights Eye Crow.

In the original timeline where Rudeus doesn't exist, she became
Roxy
's disciple and was still discriminated due to her green hair. She became an adventurer and eventually managed to conquer several labyrinths, becoming a world-class Labyrinth Explorer.

Her nickname, Luffy: It's just a nickname using the 3 kana after the first kana in her name (シ
ルフィ
エット/shi-
ru
-
fi
-et-to). Rudy interprets it as "
Luffy
" and connects it to
One Piece
 in his head.

According to Rudeus, Sylphy is submissive in bed, she accepts everything unconditionally, even if it is something very shameful, she will do it.

Her type of Blood is A and her height is approximately 110 cm in volume 1
.

Sylphy ages slower than regular humans due to her 1/4 elven blood. At 74 years old, she looks about 40 years old.

Sylphy has very low tolerance in alcohol, and gets very clingy with Rudeus when she is drunk
.

The origin of her name as the guardian of Ariel "Fitts" (Fitz in Seven Seas version) is from the
Fitts' law
, because it was the first name that the author found when he was searching names starting with "Fi" (フィ).

Mushoku Tensei Novel Volume 1 - Infancy Period

Sylphiette is first seen being bullied for her emerald green hair and getting chased and getting hit by mud balls thrown at her by the village children,
Rudeus
 saw the event and decided to step in to stop the bullies. After chasing them away he then proceeded to wash the mud off her with warm water he made using magic. She was particularly attached to Rudeus and could not bear to be apart from him.

Mushoku Tensei Novel Volume 7 - Youth Period - School Entry Chapter

She is reunited with Rudeus at the
Ranoa Magic Academy
, however he did not recognize her because she was disguised as a boy and her hair had turned white as a result of overusing her magic during the
Mana Calamity
. Then, she was disguised as Fitts-senpai and the bodyguard of
Ariel Anemoi Asura
.

She is known as the [Mystery], the one who was feared between Ariel,
Luke
 and herself. It was said that she had once single-handedly managed a handful of delinquents that posed a threat against Ariel, which caused people to stay away from her.

In the volume, she had been the one to test Rudeus to see if he was truly eligible as a [Special Student] of the
Ranoa Magic Academy
. She had later been shocked by how strong and potent he had become, even though he had only displayed the skill [Rock Bullet].

She is often seen in the library and had many meet-ups with Rudeus there. At the Magic Academy, like Rudeus, she had made use of it to find the reasons behind the
Metastasis Event
, even aiding Rudeus to find out the cause of it. In fact, she even remembers the titles of the books that she has read, showing her intellectual side.

For the most part of the chapter, she is seen trying to make Rudeus remember who she was, as she still held a liking for him. In the end, she helps Rudeus cure his impotency and she becomes his wife.

Before the happenings of the entry into the Magic Academy, she had been teleported to the
Asura Kingdom
 and found herself falling from the sky. In a desperate attempt to soften the blow she cast magic one after another which caused a mana strain, causing her hair to go white. She then coincidentally lands into the place where Ariel was nearly assassinated by a rampaging magical creature and saves her by throwing out a spell.

The incident earns her recognition and she is later promoted to become Ariel's guard, escorting and protecting Ariel until the end of the
Asura Kingdom Arc
 and
Ghyslaine Dedorudia
 takes over her role.

Szilard
=======

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Szilard
 is from the Saint Dragon Tribe and the leader of the Five Dragon Generals who oversees the protection of the Dragon World and its capital city Kayos.

Appearance

At a glance, Szilard can be seen as a leader of his people but not in the apex like the
First Dragon God
 and his most outstanding features is his ephemeral golden eyes, seen in most of the Dragon Tribe but instead of any softness, it shows a strong will laid back on them.
 Apart from being slightly bigger than the rest of the Dragon Tribe, he gives off a different aura and his scales are emerald-silver giving a calm impression.

Personality

Szilard is always calm, decisive and of good judgement even when his opinions are opposed by other Dragon Generals.

Background

The First Dragon God teaches the Dragon Tribe how to use
Dragon Battle Aura
 that allowed them to battle against the dragons that rule over Dragon World and eventually conquer it. Although the First Dragon God is powerful, he is not omnipotent and there are places out of reach as well. Thus, from the Dragon Tribe, he chose the 5 most powerful individuals to be the Dragon Generals whom he entrusts with protecting the Dragon World and Szilard is one of them who are loyal to the First Dragon God.

Szilard is the leader of the
Five Dragon Generals
 and is responsible for the entire Dragon Tribe but most of his duties is in the capital city of Kayos and is in charge of the Dragon Warriors. In a sense making him the Second-in-Command in the Dragon World when the Dragon God is away and during meetings, its usually Szilard who summarizes of the opinion of the Five Dragon Generals and offer his best judgment.
 Like the rest of the Dragon Generals, Szilard also has a unique emblem that resembles the Dragon God's emblem with some alterations.(see photo above)

Plot

Szilard greets the First Dragon God who just returned from the Demon World and brings Laplace with him. Although he is wary of
Laplace
, he didn't question the Dragon God's decision to raise him. On the meeting regarding
Crystal
's death, Szilard concludes that a gold dragon could not kill a Dragon General and considers the possibility that someone with the power of the Eight Demon Kings could possibly kill him. Despite volunteering himself to find Crystal's killer, Szilard did not oppose the idea of Laplace volunteering as well.
 Szilard greets Laplace who has just returned to Kayos after capturing
Necrolia Nacrolia
 and commends him for his work along with the Dragon Warriors and takes over the custody of Nacrolia for interrogation since he can understand Demon God language.

"Dragon God-sama, we are of one will, let's invade Demon World immediately and let them receive the just reward fro what the Five Dragon Generals have suffered."

-Szilard

Szilard attends another meeting with the rest of the Dragon Generals at the Dragon God's mansion and after Laplace conludes his report, Szilard confirms that Necrolia indeed killed Crystal under orders from the
Demon God
 to stop the Teleportation Research for the Dragon Tribe and confirms that Necrolia is already executed. After the rest of the Dragon Generals voices their opinions, Szilard summarizes their recommendation to invade the Demon World but the Dragon God chooses to negotiate with them. Like the rest of the Dragon Generals, Szilard is reluctant with the Dragon God's decision but still asks that Laplace be rewarded for his efforts on capturing Crystal's killer to which the Dragon God names him to be Crystal's successor as Dragon General. Although shocked by the Dragon God's word, Szilard acknowledges Laplace's loyalty to the Dragon God and praises him for accomplishing his mission.

When the Dragon God's child is born, Szilard announced that a parade will be held at Dragon Roar Mountain which is a grand celebration that lasted for decades and like the rest of the Dragon Generals, Szilard is also impressed by the child and left with a solemn expression.

You are more gracious to Lunaria than anyone else. Everyone acknowledges your loyalty to the Dragon God. You cannot cause that tragedy."

Szilard to Laplace

A few days after Lunaria's death, Szilard and the rest of the Dragon Generals holds a meeting where Szilard reports his list of suspects that are from the other worlds like
Pudoria Dordia
 and
Kirisis Calisis
. Szilard notices that Laplace has gone pale after giving his report then assures him that none them believe that Laplace could have done this much to his relief.

Szilard and the rest of the Dragon Generals accompanies the First Dragon God as he battles and defeats the Gods of the Beast World, Ocean World and Sky World one after another and resulting to the destruction of each world just by the power of the First Dragon God and the Five Dragon Generals.
 But for the Demon World, which is comparable in fighting strength with the Dragon Tribe and in addition, the Eight Great Demon Kings matched strengths with the Five Dragon Generals so the full force of the Dragon World's Dragon Warriors is brought to wage war on the Demon World. The war between the Dragon World and Demon World lasted for decades where one world manages to defend their world and launch a counter offensive on the other's world but are forced to withdraw after faltering.

The stale mate lasted until the Eight Demon Kings were defeated by isolating them one after another and causing the Demon God to finally appear in battle. After the First Dragon God defeats the Demon God, the Dragon Generals brings him back to the Dragon World as the Demon World's destruction begins.

Tallhand
 (
タルハンド
,

Taruhando
)
 also known as
Talhand The Clifftop
 (
厳しき大峰のタルハンド
,

Ikameshiki Taihō no Taruhando
)
 is a short rugged
dwarf
 magician used to be in
Paul Greyrat
's party before
Rudeus
 was born.

Appearance

Like all dwarfs, Talhand is short compared to other races. He also has a long orange beard that reaches below his waist that are split in two by dark bracers.

He is always seen clad in dark armor, gauntlets and helmet with a white robe underneath his armor.

Personality

While Talhand shares similarity with all dwarves that likes rock and iron, alcohol and admiration for blacksmiths and builders, he is considered a maverick among dwarves due to his unconventional thinking and stubbornness. He learned water and wind magic that are frowned upon by dwarves, and refused to conform to the traditional dwarven mindset of blacksmithing and crafting but he is very devoted towards people he trusts and admire especially towards his younger brother
Godbard
. But when Godbard also ostracized him, he leaves the village and finds it hard to trust other people. Furthermore, his attraction to men more than women made him struggle to join any
Adventurer
 party.

Background

Talhand is the 37th of 51 siblings born in the Dwarf Village which has a culture that all children of the same generations are grouped together like a school.

Talhand is close to his 38th sibling, Godbard and to support him, Talhand offers to focus his studies on Water and Wind Magic to become his right hand man when he becomes the next Ore God. Godbard agrees and also thinks that the adult dwarves are too hard headed on their tradition that dwarves to practice Earth Magic for generations. Talhand delightfully advance his studies on water and wind magic at the scorn of his other siblings. When the day for Godbard to become Ore God has come, he did not select Talhand. Talhand argues with Godbard that he studied learning wind and water magic to support him but Godbard rebukes him after losing to a blacksmithing competition so Talhand leaves the village next day on the succession ceremony of the new Ore God.

Talhand began his travels as an
Adventurer
 and is always alone. Due to his incident with Godbard, he could no longer bring himself to trust other people, cladding himself in armor and resigning to the role of a Magic Knight, believing that adventuring wouldn't be too hard. When Talhand reaches Rank B Adventurer, he is approached by
Elinalise Dragonroad
 and they begin to occasionally work together because of Elinalise's abilities being a fast warrior and heavily armored mage. Talhand and Elinalise meshed well together despite finding her irritating because of her advances. Neither of them talked about forming an official party until
Paul Greyrat
 brings them together with
Ghislaine Dedoldia
 and
Geese Nukadia
, and so Talhand becomes one of the members of the
Fang of the Black Wolf
, a party of outcasts from their own town.

Summary

In the Forest to slay a monster, Rudeus's pause to help fellow Adventurers results in one of them dying, compelling Ruijurd and Eris to jump in and slay the monsters attacking them. After Rudeus slays the Executioner as Ruijurd and Eris slay the Anaconda, Kurt is thankful for the rescue. Ruijurd demands Rudeus's reason for waiting so long when the could have saved Gablin, but knowing he waited to try and garner more glory builds on the guilt in his heart as his focus on profit allowed Gablin to die. However, Kurt intercedes siding with Rudeus as his team were the adventurers on mission, thus Gablin's death sits on Kurt's shoulders being the party leader. Hearing Kurt, Ruijurd apologizes and acknowledges them as warriors, stating his view on the ideal of honor as he apologizes to Rudeus in the misunderstanding that he was protecting their honor as adventurers. Despite Ruijurd's kind words, Rudeus's guilt still lingers inside, thinking only of profit and advancement while viewing the situation as a game.

Thinking how his past self would be fine getting away with the "good ending", Rudeus cannot help but quietly hate himself for allowing someone to die. After parting ways with the other adventurers, Team Dead End ventured further into the forest and found the remains of another adventurer team they met earlier. The culprit was revealed to be a Red Hood Cobra, an A-Rank creature that made the forest its home. Despite the cobra's evasiveness, Dead End succeeded in killing it and claimed materials from the remains before heading back to the guild. Tired from the events of the day, Rudeus just wants rest but is met by Nokopara, who found out that Rudeus traded jobs with the Peahunter team, forcing a confession from Jalil when he took Vizquel hostage. Nokopara demands a monthly fee for his silence, as quest trading is grounds for revoking their license. But in a plan to sacrifice their licenses to escape, Rudeus orders Ruijurd to carry him and Eris out once he floods the city.

After failing and quitting all his past life, Rudeus just wants to live his second life to the best he can, but Ruijurd splashes his head to reveal his green hair. Not wanting Rudeus to dirty his hands, Ruijurd exposes himself as a real Superd, causing immediate panic in the city. As Jalil and Vizquel disavow them, citizens scream in fear, and Kurt is afraid despite being saved earlier in the forest, Rudeus doubts he'll ever be able to mend their reputation. Once Ruijurd threatens to kill Nokopara if their adventurer licenses are revoked, he flees leaving Rudeus and Eris, who chase after him; Kurt realizing that they knew Ruijurd was a Superd. With Ruijurd scapegoating himself to allow Rudeus not to shoulder more blame, Rudeus breaks down crying as the city continues to panic.

Teleport Incident
=================

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

Lilia and Aisha during the Teleport Incident

Ghislaine caught in the Teleport Incident
1/3

The
Teleport Incident
, also known as
Metastasis Event
 is a
Mana
 calamity that occurred in the
Fittoa Region
,
Asura Kingdom
 in
K417
 which resulted to its citizens to be teleported to random locations on the world.  The incident caused an innumerable amount of casualties and the first turning point in
Rudeus Greyrat
's life in the series.

Prelude

"I'm not sure. That's discovered three years ago but its not something bad... It's better to think that way."

-Sauros to Rudeus





Red Orb appearing above the Boreas Estate



Since the era of the
Six-Faced World
, numerous teleportation incidents has already occurred but in a smaller scale which is also one of the reasons why there is animosity between the worlds because of suspicions of one world might be invading the other for the disappearance of their people or appearance of monsters. But according to the
Dragon Tribe
 researchers' hypothesis: a power possessed by every living creature permeates the Six Worlds which is called
Dragon Battle Aura
 by the Dragon Tribe while the Demons call it
Mana
 or Magic Power that is said to maintain a natural equilibrium within the Six Worlds. However, the power of the Six Worlds suddenly declined, creating significant imbalances. If the power diminishes significantly in one world, it'll absorb power from another world to compensate which results to the teleport incident, causing not only trees and animals but also people to disappear.

Although Teleportation Magic is forbidden by the First Dragon God because it may trigger a war, research is still conducted by all beings of the Six Worlds. For Dragon Tribe, this research is assigned to
Crystal
 and later inherited by
Dora
. The research is conducted by the older members of the Dragon Tribe since they are near the end of their life in a facility faraway from the rest of the denizens of the Dragon World so other cities will be unaffected incase of accidents. The First Dragon God plans to share the research to the other worlds to prevent anymore teleport incidents but this did not happen because of the war that lead to the destruction of the other worlds except the
Human World
.

In K412, a red orb appears floating above the Boreas Estate in
Roa
 and there is no known history recorded of such occurrence in the past. In a conversation with Rudeus,
Sauros
 tells him that it's not a bad thing and that it is better to be left at that. Five years since its appearance, Rudeus notices that the orb seems to be getting bigger but overall the daily life and activities of Roa's citizens goes on.

Cause

The cause of the Teleportation accident was actually the result of events taking place roughly 80 years in the future. At this time, a certain nation was embroiled in a war and used the power of an individual known as the "
Playback Miko
" to summon
a boy from another world
, who was prophesied to be their savior. The Miko would grow close to the summoned hero and eventually develop feelings for him. Unfortunately, the boy was actually just an ordinary human and he ended up dying when the country forced him onto the battlefield. Overcome with grief, the Miko burnt out her power, to bend time and space, to alter the world to one where she and the boy might live happily together.

To successfully alter history, the Playback Miko reached out with her power and found an individual with similar feelings for the boy as herself:
his girlfriend
 from his original world. She then attempted to summon her to her current location, the Fittoa Region, roughly 80 years in the past. The Miko's hope was that this would allow her to set things up so that the boy would not have to die. Unfortunately, the world itself fought back against the Miko's attempt to alter fate, and thus nothing happened initially. However, the Miko's attempt to summon someone from another world opened up a rift in space from which the soul of
a recently deceased individual
 emerged and was reincarnated into the world.

Due to the reincarnated individual not being from this world, the world's resistance to the Miko's power began to wane as he grew and began to influence the fates of those around him. As a result, the void eventually became visible to the naked eye in the form of a floating red orb. Eventually, the world could no longer hold it back and the rift fulfilled its purpose by successfully summoning the boy's girlfriend into the world, causing the Teleport Incident in the process.

Manifestation

In K417, huge amounts of mana gather around the orb and looking like a storm with eight eyes.
Orsted
 and
Kishirika Kishirisu
 senses the gathering of mana and mobilizes to find the source.
Perugius Dola
 aboard his Sky Castle notices the mana resembles the light of summoning and considers the possibility that someone could be seeking to undo the seal on
Laplace
. Perugius then commands
Almanfi
 to investigate the source of the mana and kill any suspicious persons on sight. At this time, Rudeus,
Eris
 and Ghislaine are outside of Roa to test out his new staff,
Aqua Heartia
 that Rudeus received on his tenth birthday from Eris the day before. Almanfi attacks them but Ghislaine fights him briefly and assures him that they have nothing to do with the incident. As the magic activates, Almanfi teleports out of the area then a pillar of light lands and expands at high speed, enveloping anyone it touches and teleports them randomly all over the world.

Casualties

Due to the Teleport Incident massively affecting the Fittoa Region, the definite number of casualties and missing are nearly impossible to account for. The Refugee Camp of the Fittoa Region has a list of missing and dead while adventurers and former adventurers alike search for the missing and coordinating with adventurer's guilds in the continent.

Known Casualties:

Philip Boreas Greyrat
 and
Hilda Boreas Greyrat
 are teleported to a
Strife Zone
 with
Ghislaine
. By the time Ghislaine reaches them, they are both already slain.

Laws
 and his wife are reported to have died and it took a heavy toll on Sylphiette who is in Sharia after joining Ariel.

Aftermath

"This much is certain. Originally I suspected Laplace or someone associated with him, however... Summoning her over is impossible even for me. In that case, it shouldn't be possible for anyone of this world... I suspect it's not man-made. It just happened by chance."

Rudeus and Eris are teleported to the
Demon Continent
 and is saved by
Ruijerd Superdia
 who accompanies them on their journey back to Roa and joins the
Adventure Guild
.

Sylphiette
 is teleported to the Asura Kingdom where she becomes
Ariel Anemoi Asura
's bodyguard as Fitts and accompanies her to
Ranoa Magic Academy
 after she left the kingdom.

A
Knight
 who is barely outside the zone of area affected by the teleportation, reports what happened to the nearest town, and the report was spread throughout the Asura.

The King of Asura also hears of the news and assigns the Asura Magic Division to investigate which also clears Sylphiette from suspicion that she is a spy.

Roxy Migurdia
 joins
Elinalise
 and
Tallhand
 to search for Rudeus in the Demon Continent.

Paul Greyrat
 and
Norn Greyrat
 are teleported to the Southern Regions of the Asura Kingdom. Alphonse, Butler of the Boreas Greyrat Estate recruits him and he joins the search group for his family and other missing citizens of Fittoa.

Paul and Norn eventually goes to
Millishion
, Holy Kingdom of Milis and asks support in the search effort from Countess
Claire Latreia
 who immediately agrees after learning Zenith is among the missing. With no news of his families' whereabout, Paul sinks into depression and spends his days drinking until he reunites with Rudeus at Millishion.

Zenith Greyrat
 is teleported to the
Teleport Labyrinth
 where Rudeus, Roxy and members of the
Fangs of the Black Wolf
 would eventually rescue her but she has become unresponsive.

Lilia Greyrat
 and
Aisha Greyrat
 are teleported to the Shirone Kingdom and are imprisoned
Pax Shirone
. Rudeus, Eris and Ruijerd rescues them with aid from
Zanoba Shirone
 after learning that Rudeus is the creator of the Roxy figurine he likes.

Nanahoshi
 is summoned to the Asura Kingdom grasslands and was saved by Orsted, eventually travelling together since she is unaffected by the curse on Orsted.

Nobles who has a grudge on Sauros like Pilemon and the Second Prince's faction schemes on eliminating Sauros

Sauros Boreas Greyrat is blamed for the calamity and is executed.  He is succeeded by James Boreas Greyrat

Alphonse
 takes charge on managing Roa, now converted to Fittoa refugee camp and its refugees rescued from the teleportation. He proposes that Eris becomes
Pilemon Notos Greyrat
's concubine.

Ghislaine returns from the Strife Zone and works on the Fittoa refugee camp. She proposes Eris should be with Rudeus or run away together.

Rudeus, Syphiette and Nanahoshi begins research to uncover the truth of the incident as this has never happened before according to Orsted.

Sylphiette asks Perugius who is behind the Teleport incident but he responds that its not man-made and just happened by chance.

Nanahoshi theorizes that
Hitogami
 is involved with the red orb's appearance when Rudeus was 5 years old during the time he grew closer to Roxy and Sylphiette and the incident itself happening a day before Rudeus is about to sleep with Eris.

Nanahoshi also theorizes that her being summoned and Rudeus' existence is to set in motion the events for the future where Rudeus' descendants will ally with Orsted to kill Hitogami and suggests that Rudeus consult with Orsted.

Despite being protected by a strong fate, the situation of the people affecting Ariel on becoming the
Asura Kingdom
's queen has been altered from Orsted's knowledge of the original history such as:
:

Derrick Redbat
 who is supposed to persuade Perugius on backing Ariel to become queen, dies while protecting Ariel from a terminate boar and is succeeded by Syphiette.

Luke Notos Greyrat
 marrying Eris and both becoming Ariel's bodyguards who will protect her from numerous assassination attempts and eventually becoming queen does not occur.

With Eris being Ariel's bodyguard, Sauros and Philip are suppose to join Ariel's faction but this does not occur due to their deaths.

After being saved by Ariel,
Tristina Purplehorse
 is supposed to testify as a live witness against
Darius Silva Ganius
 on being kidnapped then forced to become his sex slave and causing his downfall goes missing.

Rudeus and Zanoba borrowed a section of land in Fittoa from the Boreas Family where they build a research lab that has a teleportation circle to Zanoba's Workshop since it is unlikely anyone can discover the lab and there, they created
Anne
, the first automaton of the SS Anne Series that resembles Nanahoshi.

To prepare for the upcoming return of Laplace and war he will start, Ariel issues a decree that removes Teleportation magic from being a "Forbidden Technique" and uses her influence and charisma to sway the opposition and eventually became law regardless.

Rudeus informs Cliff and the Miko of Memory that he plans to build Teleportation Circles but they are extremely troubled since the Milis Religion designates Teleportation Magic to be the ultimate forbidden technique.

Rudeus creates a large teleportation grid all over Asura Kingdom despite strong opposition of the citizens of Asura Kingdom

At the minimum, The Holy Kingdom of Millis did not allow Rudeus' plan to have teleportation magic in the country;
Cliff Grimoire
 and the
Miko of Memory
 protected him from trouble with the
Milis Religion

Although Nanahoshi did the research of the teleportation that is sponsored by Rudeus, Only Rudeus is blamed by the nobles, merchants and the priests of the Milis Religion and he become known as <The Person who broke the Taboo>.

Bell
 who lives in the Fittoa Region's countryside obtains exceedingly good results at a newly built school in Fittoa and is recommended to study at the
Asura Royal Academy
 where her village organized a fund raising campaign for her travel expenses and plans to serve under the Feudal Lord of Fittoa further the development of her village. Bell would eventually become the best friend of
Christina Greyrat
 in the academy and graduate becoming a civil official under the Feudal Lord.

Trivia

Despite the random nature of the teleportation; Rudeus and Eris, Paul and Norn, Lilia and Aisha were teleported to the same place together because they are in physical contact with each other before they are teleported.

Monsters of the Teleportation Labyrinth using the Teleportation circles to replenish their numbers
Teleport Labyrinth in the Anime
1/2

The
Teleportation Labyrinth
 (転移の迷宮) is an S-ranked labyrinth located beneath the desert of the
Begaritt Continent
 that is accessed by a cave of a cliff north of the city of
Rapan
.

Background

"There is a theory that the
ancient demons
 gave birth to these Labyrinths and their creatures in a quest to create a paradise for themselves."

-
Perugius Dola
 to Rudeus





A group of Tarantula Deathlords guarding the Teleportation Circles



Like all Labyrinths near Rapan, the Teleportation Labyrinth is formed by ants that ate the remains of a gigantic
Behemoth
, previously slain by
North God

Kalman II
 and his group. The mutant descendants of these ants dig tunnels beneath the Behemoth's remains that eventually became Labyrinths where monsters became attracted to it because of their concentration of
Mana
 and due to the labyrinth having numerous Teleportation Circles, it became known as the Teleportation Labyrinth.

As with all Labyrinths, the Teleportation Labyrinth has its Magic Crystal located at the Seventh Floor where its monsters tend to kill or take intruders captive into the Magic Crystal where they become the "heart" of the Labyrinth that distribute Mana to all its inhabitants and allowing it to function. The mana that flows through these captives trapped in the Magic Crystal causes them to lose their memories, but their body is also infused with a mysterious power which turns them into a
Miko
 or
Cursed Ones
.

Geography





The Teleportation Labyrinth, located north of Rapan



The Teleportation Labyrinth is located north of the Rapan that takes 1 day or half day depending on how fast to travel there
 where the entrance looks nothing more than a cave on the outside and makes it look like a hole in the side of a cliff. But seeing it in person gives the sense that there is a labyrinth within it because of the unsettling air to it.






Rudeus' party preparing to enter the cave of the Teleportation Labyrinth



As such, a large clan consisting of several Adventurer
Parties
 tend to divide their group into 2 roles: The main group that explores the Labyrinth, while the second group, sometimes referred to as the support group set up camp and wait outside for emergencies or supplies. But for the case of the Teleportation Labyrinth, the support team returns to Rapan due to its closeness and prepares the supplies from there.

Book

"Yeah, it's amazing Paul. If the things written in this are real, then clearing up to the sixth floor is already easy."

Geese to Paul

To assist in the exploration of the Labyrinth, Rudeus borrowed a book from the
Ranoa Magic Academy
 Library titled: «An Exploratory Account of the Teleportation Labyrinth» which records the previous attempts of
adventurers
 on exploring the Labyrinth. Rudeus previously used this book to also investigate the magic circles which could give further information on the
Teleport Incident
 but due to Teleportation Magic being considered taboo, he left out details about the teleport magic circles and even consider this to be fiction or that it could be another labyrinth.
 The book contains detailed information about the Monsters on each floor including their sketch and a diagram of each Teleportation Circle and their functions whether its a one way or two way teleportation that would take days of exploring each floor with out the book otherwise.

Overview






Rudeus' party using a Teleportation Circle to transfer to the Second Floor



The Teleportation Labyrinth is a seven floor labyrinth where each floor is connected by a teleportation magic circle. The labyrinth is full of teleportation traps.

The architecture of the first three floors is similar to an ant nest, with curving tunnels, complicated passages and dead ends that is also written in the «An Exploratory Account of the Teleportation Labyrinth» but is confirmed by
Adventurers
 who previously explored the first 3 floors through trial and error. Starting from the fourth floor, the architecture is similar to the ruins of the
Dragon Tribe
.

In
K423
, The labyrinth was cleared by
Paul

Summary

While Rokari hopes Rudeus and company stay a little longer, they bid farewell to continue their journey, and Rowin gifts them funds and a sword for Eris as thanks for telling them of Roxy's well being. Curious, Rudeus asks and learns Roxy left the village 20 years ago as she was born without the Migurdian telepathy, shocking Rudeus to realize Roxy is his (mental) age of 44. After Rokari wished them well, Rowin angrily tells Rudeus to not call him father. Eatting by a campfire later on, Rudeus is thankful for the hospitality but shifts focus to how he's just standing behind his capable fighter friends Eris and Ruijurd.

As the approach the crater city of Rikarisu, Rudeus uses erath magic to give Ruijurd a stone helmet to get past the guards, on the look out for "Dead End" who Rudeus learns is actually Ruijurd. To hide his identity, Rudeus dyes Ruijurd's hair earthy red as they register at the Adventure's Guild, with the membership inside laughing at their declaration that he's the infamous Dead End. Now with his identity concealed as a Migurdian in attempt to link "Dead End" to a heroic party name, they register their team name and Eris is overjoyed to be an adventurer. As newcomers, they are slated at F-Rank at the bottom, and exit the tavern having finalized their registration. Looking at request, senior member Nokopara jokingly suggests a lost pet job for the newbies since Superds have radar vision.

Not wanting to do too much in one day, Rudeus instead has his team take their leave. However, as Ruijurd is about to get in a fight with a crass senior member, Nokopara tells his contemporary to let them be. Outside, Ruijurd is reassured by Rudeus everything is working to his plan, and Eris also reassures as Rudeus is amazing in her eyes. Confident, Ruijurd apologizes for his doubts and agrees to follow Rudeus's lead. Rudeus hugs the two in affirmation, thinking how he cannot betray their trust and devoted to finding a solution to get home. Meanwhile, Nokopara sees them from afar with a scheming smirk across his horse face.

Rudeus Greyrat

Ghislaine Dedoldia

Summary

Easily deducing Thomas to be responsible, Philip had him arrested for his attempt top sell Eris to a lecherous noble, and has had him replaced with Alphonse. However, seeing Philip's face covered in bandages, Sauros arrived with praise for Rudeus and Alphonse informed him of Sauros's beating up Philip in an overly emotional state. Calmly, Sauros asks Rudeus to teach Eris, but stops himself from accepting as he realizing Sauros has spoiled Eris by doing things for her. Thus if Rudeus does accept, then Eris wouldn't really be learning from him if all she has to do is ask her grandfather. To ensure Eris focuses on learning, Rudeus requests that Eris directly ask for his mentorship. Although angry at Rudeus's refusal, Sauros can't argue with the logic and calls Eris down, with enough strength to nearly deafen his beastkin maids. Once she has arrived, Sauros orders Eris to ask Rudeus herself to teach her, so she stands like a cute catgirl to ask Rudeus to teach her.

Rudeus blacks out for a second thinking that didn't just happen, but finds it really did and is terrified by an otherwise cute pose as Eris's face is otherwise raging. Looking to Sauros for help, the grandfather instead fawns over his granddaughter as Philip directs her to stick out her hips more. Exasperated, Rudeus looks at the beast maids and realizes the men have an affinity for them- compared to Paul who loves large breasted women. Sauros then asks Rudeus if he accepts, since Eris took a pose of humility to ask, with Rudeus still screaming no at him. During combat training, Ghislaine voices her being impressed at Rudeus telling Sauros no and making him stop doing that to Eris.

Over the next month, Rudeus tutors Ghislaine and Eris in magic and math, while he also improves in minor margins in combat training under Ghislaine's teachings. The only progress on that front is Eris showing an aptitude in combat and beating him up. When walking by her room and hearing Eris practice her magic, Rudeus remembers his first attempt with water magic and finds Eris setting her room ablaze. Eris shows an ability for magic and combat, but struggles with mathematics and reading. When Eris voices frustration, Ghislaine talks about her old adventurer days and after the team broke up when Paul and Zenith got married, she struggled with trying to be on her own. With additional details, she summarizes that she needs to learn math and reading to not repeat her mistakes, impressing Eris to be invested and improves on her studies. As Eris improves, Rudeus can't help but think of how Roxy and Sylphy are doing. When grading Eris's improving scores, Rudeus finds she is increasingly upset, then checking the calendar does he find he has been a failure of a teacher.

However, when Zanoba shows Julie Rudeus' sculpture of Rujierd, Rudeus asks about the sculpture of Roxy that he had also made. Zanoba is forced to admit that in his first year, he lost a duel to Linia and Pursena, who destroyed the sculpture. Angered at this slight against Roxy, Rudeus defeats Linia and Pursena in a fight and confines them in his room, but leaves them tied up for so long that they wet themselves, forcing him to clean them up. He then consults with Fitz on the best way to punish them without creating a grudge, and Fitz comes up with the idea to prank the beastgirls by forcing them to wear embarrassing face markings for one day. Linia and Pursena leave with a grudging respect for Rudeus after learning he trained under Ghislaine, and Rudeus spends some time alone with Fitz. Fitz considers removing her sunglasses to show Rudeus her face, but decides against it.

Summary

Back in Buena village, Zenith calls to babies Norn and Aisha to crawl to her. While Aisha gets to Zenith first, Norn starts a tantrum over it until Zenith encourages her daughter to keep going, and both babies are finally held; Zenith thinks to herself how she's come to see both as hers even if Aisha is Lilia's. When Lilia tries talking with Aisha, a sleepy Norn has them go to nap time, and Zenith looks at Paul angrily, remembering how he got Lilia pregnant despite her own pregnancy. As Aisha naps with Lilia and Norn with Zenith, Zenith recalls her following the teachings of Millis, such as monogamy. Even though the two weren't believers themselves, Zenith felt a massive betrayal when they had Aisha, she came to forgive them because of Rudeus's fear of losing his family, even though Rudi won't see them for five years. Hearing Paul's childish pleas, Zenith relents when Paul brings up Rudeus and how they should have a tight family for when he returns. When the two hug, Norn starts crying just as Paul is romancing a kiss with Zenith and she invites Paul to help change Norn's diaper, enjoying their family bonding.

Rudeus Greyrat

Summary

Rudeus still remembers how he was in his previous life, and is afraid of leaving the house for fear that his new life will be revealed a dream. However, when Roxy takes him and they both mount Paul's Horse, Caravaggio, Rudeus finally overcomes his fear of the outside world. His social fears and insecurities melt away as passersby greet Roxy and he questions why he never left before. When Rudeus and Roxy arrive to a desolated area, Roxy tells him the chant of the Saint Level Magic, Cumulonimbus, and tells him that he must maintain the magic for an hour. Using his knowledge of climate from his previous life, Rudeus was able to easily self-sustain the magic so he need not keep his arms up. After Roxy sees this, she decides that Rudeus passed the test, causing Rudeus to feel he has finally accomplished something the first time in both lives. Upon returning home, Roxy decides that it was her time to leave to polish her magic skills. She gifts her Migurdian pendant to Rudeus that it may help him someday should he be in trouble with a demon. Roxy tells him that if he really wants to improve his magical aptitude, that he should go to Ranoa university of magic. After she left, Rudeus felt the most utmost respect for her for her getting out of the house. Ironically, he also silently apologized in his mind for still having the panties that he stole from her.

Mushoku Tensei

manga adaptation
.

Cover Characters

Eris Boreas Greyrat

Summary

As the group stays at the Wolf Claw Inn, Eris bathes while recalling a talk she had with Ghislaine in Roa before the mana calamity. After a session in sword training, and Eris talking about developing a figure like her mother, she inquired of Ghislaine of her being strong, with the Sword King noting how Eris and Rudeus are a good team pairing. When Eris wanted Ghislaine to join her and Rudeus on adventures, Ghislaine reminded Eris that she wouldn't be around forever and imparted onto the young lady that she'd have to be strong to protect Rudeus, confident in Eris's progressing abilities.

Back in the present, wonders on Ghislaine's survival after the calamity, and worries of her adequacy in protecting Rudeus. Meeting the two outside, another Adventurer team approaches Eris with a recruitment offer she refuses (as she cannot speak Demon). When the adventurer pulls her coat, Eris brutalizes him for damaging the clothes Rudeus gave her and is about to kill one of them before Rudeus intervenes- unable to enjoy grabbing her by a breast given the situation. Once Rudeus warns the three away, Eris smacks him off and voices her frustrations from being unable to understand Rudeus conversing in Demon to not being noticed and not having Ghislaine around. After she rushes to her bed, Rudeus realizes how worried she was and goes to promise her that he'll be more mindful of her going forward so she won't feel insecure, promising to get them home to Asura safely.

Rudeus then meets Man-God again while he is asleep, poking fun at him for getting close to a young girl while also noting how Rudeus should be glad he took his advice and got a trusted partner in Ruijurd. However, Man-God came to Rudeus due to his current predicament: money. As their current finance from Rowin being used for the Inn and food, Rudeus calculates less than two weeks of funds to support the trio; finding it ironically funny that a former NEET is worrying about money. Irritated he's still with Man-God, Rudeus asks for his advice and is told to simply accept the lost pet quest. Waking up, Rudeus aims to do so for his party's sake.

But while the intent was noble, the outcome proved foreboding with Eris bloodied and Rudeus keeled to the floor as Ruijurd was engulfed in a dark aura of bloodlust.

==============

This article is about the Season 2 Episode 9 Anime. For the Manga Chapters, see
White Mask (Part I)
 and
White Mask (Part II)
.

The White Mask
 (白い仮面
Shiroi Kamen
) is the ninth episode of the
second season
 (33rd overall)
Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on September 3, 2023.

Synopsis

Rudeus and Fits investigates the
Fittoa Region

Teleport Incident
. Since their research indicates that teleportation and summoning are similar, Rudeus consults with Silent Seven Star another Special Student, who specializes in summoning magic at Ranoa Magic Academy, in order to gain knowledge about summoning magic. What is the identity of that person?

Plot

Fitz
 remains conflicted over revealing her true identity to
Rudeus
 as she's afraid that he's forgotten about her. Ariel encourages her to tell him the truth with her approval. Meanwhile, Rudeus continues to study teleportation and sees many similarities to summoning magic. Fitz suggests he consult with a summoning specialist, Silent Sevenstar, but Rudeus is shocked to discover it is
Nanahoshi
 and faints after reliving the
trauma of his death
 at
Orsted
's hands.

Fitz revives Rudeus and Nanahoshi shows Rudeus two Japanese names, Shinohara Akito and Kuroki Satoshi, and asks if either of those names belong to him. Rudeus doesn't recognize the names and comes to the realization that Nanahoshi is a person from his own world. Nanahoshi removes her mask and formally introduces herself as Nanahoshi Shizuka, and Rudeus notes she resembles the high school girl he died attempting to save. However, Nanahoshi wants to find a way back to their world while Rudeus has no intentions to go back and wants to stay in this world.

She explains that unlike Rudeus who was reincarnated as a child, she was summoned to the fantasy world as she is now five years ago though she hasn't aged since. Orsted found her and took her under his care, and she has been studying summoning magic ever since, though she lacks mana capacity and cannot cast magic herself. She makes a deal with Rudeus where he will use his mana to assist her in her experiments in return for her knowledge about teleportation.

She further explains that the mass teleportation disaster was possibly a side effect of the spell that summoned her to the fantasy world. Upon hearing this, Flitz snaps and attacks Nanahoshi, screaming about all the lives lost because of the incident, including those of her own parents. When Rudeus tries to stop Flitz, she becomes confused and asks him why he's defending Nanahoshi since she knows he also suffered during the years following the incident, but Rudeus clarifies that Nanahoshi was as much of a victim as they are since she wasn't summoned willingly. Flitz calms down and apologizes.

On the way back, Fitz is glad to hear Rudeus has no romantic feelings for Nanahoshi, but still can't decide whether or not to reveal the truth to him.

=============================

The Woman with the Demon Eyes
 (魔眼を持つ女
Magan o Motsu Onna
) is the twelfth episode of the
Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on October 3, 2021.

Synopsis

Rudeus and his friends arrive at Wind port, the southernmost port town of the Demon Continent. The three of them attempt to travel to the continent of Millis by boat, but they are charged a tremendous amount of money for the trip because of the presence of the Superd tribe. That night, Hitogami appears in Rudeus' dreams, that was troubled by the lack of funds, and leaves him with some advice. The next day, while Rudeus is strolling through the town, he meets a mysterious girl who is hungry.

Plot

Roxy's party disembark at the city, while Rudeus and Eris learn that due to Ruijerd being a Superd, his boat fee to travel the ocean is too high for them to pay. While looking for a solution, Rudeus is once again contacted by Human-God, who instructs him to buy some food in a specific place, where he stumbles on a hungry peddler and feeds her. The peddler reveals herself as the Demon Emperor Kishirika Kishirisu, who rewards him with a new power that allows him to see a few seconds in the future, and Rudeus uses this power to save a man from harm. After getting used to his new ability, Rudeus decides to sell his staff to get enough money for Ruijerd's ticket, but Ruijerd himself dissuades him from doing so, when Gallus Cleaner, the same man whom Rudeus saved approaches them.

Information

Story

Appearance

 (
テレーズ
・

Zenith Greyrat
 and the aunt of
Rudeus Greyrat
 and
Norn Greyrat
. She is the third daughter of
Claire Latreia
 and
Carlyte Latreia
.

Appearance

Therese has a striking resemblance to her sister
Zenith
, to the point where
Rudeus
 got her confused with his mother on their first meeting but notices that Therese's hair and the position of her mole is different from Zenith.

Personality

She is a devout believer of the
Milis Religion
 and is a knight of the
Order of the Temple
. Although she is part of the
Cardinal Faction
, she does not hate the Demon Race and is relatively tolerant to them.

She is relatively easygoing and cheerful, often playing the role of a doting aunt towards
Rudeus
. She had unwavering loyalty towards Milis, not even hesitating to strike against her own family as long as the order was given.

She is strong willed and holds her own beliefs, not afraid to speak up or take a stand against those that say otherwise.

Background

She was raised under the strict upbringing by
Claire Latreia
 who was very disappointed that Zenith ran away, often expected to excel at various places. To meet her mother's expectation towards her, she had excelled in both academics and etiquette. Despite her mother's strong opposition, she went on to being a Temple Knight although her mother thought women were unfit for such roles.

Plot

She first appeared when
Eris
 go to hunt goblins in Milis Kingdom. She was saved by
Eris
 from the
Pope Faction's
 assassins.
 Later, she helped
Rudeus
,
Eris
, and
Ruijerd
 to pass the West Port.

In
Volume 21 - Young Man Period - Cliff Chapter
, she make a comeback and often advises and helps
Rudeus
 in the course of retrieving
his mother
,
Zenith Greyrat
.

She had even tried to persuade
her mother
,
Claire Latreia
 to free
Zenith Greyrat
, even to the extent of calling her brother and father to help with the matter.

During that timeframe, she was a guard to the
Miko of Memory
 and had taken part in the trial where
Rudeus
 was framed for wanting to kidnap the Miko. She had faced
Rudeus
 in a short battle with the [Defence of the Holy Sepulcher (Anastasia)] although she had showed signs of being unwilling.

She was later exiled to another place for failing to protect the Miko from the kidnapping and demoted from her rank as a Miko's guard to a sub-captain of another division. However,
Rudeus
 signs a petition formed by the rest of the Miko's guard in order to lighten her punishment. As a result she is still demoted but is allowed to continue guarding the Miko while under a new superior. This is shown when, after being requested by
Rudeus
,
Eris
 finally reunites with the Miko she saved years ago.

Timeline
========

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!







This article is for the
Timeline
 of the
Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation
 Series, that includes the storyline of the Original
Light Novel
,
Web Novel
, Redundancy and Old Dragon Tales.

Antiquity

More than 100,000 years ago

The age of the gods of ancient times. According to legend.

20,000 - 10,000 years ago

The God Wars

The God Wars (not the offical name) began when the first Dragon God declared war on 4 of the 6 worlds in order to search for the murderers of his wife Lunaria. Evidence pointed to a conspiracy of these four worlds that resulted in Lunaria's murder, and so the Dragon God and his five Dragon Generals began their massacre on the Beast world, followed by the Ocean World, the Heaven World and finally the Demon world. Each time, the Dragon God faced off and killed one of the Gods while his Dragon Generals committed genocide on the world populations. The Human God then opened a rift to allow the survivors of those worlds to escape into the human world.

The five Dragon Generals betray the Dragon God when he announced invading the Human World, and their battle ends in mutual defeat. The Dragon God is killed by Hitogami.

The dying Dragon God sends his son Orsted into the future to defeat Hitogami. Demon Dragon King Laplace (one of the five Dragon Generals) is given a mission by the Dragon God, “Gather knowledge on all known techniques and magic.  Archive them for my son when arrives in 10,000 years.”

Laplace escapes the collapsing Dragon World, and begins to wander the Human World as the second generation Dragon God.

The legend states that all worlds but the Human World were destroyed, but at least the Void World still exists.

10,000 - 8,000 years ago

The age of chaos. The different races in the Human World are mixed together and struggle. Eventually, each race starts to live in different parts of the world. Only the humans and demons continue to quarrel.

Laplace begins studying techniques and spells for the sake of defeating Hitogami, with the goal of one day teaching them to Orsted.

7,000 years ago

Start of the First Great Human-Demon War.

6,000 years ago

The First Great Human-Demon War is ended when the hero Ars leads his six comrades to defeat the five Demon Lords and Demon World Emperor
Kishirika Kishirisu
.
 The hero Ars then established the Asura Kingdom, the capital of which is named after him.

5,500 years ago

Humans wage war on other races and each other for a period of about 500 years.

5,000 years ago

Kishirika revives. Start of the Second Great Human-Demon War, began by Kishirika. The demons ally with the beast race and sea race, and corner the humans.

4,200 years ago

Badigadi manages to dominate the humans, becoming a key player in the war, after taking advice from Hitogami who appears in his dreams. This left the humans trapped and almost defeated.

The Golden Knight Aldebaran, with his Fighting God Armour, appears and singlehandedly turns the tide of the war in favour of the humans. At the very end, his attack punches a huge hole in the Great Continent, forming a sea and splitting it into the
Central Continent
 and
Demon Continent
.
 Falsely according to legend, this happens when Aldebaran fights Kishirika.

In actuality, the Human Hero Aldebaran had abandoned his armour and had died before this point. Advised by Hitogami, Badigadi locates the armour and becomes the Fighting God. Possessed by the armour, Badigadi kills Kishirika and then engages in a final battle against Laplace. Using the ingrained techniques of the armour, Badigadi is able to defeat Laplace, resulting in his soul to split in half. Laplace loses his memories and is split into two individuals: the Technique God Laplace who seeks to defeat a god and the Demon God Laplace who hates humans. At the same time, the Fighting God Armour was broken and fell to the bottom of the ocean, which was just created by the separating of the two continents.

Whilst both Aldebaran and Badigadi were Fighting Gods, history mistakes them for the same person. Badigadi was the one who split the continents using the power of the Fighting God Armour fighting against Laplace, and not by Aldebaran fighting Kishirika.

The Second Great Human-Demon War ends with the splitting of the continents.

4,200 - 1,000 years ago

A time of peace. Humans gradually segregate demons onto the Demon Continent and blockade it. The demons struggle for resources, and their population drops.
   Kishirika revives again at some point during this period.

1,000 years ago

Demon God Laplace is reborn. He unites the demons and subjugates the Demon Continent.
  There are some demons, such as Badigadi and Kishirika, who do not join Laplace. They become a faction known as the Moderate Faction.

500 years ago

Start of the Laplace War, fuelled by the Demon God's hatred for humans. Laplace persuades the sea race and beast race, and attacks the Central Continent. Quickly gains control of the north and south part, and invades the west from both directions.
  Some time after this, before the end of the war, Laplace gives spears to the Superd Warriors, which some accept. Crazed by the cursed spears, the Superd start attacking family, friends and foe alike, resulting in the deaths of the majority of Superd and Kishirika (again). This villainises the Superd, who go down in history as traitorous monsters, though people are generally unaware of the curse that afflicted them.

About 400 years ago (K0)

The Seven Heroes persuade the sea race to lift the blockade of the sea, and ally with the beast race by holding hostage the children of their heads of families. The last remaining human country, the Asura Kingdom, put all their efforts into a final assault. The Seven Heroes led the Millis Holy Order of knights and the beast race in an attack on Laplace's stronghold. In the final battle, four of the Seven Heroes die, leaving Dragon God Urupen, the first generation North God
Kalman I
, and the Armoured Dragon King
Perugius
. Laplace's close allies are annihilated and Laplace is sealed.
Ruijerd Superdia
 also aids the Heroes during the final battle. The war ends. According to legend (Citation Required).  Ruijerd's role was mentioned by himself and Perugius.

To You
 (あなたへ
Anata e
) is the eleventh episode of the
second season
 (35th overall)
Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on September 18, 2023.

Synopsis

Rudeus discovers that Fitz is actually a woman. There are also signs that by touching her body that Rudeus would be cured of her impotence. Rudeus finds hope in Fitz's presence, but since she pretends to be a man, he worries that she might become distant. Then Luke comes to visit... Meanwhile, Fitz is told something by Ariel.

Plot

Luke
 confront
Rudeus
 about what he has done to Flitz, but he acts ignorance and has no intention of revealing Flitz's true identity to anyone else.
Ariel
 confronts Flitz about everything that has happened to her, how Rudeus approached her and Luke at the super market, that she intentionally told him that she was male and Rudeus knows she's actually a female from what Luke told her.

She tells her she was patience with Flitz taking her time, but grows tired of her indecisive and pressures her to reveal her identity to Rudeus and she shouldn't hold back because she still owes Ariel for saving her life She tells Flitz she is her friend, not her servant, and once again asks what Flitz really wants. She tells him she wants to be together with Rudeus. However, Fitz is still uncertain if Rudeus remembers her as Sylphie, so Ariel and Luke come up with a plan to help jog Rudeus' memory.

When Ariel asks if there are any strong memories she has with Rudeus, Sylphie mentions that he thought she was a boy when they were kids, and that when they bathed together and Rudeus undressed her, he found out she was actually a girl. When asked what kind of relationship she seeks with Rudeus, Fltiz tells her she’s fine having lots and lots of kids with him. With that information, Ariel supports Flitz's choice, but warns her if she fails to tell Rudeus her identity, she will use her authority as the second princess of Asura to forbid her having further contact with Rudeus.

Later, Fitz invites Rudeus to accompany her to gather a rare flower deep in the Forest of Hail despite it being the middle of winter. When he asks to bring someone with them, Flitz is against it, stating it would cause Ariel some trouble and that they should do it with just the two of them. Rudeus agrees and the pair travel into the forest. Fitz then secretly uses her ring which suddenly causes it to rain, soaking both her and Rudeus before they can reach shelter inside a cave.

Rudeus strips off his wet clothes to avoid hypothermia and advises Fitz to do the same, but Fitz insists that Rudeus strip her instead. Rudeus complies and recognizes her as Sylphie, his childhood friend from
Buena Village
, much to her relief. Now properly reunited with Rudeus, Sylphie admits that for a long time, she has loved him and wants to stay with him forever.

Black Wolf
』. Is that right?"

Summary

At the start of a new day, Rudeus meets with Ghislaine and Eris as he promised to show them his Water Saint level magic. After an awkward hello with Eris, Rudeus inquires about a red orb that floats over Roa, as Ghislaine had been curious also. As it appeared five years earlier and nothing has occurred, Sauros and Ghislaine deemed it to be harmless and let it be, so the trio board the carriage. As townsfolk greet Rudeus riding by, Ghislaine reminisces on how Rudeus has grown in three years, as well as Eris having grown since his arrival. Even after teaching Ghislaine reading, writing and math, the people in Roa have come to accept Rudeus on their own, as Rudeus have become a respectable teacher. Whilst Eris agrees, Rudeus thinks how he has changed since reincarnating and wonders how his teacher, Roxy, is doing. In Shirone Kingdom, Roxy's "student" Prince Pax finds her letters from Rudeus and, thinking he's her lover, threatens to assassinate him if she doesn't become his woman; unfazed, Roxy corrects his misconception and welcomes him to try. When comparing the pathetic Pax to the prodigious Rudeus in her mind, Roxy sees the mana pooling over Fittoa and worries of Rudeus's safety.

Far from Roa, Rudeus displays his magic skills with his new staff, finding it magnifies his spells 2-5 times with the standard mana input, and thanks Eris for the gift. As Rudeus starts the chant for Cumulonimbus, he stops as he notices the sky change. As Ghislaine can see the mana pooling over the city, her plan to get the children away is interrupted by the arrival of Almanfi, servant to Perugius. Initially believing Rudeus to be the cause of the mana anomaly, he seizes attempts to kill him hearing Ghislaine's sworn title of Sword King. When Rudeus attempts to ask for more information, the red orb swirls with mana as an unknown person inside awakens. The resulting energies are sent to ground and everyone, from House Boreas to Rudeus's family in Buena Village, are caught in a mana disaster with the epicenter in Roa. As Almanfi escapes and Ghislaine is engulfed, Rudeus holds onto a frightened Eris as the region is wiped off the map. Arriving in an unknown space, Rudeus finds himself in his original form and falls in a depression begging any who can hear him to not let it be so. In the physical world, Rudeus's body is found by a Superd man.

===============

Turning Point 2
 (ターニングポイント 2
Tāningupointo 2
) is the Twenty-first episode of the
Mushoku Tensei
 anime series originally broadcasted on December 5, 2021.

Synopsis

After parting ways with Lilia and Aisha, Rudeus and his friends head to their homeland. On their way, they encounter Orsted, the Dragon God, one of the seven great powers. Eris and Ruijerd suddenly change their expressions and begin to tremble. Although they have never met before, Orsted knows Eris, Ruijerd, and even Paul well, but he doesn't seem to know about Rudeus. When Rudeus answers a question from Orsted , Orsted suddenly attacks him!

Plot

PRELUDE

The inner self of
Rudeus
 explains how life can be unpredictable, since everything happens suddenly. Both
Ruijerd
 and
Eris
 are shown unconscious and Rudeus is spitting blood with a hole in his chest in front of
Orsted
.

PLOT

The party
<<DEAD END>>
 is travelling through
Red Dragon Mountain
 to reach the
Fittoa Region
 of
Asura Kingdom
. One night, after a brief spar, Ruijerd acknowledges  Eris as a
warrior
. An astonished Eris asks Rudeus to pinch her, to check if it's not a dream. Rudeus asks Eris if she'll not punch him if he does so, to which Eris tells she won't. Rudeus playfully pinches her chest and Eris sends him flying neverthless. Now that she realizes it's not a dream, she gets excited, but Ruijerd warns her not to get cocky, since acknowledging her as a warrior means he won't treat her as a kid anymore.

The next day, they climb the Red Dragon's Lower Jaw valley, to avoid any fights with a group of
red dragons
. But Eris suggests that, instead of taking a detour, they should climb the mountain and fight them. Both Rudeus and Ruijerd reject this plan, since fighting a herd of Red Dragons is very risky. Ruijerd then goes to explain that even the
lower ranked

<<SEVEN GREAT POWERS>>
 will have to retreat halfway, while fighting a herd of red dragons. Rudeus is surprised to hear that even people that strong will have hard time against red dragons, to which Ruijerd tells that an upper ranked <<SEVEN GREAT POWERS>> can easily dominate them even in herds. Rudeus starts thinking how strong the Technique God and Dragon God are when both Ruijerd and Eris stop moving, stiff as rocks. Since they had a terrified look on their face, Rudeus asks them what happened and looks ahead.

In the thick mist,
a tall man in white
 is seen coming in their direction along with a
masked girl with black hair
. They both pass the members of <<DEAD END>> and after a while, the pair stops. There was a long pause. Ruijerd warns both Rudeus and Eris not to move at any cost. <<DEAD END>>'s pack animal jumps off the side of the cliff. Hearing that voice, the man in white asks him if he is 'Ruijerd Superdia'. Rudeus tries to look at that man with his clairvoyence eye, but couldn't find anything. The main in white then looks at Eris and asks if she is 'Eris Boreas Greyrat'. The man then looks at Rudeus and tells, he doesn't know who he is. Ruijerd and Eris asks him how he knows them, to which he comments that it is a strange place for them to meet and turns back to leave.

Rudeus, now curious about this person calls at him and introduces himself. He then asks for that man's name, to which he answers his name is 'Orsted'. Rudeus asks Orsted if he knows Ruijerd and Eris, to which he answers that "they haven't properly acquainted yet". Rudeus, surprised by that answer, asks what that means. Orsted tells he doesn't need to know that and asks which Greyrat family is he from and what is his father's name. Rudeus tells his father's name is "
Paul Greyrat
". To his surprise, Orsted comments that "Paul is supposed to have only two daughters".  Orsted then asks Rudeus, why he doesn't look away, to which Rudeus politely tells that he wants to look away since Orsted is kind of intimidating him. Orsted then asks Rudeus why he called for him, to which Rudeus asks if he knows anything about
Mana Calamity
. Orsted, a little annoyed by the question, tells he doesn't know anything.

Rudeus then thanks him and turns back to leave, when Orsted asks if he knows anything about the word "Human God". Rudeus turns back with a smile on his face and admits he sees him in his dreams, and immediately gets attacked by Orsted. Ruijerd blocks his attack with his spear and tells Rudeus and Eris to run away. Orsted looks at Rudeus with rage telling Rudeus is an apostle of "Human God" . Ruijerd then fights Orsted but is immediately sent flying away with a punch. He then approaches Rudeus to finish him. Eris comes roaring at him with her sword, but her swing is stopped by Orsted and sends her flying too. Rudeus looking at his party members getting overpowered, gets terrified and gets a vision of his lungs getting punctured. Orsted catches Rudeus and crushes his abdomen area, and tells him to inform "Human God" before dying that Dragon God Orsted will kill him soon, and turns back to leave. Eris, makes a desperate attempt to attack Orsted with
<FireBall>
 spell, but couldn't since she was badly injured. Looking at this, Rudeus builds up his
mana
 to make a very powerful
<Stone Cannon>
 spell and fires it at Orsted, which injures him.

Orsted notices that Rudeus can use chantless magic casting and asks if he learnt that from "Human God". Rudeus uses wind magic to breathe and then builds up a <FireBall> spell in his right hand. Orsted, now more annoyed, uses
<Disturb Magic>
 to disperse the magic built by Rudeus. Rudeus uses wind magic to fall back. Orsted notes his skill and calls up a <Front Dragon Gate>. Rudeus starts developing a very strong, saint level fire magic and fires it at Orsted. Orsted then opens the <Front Dragon Gate> and sucks the spell which almost breaks it. Orsted then noted that Rudeus' magic power capacity is as powerful as
Laplace
's. He then lifts Rudeus and asks why he doesn't heal himself with chantless casting and thrusts his hand through Rudeus' chest, leaving a hole as shown in prelude. Eris looking at this, starts crying for help. As dying Rudeus loses his consciousness, The masked girl, whom Orsted calls 'Nanahoshi', asks him a question that puzzled her.

Rudeus, now in his original form, finds himself in the void dimension. He looks at his body and finds a hole in his chest. "Human God" appears and tells that he wasn't expecting Rudeus would meet Orsted. Rudeus then asks "Human God", why Orsted attacked him after hearing his name. "Human God" starts explaining that Orsted is an evil Dragon God and he hates him, since he is a virtuous Human God. Rudeus comments that, it's easy for people to hate "Human God" and asks why he didnt inform him beforehand about his meeting with Orsted. "Human God" tells that he can't see anything about Orsted since he is
cursed
. He further goes to explain that Orsted was born as a cursed child, which made living creatures of that world to either hate him or fear him. Rudeus finds that situation relatable and tells that it is a very sad curse. He then asks "Human God", why he didnt hate or fear Orsted in the first place, to which he answers that Rudeus is originally from an another world. A curious Rudeus asks if curses dont affect reincarnated people, to which "Human God" answers that the situation was same, when he met Ruijerd. A surprised Rudeus asks what he meant by it. "Human God" tells that Ruijerd's curse is due to the spear that Laplace gave him during the war, which passed the <Curse of Fear> to the
Superd race
.  Rudeus now starts thinking that, him helping Ruijerd was useless after all, to which "Human God" tells that the curse is slowly fading away, since Ruijerd shaved his head off. He then tells that Ruijerd can build their good reputation back, by doing good work.

Rudeus then asks "Human God", how he can defeat Orsted. He tells that Orsted can't be defeated, since he is the most powerful person in the world with the power to destroy that world but cannot do so due to the curses that limit his power. Rudeus gets suspicious because "Human God" seems to know a lot about Orsted, even though he can't see him, but tells he doesn't care about it since he is already dead. "Human God" then tells that Rudeus has got the wrong idea and is still alive, pointing at his chest which now didn't have a hole.

Rudeus wakes up on Eris's lap, who explains to him that after he passed out, the girl named Nanahoshi asked Orsted to heal him. Rudeus, filled with a wave of mixed emotions, hugs Eris. She asks if she can punch him, which Rudeus accepts. But she punches him softly and starts crying and tells him that she is glad that he is still alive.

At Ranoa Magic Academy, Rudeus spots and waves at Norn who is walking with her friends and returned the gesture then catches up to her friends. The siblings are later seen together working on a book about
Ruijerd Superdia
's life which is one of Rudeus' previous plan to help restore the
Superd Tribe
's reputation but Rudeus is struggling on how to present the story. Upon seeing that Rudeus only have Ruijerd's physical appearance in writing so far, Norn volunteered to help since Ruijerd told her about his past and Rudeus agrees as long as she can keep up with school.

That evening at the Greyrat House, after being asked by Rudeus, Aisha asks if she can be paid for her work.

At the Commerce District, Rudeus is shopping together with Aisha buys some seeds and Rudeus buys a pair of earrings for Sylphy. After seeing Aisha haggle the price of a curtain after name dropping his and
Ariel Anemoi Asura
's name, he is awed of her sister's business sense. On their way home, Aisha is told by her mother,
Lilia Greyrat
 that as a maid, she cannot own furnishings of her preference but Rudeus allows her to keep the curtains which she places in her room.

At Ranoa Magic Academy in Nanahoshi's Research Room, Nanahoshi discusses the 4 phases for her
Summoning Magic
: Summon an inorganic matter, organic matter, living organism, Summon an organism with detailed conditions and to return the summoned organism back to its original location. Nanahoshi also mentions that she needs to consult with the
authority of Summoning Magic

summoning an inorganic matter
, Nanahoshi gives Rudeus a scroll containing a

 training.

At Cliff's Research Room, Cliff shows a prototype of a
Curse Supressing Tool
 to extend the limit of effects of Elinalise's
Curse of Promiscuity
 but has 2 problems. First is its ugly appearance but with help from Zanoba and Nanahoshi, they can probably make it smaller. Second, it requires a huge amount of
Mana
 to which Rudeus agrees to provide.

Rudeus' everyday routine has been the same from working out, having meals, helping on his friends' research, help Norn on her studies and returning home until Sylphy tells Rudeus that she is pregnant which made Rudeus happy. That night, Norn congratulates the couple while Aisha informs them that she already told Rudeus' circle of friends and Elinalise will take over Sylphy's bodyguard duty to Ariel. Rudeus longed for his family to be reunited and living together in Sharia but he received a letter from
Geese Nukadia
 requesting assistance on rescuing
Zenith
.

At the Void World, Rudeus confronts Hitogami on regretting his decision on going to the Begaritt Continent but Hitogami insists that he will regret it all the same. After a couple more exchanges, Rudeus decides to stay in Sharia and wakes up from the dream where Sylphy is worried that he has been tossing and turning. Sylphy assures Rudeus not to worry about her but Rudeus tells her that he will stay.

Rudeus continues with his daily routine and reflects and the possibilities on why Geese sent him the letter. Rudeus also consults with his friends to which Elinalise agrees that he should stay but plans on going instead for her granddaughter's family's sake and will leave Cliff as he has the making of a future pope of the
Milis Religion
 and sees his love as youthful indiscretion. Zanoba advises Rudeus that he should make the decision on his own and while he is willing to join if he asks, he will slowdown Rudeus and he cannot take Juliette on such a long trip. Zanoba also advises him that children still grow when their father is not watching them but urges him to go if he is worried and he will watch over his family in his stead.

One morning, Rudeus while outside the house sees Norn packed and plans to leave in his stead. Rudeus tells her that she will not make it but Norn insists on going in tears since their mother and father are in trouble and Rudeus refuses despite being strong. Seeing Norn wanting to go badly but unable to, Rudeus decides to go and asks Norn to watch the house for him.

Differences with the light novel:

In the light novel, Eris PoV was a monologue between the sex scene and before Rudeus awake.

The anime expands Rudeus' worries after his separation from Eris.

The anime adds many PoV  for some characters.

Ruijerd helped some travelers.

Zanoba traveling in a carriage in a snowy land.

Geese traveling in a desert.

Gyes, Minitona, Tersena and the Holy beast in the Great forest.

Kurt arriving in the ocean.

Paul and Norn reunion with Lilia and Aisha.

How Roxy's group arrived and started the party was cut.

In the light novel, Kishirika sees Rudeus that was training in the northern lands.

Some scenes after Roxy discover the Localization of Zenith thanks to Kishirika were cut.

A scene Elinalise proposed to tell about Zenith localization to Rudeus.

The demon king Badigadi appears for the first time and decides to help them.

How the group is divided in two, Roxy with Talhand traveling to Millishion to meet Paul and Elinalise with Badigadi to the northern land of the central continent to meet Rudeus, with the purpose to inform about the localization of Zenith.

The anime adds a dream of Zenith about the Family.

Looks like that was inspired in the LN 1 Extra Chapter: The Mother of the Greyrat Family

The
LN 6 Extra Chapter: Distorted, But Unchanged
 was cut.

The
LN 7 Extra Chapter - Ruler of Ranoa Magic Academy
 only was covered a little with the last scene.

Water God Style
===============

This article contains information about spoilers describe in the novels, anime-only watchers and manga-only readers should please proceed with caution!

"Even if it's cold, they can't wear heavy things on their bodies. They're the opposite of us who wear thick clothes even when it's hot. It's interesting, isn't it?"

Water God Reida Reia

Water God Style
 (
水神流
,

Suishin-ryū
)
 is one of the three major schools of swordsmanship.

Background

The origins of the Water God Style started a long time ago in a country by the sea that is frequently attacked by Water Dragon King especially the fisherman that encroached on his territory and incurred his wrath which also results to attacking the port town. The country's knight order tried to subdue the dragon but failed due to its massive size and ability to move freely through the water of the country which pushed the country to the brink of ruins. In this situation, the king declared that he would offer both his crown and daughter's hand to any who could subdued the Water Dragon King but many knights, brave men and heroes who took up the challenge were torn to pieces by the Water Dragon King.

With all the heroes and knights defeated, Reidar approaches the king and tells him that he will defeat the dragon who consents but is doubtful that a sloppy man with a vagrant visage will make a difference and like the king many thought he would give up half way. Despite his appearance, Reidar was strong and froze the surface of the ocean to stop the Water Dragon's movement but he eventually broke out of the ice and attacks Reidar. With his worn out sword, Reidar returned the Water Dragon King's unblockable strike and slicing its head off with a single slash.

With the Water Dragon King's head in hand, Reidar returns to the king who gave him a fortune great enough to play around for the rest of his life but the king refuses to give his daughter nor the crown to this dirty man. Reidar was not mad but he fell into a deep depression as he is in love with the princess that he had always watched from afar. Despite being able to become king through sheer force easily, Reidar decides to leave the country; but the princess grew angry at the king and hit him hard enough she sends him flying then left the castle.

The princess chased after Reidar who was leaving the country and clung to his legs then tells him: "I have abandoned my country. I am no longer a princess, nor do I have a last name. Even if you obtain me, you won't be able to have the country, you won't be able to become king. But if that is agreeable with you, please take me as your wife." Reidar held the princess in his arms and left the country and the two eventually married then vanished.

Decades later somewhere in the world, the Water God Style was born. And accordance with the Reidar's story a custom was born. "The spouse of the Water God Style shall abandon their household." like the princess did.

Characteristics





Paul doing a Water God Style counter attack



This style of swordsmanship specializes in defensive techniques, emphasizing parrying and counterattacking incoming attacks. Since there are only a few ways to attack, the art of provocation is also employed to make the opponent take the initiative.

A skilled practitioner can read the flow of
magic
 and use their senses to block and counter any attack, including magic and projectiles.

The weakness of Water God Style is that users cannot attack first while displaying its techniques, which makes it vulnerable to
North God Style
 due to its sudden attacks, trickery, and adaptability, all of which are difficult to anticipate. Conversely, Water God Style is well-matched with
Sword God Style
 because of their shared philosophy of taking the initiative and striking first.

Practitioners often wear heavy equipment, such as full-body armor, because they do not need to move. This sword style is mostly used by palace knights and nobles whose job is to protect someone.

Techniques

Flow

Flow
 (
流
,

Nagare
)
: The basic counter-attack technique that can be applied to all the techniques of the Water God Style.
This technique, once mastered, is said to be able to return any attack that comes in the user's way.
Although it is a basic technique and not one of the Five Secret Arts, the school considers it to be the backbone of the style and the most important technique, thus it is also regarded as a
Secret Art
 (
奥義
,

Ōgi
)
.

Five Secret Arts

Five Secret Arts
 (
五つの奥義
,

Itsutsu no Ōgi
)
: The collective name of the five undisclosed ultimate techniques of the Water God Style. Even just one of the Arts is extremely hard to master, and when at least three of them have been perfected the individual is qualified to be a Water God.

Deprivation Sword Kingdom

Deprivation Sword Kingdom
 (
剥奪剣界
,

Hakudatsu Ken-kai
)
: An ultimate technique created by the Water God Reida Reia by combining the two of the most difficult Five Secret Arts, also called the phantom
Sixth Secret Art
.
Upon entering stance, the user establishes a six-dimensional domain of attack, with a range "approximately the size of a party hall," encompassing all directions—front, back, left, right, up, and down. If any enemy within this range moves—even slightly, including mana—the technique automatically responds by cutting them down.

Since it is a pure counterattack technique, it cannot be used to cut a completely motionless target. It also can't counterattack faster than the user's reaction time.

Ranks

There are seven ranks in the Water God Style:

Water God

The Water God is the most powerful practitioner of the Water God Style and leader of the school. Practitioners who are of Saintly level and above may call themselves a Saint, King, Emperor or God of the Water God school. Similar to the system of
Sword God Style
, there can be only one swordsman of the God rank while the there can be multiple practitioners who can assume the rank of Water Emperor and below. To succeed to the title of Water God, one must master at least three of the
Five Secret Arts
 of the Water God Style left by the founder, the first Water God Reidar.

Water Emperor

Trivia

The first generation Water God was the only individual ever to master all of the Five Secret Arts.

The name of the first generation Water God, Reidar, is a popular name around the Shirone Kingdom
.

Male Water Gods would inherit the Reidar name, whereas female Water Gods would be called Reida
.

The headquarters of the Water God school is located in Ars, the capital of
Asura Kingdom
 on the
Central Continent
.

Water God
Reida Reia
 is the only known swordsman who have mastered the technique Deprivation Sword Kingdom, and is what allowed her ascension to the God rank despite the existence of several other qualified swordsmen.

Water God Style is regarded as last among the three Sword Style after the North God style, perhaps due to its passive nature.

Summary

Chapter 155: Diary - First Part.

Rudeus reads the diary from his future self, which described the following events. Roxy became infected with Magic Stone disease, which was identified by Cliff and his Eye of Identification. This can only be healed with God rank detoxification. So, Cliff, Zanoba and Rudeus go to the Holy Kingdom of Milis using teleport magic circles to get the book with God Class Detoxification chants. Unfortunately, this book is within a cathedral that cannot be entered unless you are archbishop level. They decide to steal the book but are caught. Cliff dies during the battle and the magic teleporting circle that they used is destroyed. They also become wanted men in the Milis region. By the time Rudeus and Zanoba arrive home, Roxy was already half crystalized and had died. Elinalise is informed of Cliff's death, and leaves town while heavily pregnant. Rudeus then becomes depressed due to Roxy's death and dependent on alcohol. He begins neglecting Sylphy. Sylphy then leaves with Ariel who has returned to the Kingdom of Asura. Rudeus then decides to chase after Sylphy by following her to Asura. During his travels, he frequently runs into Eris. She is unable to properly express her feeling towards Rudeus and so just hits him. Rudeus discovers that Ariel has returned to Asura in order to gather an army to perform a coup d'etat. This fails however, and so Ariel, Sylphy, and Luke all die.

Chapter 156: Diary - Second Part.

Rudeus continues to read the diary from his future self, which described the following events. After Sylphy's death, Rudeus spent more time going to brothels. He also frequently ran into Eris, who also was living in Sharia. Rudeus continues to have mixed feelings about Eris. The Milis Church put a bounty on the heads of Rudeus and Zanoba due to their exploits from stealing the God Class detoxification chant book. Zanoba completes his automaton research. He is able to create essentially a robot that looks like Sylphy and acts like her as well. Rudeus ends up destroying this robot. Zanoba ultimately mass produces his robots. Rudeus develops a hatred for Hitogami. He vows to get stronger in order to kill Hitogami. Throughout this process, he loses touch with his family; only Aisha stays in touch. To augment his physical strength, he and Zanoba develop fully body armour similar to his prosthetic hand, which Rudeus can augment with magic to improve his physical strength.

Future Rudeus continues to work on his magic over the years, developing gravity magic, electricity magic, voice magic. However, he becomes a bad person; he would frequently get into arguments, do whatever he wanted, and occasionally raped women. Rudeus continued to run into Eris, and so he begins to falsely suspect that she is affiliated with Hitogami. Rudeus continues to try to gather more information about Hitogami by questioning beings who are long-lived. He ends up trying to speak to Atofe, but ends up fighting her and her imperial guard, including Moore. During the battle, he becomes careless and is saved by Eris, but then she is killed as a result. After Eris' death, Ghyslaine explains to Rudeus that Eris has loved him all this time and had followed him around for this reason. Ghylaine blames Rudeus for Eris' death.

Years pass, and Zanoba dies, killed by the Order of the Temple. Julie, Ginger, and Aisha are killed as well. With this, Rudeus no longer has any living loved ones. There was no mention in the diary of the fate of Lucy, Norn or Lilia. Through his travels, Rudeus discovers the nature of this world, which is that it shaped like a cube, with six sides: Dragon world, Human world, Demon world, Beast world, Ocean world, Sky world. The interior of the die is the Void World, where Hitogami resides. Rudeus learns that in order to travel to the Void World, one must collect the 5 ancient Dragon Race treasures. However, collecting all 5 treasures turns out to be impossible within his lifespan. Rudeus then learns how to travel to the past and he decides to go to the past to correct his mistakes. The diary then ends here.

Chapter 157: Resolve.

After finishing reading his future self's diary, Rudeus has a discussion with Sylphy and Roxy. He vaguely reveals that someone has shown him the future in which a bad person would cause terrible things to happen to his family. Rudeus then broaches the subject of adding Eris to their polygamous relationship. Sylphy and Roxy initially object, since they know that Eris broke Rudeus' heart, which resulted in his erectile dysfunction. Rudeus reassures them that he now knows that this was actually a misunderstanding. Both Sylphy and Roxy tentatively agree to accepting Eris, depending on how well Rudeus' and Eris' are able to reconcile in their meeting together.

Rudeus then falls asleep, and he sees Hitogami in the white void. Hitogami is initially extremely frustrated at the fact that future Rudeus has disrupted Hitogami's plans to kill Rudeus' family. Hitogami reports that Orsted is trying to kill Hitogami, but cannot do so alone. However, Rudeus and his descendants are not affected by Orsted's curse, which cause all beings to hate Orsted. This means that Rudeus' descendants may end up assisting Orsted and kill Hitogami. Furthermore, Rudeus and his descendants have 'strong fate', which means that Hitogami has difficulty with changing their fate. So, because Rudeus and his descendants have strong fate and may end up helping Orsted to kill Hitogami, Hitogami tries to kill Rudeus' descendants to prevent his own ultimate death. Rudeus tells Hitogami that he will do anything for him if he is able to save his family. Hitogami therefore suggests that if Rudeus wants to save his family, he needs to kill Orsted.

Rudeus then wakes up. He vows to kill Orsted to save his family from Hitogami.

Eris gets ready to leave the Holy Land of the Sword to meet up with Rudeus in Ranoa, who she hasn't been in contact for many years. Just prior to departing, she receives a letter from Rudeus. The letter describes how Rudeus initially thought Eris had rejected him, but he now knows this was a misunderstanding and that she actually loves him. Rudeus informs Eris in this letter that he currently has two wives, but is willing to accept Eris has his third wife. Eris' two friends argue over whether Rudeus is an asshole or not. Rudeus' letter also included a post script, which stated that he planned to challenge Orsted to battle, with the caveat that he may not survive. Eris becomes excited at this, and she and Ghylaine head off toward Rudeus.

Wii Taa
=======

One of the
Three Swords of the North God
, Light and Darkness, Wii Taa.

Appearance

He's about 1 meter tall, he wears a polished full body armor that shine brightly in the light.

Personality

Note: This section is under construction and revision
.

Background

He was a pupil of
Kalman III
, and served the Notos family for many years.

Plot

Took part in multiple ambushes on
Ariel Anemoi Asura
. The first was while her, her attendants,
Luke Notos Greyrat
,
Rudeus Greyrat
,
Eris Boreas Greyrat
,
Sylphiette
, and
Ghislaine Dedoldia
 were traveling from the
Magic Academy
 back to Ariel's homeland, the
Asura Kingdom
. The ambush took place in the dense forest known as the
Red Wyrm's Whiskers
 just before the fortress that leads into the Asura Kingdom. In the battle he declared that he wanted to have a duel with Ghislaine and at first he had the upper hand as he was able to cut her a few times, enough to draw blood. But after Rudeus figured out the trick he was using to prevent Ghislaine from attacking, and cast
Mud Rain
 which dirtied his armor enough to stop it from reflecting light, Ghislaine was quickly able to slash his shoulder using
Longsword of Light
, forcing him to retreat.

The second was while Ariel and her bodyguards Rudeus, Eris, Ghislaine, Luke, and Sylphiette were traveling back from speaking with
Pilemon Notos Greyrat
. While Ariel took a secret underground passageway back to her residence and Sylphiette used a magic item to disguise herself as Ariel, Wii Taa, another of the Three Swords of the North God,
Nuckelgard
, and
Auber Corvette
 attacked them in the middle of the street at night. He fought against Ghislaine again, but this time Rudeus had warned her about his tricks and how to counteract them, and she had little trouble cutting his arm off and forcing him to use his item that created extremely thick black smoke to flee. While Rudeus hesitated whether or not to go after him, he was able to enter an alley where
Orsted
 used his powers to create a gaping hole in his chest, causing him to die. While this may have been his true cause of death, Eris declared that it must have been Rudeus who killed him, and no one but him knew that Orsted would be helping them out from the shadows, so Rudeus obtained credit for it.

Power and Abilities

He fights mostly by blinding his opponent by reflecting sunlight with his mirror-like armor during the day. He simply needed to lift his gauntlet and let it reflect the Sun's light in his opponents eyes, which was enough to prevent even the
Sword King
 Ghislaine from attacking him. At night, he covers himself in ink and uses thick black smoke that blends him with the night.

North
 King.

Equipment

Unnamed Armor
 - a set of full body armor that was kept so shiny that it could interfere with his opponent's vision while in combat.

Unnamed Sword
 - a blade around 30 centimeters long that also gleamed brilliantly.

Unnamed Shield
 - a jet black shield he used in combination with his night equipment.

An item capable of quickly producing an extremely large cloud of thick black smoke that he would use at night.

Achievements

Note: This section is under construction and revision
.

Quotes

Note: This section is under construction and revision

Trivia

Rudeus noted that he look like a disco ball with his short posture and his shiny armor.

He cared about or trusted Auber Corvette to some degree, as when he attempted to flee from Ghislaine after being badly wounded, he shouted Auber's name either as a cry for help, or to inform Auber that this was his chance to escape, since Auber was injured as well.

Appearance

Zanoba Shirone
 (
ザノバ・シーローン
,

Zanoba Shīrōn
)
 is the former third prince and a
blessed child
 of the Shirone Kingdom. Initially presented as a minor character, harboring an abnormal infatuation with figurines and being intrigued by
Rudeus'
 crafting skills, he later turns into one of the main supporting characters of the series after becoming classmates and friends with Rudeus at the
Ranoa Magic Academy
.

Appearance

He is a tall, thin, oval-faced man, with his cheekbones clearly visible. He wears round glasses. He also sports a bowl cut hairstyle.

Personality

During his debut, Zanoba appeared as an impulsive and boisterous man-child who's deeply obsessed in dolls and figures, to the point that he has no qualms in killing people or trading his loyal subordinates for a figurine. Contrary to his comical appearance, he is highly intelligent and observant, but as his monstrous strength causes him to be alienated by others, he doesn't often have the chance to display these skills.

He has utmost respect towards Rudeus, whom he regards as his master. Although he used to think of other humans as nothing more than dolls made of flesh, he slowly comes to accept other people thanks to the influence of Rudeus and other people around him. Zanoba harbors a deep patriotism for his country and a fondness of warfare, but often tries to hide these traits from others. He is a highly proficient military commander, capable of rallying soldiers and planning effective tactics against tremendous odds.

Due to his intellectual level, he often conducts research and produces several inventions for Rudeus. He also has a deep level of understanding and appreciation of arts and crafts, enough to eventually earn the favor of Armored Dragon King
Perugius Dola
.

It's revealed that his patriotism, fondness for warfare and his love for his younger brother
Pax
 were simple attempts to act more human. Even though he does not fully understand such emotions, he feels like they are the right ones to act on.

Background

Zanoba is born as the Third Prince of Shirone Kingdom. When he was three years old, he accidentally killed his brother Julius, the Fourth Prince causing him to be known as the Head Ripping Prince. When he was 15 years old, he also killed his wife by accident.

 (
ゼニス・グレイラット
,

Zenisu Gureiratto
)
,
née

Latreia
 (
ラトレイア
,

Ratoreia
)
, is the wife of
Paul Greyrat
 and the mother of
Rudeus Greyrat
 and
Norn Greyrat
.

Born a noble, she ran away from home and joined Paul's party before starting a family with him later. Following the
Teleport Incident
, however, she was transported into the
Teleportation Labyrinth
 and encased within a mana crystal. After being rescued, she awoke as a
Miko
, but was left in a constant dream-like state.

Appearance

Zenith is a very beautiful
Human
 woman who has blonde hair that she normally ties in a ponytail with chin-length hair strands hanging on either side, blue shaded eyes, she has a slender build and a voluptuous figure with large breasts (which
Norn Greyrat
 inherited) and she appears more youthful than her actual age as noted in,
 as a result of her being trapped in a magic crystal after the
Teleport Incident
.

Personality

Zenith has a very warm and loving personality, acting as a loving mother who can be strict at times. She is very conservative in morals as a
follower of Millis
, and will get angry at
Paul
 due to the fact that he is a womanizer. She will also get angry when people damage the plants in her garden.

After being freed from the
Teleport Labyrinth
, she does not express emotions actively since she sees the world around her as if she were in a trance or dream. Occasionally she will display actions that show her emotions, such as when she smiled at
Norn
 or hit
Rudeus
 when he said he was going to add
Eris
 to his family as a wife, which shows signs of her personality basically unchanged but hidden and suppressed by her dream state caused by her Miko Powers.

Background

Zenith was born in the
Holy Country of Millis
 as the second daughter of an Earl of Millis. She grew up following the Millis Church religion, never breaking the rules, getting good grades in school and had the nickname
Millis young lady standard
. However, when Zenith reached the age of 15, she rebelled against her parents and ran away from home, thus turning her back on the noble's [road] of being in an arranged marriage with another Earl's family in Millis.






Zenith and Paul settling down in Buena Village



While trying to find a job as a Healer, she was a solo adventurer for a time. However, she was frequently conned out of a large amount of money due to the little knowledge she had on how expensive healers are and being used as a human shield against monsters, but she was later saved by
Paul Greyrat
. She then joined Paul's party, the
Fangs of the Black Wolf
, as a healer. She spent a long time in the party as a healer and gradually began to fall in love with Paul and wanted to marry him. However, Paul was a womanizer who frequently slept with multiple women and she didn't want to be with someone like that, so she told him if he promised to be faithful to her then she would sleep with him, to which he agreed. However, she still thought that if Paul doesn't keep his promise, she will just give up and leave him.

Shortly after she became pregnant with
Rudeus
, Zenith was extremely uneasy and did not know what to do since she had not thought that Paul would keep his promise. However, Paul took responsibility and married her so they both retired from adventuring and settled down in the
Buena Village
 where Zenith works at the village clinic.

『Miko Power』: Telepathy

Zenith has gained the ability to read minds after being trapped in a Magic Crystal during the
Teleport Incident
. A side effect of her power is that she is in a dream like state where she is not fully awake and not able to actually speak, but thinks she is speaking due to her telepathy. Her lack of reaction to her surroundings leads others to think that she has lost all of her memories and ability to speak. She can hear the thoughts of babies and animals with this power, as she thought she was hearing
Lara Greyrat
 and
Leo
 speak, but in reality she was actually reading their minds. Additionally, she is unaffected by
Orsted
's curse of being feared and hated as noted by her remarks to everyone's reactions to him whenever he visits their home in Sharia.
