Mu Wenchang, a member of the
Mu Family
, was one of the  experts who arrived alongside
Mu Jie
,
Mu Yurong
, and
Mu Yitong
 to pursue Yunxiao for the
Merciless Bell
.

Plot

Initially dismissing Yunxiao as unworthy, he was shocked to learn he had reached the peak of the nine-star Martial Sovereign realm. However, upon hearing that Yunxiao possessed a great treasure, greed clouded his judgment, and he immediately sought to claim it.

Wielding a massive black saber forged from one of the heaviest materials in the world
Black-moon blade
, Mu Wenchang attacked without hesitation, believing Yunxiao would be unable to withstand its weight and force. To his shock, Yunxiao effortlessly caught the weapon using his divine ability, manifesting three heads and six arms. Overconfidence turned to desperation as he failed to overpower Yunxiao. When faced with a lethal counterattack, he was forced to abandon his prized saber and retreat in humiliation, as Yunxiao mockingly seized the weapon and dismissed it as worthless scrap.

After
Lord Pu
 appeared and slew many experts of the
Corpse Fiend Sect
 and their corpse puppets with a single sword strike, those who witnessed it were left in shock and disbelief. Seizing the chaos, Mu Wenchang and the others attempted to escape. However, despite his valiant efforts, Mu Wenchang was ultimately caught by
Jing Qi
 and poisoned with the Five Great Extinction Poisons. The deadly toxins ravaged his body, sealing his fate. Unable to resist, he succumbed, his life fading away as he ensured his allies had a chance to survive.
