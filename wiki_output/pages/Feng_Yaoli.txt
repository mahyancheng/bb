Feng Yaoli, the king of the fallen country of Little Bingtian in the far north, who used his wife's life to refine weapons.

Appearance

Huo Dou Form Feng Yaoli's body had grown twice in size, and his entire body was a faint blue. A pair of golden and silver horns grew out of his head, and there were two-colored lightning bolts crackling on them.

Plot

Eternal World

Feng Yaoli arrived at
Bailun Jieyi
 stone house, also seeking the secrets of the Taichu Divine Art’s inheritance. There, he confronted
Yin Yu
, who ultimately killed Bai Lun Jieyi and searched his soul and
Wei Wuya
 that try to stoping him to snatch Bailun Jieyi Body from Yin Yu. However, upon doing so, Yin Yu suffered a powerful backlash, severely injuring his soul consciousness. Witnessing this, Feng Yaoli chose to withdraw, opting not to escalate the conflict any further.

Later had once been fooled by Yunxiao and accidentally made a heart oath that he would never attack Duanmu Youyu again. That was why he had formed an alliance with Yin Yu, trying to snatch the nine luminaries star staff from Duanmu Youyu through Yin Yu.

Power

Feng Yaoli was a True God-level being from the past who possessed the Huo Dou Body, granting him the ability to wield both the power of the Huo Dou bloodline and his own true power Cold True Essence. This Cold True Essence was an embodiment of extreme cold energy, similar to the power of the Beiming family, yet fundamentally different. Feng Yaoli’s cold was absolute, an extreme and pure frost, while the Beiming family’s power carried a hint of yin energy, leaning toward the dominance of Extreme Yin Power.

This person's cultivation, profound level weapon, physical body, and magical powers were all extraordinary. Even an empty realm warrior would not be able to suppress him. Only an existence like the Misty Rock Lord would have a certain chance of victory.

Leng Jian Bingshuang (The Cold Sword’s Frosty Blade) is a Divine/Holy Weapon. It was forged through an extraordinary process—a fortune teller and Feng Yaoli refined an entire kingdom’s space into the sword itself. In doing so, they transformed the Snow Country into an independent realm contained within Leng Jian Bingshuang. Within this space, Feng Yaoli reigns as its absolute master, wielding complete control over its domain.

The Tai Chi Sealing Heaven Seal - innate magical power of the Huodou clan. under the Taiji Heaven Sealing Seal, everything in the Three Realms and Five Elements is sealed. this move consumes a lot of energy, will become extremely weak after performing it.

The Taichu Zhen Jue is one of the Four Great Divine Techniques, possessing the power to counter and rival the Devil Lord’s Ice Fiend Heart Flame. In ancient times, two legendary masters the Realm King and the God of Evolution—each cultivated their own supreme techniques: the Great Realm Divine Art and the Great Evolution Divine Art, respectively. The Taichu Zhen Jue stands on equal footing with these divine arts, neither inferior nor lacking in power. The Taichu Divine Art is an ancient and powerful technique originally created to control the power of time. It grants its practitioner the ability to manipulate time flow, accelerate or decelerate time, and even create time domains. However, over generations, the Taichu lineage misused this divine art not for its intended purpose but to peer into the past and future, attempting to uncover the secrets of fate.
 Just like his senior brother
Bailun Jieyi
, one of the most accomplished practitioners, he had reached only the eight level from nine levels.
