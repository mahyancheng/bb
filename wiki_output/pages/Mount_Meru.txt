Mount Meru, one of the four celestial realms of the continent. Is described as an ancient
Taoist sanctum
 where powerful warriors once trained. However, it was later lost to another world and now
floats in the void
. Mount Meru follows a
specific pattern in its appearances
, resurfacing in the
southern region
 every few decades or centuries, making it a rare and mysterious location. The mountain is
rich in spiritual Qi
, hundreds of times denser than in the realm of heavenly martial arts. This makes it an
ideal place for cultivation
, where just a few months of training is equivalent to years elsewhere. For
genius disciples
, the benefits of training in Mount Meru are immeasurable, likely granting them immense power and rapid progress in martial arts.

After the clash between
Di Jia
 and the Martial Sovereign
Lu Daozi
 that descending and take over
Xu Qing
 body, the space of Mount Meru, which had opened above Martial Flame City, collapsed and merged with the city. As a result, Martial Flame City became rich in spiritual Qi, reaching a level comparable to the other major powers in Tianwu.
