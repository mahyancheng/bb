Ding Ling'er is the head of
Tianyun Merchant Guild
 and one of the eight executive members of the Merchant Union. Appointed by her
Father
, she was entrusted with the mission to strengthen and expand the company.

Appearance

A charming young lady in her twenties, she has a delicate and graceful figure.

Background

Ding Ling'er was a rare talent in the business world, possessing both keen intellect and unwavering determination. Entrusted with the leadership of Tianyuan Trading Company at a young age, she worked tirelessly to uphold her father’s legacy. Under her guidance, the company endured fierce competition and external pressures, proving her capability as a leader. Though lacking the support of the guild’s elite forces, Golden Edge and Silver Light, she navigated treacherous business rivalries with sheer resourcefulness and strategic acumen.

Her ability to turn adversity into opportunity set her apart. She possessed sharp insight, recognizing market shifts and potential alliances before others did. Beyond business acumen, she was a formidable martial artist, a rare combination that made her both respected and feared. However, her greatest strength lay in her unwavering commitment—she bore the weight of Tianyuan Trading Company on her shoulders, driven by a sense of duty rather than personal ambition.

unknowingly aiding in the process

power of eighteen Nine-Star Martial Emperors

Nine Yin or Nine Yang attributes

Ding Ling’er assures Yunxiao that, regardless of the outcome, her father has promised him one pill, which could help him break through to the intermediate Nine-Star level.
