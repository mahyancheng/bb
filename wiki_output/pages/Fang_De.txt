Plot

Fang De closely monitored the situation on the island, particularly the battle between
Li Yunxiao
 and
Luo Qingyun
. He was shocked by the display of power and talent by both fighters and witnessed the intense clashes between their formidable techniques.

As the battle escalated, Fang De and the others set up a barrier to contain the powerful attacks unleashed by Li Yunxiao and Luo Qingyun. Fang De was also involved in deciding the outcome of the crystal stone competition, with the remaining crystal stones unaccounted for due to the damaged array. Ultimately, he decided to end the competition and activate the teleportation array to send everyone back.

After the competition, He discussed with
Xin Pi
 the upcoming Veiled Desolation event and the entry quotas auction in Flame Martial City, which Li Yunxiao planned to host. Fang De returned to the Heaven-Gathering Sect and reported everything to Sect Master
Qi Feng
.
