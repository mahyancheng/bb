Plot

Having successfully severed Yi Fen’s last connection to Noah’s Ship, the Ghost King took full control of the legendary warship. However, his focus quickly shifted to Lin Yunxiao, whose growing power filled him with unease. Ignoring Long Qianmiao, who was extracting the power of the Heavenly Phoenix, the Ghost King furiously charged at Lin Yunxiao, roaring in disbelief, With a massive green palm print infused with the Light of Reincarnation, he struck down, shattering space itself. Yet, just as the attack was about to land, a barrier of golden and black runes emerged, blocking his devastating blow. Shocked, the Ghost King unleashed the Eternal Reincarnation Blade, its power surging through the Great Wheel of Samsara. Despite relentless slashes, the barrier held firm until it finally shattered—but not before Lin Yunxiao opened his eyes, revealing one golden and one black pupil.

A deep, primal fear gripped the Ghost King’s soul. Beads of sweat rolled down his forehead as two True Fiend Dharma Idols—one golden, one black—manifested behind Lin Yunxiao. Each had three heads and six arms, their expressions embodying both divine serenity and demonic wrath. As their power merged, they formed a towering Giant Spirit Dharmakaya, its arms wielding golden and black energy spheres. The Ghost King, refusing to accept defeat, unleashed his strongest strike, summoning the Wheel of Samsara and the Eternal Reincarnation Blade to cut down his foe. But the Giant Spirit Dharmakaya effortlessly blocked both attacks, shattering the blade’s energy into chaos. Fear twisted the Ghost King’s face as Lin Yunxiao made his final move—a black saber, descending from the golden-black nebula.

As the saber fell, space itself began to collapse.

The Ghost King, believing himself invincible, had executed his plans flawlessly, even obtaining Noah’s Ship. However, when faced with Lin Yunxiao, his power was meaningless. He unleashed the Reincarnation Light, an ultimate attack capable of erasing all existence. Yet, Yunxiao’s True Fiend Dharma Idol effortlessly countered it with the Aghan Bone Cleaver, a blade so powerful that it fractured time and space itself. The Ghost King’s strongest technique was shattered in moments, and the very world split in half from Yunxiao’s attack. Terrified, the Ghost King tried to flee, but the blade’s energy pursued him relentlessly.
He made a desperate final stand with Heaven Burning Moon, but his defenses crumbled instantly. Severely wounded and consumed by demonic energy, he collapsed, barely clinging to life. The once unstoppable ruler of Samsara was reduced to a powerless figure, struggling to survive.

The Ghost King attempted to ambush Lin Yunxiao, but it was a trap. Yunxiao had been expecting the attack and lured him in. He summoned the Aghan Bone Cleaver, now radiating golden light, and struck with overwhelming force. The Ghost King, realizing his mistake too late, tried to flee, but the saber strike was inescapable. His body swelled uncontrollably before violently exploding, scattering ghostly energy across the battlefield.

The shockwave injured many warriors, even forcing Wei Qing to spit blood. As the battlefield fell silent, it became clear—the Ghost King had been completely destroyed, his existence erased.

Power

The Ghost King is so powerful that even beings of divine transcendence cannot match him. Wei Qing states that to face the Ghost King, one would need more than eight Ghost Asuras or three experts of divine transcendence to have a chance against him. He even wields the Small Wheel Three-Phase Life Transformation Reincarnation Wheel—an ancient artifact of unparalleled power refined directly from the force of reincarnation. Although this profound weapon contains only a trace of the reincarnation rules, when activated with long preparation, it enables him to unleash 100% of his power already reached the God Realm without being suppressed or restricted by the Heavenly Martial Realm law.

By merging directly with the Wheel of Samsara, he could assimilate everyone trapped within its domain. Bathed in the light of reincarnation, they would be melted into pure energy, becoming his nourishment and strengthening him endlessly.
