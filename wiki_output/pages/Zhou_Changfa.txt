Plot

The Zhou Great Family Crisis

In the confrontation between Zhou Changfa and Yunxiao, Zhou Changfa, the leader of the elders in the Zhou clan, demanded that Yunxiao surrender the Green Phoenix Floating Battleship and kneel for punishment. However, Yunxiao, confident in the warship's power, refused and threatened to self-destruct the warship, causing massive destruction. The situation escalated as the Green Phoenix Floating Battleship descended, and panic spread among the onlookers, including
Ding Ling'er
, who remained fascinated by Yunxiao's audacity. As chaos ensued,
Xin Pi
 and others intervened, urging Yunxiao to stop the impending disaster and offering to mediate a peaceful resolution. Reluctantly, Yunxiao agreed, temporarily halting the warship. However, in a surprising turn, Zhou Changfa launched a powerful attack on Yunxiao, intending to kill him.

Zhou Changfa's attack was temporarily stopped by the talisman Yunxiao used as a defense. However, Yunxiao survived the attack and managed to land on the Green Phoenix Floating Battleship. Yunxiao threatened to self-destruct the warship, prompting panic among the onlookers. As the situation escalated, Xin Pi and others desperately pleaded for him to stop, as the self-destruction of the warship would result in widespread destruction. Finally, Yunxiao halted the warship's descent and engaged in discussions with Xin Pi and Zhou Changfa to resolve the conflict.

Again, Yunxiao threatened to activate the self-destruction of the Green Phoenix Floating Battleship and the six-universe Star Observation formation, causing panic among the onlookers. However, another time, Xin Pi and others pleaded with Yunxiao to stop. After some negotiation, Yunxiao agreed to halt the self-destruction, but he presented his conditions. He demanded the release of
Qin Ruxue
, the compensation of Five Million Mid-Grade Primordial Stones, and a public apology to
Tianshui Kingdom
. Additionally, he requested compensation of Fifty Million Mid-Grade Primordial Stones for his losses. Reluctantly, Xin Pi agreed to the conditions, and Qin Ruxue was released.
 As the situation settled, Yunxiao and Qin Ruxue left on the Green Phoenix Floating Battleship, leaving behind a tense atmosphere and disgruntled Zhou family members. Later,
Baili Gongjin
,
Wang Chen
,
Cheng Feng
, and
Mo Zhai
 were mentioned, leading to suspicions and confrontations between Zhou Changfa and Baili Gongjin, as well as the involvement of Mo Zhai from the Mo family.

The Golden Crow Arena

Xin Pi tried to mediate the situation when Li Yunxiao arrived at the arena with a powerful Martial Grandmaster level demonic beast, stunning everyone. The Zhou family accused Li Yunxiao of cheating in the duel and demanded proof of his beast-taming abilities. Li Yunxiao demonstrated his control over the demonic beast, making it obey his commands, silencing the accusers and impressing the crowd. Later, when Li Yunxiao refused to fight without the beast,
Zhou Changfa
 negotiated and compensated him with Sixty Million Mid-Grade Primal Stones to put it away.

During the duel, Li Yunxiao displayed incredible agility and physical strength with his
Heavenly Tyrant Body Tempering Technique
. He neutralized the powerful strike of Martial King
Zhou Yushan
 and counterattacked with exceptional comprehension and skill in his sword technique.
Xin Ruyu
 observed the performance and saw Li Yunxiao as a formidable rival.

Xin Pi observed the duel between Li Yunxiao and Zhou Yushan and noticed Li Yunxiao's use of a Seal that even surpassed the Floating Life Seal of
Yang Di
. He discussed this with other experts, speculating that Li Yunxiao might be a successor of one of Gu Feiyang's disciples. Zhou Changfa also witnessed the intense clash between Li Yunxiao's Heaven and Earth Seal and Zhou Yushan's Snow & Frost Bright Sword, resulting in Zhou Yushan's disappearance from the stage. The onlookers were shocked by Li Yunxiao's strength and calmly assessed the situation, realizing that there was no one in the
Southern Region
 capable of killing him. After the duel, the Zhou Great Family suffered a significant blow to their reputation due to these events, Zhou Yushan's death and
Zhou Yangbiao
's punishment.
