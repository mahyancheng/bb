Xuan Ping is a teacher at Jialan Academy who claims to be neutral and unaffiliated with any faction. While many teachers secretly support one of the two major powers in Tianshui, Xuan Ping insists that as an academy teacher, it would be inappropriate to intervene in student duels. He emphasizes the need for fairness and justice, refusing to take sides in the fight between Yunxiao and Lan Xuan.
