Ban Bingbai is the commander of the City Guards of Yangpu. At first, when confronting Yunxiao’s group, he follows his duty as the commander, attempting to uphold the law by questioning them and preparing to arrest them based on Wu Guang’s orders. However, he quickly realizes that these youths are not ordinary. When Yunxiao fires the Cloud Piercing Arrow an elite military signal Ban Bingbai immediately recognizes its significance and starts sweating. He understands that the people he’s dealing with have a powerful background, far beyond his ability to handle.

As soon as Yunxiao’s two-thousand-strong army arrives, Ban Bingbai is paralyzed with fear. The overwhelming killing intent and the presence of a Martial Lord leave him no choice but to stand down. He quickly realizes that Wu Guang has caused an enormous disaster, and he refrains from taking further action. Instead, he anxiously waits for Wu Guang’s father, City Lord Wu Liantian, to arrive and take control of the situation.
