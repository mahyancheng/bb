Relationships

Xiao Qingwang is a Martial King and a high-ranking commander of the
Tianshui Kingdom
. Once a powerful and influential figure, his authority has gradually weakened over the years, to the point where he can no longer fully control all five units of the State Guardians. Just like
Chen Dashen
, he was afflicted by extreme cold poison after participating in the ranking battle 5 years ago, which significantly hindered his strength.

Appearance

He had a facial complexion that looked like iron, his air as mighty as mountains and rivers.

Personality

He values honor and loyalty, showing a strong sense of duty to repay kindness. Despite his waning influence, he remains a respected and formidable figure in the kingdom.

Backgroud

Xiao Qingwang was no ordinary general. Unlike those who fought for wealth or titles, he fought for the
state itself
. His loyalty did not lie with a crown but with the very existence of Tianshui. To him, rulers were fleeting, but the land and its people endured. He saw weakness and corruption spreading like a disease, and he did what warriors do best
he cut it down without hesitation
. Even the royal family was not spared from his ruthless justice.

Plot

Since his internal injuries healed, his strength has been continuously improved. In addition, as a senior executive of Yanwu City, he had received great support from the Tianyuan Chamber of Commerce, and his strength has also improved by leaps and bounds. Now he is a two-star martial master.
