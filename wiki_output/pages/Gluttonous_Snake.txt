Gluttonous Snake, is a descendant of a true spirit with powerful spatial abilities. Its cultivation revolves entirely around endless consumption—it constantly devours everything in its path, as if it can never be full. As it eats, its body grows proportionally, and when it reaches a certain limit, the consumed matter condenses within it, forming an internal space of varying size and quality. Some of these internal spaces can be as vast as half a city, capable of housing millions of people. This ability makes the Gluttonous Snake an ideal refuge for hidden families or sects, allowing them to exist in secrecy within the creature’s body.

Trivia

the internal space of the snake is restricted by the rules.
