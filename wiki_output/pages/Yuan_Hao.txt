New King

The Golden Crow Arena

He was with
Baili Gongjin
 when they observed the duel between
Li Yunxiao
 and
Zhou Yushan
 through a water screen in a luxurious room. When Li Yunxiao used the Mortal World Seal, Yuan Hao noticed that it was different from the Floating Life Seal of
Yang Di
, and he expressed curiosity about this unknown seal. Baili Gongjin explained that Yang Di's seal had three styles, and the Mortal World Seal was the second style that Yang Di had searched for but couldn't find. Yuan Hao was shocked to witness the power of the Mortal World Seal as it clashed with Zhou Yushan's Wu Hook Sword Ray. Later, when the Heaven and Earth Seal appeared, Yuan Hao was among those amazed by the overwhelming power and speculated about Li Yunxiao's potential connection to Gu Feiyang's disciples.
