The Four Seas royal families, descendants of the dragon race, also hold ties to this land, though their bloodlines have weakened over generations. Among them, the First Dragon, the progenitor of the East China Sea Dragon Clan, remains the most revered, possessing power comparable to the ancient True Spirits.

History

The Rainland of the East China Sea is not just a vast and mysterious region—it is the remnant of an ancient Dragon Domain, once created and ruled by a True Dragon Lord. Over time, this domain shattered, leaving behind a fragment imbued with immense True Dragon power, which later became known as Rainland. Rainland is believed to have evolved into a sacred land for the dragons, a place where their wounds heal rapidly, and their strength is continuously nourished. The land itself carries unique laws of existence, separate from the Tianwu Realm, making it an independent space beyond the normal constraints of time, space, and elemental balance.

At the heart of Rainland lies the legendary World Sword, a divine weapon believed to be in the possession of the Dragon Head, the ruler of the region. Che You, a formidable dragon warrior, desires to reclaim the World Sword and unlock the deeper mysteries hidden within Rainland, believing that its true nature still holds remnants of the Dragon Realm’s original power.
