Personality

Shui Luoyan comes across as proud, competitive, and somewhat dismissive, with a strong sense of superiority, especially in martial strength. She is straightforward and blunt in her speech, never hesitating to challenge or question others. However, this also makes her appear arrogant, ignorant, and overconfident, as seen when she openly doubts Yunxiao’s strength after hearing of his victory against
Luo Qingyun
. She underestimates him completely, even going so far as to claim that she could kill him with a single finger.

Said to be one of the two beauties of the Merchant Union aside from
Ding Ling'er
.
