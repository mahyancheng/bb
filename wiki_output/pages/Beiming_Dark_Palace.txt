Plot

Li Yunxiao learns of a mysterious dark stone from outer space, which could help demons break through to the Holy Demon Realm. Determined to prevent disaster, he heads to Beiming Xuan Palace to secure the stone. However, the Beiming family is reluctant to cooperate. When negotiations fail, Li Yunxiao confronts Bei Ming Duan Jue and Mu He, overpowering them with ease.

Their last hope lies in Bei Ming Zhan Guan, an ancestor, who confronts Li Yunxiao. Despite the tension, Zhan Guan offers to negotiate, but refuses to surrender the Xuanming Stone. Li Yunxiao reveals the stone’s demonic origin, warning that its misuse could cause catastrophe.

As the discussion intensifies, a mysterious figure Zhan Guan's brother and a powerful demon cultivator emerges.

After Li Yunxiao's offer and negotiations are rejected by both Bei Ming ancestors, he confronts the Bei Ming family to seize the Heavenly Mysterious Dark Stone. In a fierce battle, Yunxiao transforms into a powerful being with three heads and six arms. He creates a golden vortex to absorb spiritual energy and unleashes the devastating "Xingxuan Explodes" move. Bei Ming Du Jian counters with his black giant sword, but Yunxiao's immense power overwhelms him. Although injured, Du Jian survives but is visibly shaken.

In Second move Yunxiao summons a massive thundercloud, forming a giant hammer that transforms into a dragon, symbolizing unstoppable power. Du Jian, refusing to yield, uses his ultimate move, "Who Else but Me," embodying the pride and strength of the Bei Ming lineage. The colossal clash destroys the entire Bei Ming Xuan Palace, leaving a massive crater. Though defeated, Du Jian survives.

Seeing his brother fall, Bei Ming Zhan Suan attempts to intervene but is blocked by the Six Dings and Six Jias formation. Taking advantage of the chaos, Mo ambushes and fatally wounds Zhan Suan. Meanwhile, Bei Ming Duan Jue tries to escape but is intercepted by Wei Qing, who captures him using the Yin-Yang Qi Bottle—a treasure capable of storing both people and objects.

Wei Qing then captures the severely injured Bei Ming ancestors and other surviving Bei Ming members, ensuring their complete defeat.
