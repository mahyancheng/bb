Former Member of the Alchemist Association, wanted by the Sea of Soul Formation.

Appearance

He was old and had a Vulture-like face.

Personality

Qiu Mujie is a ruthless and fanatical alchemist who values his pursuit of the highest art above all else, even at the cost of countless lives. He sees ordinary people as insignificant and believes their sacrifice for his research is an honor. His complete disregard for morality and his obsession with experimentation have earned him the nickname "Mad Jie."

Background

In the study of the human body, there was no one in the world who was better than him.

History

After Qiu Mujie became a wanted man by the Sea of Soul Formation, Wei Qing offered him protection in exchange for his assistance in a grand project. Together, they secretly conducted experiments to create a god. To support this, Wei Qing invested immense resources into Qiu Mujie’s research on Body Fusion.

Meanwhile, Qiu Mujie secretly worked on perfecting his ultimate body, finding ways to overcome its shortcomings and eliminate the backlash of fusion. Though his results were groundbreaking, they were merely a small branch of Wei Qing’s larger experiment—one that Wei Qing remained unaware of.

Eventually, Wei Qing no longer needed Qiu Mujie, having likely mastered the true method of achieving full physical perfection. Seeing no further use for him, he attempted to kill Qiu Mujie, discarding both the scientist and the Countercharge Balancing Technique he once relied on.

Plot

Later, Qiu Mujie was sent by
Wei Qing
 specifically to capture Li Yunxiao. Wei Qing was well aware that Qiu Mujie’s submissiveness was merely an act and that he had long harbored intentions of betrayal. That was why he secretly assigned Xiao Xiao and Huan Mie, two peak nine-star Martial Emperor experts, to monitor him in the shadows.

Qiu Mujie clashed with Li Yunxiao in Fengling City after attempting to seize
Narcissus
. Both sides unleashed their trump cards, with Qiu Mujie even revealing his true form—a half-mermaid beast—pushing Li Yunxiao into a desperate struggle that left him injured and forced back. However, before the battle could reach its conclusion, interference came from multiple sides. Forces from
Crimson Crescent City
, the
Sea of Soul Formation
, and Wei Qing’s subordinates all joined the fray. Even
Yu Shengfeng
 made an appearance, suppressing everyone and ultimately putting an end to the fight.

Technique

Qiu Mujie’s ultimate body was a terrifying fusion of countless supreme traits from various powerful races. His body incorporated the feet of a Truth Listener, the feathers of a Black Swamp bird, the arms of a Golden Ape, the ominous claws, and the thousand Immemorial Heaven’s Eyes—each an extraordinary existence on its own. Yet, his transformation didn’t stop there. He possessed green eyes, a strange horn on his forehead, feelers on his head, a copper nose, the ears of a Silver Eagle, dragon scales covering his body, and the long tail of a Suan Ni,Centaur, mermaid etc. A living assembly of a hundred races, Qiu Mujie had defied the natural order, achieving an unprecedented balance that allowed him to retain his divine sense despite his monstrous form.

Qiu Mujie’s quasi-Sage body possesses a unique trait—he can harness both his sea of Qi and his demonic core simultaneously. Moreover, he has several spare dantian demonic cores stored within the bodies of demonic beasts. This allows him to bypass restrictions placed on his cultivation. If someone attempts to suppress him, he can simply self-destruct his original dantian to break free, just as he did when Yu Shengfeng tried to seal his power—immediately replacing it with one of his spare cores.

He was perhaps the first in history to achieve such an unimaginable transformation without suffering conflict or backlash.

Qiu Mujie’s recovery technique is both bizarre and effective. A ripple forms on his chest, with his belly button as the center, before suddenly expanding into a fist-sized opening. From within, a fish head slowly emerges, absorbing essence pills and instantly converting them into Yuan power. The energy flows through his body, rapidly healing his injuries until he is fully restored within moments. Though undeniably powerful, its strange appearance left Yunxiao both impressed and embarrassed, suggesting that Qiu Mujie find a way to make it more aesthetically acceptableas even he might consider using it if it looked better.

Kurosawa Feather/feather of the dark swamp has an extremely powerful spatial ability combine with his powerful mental energy. With a slight flap of his wings, the runes on his black feathers flashed, and he can instantly teleported away.

The Qi Transformation Vortex is Qiu Mujie's ultimate technique, achieved by self-destructing eleven ninth-tier demonic cores simultaneously. When multiple ninth-tier cores explode at once, the resulting force rivals the attack of a Divine Transcendence expert. He resorted to this technique when pushed to the brink by Nanfeng Xuan,
