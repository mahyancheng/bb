Land Of No Return

Bai Zhansheng, leader of the Thousand Mountains Prefecture, faces accusations from Great Elder Mao Haokong, who claims Bai is colluding with the demon race to break the seal of Five Cloud Mountain. Mao brings two dark agents from the Holy Region, Fei Cheng and Tai Yuan, as witnesses. They demand Bai surrender the seal’s key, claiming demons have infiltrated the prefecture. Bai refuses without an official decree from the Holy Region's council, suspecting foul play.
