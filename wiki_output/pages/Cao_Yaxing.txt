Mount Meru

Cao Yaxing was one of the individuals involved in the confrontation with
Di Jia
, a powerful cultivator who had been sealed for a long time. Cao Yaxing, along with his companions, tried to resist Di Jia's overwhelming strength, but their efforts proved futile against the black demonic power he possessed.

During the battle, Cao Yaxing and his allies utilized their most potent treasures and techniques, including Seven Rank Xuan Weapons and powerful Eight-Rank talisman, to confront Di Jia. However, Di Jia's black demonic claw effortlessly destroyed their defenses and shattered their Xuan Weapons. Their attempts to resist him were in vain.

As the battle intensified, Cao Yaxing and his companions witnessed the overwhelming power of Di Jia's demonic technique, leading to fear and desperation among them. They were unable to find a way to overcome the immense strength displayed by their adversary.
