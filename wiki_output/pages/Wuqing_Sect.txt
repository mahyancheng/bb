Unbeknownst to them, someone had arrived before them and had already caused devastation—killing the Sect Master of Wuqing Sect in the process. Their arrival, unfortunately, coincided with the aftermath of this attack. The remaining members of the Wuqing Sect and two of their all still in shock and angered by their leader’s sudden death, immediately turned their suspicions toward Li Yunxiao and his companions. Believing that their Sect Master's murder was directly linked to Yunxiao's arrival, the Wuqing Sect accused them of orchestrating the attack.
