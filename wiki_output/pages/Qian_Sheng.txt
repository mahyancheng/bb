Plot

Eternal World

During a crucial meeting, Qian Sheng proposed that the
Money Sect
 join Li Yunxiao’s alliance, seeing it as a strategic move to secure their future. His offer surprised many, as the Money Sect had remained independent despite pressure from the two major business alliances. However, with the world in turmoil, finding a powerful backer seemed necessary.

Qian Sheng suggested naming the alliance after Yunxiao, calling it the Yun Alliance.
Chen Duantian
 objected, arguing that an alliance of many sects shouldn't be named after one person.

In response, Li Yunxiao playfully exaggerated the name, proposing the Super Tianwu Alliance, a righteous cause that will last for eternity and be invincible throughout the universe. The name amused some, but ultimately,
Heavenly Martial Alliance
 was settled upon.
