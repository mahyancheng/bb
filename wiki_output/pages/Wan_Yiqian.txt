Plot

New Yan City

Wan Yiqian, approached Li Yunxiao, in the
New Yan city
 hoping to enlist his help against
Ling Baiyi
, who had disrespected the merchant alliance. Though normally cautious, Wan admitted this was one of the riskiest moves in his life. He offered Yunxiao a rare merchant token, granting full access to the Union’s resources, showing his sincerity. Yunxiao, however, was uninterested, believing the plan was too dangerous. Wan tried to persuade him, reminding him of their past agreement and his strong martial heart. Despite Yunxiao’s refusal, Wan hinted at deeper secrets, insisting that the Myriad Treasures Tower could offer him great benefits. He invited Yunxiao to discuss further in a safer place, wary of prying eyes. Though still hesitant, Yunxiao accepted the token, knowing its value, and pondered the situation as Wan’s projection vanished.

After the battle in
New Yan City
,
Wan Yiqian
 suffered a devastating blow, both physically and politically. As the head of
Myriad Treasures Store
, the most powerful faction in the
Merchant Union
, he had long been a dominant force in the business world. However,
Ding Shan's betrayal
 and his
expulsion from the Council of the Business Alliance
 shattered his standing overnight.

The shock of being cast out left
Wan Yiqian
 in a furious and desperate state. His rage nearly pushed him to self-destruction—
he attempted to detonate his dantian and the Cosmic Light Plate
 in a last-ditch effort to take
Ding Shan
 down with him. However, his attempt was thwarted by
Cangwu Qiong
, the ruler of the Sanctuary, who effortlessly sealed his divine weapon and stripped him of his chance at vengeance. At that moment,
Wan Yiqian realized that Ding Shan had been backed by the Sanctuary all along
,

Originally part of Ten Thousand Treasure Store's Ancient Treasure Trove, the
Tyrant Body Tempering Art
 was inside a medium of inheritance. Wan Yiqian sold it to the
Ao Family
, one of the
Hidden Families
.

Later, as a token of gratitude they gave Wan Yiqian the first part of the
Tyrant Body Tempering Art
 in a Jade Slip and the promise to owe him a favor.

Wan Yiqian sold Gu Feiyang
Tyrant Body Tempering Art
, but didn't tell him that he only got the first part of that technique. He wanted to see the consequences of only cultivating the first half of that technique.

Power

The cosmic light plate was a profound level weapon. The other half of it was called the universe light plate. The combination of the two was famous even in the ancient times.
