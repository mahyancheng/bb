Plot

Peng Yue suffered a
merciless beating
 at the hands of Yunxiao and
Che You
. After attempting to delay
Fei Ni
 succession as sect master, Yunxiao decided to
forcefully persuade him
 by ensuring he would be bedridden for the exact time he claimed to need for deliberation. Despite the shocking cruelty, no one dared to speak up in Peng Yue’s defense, as he had
colluded with
Wei Qing
 and was widely disliked. In a final, devastating move, Che You
crippled half of Peng Yue’s dantian
, ensuring that even after he recovered, his
cultivation would permanently drop below the Martial Sovereign realm
.
