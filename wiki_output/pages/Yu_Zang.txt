Appearance

A man with  a terrifying scar that ran down from the left side of his forehead, passing through his eyes, nose, and lips, embedding itself several inches deep into his face. The scar wriggled like a centipede.

Personality

Yu Zang is too narrow-minded person.

Plot

He died after Li Yunxiao performed a soul search on him and then crushed his head for attempting to expel Li Yunxiao and his party as they tried to enter the inner Battle Soul Mountain.

Trivia

Cultivators at his level could change their appearance at will, and healing this degree of scar was a piece of cake. However, this person had obviously kept it on purpose, and the meaning was self-evident.
