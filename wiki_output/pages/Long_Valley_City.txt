Long Valley City, one of the main cities of the Eastern Region.

Plot

Long Valley City was once a battleground of competing families, but under Shuai Junwei’s rule, the Shuai family rose to dominance. Through strategic alliances and ruthless decisions, they secured their position, even gaining influence over the powerful Ink Feather Merchant Association. However, their stability was shaken when Li Yunxiao intervened in their arranged marriage with the Du family. Fearing disaster, Junwei swiftly broke off the engagement, redirecting the situation to maintain peace. Despite the initial shock, the crisis ended with a strengthened bond between Long Valley City and Earth Dragon City, as the Shuai family cleverly turned a potential conflict into a new alliance.
