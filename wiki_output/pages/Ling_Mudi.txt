SPOILER ALERT!

He is the King of the Northern Region. He participated in the Ancient Demon Sealing War 100,000 years ago.

Personality

Ling mudi personality was once calm and wise, like a kind elder, but the influence of the Rainbow Stone had gradually eroded his mind, pushing him into a demonic state. Under its effects, his thoughts became chaotic, his emotions unstable, and his actions ruthless, as if he were no longer the same person. Even after the stone was removed, the corruption of tens of thousands of years could not be undone instantly. Though he regained some of his former clarity, he admitted that he might never fully return to the Ling Mudi of old—not until his very soul faded away.

Background

100,000 years ago, Ling Mudi was invited by Lord Universe God to take part in the Demon-Sealing War. As one of the Four Domain Monarchs, ruling over the Eastern, Western, Southern, and Northern Domains, his status was once above that of the current Seven Sect Masters, nearly on par with the Masters of the Two Holy Lands. Back then, these monarchs stood at the pinnacle of power, playing a crucial role in shaping the fate of the world during the great war.

Plot

after his remnant soul come from the void he then  possessed the gourd Little King Kong.

Beifeng Nan and Ling mudi, once allies, clashed over the fate of the Rainbow Stone. Beifeng Nan believed it should aid the new generation, honoring their fallen comrades' sacrifice. Ling Mudi, however, saw it as a sacred relic too dangerous to fall into unknown hands. Their differing ideals led to a battle.

Ling Mudi acknowledged Li Yunxiao as the master of this generation’s World Deity and the chosen one. Given his age and achievements, even if he had lived a hundred thousand years ago, he would still have been an extraordinary genius. He truly deserved to possess the Divine Realm Tablet. Ling Mudi had a deep connection with the tablet’s previous owner and stated that its reappearance signaled the arrival of another great tribulation.

Power

Ling Mudi is undoubtedly one of the greatest alchemists of all time. His unparalleled skill allows him to extract the power of fundamental rules, and with the right materials, he can forge divine steel and craft tenth-tier items.

The Seven-Colored Tusita Heaven, crafted by Lord Ling Mudi, is an ancient profound-level weapon with power rivaling Saint weapons. However, due to incomplete materials, only a three-colored version was created using three Extreme Earth-type origins. Before the Demon-Sealing War, the warriors of Two World Mountain sought to complete it but failed to obtain the remaining four supreme earth elements. Now in Yunxiao’s hands, this tricolored Tusita Heaven still possesses immense weight and earth energy. If fully cultivated, it could manifest the divine ability of the Boundless Pure Land, that has infinite weight and heaviness would probably kill anyone who touched it, becoming an unrivaled force under the current sky.

Rainbow stone can also nourish the soul
