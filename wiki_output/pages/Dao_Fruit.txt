Eating a Dao fruit allows the cultivator to comprehend the Dao Intent according to the grade of the fruit and greatly enhances their Yuan Qi. Dao Fruits exist from the 1st to 9th grade, with 1st grade containing First Origin Realm Dao Intent and 9th grade the Martial Sovereign Dao Intent. They are primarily used for the comprehension of the Martial Dao and rarely to enhance a cultivators Yuan Qi.

i.e.

Seven Constellation Dao Fruit allows comprehension of the Martial Emperors Dao Laws, which means after consuming it they only need to increase their Yuan Qi to reach the peak of Martial Emperor Realm and no longer need to worry about the comprehension of the Dao.
