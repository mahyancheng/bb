Armor (Armor of Nightshadow),
 an artifact of unparalleled power. His brother,
Bai Lingyue
, desperately tried to claim it but was brutally rejected, his flesh burned away. With the armor fully merging with Ling Baiyi, his strength skyrocketed, and a single strike from his
Six Wounds Purple Blade
 tore open the sky, nearly splitting the city in two. Those who opposed him, including
Ming Zhen

and
Ming Jian
, were effortlessly slain. The execution became a bloodbath, marking

Power

Ramayana Armor
, Ling Baiyi's armor is the legendary God-level and terrifying piece of equipment passed down through the Ling family. This armor is capable of summoning
Ramayana
, the God of Slaughter.
 Primarily purple-black in color, the armor can manifest a towering giant spirit behind Ling Baiyi, mirroring his movements and exponentially enhancing his strength. However, once completely refined, the armor undergoes a profound transformation. It is reborn under a new name—the
Nightshadow Armor
.  Upon achieving complete fusion with the armor, Ling Baiyi undergoes a shocking metamorphosis—his body expands by over three feet, his skin becomes covered in purple scales, and two ominous horns sprout from his forehead. At that moment, he no longer merely summons Ramayana—he becomes Ramayana himself, a living embodiment of
the God of Slaughter
.

Crimson Crescent City
