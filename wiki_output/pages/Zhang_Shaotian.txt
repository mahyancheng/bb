Plot

Demon Origin Plains

Zhang Shaotian and his four junior members, arrive on the scene, revealing their sinister nature and the terrifying power of their sect. They unveil a black banner bearing a frightening image, representing the Devouring Soul Sect's brutal reputation for extracting souls. This sight instills fear and recognition among the gathered warriors, including
Zou Chen
 and
Kang Wu
.

Kang Wu, once defiant and confident, is reduced to submission before the Devouring Soul Sect, showing the sect's fearsome influence. Despite the warriors' initial resistance, they find themselves trapped in a desperate battle against the Soul Devouring Banner wielded by the Devouring Soul Sect members. The sect employs soul-extracting techniques to immobilize and capture some of the warriors, subjecting them to the horrifying process of soul extraction.

Zhang Shaotian's junior members display cruel delight in the martial artists' suffering, likening it to their enjoyment of extracting souls from demonic beasts. The horrifying power of the Soul Devouring Banner is demonstrated as the martial artists' souls are consumed, leaving behind lifeless bodies. This nightmarish scene of despair showcases the callous and ruthless cultivation methods of the Devouring Soul Sect.

As the Devouring Soul Sect members continue to extract souls, an unexpected turn of events unfolds. A horde of Five Elements Spirit Devouring Rats, possessing wings and the ability to fly, emerges from the ground. These rats overwhelm the sect members, forcing them to flee in the face of this unexpected threat.

Later, he killed two juniors of the four who were with him, which leaded his Soul Devouring Barrier to reach the 9th Rank. Just as they continued their journey they encounter
Qing Luo
 and her companions from the
Empyrean One Pavillion
, eventually, they killed her and all her companions and continued their journey.

Illusionary Realm of the Water Moon Flower Mirror

Inside the Illusionary Realm of the Water Moon Flower Mirror, Zhang Shaotian and his juniors confront
Li Yunxiao
,
Ye Fan
 and their companions. They demand information on how to break the array and offers to spare Li Yunxiao's life if he complies. Li Yunxiao initiates an attack against Zhang Shaotian and his group. Li Yunxiao employs his Eye Technique and Spring Life Qi to confound and suppress Zhang Shaotian, temporarily gaining the upper hand. However, Zhang Shaotian manages to counteract the attack and escapes the restraints. The Soul Devouring Clan members vow to follow the Sacred Fire Temple group through the illusion. Li Yunxiao successfully uses his array skills to shift the Tiger King War Chariot into the Summer Boundary, the next layer of the Four Seasons Boundary.

Later, in another place,
Li
's attempt to break the formation triggers catastrophic consequences, Little Qing, who has been observing, warns that disaster is looming. The formation's instability leads to the sudden rise of an enormous ice mountain that engulfs Li, while the surrounding area experiences chaotic shifts between the four seasons.

The mountain's peak undergoes rapid transformations, with spring, summer, autumn, and winter all manifesting at different levels. The mountain's appearance reflects the four seasons, with spring at the midpoint, peach blossoms, withered trees, and snow at the base. Meanwhile, an immense boundary of the four seasons emerges in the distance, revealing the Immortal Mountain of lord
Throne
.

Li Yunxiao successfully defends himself against an ambush by Zhang Shaotian and his fellow Soul Devouring Sect disciples. Utilizing his control over the rule of Autumn, he overpowers one of the disciples and eliminates him. Zhang Shaotian is taken aback by Li Yunxiao's ability to wield the power of rules and realizes the threat he poses.

Li Yunxiao proposes a cooperation to escape the barrier and seize Throne's Immortal Mountain. Zhang Shaotian is intrigued by the potential of obtaining the Immortal Mountain and agrees to the plan, with the condition that Li Yunxiao shares the secret method to condense the laws of heaven and earth, which could bolster his strength to contend with the Martial Sovereigns from Myriad Star Valley.

With Zhang Shaotian's brute force, they retrieve a powerful artifact, a long gray banner, from the body of a deceased junior disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect. The banner's main soul has been extracted, and its power diminished, but the artifact still holds a malevolent aura.

Four Seasons Immortal Mountain

Li Yunxiao
 and his group, including Zhang Shaotian and others, enter the Immortal Mountain and are awed by the profound changes in the surroundings. Li Yunxiao reveals that the Soul Devouring Sect members possess a secret technique for soul-searching, which they can use to locate living and even deceased souls. This technique sparks both intrigue and discomfort among the group. Zhang Shaotian employs his Soul Devouring Sect's soul-searching ability through a golden soul slave to find traces of other individuals within the vast mountain. That leaded to a fight against
Tang Jie
 and his Companions.

As Zhang Shaotian's Soul Devouring Gonfalon faces off against Tang Jie's Vermilion Bird Saber, the confrontation creates a stunning clash of power. Tang Jie's profound artifact is a ninth-grade weapon, and its overwhelming strength surprises Zhang Shaotian, making him realize the potential benefits of refining a ninth-grade profound artifact in conjunction with his Soul Devouring Gonfalon. This revelation adds to Zhang Shaotian's determination to capture Tang Jie and take advantage of his connection to the Vermilion Bird Saber.

As the battle unfolds, Tang Jie's fear reaches its peak as he witnesses the horrifying power of the golden soul slave when Zhang Shaotian extract the soul of the living
Dan Yangze
. However,
Shen Feng
 intervenes to save Tang Jie, suppressing the soul slave and briefly turning the tide of the battle. Zhang Shaotian retreats, and a standoff ensues between Shen Feng and Li Yunxiao's group.

Tang Jie seeks to persuade Shen Feng to eliminate their enemies, but Shen Feng hesitates due to the dangerous environment and the potential for wasting his strength. Li Yunxiao engages in a tense verbal exchange with Shen Feng, asserting that he is not afraid and even challenging Shen Feng's strength. Shen Feng eventually decides not to engage in a direct confrontation, opting to leave the situation for later resolution outside the barrier.

Shen Feng shares his findings about the Immortal Mountain's strange environment and the disappearance of Mister Yu and his group. They discover a peculiar cliff that absorbs divine sense and essence upon contact, revealing a hidden space resembling a giant chessboard.
Shang
 and the other Great Monsters, including
Yu
, also appear in this space. Tang Jie's eagerness for revenge against Li Yunxiao intensifies. Shang orders an attack against Li Yunxiao and his group, including Zhang Shaotian. However, the unique environment suppresses the use of Primordial Qi and Essence, rendering the attackers powerless. Li Yunxiao's true power becomes apparent as he effortlessly defeats Tang Jie despite the restrictions, leaving the group of Great Monsters stunned.
