Plot

Five Cloud Mountain

Amidst the conflict,
Shang
 offered the Holy Land warriors a chance to retreat, but insisted that Yunxiao stay. Hei Yuhu, leader of the Holy Land forces, hesitated, realizing the future threat a unified demon race under Shang could pose. Yunxiao pointed out that supporting
Huang
 could prevent greater conflict in the future. After deep contemplation, Hei Yuhu decided to side with Huang, choosing to confront Shang and Mo to protect the balance between the human and demon races.

Later when the human forces were surrounded and suppressed by thousands of powerful monsters, they struggled to withstand the relentless, locust-like bombardment. One formation after another fell, and even the mighty Five Star Formation was eventually broken.

In a desperate final attempt, Hei Yuhu chose to self-destruct along with the ninth-level battleship, sacrificing himself.
