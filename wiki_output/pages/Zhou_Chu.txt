Plot

Zhou Chu told his master,
Cangwu Qiong
, that
Li Yunxiao
 was arrogant but incredibly strong. When he hesitantly asked if Li Yunxiao was really Gu Feiyang, Cangwu Qiong confirmed it with certainty, expressing his surprise.
Recalling his past conflict with Li Yunxiao in Xinyan City, Zhou Chu grew nervous, fearing retaliation. Meanwhile, Cangwu Qiong decided to visit
Ren Ximin
 in Linghua Wonderland before making any moves.
