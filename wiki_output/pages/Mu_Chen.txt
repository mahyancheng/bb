Mu Chen was one of the greatest puppeteers in the history of the Mu family, earning the title "Venerable Puppet Master." He was an extraordinary figure from tens of thousands of years ago, and every disciple of the Mu family knew of his legendary achievements. His knowledge and innovations in puppetry were far beyond his time, and his theories hinted at groundbreaking advancements.

History

One of his most ambitious ideas, recorded in a jade slip, was the concept of developing puppets into an independent race, granting them intelligence equal to that of humans.
Mu Chen was also responsible for crafting the Royal Chariot, which he believed was the pinnacle of puppet craftsmanship, representing a qualitative leap in puppet evolution.
Among his many achievements, he also created the Twelve Dingjia Puppets, each of which was a ninth-rank puppet equipped with unique divine abilities. These puppets were an integral part of the Six Ding Six Jia Formation, which had the potential to set up the legendary Twelve Divine Beings Killing Formation, one of the three great ancient ominous formations.
Despite his remarkable contributions, the Mu family’s renowned Three Great Puppetry Techniques—Transforming Beans into Soldiers, Six Ding Six Jia, and the mysterious number one technique—did not entirely reflect Mu Chen’s ideology. There was speculation that his Royal Chariot(Yu Tianyi]] might have been connected to this unknown first-ranked technique, but no clear records confirmed it.
