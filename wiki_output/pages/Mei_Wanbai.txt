History

A decade ago, Wanbai lost the Mei family heirloom—the key to unlocking the gate to their secret river, the Wuding River. As punishment, the Mei family head at the time sentenced her and her husband to execution. Before being thrown into the Wuding River, family members cast a gravity technique, causing them to sink instantly.

However, Wanbai had never actually lost the key. She had secretly stolen it to save her daughter, Mei Dong’er, from an incurable disease, using its power to aid in her recovery.

After a decade had passed, before Grandma Wo passed away, she told Mei Dong’er about her mother’s final wish—to return to the Mei family and bring the key back to Plum Valley. When Mei Dong’er came of age.

Trivia

the reason wanbai wait for Mei Donger entered adulthood to return the key is because Mei Donger body would automatically heal once he entered adulthood.
