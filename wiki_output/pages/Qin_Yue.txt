Qin Yue was a standout prince of the Tianshui royal family, known for his
handsome appearance, wisdom, and strategic mind
. Despite being only a year older than
Li Yunxiao
, he carried himself with
nobility and foresight
, displaying the
aura of a ruler in the making
.

However, his path to the throne was
fraught with political danger
, as his older brother,
Prince
Qin Yang
, held the strongest claim. Refusing to submit to fate,
Qin Yue gathered powerful allies
, including the mysterious
Bai Mou
, Li Yunxiao and
Li Family
 to position himself as a serious contender.

His greatest advantage and potential downfall was
the favor of his ailing father, King
Qin Zheng
. With the king’s health deteriorating, time was running out. If Qin Yue did not act soon,
his brother would seize power, and his chance to rule would be lost forever
.

Trivia

His Father give him The
Sanskrit Sea and Cloud Flag
 was a powerful artifact crafted by the legendary master refiner
Yang Di
 for the woman he loved. Its greatest strength lay in its ability to create an impenetrable barrier, capable of withstanding all attacks below the
Martial King
 level. the flag given to
Prince Qin Yue
 was not the original but rather a
defective prototype
 from Yang Di’s first attempt at refining it. While still formidable, this version of the artifact could only last
for one hour
 before its energy was depleted.
