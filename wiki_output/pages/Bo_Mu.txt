History

In the past Qiu had encountered a crisis: his
Dharmakaya (true body)
 had become a liability, and he needed it to be sealed away temporarily. He turned to Bo Mu, entrusting him with this task. As a sign of gratitude and faith, Qiu Nu gifted him the
True Sun Mantra
, a profound technique imbued with the power of the dragons. a highly valuable technique that later became an inherited secret within Bo Mu’s family.

However, the tides of fate turned cruel. At some point after the sealing of Qiu Nu’s Dharmakaya,
Bo Mu was captured by the Demon Master
, enslaved through a forbidden technique, and forced to serve under demonic influence. The once-proud Sea God became a mere tool, shackled to the will of the demons.

Qiu Nu, witnessing this, was faced with a difficult choice. He could risk his own power to free Bo Mu or let fate take its course. In the end,
