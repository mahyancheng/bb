Yunxiao and Bei Fengnan combined their powers by merging the Thunder Realm with the Seven Illusions Green Nightmare. Yunxiao named this devastating technique the "Crazy and Cool Spinning Yo-Yo for Eternity."

Their combined attack created a vast world of thunder and poison, spreading across the endless sky. Wherever the green light passed, everything withered, and the world lost its color and sound. Those caught within the Thunder Realm were stunned and gradually turned to dust without resistance.

This powerful move reversed the tide of battle, securing the human race's fortune for thousands of years. The technique became legendary, known as one of the most terrifying large-scale attacks in history. In a single strike, four thousand elite demons were reduced to ashes, with half of them killed or severely injured.
