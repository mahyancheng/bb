Han Bai
 is one of
Li Yunxiao
's hardcore supporters.  The first appearance of
Han Bai
 was he,
Chen Zhen
 &
Qin Ruxue
 arguing with
Lan Fei
 and his minion.

Background

Han Bai
 appeared to be one of
Li Yunxiao
's best friends, and since he was not a martial artist, he and
Chen Zhen
 always tried to protect him.

History

New Li Yunxiao

Han Bai
 and Chen Zhen tried to protect Li Yunxiao from Du Feng and Luo Jie, but unfortunately, despite Han Bai's strength as a 4-chakra Martial Apprentice, Luo Jie was a 5-chakra Martial Apprentice. When confronting him, his hand broke, and with a few breaths, Qin Ruxue came to try to push them away and protect Li Yunxiao, but in the end, Li Yunxiao defeated the two in moments.
