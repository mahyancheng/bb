Hua Qing is not easily swayed by words and acts decisively, as seen in his immediate attempt to subdue Fei Ni and prevent her from reaching the Council of Elders.

Plot

When Fei Ni returned to the Long family, he immediately confronted her, fully believing the accusations that she had colluded with Li Yunxiao and murdered the clan leader. Despite their past rivalry, he acknowledged her rapid growth in strength, Determined to prevent a "traitor" from approaching the Council of Elders, Hua Qing attempted to suppress Fei Ni, proposing to seal her energy before allowing her to proceed. However, Fei Ni outright refused, declaring that the Long family was on the brink of destruction and that she had no time for unnecessary battles. Undeterred, Hua Qing launched a fierce attack, believing that eliminating her was his duty.

His strike—a powerful slash from his greatsword—was utterly ineffective, cutting through empty air as Fei Ni effortlessly evaded. Shocked by her newfound mastery, Hua Qing barely had time to react before Fei Ni struck back, sending him flying with a devastating palm strike. The impact shattered his bones, leaving him horrified at the gap in their strength.
