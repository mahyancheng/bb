Plot

He and his brother, Luo Tian, arrived in Fengling City alongside the Red Moon Supreme Council, originally intending to assist in capturing Li Yunxiao and Qiu Mujie. However, instead of escalating the conflict, he chose to mediate between them, seeking to resolve past grievances.

Given the strong alliance between the Sea of Soul Formation and Red Moon City, and the fact that Yunxiao was a ninth-tier alchemist with no true life-or-death enmity with Red Moon City, he proposed a peaceful resolution. To avoid further conflict, he offered Yunxiao a position as an elder within the Sea of Soul Formation, ensuring harmony between both sides.

However, Yunxiao outright rejected the offer and instead made a counterproposal. His condition was clear—the marriage between Tang Xin and Jiang Ruobing must be annulled, and the Four Extremes Sect must withdraw from Red Moon City. Only then could the grudges between him and Tang Qing be completely written off. Faced with this unexpected demand, he found himself left with no other choice.
