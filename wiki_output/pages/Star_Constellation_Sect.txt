General Information

The Head of the Star Mansion Sect cultivates the "Surging/Storming Waves Technique," which requires a large number of Sea Demonic Beast cores as supplements. Hence, their demand for sea beasts is extremely high. It's no wonder they attach such importance to
Qinghai Town
.

However, their main power is still concentrated in the
Heavenly Abyss City
 of the Eastern Sea. That's where the most abundant sea beast resources of the
Heavenly Martial Continent
 are found. Moreover, the Sect Leader,
Old Man Xingxiu
, has a peculiar fondness for girls around the age of
thirteen
 or
fourteen
. The Star Sect even specially built a palace to keep these girls for that old eccentric's “enjoyment.”
