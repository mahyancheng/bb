Shi Kangcheng is a senior elder of the Long family and a staunch defender of tradition and rightful succession. He firmly believes in upholding the family’s ancestral rules, which dictate that the sect leader must always be chosen from among the young masters, not from the Council of Elders.

Plot

He opposes
Yi Hongming
 self-declaration as temporary clan leader, arguing that
Fei Ni
, whom
Long Qianmiao
 appointed, should rightfully take over. Yi Hongming accuses him of siding with Fei Ni and causing turmoil, but Kangcheng counters that Yi Hongming is the real disruptor. Shocked to find that many elders, including the respected Lu Yuan, have sided with Yi Hongming, Kangcheng feels betrayed and furious, standing alone against a growing political takeover.
