Although Miaoxuan Sect is not as dominant as the seven super powers in the entire Tianwu Continent, it is also famous in the North Region, which has the strongest overall strength. Its strength is at least ranked in the top ten in the entire North Region, and they are the most licentious sect in the entire North Region. Basically, no woman that Miaoxuan Sect disciples like can escape. Even several women from the Beiming Xuan Palace have become the forbidden food of Miaoxuan Sect's young master Wang Zhen.
