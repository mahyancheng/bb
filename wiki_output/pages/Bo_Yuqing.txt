Plot

Back then
Lu Congzi
 arrived in a hurry and informed Bo Yuqing that something had happened to their master
Yu Shengfeng
. Without hesitation, Bo Yuqing followed him and helped break through the array, unaware that he was being deceived. Yu Shengfeng had already been bewitched by the Aegirine Neon Stone, and taking advantage of the situation, Lu Congzi manipulated Bo Yuqing into joining forces with him to kill Yu Shengfeng. Fortunately, though Yu Shengfeng was severely injured, his soul managed to escape.

After obtaining the aegirine stone, Bo Yuqing sought to refine it in hopes of achieving an Extreme Yin Body. Lu Congzi then taught him the forbidden art of "Death Sacrifice." Ignorant of its true nature, Bo Yuqing failed to realize that the only way to refine the stone was to sacrifice himself—using his own death as the catalyst. As a result, he wasted ten years without making any progress. Had he not stopped practicing in time, he would have died long ago.

What Bo Yuqing never realized was that Yu Shengfeng had deliberately fallen into the trap, believing he could turn the situation in his favor. However, he never expected Lu Congzi to conceal his true strength so deeply that even he failed to detect it. At the critical moment, Yu Shengfeng miscalculated, leading to a near-fatal mistake one he almost regretted for the rest of his life. Yet, what disappointed him the most was not just his own failure, but the fact that Bo Yuqing had ultimately chosen to strike alongside Lu Congzi.

Technique

Wailing sword rain wind-evil tune, The entire space seemed to have turned into a huge black hole, with only countless white feathers floating inside, giving off an endless sense of desolation The cold sword cut through the darkness, creating countless sword shadows. It was accompanied by an unusually strong spiritual power, and white feathers flew.

The Death Sacrifice technique is the only method to refine the aegirine stone, requiring the refiner to sacrifice their own soul. Among all the past generations of demonic servants, only Grandmaster Yu Yixian had successfully cultivated this forbidden art. His mastery of Death Sacrifice became a legacy, a so-called blessing for future generations, though its true nature remained a double-edged sword—offering immense power at the cost of one's own existence.
