The Big Dipper sect was one of the most powerful local forces in Southfire city and occupied the best Feng Shui lines. Moreover, there were traces of fire element in the spiritual energy. It was obvious that this area of the earth vein contained fire golden crystals, which were a great wealth of resources.

General Information

After

 confirmed as a Martial Sovereign of the Nine Heavens, the Big Dipper Sect's prestige soared. The news spread rapidly, solidifying its status as the strongest force in Southfire City.

History

The Big Dipper Sect and the Sky Scorpion Sect were once part of the same powerful family, dominating the Eastern Region. Over time, internal conflicts split them into two factions. The root of the conflict was an elusive treasure hidden by the first sect master of the Northern Scorpion Sect, a powerful figure who controlled the Southern Fire Golden Crystal Mountain range. On his deathbed, he foresaw the sect's potential decline and buried all of its wealth to be discovered by future disciples when they were strong enough to protect it.

Centuries later, the Northern Scorpion Sect began to weaken. Their enemies, growing more powerful, saw this as an opportunity to destroy the sect. In a major assault, hundreds of Martial Emperor-level warriors were mobilized in an attempt to wipe out the Northern Scorpion Sect once and for all. To survive, the sect's leader at the time accessed a portion of the founder’s treasure, allowing them to repel their enemies. However, this marked the start of the sect’s decline.

Although the North Scorpion sect had declined at that time, it was still an existence that was not weaker than the seven superpowers now. Its enemies failed in the end and eventually sought refuge with another force in the Eastern Region, which is the Jiang family of the current
Crimson Crescent City
.

Over the years, the North Scorpion Sect weakened, eventually splitting into the
Big Dipper Sect
 and the
Sky Scorpion Sect
. Despite their separation, they remained dominant forces in
Southfire City
.

Later, the
Thunderwind Chamber of Commerce
 intervened in the region’s conflicts, nearly wiping out both sects. However, the two sects unexpectedly fought back, leading many to believe they had once again accessed the legendary treasure.

Imitation Transformation Technique
 is a powerful disguise technique that allows the user to take on the appearance of another person with astonishing accuracy. When disguised, the resemblance is so precise that it becomes nearly impossible to distinguish between the impersonator and the original, making detection extremely difficult.
