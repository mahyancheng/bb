Plot

The Zhou Great Family Crisis

During the confrontation between Yunxiao and the Zhou family, an old man named Baili Gongjin, who was a renowned Six-Tier Emperor Alchemist and the president of the
Duskflame Empire
's Alchemist Association, appeared. Baili Gongjin expressed shock and complex emotions upon seeing Yunxiao and confirmed that the pill given by the Zhou family was indeed poisonous. This revelation caused panic among the onlookers and raised suspicions about the Zhou family's intentions.

Zhou Yangbiao
, the leader of the Zhou family, requested Baili Gongjin to verify the pill and prove its innocence. However, Baili Gongjin confirmed that the pill was indeed toxic. The situation intensified when one of the Zhou family elders, Zhou Bo, voluntarily tested the pill and tragically died from its effects. This shocked everyone present, as Zhou Bo was a Peak Nine-Star Martial Grandmaster and considered invulnerable to most poisons.

Amid the chaos, Baili Gongjin's suspicion shifted toward Yunxiao, who was accused of poisoning Zhou Bo. However,
Xin Pi
, a member of the Xin Imperial Family, expressed doubts about Yunxiao's involvement and suggested that Baili Gongjin might be the one responsible. The true nature of the poison and the culprit remained unclear, leading to a tense and uncertain atmosphere.

Yunxiao expressed gratitude towards Baili Gongjin,
Wang Chen
,
Cheng Feng
,
Mo Zhai
 for their care and support. This surprised and shocked the onlookers, including Wang Chen, Cheng Feng, Mo Zhai, and
Zhou Changfa
.

Zhou Changfa demanded an explanation from Baili Gongjin regarding the pill used in the conflict. However, Baili Gongjin defended himself against the accusation and denied any involvement in tampering with the pill. Mo Zhai from the Mo family supported Baili Gongjin, claiming that Yunxiao was attempting to sow discord among them. Later, the angry Baili Gongjin cut all the connections between the Duskflame Alchemist Association and the Zhou Great Family, leaving them without high-quality resources.

The Golden Crow Arena

Baili Gongjin, was observing the competition in the Golden Crow Arena through a water screen projection in a luxurious room at the Alchemist Association. When Li Yunxiao used the Mortal World Seal during the duel. Baili Gongjin recognized the seal as one of the three styles imparted by Gu Feiyang to Yang Di, the Floating Life Seal, Mortal World Seal, and Heaven and Earth Seal. He was shocked and speculated that Li Yunxiao might be the successor of one of Gu Feiyang's disciples.

Baili Gongjin was amazed by the power displayed by Li Yunxiao's seal, and expressed regret that he hadn't stopped the duel if he knew Li Yunxiao possessed the Mortal World Seal. He also discussed this revelation with other experts, including
Yuan Hao
, and they were all stunned by Li Yunxiao's extraordinary abilities and the possible connection to Gu Feiyang's legacy. This revelation put the Zhou family in a difficult situation, as they now faced potential repercussions if Li Yunxiao was indeed connected to Gu Feiyang's lineage.
