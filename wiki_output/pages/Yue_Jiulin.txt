Plot

After The Golden Crow Arena

He intercepts
Li Yunxiao
 and
Duan Yue
, along with the Crown Prince of the Duskflame Empire,
Xin Ruyu
, with the intention of subduing Li Yunxiao and making him the Crown Prince's servant.

Li Yunxiao stands his ground and refuses to submit, leading to a confrontation with Yue Jiulin. However, their encounter is interrupted by the arrival of
Baili Gongjin
, the President of the Alchemist Association, and several others.

Baili Gongjin's presence startles Yue Jiulin, as he realizes that the Alchemist Association might issue a pursuit order against him if he continues to antagonize Li Yunxiao, who is a highly valued alchemist. The pursuit order could lead to dire consequences, and Yue Jiulin becomes anxious.

Li Yunxiao seizes the opportunity and exposes Yue Jiulin's intention to capture him, claiming it to be an attack on the dignity of alchemists. He urges Baili Gongjin to take action to restore the dignity of their alchemist lineage.

Baili Gongjin advises the Crown Prince, Xin Ruyu, to apologize to Li Yunxiao to defuse the situation and prevent further conflicts. Though Xin Ruyu is angered, he decides to leave to avoid more trouble and promises to settle their grievances later. Yue Jiulin, realizing the precarious situation, follows Xin Ruyu and departs.

Qionghua Island

He confronted Li Yunxiao as he was flying towards Qionghua Island. Yue Jiulin demanded that Li Yunxiao hand over the demonic beast and the Wu Luring Frost. However, Li Yunxiao refused, stating that he needed the demonic beast's help to secure a slot for the Fire Crow Empire. Yue Jiulin warned him to cooperate or face consequences.

In a tense exchange, Li Yunxiao used a mental attack to momentarily distract Yue Jiulin, who believed he saw the Sect Leader of the Heavens-Gathering Sect,
Qi Feng
, behind him. While Yue Jiulin turned around, Li Yunxiao approached him and trapped him in a golden light, sealing his soul consciousness and preventing him from escaping. Li Yunxiao then transported Yue Jiulin into the
Universe God Monument
, a mysterious place with intense heat and a red sky.

There, he used the power of the Universe God Monument to create a formidable Heaven Flame Formation to trap Yue Jiulin. Despite Yue Jiulin's attempts to resist and use his lightning power, the formation proved to be too powerful, and he was captured and imprisoned within the Monument. With Yue Jiulin secured, Li Yunxiao continued his journey towards Qionghua Island.
