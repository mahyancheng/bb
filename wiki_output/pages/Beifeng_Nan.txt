History

Beiming Nan, along with three thousand warriors, had perished sealing the demon at Two World Mountain a hundred thousand years ago—even his lord had fallen, leaving him as nothing more than a remnant soul. Yet, none of them had ever complained. Life and death had long lost their meaning. He willingly became a rotting corpse, standing guard for an eternity. Now, with little soul power remaining, his existence was fading—he wouldn’t be able to hold on for much longer.

Plot

Beiming Nan, having lived for 100,000 years, was resigned to his inevitable demise. With no Godly State experts left under the sky, he intended to entrust his Eternal Imperial Sword to Yunxiao, ensuring it wouldn’t be lost or fall into unworthy hands. However, Yunxiao refused and instead offered a way to suppress his injuries using the Divine Realm Tablet and a soul cultivation technique. Though initially doubtful, Beiming Nan couldn’t ignore his lingering will to live and agreed to seek permission from the technique’s original owner within the tablet. After Ling Mudi, his master, was taken into the Divine Realm Tablet by Yunxiao, Beiming Nan followed as well and chose to aid Yunxiao on his journey.

Power & Technique

Back then, Beifeng Nan directly refined the Seven Illusions Green Damask and fused it with his Heaven and Earth Venomous Body. Through this process, he forcibly opened the Eight Gates and sanctified his body, achieving a complete physical transformation without relying on the power of the Ten Rules. However, his actions led to deep regret his once perfect body deteriorated into a rotting corpse, leaving him in a state neither human nor ghost, cursed to exist for 100,000 years.

The seven Illusion Green damask of the major five poisons of extinction. His Seven Illusion Green Nightmares are actually wood poisons. And focus on single attack.

One controls the world for eternity, eight diamonds reflect the shadow, the mind becomes the sword. A green poison appeared, and within it, thousands of swords appeared, slashing down one after another.

Beifeng can summon countless corpse puppets from his shattered poisonous sword. Each puppet's body glows with a faint green hue.

After seeing Meng bai use his eight charm Vermillion saliva (one of the 5 major poisons) and combining it with the Rudra Mystic Water (a mutated water element), Yunxiao suggested doing the same with his thunder world and Beifeng nan's poison, because the seven Illusion Green damask of the major five poisons correlates to wood, the move isn't all powerful but it was able to spread to a very wide range, which attracted world destroying divine lightning of Shangqing Zifu. Move is called "cool and alluring spinning yo-yo".
