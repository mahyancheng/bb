Hua Qianshu
, the first and most beloved disciple of
Gu Feiyang
, was once a determined and gifted martial artist. However, his struggle with his own limitations eventually led him down the path of
Demonic Cultivation
.

History

Hua Qianshu was once a talented martial artist and a disciple of
Gu Feiyang
. However, due to his limited talent, he struggled to break through to higher realms. Desperate to overcome his limitations, he turned to forbidden demonic cultivation.

Gu Feiyang, determined to save Hua Qianshu, sought a way to expel the demonic energy possessing him. After discovering a method in ancient records, he traveled to the East China Sea, where it was said a technique existed to purge demonic influence. However, this pursuit led to a massacre, as Gu Feiyang slaughtered countless people from
Eastern Sea
 and killed over 100
Martial Sovereigns
 while being hunted across the
Four Seas
 in his desperate attempt to find a cure.

Later, Hua Qianshu was approached by
Cangwu Qiong
 and
Ren Ximin
, who sought test subjects for their experiments in breaking the shackles of martial arts through demonic cultivation. Along with other martial artists who willingly became test subjects, Hua Qianshu ventured into the
Tiandang Mountains
 a place where the laws of the Demon Realm and the Tianwu Realm intertwined hoping to comprehend demonic power and achieve greater strength.

Knowing that his talent alone was insufficient, Hua Qianshu deliberately involved his master, Gu Feiyang, in the expedition to the Tiandang Mountains, This decision ultimately led to Gu Feiyang’s demise, causing Ren Ximin and Cang Wuqiong’s plan to fail.

Plot

After
Gu Feiyang
 death at the whims of Ren Xifan and
Cangwu Qiong
, Hua Qianshu became a
Martial Sovereign
 a few years later and began practicing Demonic Techniques under Cangwu Qiong command.

Later,
Ren Ximin
 gathered Hua Qianshu along with other subordinates to practice Demonic Techniques under the command of
Di Jia
 who became their Demonic Master, forcing them to become Di Jia Demon Slaves, which resulted in Hua Qianshu becoming Di Jia strongest subordinate.

Later, with Di Jia death at the hands of
Zhuo Kun
, a thread of Demonic Qi from Di Jia remains sailed into Hua Qianshu body and was refined by Hua Qianshu, who took possession of his connection to the
Heavenly Demonic Weapon
. This process freed Hua Qianshu mind.

Power

After venturing into the Tiandang Mountains, Hua Qianshu and twelve others obtained the power of the fallen True Spirits. Hua Qianshu inherited the power of the phoenix—though not the ancient phoenix, it still granted him divine fire. However, after his demonization, this divine fire was corrupted and transformed into a powerful demonic flame.

With the infusion of True Spirit power and their descent into demonic cultivation, Hua Qianshu and his companions experienced a significant surge in strength, surpassing that of ordinary Heaven-Control Realm warriors.
