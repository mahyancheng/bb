King Qin Zheng, the shrewd and pragmatic ruler of Tianshui, spent decades navigating wars and political intrigues. Despite being over seventy and physically frail, his sharp mind remained focused on maintaining power. Unlike most rulers who prioritized a stable succession, his primary concern was securing his own rule.

Plot

Qin Zheng’s actions in his later years revealed his true nature as a
cunning strategist
 who refused to relinquish control. His eldest son,
Prince Qin Yang
, was once seen as the undisputed heir due to his
military achievements and influence
. However, in a sudden shift, the king began
alienating Qin Yang and gradually stripping him of power
, instead
elevating Prince Qin Yue
 a move that confused the court.

Rather than openly declaring an heir, Qin Zheng
intentionally created a rivalry
 between Qin Yang and Qin Yue. By doing so, he kept both princes preoccupied with each other, preventing them from turning their ambitions toward the throne itself. This tactic allowed him to
maintain absolute authority
, as neither son could act against him without being countered by the other.
