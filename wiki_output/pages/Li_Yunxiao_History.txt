Duskflame's Alchemist Association

Li Yunxiao challenges three Rank-Four Lord-Grade Alchemist masters –
Xin Ze
,
Lu Haochu
, and
Ge Xiangqian
 – to a high-stakes duel, displaying arrogance that offends them. The alchemists, offended yet intrigued, accept the challenge and offer their most prized treasures as gambling stakes. Xin Ze presents a
seventh-tier Cosmic Sun Note Jade
, enhancing alchemical refining. Lu Haochu offers a
Heavenly Flame Battle Flag
, and Ge Xiangqian stakes a pair of

Yuan Hao
 expresses his desire for the wings, offering to pay up to 60 million mid-grade primal stones for them. Li Yunxiao then includes the wings as part of the gambling stakes.

Throughout the confrontation, Xin Ze is visibly angry and irritated by Li Yunxiao's dismissive attitude towards his treasures and insistence on betting with primal stones. He questions Li Yunxiao's understanding of the value of the seventh-tier Cosmic Sun Note Jade and tries to argue that it is worth much more than the proposed 50 million primal stones. Later,
Baili Gongjin
 expresses an offer to pay up to 50 million mid-grade primal stones for it. Li Yunxiao then includes the wings as part of the gambling stakes.

To everyone's astonishment, Li Yunxiao claims that someone will bring the 100 million mid-grade primal stones for the gambling bet soon. Xin Ze, initially skeptical, is proven wrong when his brother,
Xin Pi
, arrives and hands over the 100 million mid-grade primal stones as promised. Despite the disbelief and shock from the other alchemist masters, Their confidence in winning the bet is gradually shaken as he observes Li Yunxiao's demeanor, which shows deep certainty of victory against the three of them.

As the competition begins, Li Yunxiao surprises everyone by suggesting that each of the three alchemist masters will condense one primal stone, while he alone will condense two primal stones simultaneously. His mastery of refining techniques, including the Twelve Forms of Flying Flower and Falling Snow, amazes. Li Yunxiao's adept use of the Scripture of Rippling Mirage, a mysterious technique, adds to the astonishment.

Just when it seemed like Li Yunxiao was about to win, Xin Ze decided to risk it all and swallowed a valuable rank seven beast soul pellet, "Purple Qi from the East," which significantly boosted his soul power. With renewed strength, he successfully advanced his primal stone to the supreme-grade level, surpassing Li Yunxiao's pseudo-supreme grade.

In the final stages, Li Yunxiao pushes his primal stone beyond supreme-grade, borrowing power from the
Kunwu Divine Tree

Qionghua Island Arc

Leng Quan
 encounter

Li Yunxiao encountered
Leng Quan
, who had set up the Rain Element Formation, one of the seven strongest elemental formations, on Qionghua Island. Li Yunxiao recognized the formation and demanded the formation diagram from Leng Quan, claiming he planned to merge the seven elemental formations into one.

To understand the power of the Rain Element Formation, Li Yunxiao tested his strength against Leng Quan in a fierce battle. Despite Leng Quan's higher cultivation, Li Yunxiao's true qi advantage cracked Leng Quan's fists and caused him to bleed. However, Leng Quan concealed other disciples within the formation to maintain its effectiveness.

Li Yunxiao surprised Leng Quan by detecting the hidden disciples and revealed that he also practiced Water-based martial techniques. He unleashed the "Water Dragon's Song," inspired by observing a water snake, but Leng Quan countered with his "Azure Tyrant Palm."

Leng Quan challenged Li Yunxiao to face the combined strength of five Martial Grandmasters, and the battle intensified. Li Yunxiao used the power of the
World God Monument

 encounter

This attack affected many on the island, leaving them entranced, and even Li Yunxiao struggled to resist it due to his Martial Lord cultivation level.

The battle between Li Yunxiao and Luo Qingyun escalated, with both displaying extraordinary techniques and martial prowess. Luo Qingyun transformed into an ancient dragon using the Soaring Dragon Body technique, while Li Yunxiao unleashed the Great Illusory Fist, creating a distorted space filled with illusions.

Their intense battle created an independent domain-like space, showcasing their mastery of martial techniques beyond their cultivation levels. Luo Qingyun summoned a true dragon's shadow using the "Dragon's Dominion Four Extremes" divine technique, and Li Yunxiao responded with his own phoenix shadow, using a powerful sword technique that cut through the dragon's body, causing an explosive force that created a black hole above Qionghua Island. The tremendous power from the battle affected Mingxin Lake, causing massive waves and elemental energy fluctuations, catching the attention of
Xin Pi
 and
Huo Sen
, though they couldn't interfere due to the rules.

After surviving the intense battle, Luo Qingyun suffered severe injuries and fell into the sea. Li Yunxiao, who had planned an escape route, hid in the depths of the sea to avoid the devastating attack that reshaped the land into a vast sea. Although Luo Qingyun harbored hatred and humiliation, he couldn't resist Li Yunxiao's overpowering strength, and Li Yunxiao decided not to push further, conserving his strength.

Li Yunxiao collected some of Luo Qingyun's blood and emerged victorious in the competition with over a thousand crystal stones. The remaining 132 crystal stones couldn't be found due to the damaged array, leading to the decision to activate the teleportation array to send everyone back.

Fang De
 and even
Xin Pi
, who already knew it.

Leng Xingbo
 encounter

Li Yunxiao encountered
Leng Xingbo
, the Lord of Emotion Severing Mountain, on the foot of a mountain. Leng Xingbo was a formidable expert at the Eight Disolates Martial Supreme Realm. Leng Xingbo had come to reclaim his treasured sword, the Wu Gou Frosty Brilliance Sword, which Li Yunxiao had won during his duel on the Golden Crow Arena.

Despite Leng Xingbo's intimidating presence, Li Yunxiao remained calm and engaged in a casual conversation with him. Leng Xingbo praised Li Yunxiao's courage and even considered taking him as his disciple and betrothing his daughter,
Hong Ling
, to him. However, Li Yunxiao declined the offer, revealing that he was responsible for the death of Hong Ling's husband.

When Leng Xingbo retrieved the Wu Gou Frosty Brilliance Sword, he felt something was amiss as the sword had lost its brilliance and spirit. Li Yunxiao explained that the sword had found its best destination and died without regrets, conveying emotions despite being an unfeeling sword. Leng Xingbo was deeply moved by this realization and achieved a breakthrough, breaking through a long-standing bottleneck in his cultivation.

As a reward, Leng Xingbo decided to betroth his daughter, Hong Ling, to Li Yunxiao. However, Li Yunxiao, feeling overwhelmed, proposed holding an auction in three days in Flame Martial City, where Leng Xingbo could bring Hong Ling to find a suitable son-in-law.

After their conversation, Leng Xingbo left, and Li Yunxiao continued on his journey, pondering the need for valuable weapons beyond the Wu Gou Frosty Brilliance Sword and the Realm God Stele, and headed towards Flame Martial City on a green wolf battle chariot.

The Mount Meru
 Arc

Upon the opening of the Sumeru Mountain Secret Realm above
Martial Flame City
, Yunxiao took control of the arrays, laid out by the experts, which were originally intended to only let people in who obtained or purchased the
quota crystal
.

In order to enter, one had to pay a fee to Li Yunxiao to get entry into the secret Realm. After entering the Secret Realm, he let
Luo Yunshang
 out of the
World God Monument
 and left it behind to absorb the dense spirit Qi. Shortly after, Yunxiao caught a "little green demon" and gave it Luo Yunshang and taught her how to control it (its strong point is high agility).

Shortly after, they discover people fighting a
Stone Beast
. While fighting it, the Stone Beast advances from the Martial Grandmaster to the Martial Emperor Realm. Because of that, the people decide to run away. While escaping, Yunxiao and the others come across a bunch of people who fight for a seven constellation
Dao Fruit
. Luo Yunshang manages to snatch it with the help of the little green demon.

Before people can get agitated about it, the Stone Beast manages to catch up. Sitting in the same boat, the people join forces to take it down. After destroying the Stone Beast's physical body, its "heart" remains, which allows it to recover its body again. Before that happens, Yunxiao manages to subdue it.

After that,
Wang Qiang
, whom Yunxiao saved from the little green demon previously, takes Luo Yunshang hostage in an attempt to get the Dao Fruit. However, before Yunxiao can make a move, a passage opens and swallows all people present. Yunxiao enters it as well and finds himself in a passage. Wandering in the passage, he finds
Tadpole-Like Characters
 on the walls, similar to those of his
Godly Evolution Technique
 and
Godly Realm Technique
. He manages to activate those characters, which opens up another passage.

Following the passage his Qi greatly increases, and he breaks through several stars, furthermore some
mysterious energy
 accumulates in his dantian. At the end of the passageway, he finds a jade platform with a
golden sword
 on it. After taking it, he arrives inside the so-called Soaring Heaven Palace, which gives massive benefits according to legends. Meanwhile, the other people who got swallowed by the passage, but didn't activate the characters, arrive outside the Soaring Heaven Palace where many other people are also gathered. There, Ding Ling'er is also in the crowd and manages to free the hostage taken Luo Yunshang from Wang Qiang.

Ding Ling'er gets into a quarrel with Tang Yuan, who tries to pursue her, but Qian Wudi interferes. After that, they discover Yunxiao coming out of the Divine Palace, only a barrier separating the two parties. Yunxiao brings the people to humiliate Tang Yuang in exchange for opening up the barrier.

After entering the Palace, they arrive in a hall. In order to go deeper inside, they have to open a sealed stone door. Managing to solve some arrays the door opens up, however without bypassing the dragon pressure one cannot enter. Yunxiao, who obtained
Luo Qingyun
's blood (in previous arcs) can enter together with Ding Ling'er and Luo Yunshang without problems since the blood contains a trace of the dragon's bloodline. Arriving in a hall, the three meet a Demon Dragon Soul who turns out to be Gu Feiyang's sword spirit. At that moment,
Luo Yunshang
 and
Ding Ling'er
 also learn of Yunxiao's real identity.

The
Demon Dragon
 having a grudge with Yunxiao tries to kill the latter. Yunxiao and the two women flee out of the hall, the people still being outside follow up and flee together with Yunxiao. After a short time, the Demon Dragon manages to catch up. Yunxiao and the others, forced to fight him, suppress the Dragon Soul and try to capture it. Getting beaten up, the Dragon flees back to the Palace and hides.

Yunxiao who chased the Demon Dragon back to the Palace manages to convice the latter to once again become his sword spirit. Yunxiao learns that the Soaring Heaven Palace, he previously was in, only is a "reflection" of the original one. The entrance to the real Palace is at the bottom of the sea of qi nearby. To open the gates to the real palace, he uses the
golden sword
, which he previously obtained in the passageway, as a key. Before entering, five people appear, who turn out to be disciples from the
Seven Major Forces
. who were also waiting for the palace to open. Li Yunxiao allowed them to go ahead and lead the way.

They encountered various challenges, including petrified obstacles, a bridge with a Divine Sense barrier, and a powerful Gravity Formation caused by
Living Soil
. During the confrontation with
Cao Yaxing
's group, Li Yunxiao was able to obtain a
purple cauldron
, which seemed to be of higher value than the five Nine-Rank Profound Artifacts found in the inner hall. This choice surprised and impressed the others, leading to tensions and confrontations over the remaining treasures.

Inside the inner hall, they faced
Liu Yongheng
, who was possessed by a mysterious and powerful entity named
Di Jia
. The possession caused chaos, and Liu Yongheng's true strength remained a mystery. As they fought for the treasures and the Living Soil, Di Jia displayed overwhelming power, defeating many members of the group.

Li Yunxiao and Luo Qingyun tried to resist Di Jia's power, but their efforts seemed futile. Di Jia revealed that their energies were effective against the Black Demon Qi, but not strong enough to overcome it. Despite the dire situation, Li Yunxiao encouraged the group to work together and find a way to defeat Di Jia.

During the battle,
Xu Qing
 used a technique to make a
Martial Sovereign
's divine consciousness descend to suppress the Black Demon Shadow temporarily. In a desperate attempt,
Lu Daozi
 and the others managed to escape through a hole created by Lu Daozi's Martial Sovereign equal-attack, leaving Di Jia weakened and frustrated.

Li Yunxiao and Luo Qingyun used the Heavenly Spiritual Ring to escape the inner hall, and the Soaring Heaven Palace's defenses opened, causing the inner hall to collapse and create a massive whirlpool at the bottom of the sea. Many corpses were left in the aftermath of the intense battle.

Li Yunxiao responded arrogantly from the City Lord's Mansion, insulting and challenging the Old Monster.

Infuriated, the Old Monster unleashed a powerful aurora attack, which Li Yunxiao valiantly attempted to defend against using a series of powerful techniques and defensive arrays. Despite Li Yunxiao's efforts, the aurora's overwhelming power proved too much for him, and he was ultimately knocked into the ground, leaving the city in awe of the Old Monster's might.

Hai Beifei offers Li Yunxiao the position of eighth team captain in their mercenary group and assistance in his formula path if he sacrifices his divine body to help Hai Lin.

Li Yunxiao suspects that Hai Beifei would have forcibly taken his divine body's power if he hadn't rescued Hai Lin and the group. He confronts Hai Beifei, refusing the offer and warning against forcing him into such a situation. After witnessing Li Yunxiao's strength and his unique divine body and demonic flame, Hai Beifei becomes cautious.

Zhang Shaotian
 &
Little Qing
 Encounter

Inside the Illusionary Realm of the Water Moon Flower Mirror, the group continues to struggle with the complex illusion. They discover that the illusion is structured like a series of barriers within barriers, each layer becoming more intricate and challenging to navigate. Suddenly, Zhang Shaotian and his juniors confront Li Yunxiao,
Ye Fan
 and their companions. They demand information on how to break the array and offers to spare Li Yunxiao's life if he complies.

Li Yunxiao initiates an attack against Zhang Shaotian and his group.

Four Seasons Immortal Mountain Appearance

Later, in another place,
Li
's attempt to break the formation triggers catastrophic consequences, Little Qing, who has been observing, warns that disaster is looming. The formation's instability leads to the sudden rise of an enormous ice mountain that engulfs Li, while the surrounding area experiences chaotic shifts between the four seasons.

The mountain's peak undergoes rapid transformations, with spring, summer, autumn, and winter all manifesting at different levels. The mountain's appearance reflects the four seasons, with spring at the midpoint, peach blossoms, withered trees, and snow at the base. Meanwhile, an immense boundary of the four seasons emerges in the distance, revealing the Immortal Mountain of lord
Throne
.

Li Yunxiao explains that breaking the formation requires either taking and breaking the Immortal Mountain, an almost impossible task, or relying on Little Qing, who is the only one capable of truly controlling the formation. The group's hopes rest on Little Qing's ability to free them from its grasp.

Li Yunxiao successfully defends himself against an ambush by Zhang Shaotian and his fellow Soul Devouring Sect disciples. Utilizing his control over the rule of Autumn, he overpowers one of the disciples and eliminates him. Zhang Shaotian is taken aback by Li Yunxiao's ability to wield the power of rules and realizes the threat he poses.

Li Yunxiao proposes a cooperation to escape the barrier and seize Throne's Immortal Mountain.
