Power

The Blood Prohibition Style is the innate magic of the Cang Yao clan, allowing them to extract and absorb energy from blood. Their unique physique enables them to decompose blood and harness its power, similar to how others absorb Yuanshi energy—except their source is blood. In the past, Mo's ancestor used this method to seal himself, refining his power into a Blood God Bead for future generations to inherit.
