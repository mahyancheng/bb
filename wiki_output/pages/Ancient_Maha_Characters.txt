History

The
Ancient Maha God
 wrote a scripture, which contained all his comprehension about the heaven laws, the
Maha Ancient Scripture
. In the end the Scripture was rejected by the natural order and got destroyed by the heavens sending Brahma Thunder (Realm Power) for three months into it, turning the Scripture into countless fragments. Those fragments were sent to all the corners of the world.

Many experts gathered the fragments of the Scripture and created
3000 Maha Ancient Characters
. Through combining the Maha Ancient Characters many Divine Techniques were created. The four strongest, which are also closest to the original Scripture, are:

Godly Evolution Technique

Godly Realm Technique

Sun Sutra

Absolute Beginning Sutra

360 Primary

Characters
 of the
Maha Ancient Scripture
 are contained in these four Divine Techniques. The remaining
2640
 are
Secondary

Characters
 (total of
3000 Characters
).
