the president of the thunderwind Chamber of Commerce.

Plot

when faced with Ding Shan’s ruthless ambition, he found himself powerless to resist. Initially, Zhu Qishui
cursed Ding Shan
, proclaiming that he would die without descendants. However, Ding Shan, unfazed and even
amused
, revealed that he already had a son who would carry on his legacy. This revelation sent a chilling message—not only was Ding Shan not concerned about the consequences, but he had also planned far ahead.

Realizing the
hopelessness of his situation
, Zhu Qishui's defiance
turned to fear
. Knowing that he was doomed, he
knelt and begged for mercy
, hoping to at least
protect his family
. However, his fate was sealed. Rather than face further humiliation or execution at Ding Shan’s hands, he
took his own life
, smashing his head against the ground so violently that his skull shattered.
