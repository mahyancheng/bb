Xu Feng was one of the top-ranking members of the
Star Constellation Sect
 branch in Verdant Sea Port. Along with other members of Star Mansion, he attempted to stop
Duan Yue
 from stealing their battleship. However, he was almost killed by the formation array's deadly attack Devil Tone Cognate, a powerful technique unleashed from the battleship that Li Yunxiao had repaired and turned against them.
