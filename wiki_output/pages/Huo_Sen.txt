Plot

Qionghua Island

During a discussion with
Chu Yu
 and
Xin Pi
, Huo Sen expresses doubt about the rumors of a young genius from Shangyang City killing a Martial Grandmaster. Chu Yu seems to know more about the incident and hints that it might be true. They continue to chat about the powerful young talents participating in the competition.

When
Li Yunxiao
 arrives at Mingxin Lake with the Tiger King Chariot, he attracts attention and is met with hostility from some participants. Chu Yu's guard, a burly man with a Rank Five warhammer, confronts Li Yunxiao aggressively, resulting in a clash between them.

Li Yunxiao retaliates and traps the burly man with powerful gravity and seals his meridians, rendering him helpless. He then triggers an explosion with the Tiger King Chariot, causing a massive display of power. Chu Yu and Xin Pi both intervene to prevent the situation from escalating into a battle between Martial Emperors.

Huo Sen plays a role in diffusing the tension and advising them to focus on the competition for the slots. However, he also shows admiration for Li Yunxiao's audacity and wishes to see if the young man's life can withstand such bold actions.

Huo Sen is cautious about the possibility of trouble and warns that if anything untoward happens, there are thousands of people present who might retaliate against Chu Yu and Xin Pi. His remark serves as a warning to maintain peace during the competition.

Later, Chu Yu's dark expression hints at a scheme involving
Luo Qingyun
, a mysterious disciple, in the competition with the intention of eliminating Li Yunxiao. However, Huo Sen seems to dismiss any potential danger and plays the peacemaker, urging them to start the competition without further delays.
