Pan Yi was a unique existence, a spirit born from the remnants of
Xiaofeng Can,
 the former King of the Southern Region. After Xiao Fengcan’s Light Glass Body collapsed upon his death, it transformed into thousands of strange pearls, which solidified over time. These pearls contained a powerful energy and maintained a strong connection with the surrounding phenomena within the cave.

Appearance

He had unkempt hair and a dirty face.

Background

Over countless years, the power of these pearls nurtured Pan Yi into existence. Though he possessed some cultivation, he had never formally trained in martial arts. His knowledge of combat was limited to the unique techniques of the Huowu Empire, likely remnants of Xiao Fengcan’s past.

Pan Yi’s body was incredibly resilient, almost immortal, and no weaker than rare heavenly materials or earthly treasures. His lifespan was nearly infinite, making him an anomaly among living beings. However, despite his powerful physique, he lacked personal ambitions and seemed to accept his existence as something beyond normal human life and death.

Plot

After exchanging a few words about Pan Yi’s origins, Yunxiao invited him to travel together, offering him the chance to witness powerful beings and broaden his horizons. To help Pan Yi break through to the Void Light Realm. Moved by Yunxiao’s offer, Pan Yi decided to follow him. Over time, he not only became Yunxiao’s loyal companion but also learned several martial arts techniques under his guidance.

Power

His cultivation base is not as high as the previous owner of this body.

Trivia
