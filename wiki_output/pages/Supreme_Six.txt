Plot

The clue of this treasure in Mount Phoenix was accidentally discovered by Qi Zhenzi among the ancient books and records in the Supreme Palace. He was skeptical at first, but after carefully studying the clue, he found that it was real. So, he instigated the Supreme Six to help him. In order not to divulge the news, he made an army trap Kunjin, and at the same time, slaughtered all the people in the three towns beneath the mountain.
