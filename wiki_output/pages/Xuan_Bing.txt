Plot

Demon Origin Plains

After the appearance of the True Spirit, Xuan Bing launched a surprise attack on Yunxiao and his group with three powerful warships two Golden Sun Warships and one Netherworld Warship. The fierce attack forces Yunxiao’s group to struggle for survival. During the battle, the Imperial Bell appears, blocking attacks, while Feng Zhu and Qi Guang join the fight, using Holy Skills against Xuan Bing.

Then, the World God Monument appears, sinking one warship and causing chaos. Taking advantage of the moment, Li Yunxiao uses the
World God Monument
, to trap the Netherworld Warship, burying it deep underground and destroying it. Xuan Bing and his forces are left in shock and desperation over the loss of the two warships.

Despite his narrow escape, Xuan Bing failed to learn his lesson. He later attacked a passing battleship heading in the same direction as him. Just like his previous encounter with Yunxiao, his attacks were easily countered. The opposing group retaliated, destroying his remaining warship. Defeated, Xuan Bing was swiftly captured by Yu.

During his captivity, he suffered humiliation at the hands of
Yuwen Xun
 before ultimately being killed.
