Southfire city was quite large. Although it was not as outrageous as the light song woodland, it was still much larger than the upper Sun City of firecrow Empire. the city is somewhat special from other places, because it is located near the Lihuo Golden Crystal Mine, so a large number of martial artists gather here to mine all year round. These martial artists do not belong to any forces, and they are caught between the local forces and the strength of the Chamber of Commerce to survive, so they often form teams and keep each other warm.
