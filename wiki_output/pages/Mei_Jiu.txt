Li Yunxiao

Li Feiyu

She assured him that the Mei family was willing to offer a satisfactory price, even if it meant spending their entire fortune.

As Yunxiao revealed that he was Mei Dong'er's friend and willingly offered the item to Aunt Jiu in exchange for information about her, Aunt Jiu suddenly realized that Yunxiao was the one who killed
Wang Da
, dragging the Mei family into the conflict. Without listening to Yunxiao’s explanation, dismissing it as mere excuses, she attempted to capture him, eager to test the strength of the man who had forced
Wang Gong
