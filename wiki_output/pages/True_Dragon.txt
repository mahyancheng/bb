Background

The real Dragon and the heavenly Phoenix are born by gathering the essence of heaven and earth. They are the embodiment of the true 'Dao' of the heavenly martial realm, just like the Brahm Zifu apocalyptic godly Thunder. They are 'spiritual creatures' to carry out the Dao on behalf of heaven. When the heavenly martial realm is in chaos or crisis, the real Dragon and the heavenly Phoenix will be born.

The inheritance of the true dragon is different from that of the heavenly Phoenix. The true dragon is born from the heaven and earth. After every generation of the true dragon dies, a new Dragon will appear.
