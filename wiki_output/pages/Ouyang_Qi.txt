Plot

Demon Origin Plains

Ouyang Qi, along side with
Chen Chuanjiu
 and
Zheng Yunfeng
, observes
Young Emperor Hao Lian
 in the Demon Plain. Recognizing Hao Lian's deep connection with nature, Chen, and his companions plan a surprise attack. Chen initiates a powerful martial technique, but Hao Lian remains unperturbed, displaying a calm demeanor. Instead of defending himself, Hao Lian approaches a Demon Snake and retrieves a half-eaten Five-Elements Spirit Devouring Rat from its mouth, showing compassion for the creatures.

In a subsequent encounter, Young Emperor Hao Lian protects the Demon Snake and Spirit Rat from harm using a green battle armor, which shatters under Chen Chuanjiu and his companions' combined attack. Believing Hao Lian to be injured or dead, they enter a passage he opens. However, Hao Lian has hidden inside a pit, and when Chen and Zheng Yunfeng enter the passage, he surprises them by reemerging, killing Ouyang Qi, and leaving a warning.
