Plot

Mount Meru

After Mount Xumi released its spiritual energy, Yanwu City became one of the most treasured cultivation grounds in the Tianwu Realm, attracting countless warriors from all regions. The city expanded over tenfold and rose to lead the entire Southern Region.

Martial Flam City Crisis

After  Mount Xumi’s disappearance, the spiritual energy has started to decline, A few years ago, a strange phenomenon appeared above Tianshui Kingdom, releasing astonishing spiritual energy, which was continuously absorbed by Yanwu City's spirit-gathering formation.

In response, major sects from the Southern Region sent experts to investigate. They concluded that a massive spiritual vein existed near Tianshui Kingdom, but despite extensive searches, they found nothing. Even warriors from the other three regions continued their exploration for a long time but eventually gave up.

Now, with Yanwu City's spiritual energy depleting, concerns are growing over how long it will last. To slow down consumption, the city has begun restricting foreign warriors, requiring those who wish to cultivate there to pay a large sum of Yuanshi.

Southern Sealed Land

Yanwu City is experiencing a severe spiritual energy crisis, with reserves rapidly depleting and cultivation becoming unsustainable. To slow this decline, the City Lord’s Mansion has imposed restrictions, but without discovering a new energy source, the city's future remains uncertain.

A past attempt to locate the source failed despite the promise of control over East Yanwu City as a reward. Now, discussions are underway to increase the stakes, but many fear that even offering half the city won’t help if the source remains undiscovered.

Meanwhile, power struggles are intensifying. Major sects like Tianzhu Sect and Duanqing Mountain are secretly backing factions to infiltrate Yanwu City, while smaller sects also compete for control over its spiritual veins. As internal and external forces fight for dominance, Yanwu City stands on the brink of collapse.

Coup d'état

During the Martial Flame City crisis, Xin Ruyu, backed by a major force from the Duskflame Empire and supported by one of the Seven Major Powers in Tianwu, took advantage of the chaos to stir up trouble. With Yanwu City's spiritual energy depleting, he openly declared his intent to seize control, claiming that the Li family was no longer fit to rule.

However, before his plans could unfold, Yunxiao suddenly arrived at Martial Flame City, putting an abrupt end to Xin Ruyu's ambitions. In a decisive move, Yunxiao crippled Xin Ruyu, while the sect masters who had sided with him were given a chance at pardon on the condition that they destroy their own dantians as a form of punishment.

Later, while searching the soul of one of the fallen experts, Yunxiao discovered a shocking truth: the force backing Xin Ruyu was none other than
Beiming Dark Palace
, one of the Seven Major Powers.

With 100,000 years’ worth of sealed spiritual energy soon to be released, Yanwu City was poised for massive growth, expected to expand tenfold. This transformation would make it a major economic and cultivation hub, reshaping the balance of power in the world.
