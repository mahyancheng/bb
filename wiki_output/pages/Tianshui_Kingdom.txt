Trivia

In the state of Tianshui, whenever someone was promoted to a first-tier alchemist or stepped into the Three Powers realm and became a Great Martial Master, the king would host a feast at the palace, inviting all the dignitaries to celebrate.

Apart from a limited number of Martial Lords, Great Martial Masters were the strongest forces in the entire state of Tianshui. Even in the State Guardians, the number of Great Martial Masters in each unit was extremely limited.

Ever since Yanwu had become a Holy Land for cultivation, all the countries and sects in the southern region had sent their outstanding disciples there.
