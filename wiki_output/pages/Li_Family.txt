Background

The Li Family, once a prestigious and powerful clan with deep military influence, had fallen into internal strife and external suppression. Li Yi, backed by hidden forces—including King Qin Zheng had gained control over most of the family. The king, wary of the Li Family’s immense military power, sought to weaken them by supporting the rival Lan Family and using Li Yi as a puppet to create division from within. Despite this, Li Baifeng and several elders were secretly plotting a counterattack, waiting for the right moment to reclaim their family's former strength.

Trivia

The Li Mansion was so large that all the servants’ names were erased and replaced by numbers to make it easier to manage. They would be given names only if they did a good job and were approved by their masters.
