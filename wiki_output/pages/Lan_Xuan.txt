Lan Xuan, was currently ranked third on Minor Chart in
Blue Jewel Academy
 and direct descendant of the Lan Family, Lan Fei's half brother.

Plot

Lan Xuan publicly challenges Yunxiao to a fight, giving him two choices—submit and never oppose the Lan Family again or face him in battle and be crippled. Confident and eager to establish dominance, Lan Xuan expects Yunxiao to back down. However, to his surprise, Yunxiao immediately accepts the challenge.

Meanwhile, Wang Feng, who had been trying to clear Lan Fei’s name, is enraged when Lan Xuan openly admits his brother’s guilt, ruining all his efforts. Lan Xuan, however, benefits from the situation, gaining a better reputation within his family.

As the duel began, Lan Xuan planned to win with a single move to establish his prestige. However, Li Yunxiao effortlessly evaded all of Lan Xuan's attacks using the
Moonwalk Step
, displaying incredible agility.







Not only did Yunxiao dodge every strike, but he was also preparing his ultimate technique—the
Floating Life Seal
. Borrowing the force of heaven and earth, he gathered immense power to unleash the move. His plan was clear—he would crush Lan Xuan completely with this decisive strike.

Lan Xuan stood petrified in the arena. Even before the palm seal descended, its heaven-shaking might had already shattered his fighting spirit. In an instant, his clothes were reduced to ashes, and bloody cracks spread across his skin.

When the
Floating Life Seal
 finally struck, it exploded into a blinding golden light, sending Lan Xuan flying like a punctured balloon. Streams of blood spurted from his body as he was hurled dozens of meters away, crashing into the ground with such force that the diamond rocks beneath him shattered.







Without hesitation, Li Yunxiao stepped forward and mercilessly destroyed Lan Xuan’s dantian, crippling him for life.
