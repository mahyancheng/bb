 and perfected by

They can absorb the power of heaven and earth and hence almost need no power supply from the user (Li Yunxiao). Each of the Six Ding Six Jia's strength is comparable to that of the one using them. Depending on the Cultivation Realm Li Yunxiao can bring summon one Giant Spirit for each of the puppets, as a
Return to Truth / Divine Transcendence
