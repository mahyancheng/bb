Wan Yuan, was one of the expert that invited by
Ding Shan
 to refining the
Nine Yin Nine Yang Pill.

Plot

Wan Yuan suffered a horrifying fate due to the failed alchemy process involving the
Nine Yin Nine Yang Pill
. Initially, he was struggling to maintain his strength, but after consuming
Ding Shan’s secret restoration pill
, he felt an overwhelming surge of power. Encouraged by this sensation, he continued pushing forward in the process. However, something went terribly wrong.

Instead of being replenished,
his body began to rapidly wither
, as if all his energy and life force were being
drained away
. His
eyes sank in, his skin shriveled, and his veins became disturbingly visible
 beneath his pale flesh. In mere moments, he was reduced to
a skeletal husk.

This terrifying scene sent
shockwaves through the group
, as they all began to experience
similar symptoms
—extreme exhaustion, wrinkling skin, and fading vitality. The situation revealed that Ding Shan had orchestrated some kind of sinister energy-draining
alchemy formation
, absorbing the life force of everyone present
except himself and Yunxiao
, who had also begun
absorbing the surrounding yin-yang energy
 to strengthen himself.

As the realization dawned on the group,
panic and chaos erupted
. It became clear that
Ding Shan had betrayed them
, using the alchemy process to
drain their strength for his own benefit
. Even the strongest among them, including leaders of powerful factions, found themselves helpless as their energy was continuously siphoned away. Meanwhile, Yunxiao—realizing what was happening—
followed suit and absorbed energy himself
, drawing Ding Shan’s ire.

Wan Yuan’s fate became a
warning to the others
: if they didn’t find a way to stop this process, they would all end up
drained lifeless like him
.
