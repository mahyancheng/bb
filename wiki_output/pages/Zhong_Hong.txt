Zhong Hong of the broken Mountain Valley, One of the ten great sects of the North Region.

Plot

Zhong Hong approached Wan Yiqian under the guise of offering him refuge in
Broken Valley
, citing their long-standing business ties with
Ten Thousand Treasures Tower
. Despite his polite invitation, Wan Yiqian saw through the act, mocking Zhong Hong for not intervening earlier when his life was in danger. Zhong Hong, unfazed, maintained that
Broken Valley
 remained a formidable force and could still offer protection. However, his reluctance to confront
Shenxiao Palace
 directly revealed his cautious and self-serving nature.

As the conversation unfolded, Yunxiao sensed hidden presences nearby, suspecting the use of
Clarity Invisibility Talismans
—a rare and highly secretive artifact. Zhong Hong admitted to purchasing them from
Tianyuan Trading Company
 for an exorbitant price, along with a
Jade Slip
 detailing ancient treasures linked to Wan Yiqian. This confirmed that Zhong Hong’s true objective was not just protection but control—securing Wan Yiqian and his hidden treasures for Broken Valley’s benefit. revealing that information about Wan Yiqian’s hidden treasures had already spread across the North Region, making it impossible for him to monopolize the wealth alone.

Ultimately, Zhong Hong’s plot was simple—he wanted to exploit the situation, manipulate Wan Yiqian into seeking refuge with Broken Valley, and, in return, demand a share of his ancient secret treasures, particularly powerful artifacts like the Cosmic Light Plate.
