Subordinate of
Lu Congzi
, Yuan De is the former vice president of the
Sea of Soul Formation
, he is a powerful Martial Artist who reached Divine Transcendence shortly before Gu Feiyang's death, and after his reunion with
Li Yunxiao
 at the
Devil's Well
, the two confront each other and Yuan De demonstrates that he has adopted the Demonic Cultivation system implemented by Lu Congzi to the Soul Formation Sea, which helped him reach the Peak of Perfection.

He feels indignant and ashamed for being defeated by Li Yunxiao and
Yu Shengfeng
 just after reaching the Peak of Perfection, as he imagined that he would be at the peak of the World, but was repeatedly suppressed. In the secret space beneath the Devil's Well, he fights Yu Shengfeng and Li Yunxiao by letting a Demon Lord inhabit his body to defeat them, but the Demon Lord tries to escape with his body, to the Demon Realm and forcing his body inside, which disintegrated him and killed him in the process.
