Plot

Qionghua Island

He set up the Rain Element Formation, one of the seven strongest elemental formations, to attack Li Yunxiao. The Rain Element Formation condenses the essence of water from the five elements and creates a rain of sharp swords that can pierce through trees and cause massive destruction.

When Li Yunxiao recognizes the Rain Element Formation and demands the formation diagram from Leng Quan, the latter becomes angry and denies Li Yunxiao's claim that he plans to merge the seven elemental formations into one. Leng Quan warns that each of the seven elemental formations is extremely powerful, and even a Martial Emperor would be affected by their might.

Li Yunxiao, still seeking to understand the power of the Rain Element Formation, decides to test his strength against Leng Quan, who is much more powerful than him. They clash, and despite Li Yunxiao's true qi advantage, the oppressive strength of the Rain Element Formation cracks Leng Quan's fists and causes him to bleed. However, Leng Quan manages to hold his ground and even conceals another disciple within the formation to maintain its effectiveness.

Leng Quan is surprised that Li Yunxiao can detect the hidden disciple, as the Rain Element Formation is known for its extreme concealment. Li Yunxiao revealed that he also practices Water-based martial techniques, surprising Leng Quan. Li Yunxiao's true qi transformed into the Water attribute, and he unleashed a move called the "Water Dragon's Song," inspired by observing a water snake. However, Leng Quan countered Li Yunxiao's attack using his "Azure Tyrant Palm," a powerful water-based palm technique.

Leng Quan then revealed four hidden disciples who also possessed water-based entities, each with strength comparable to a Martial Grandmaster. He challenged Li Yunxiao to face the combined strength of five Martial Grandmasters, claiming that if Li Yunxiao won, he would give him the Rain Barrier's map.

The battle intensified, and Li Yunxiao used the power of the
World God Monument
 to break Leng Quan's water-based entanglements. Employing the "Great Boundary God Art," Li Yunxiao's overwhelming strength suppressed Leng Quan and his disciples, forcing them to surrender and give up the crystals. However, Li Yunxiao's victory was somewhat controversial as a sudden sea of flames appeared during the battle, and Leng Quan felt frustrated by the unexpected turn of events.

Eventually, Leng Quan and his team surrendered after being overwhelmed by Li Yunxiao's strength. Leng Quan reluctantly handed over the crystals and the Rain Barrier formation map to Li Yunxiao. Despite his unwillingness, he was left puzzled and frustrated by the unexpected appearance of a sea of flames during the battle. The enforcement members watching from above were also astonished by the turn of events and the outcome of the battle.
