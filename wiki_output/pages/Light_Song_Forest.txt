Light Song Forest is actually a chaotic place, with many deaths occurring every day, yet people still flock to it. Because this is a paradise of violence, a haven for criminals. As long as you have strength or money, you can get everything you want inside. Though it may seem very chaotic inside, it still operates under its own rules. There are hundreds of different forces, and three of them even claim to be the Kings of Mercenaries, refusing to submit to each other, resulting in countless clashes and numerous casualties.

These three individuals are the leaders of the three largest mercenary forces in Qingge Forest. They are Skull Mercenary Group's leader,
Shen Feng
 ruled over the South, Storm Mercenary Group's leader,
Chen Chuanjiu
 ruled over the East, and Rookie Mercenary Group's leader,
Haolian Shaohuang
 ruled over the North. There is also another Mercenary Groups, but they're small and under the leadership of the Three Big Groups.

As for the West of the City is a chaotic place. None of the three mercenary groups have the upper hand. As there were no rules or restrictions, this place became the place with the highest number of deaths in the Light Song Forest every day. But many martial artists still poured in tirelessly, because the greatest joy here was that there were no rules or restrictions.
