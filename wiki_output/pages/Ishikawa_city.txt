Ishikawa city was not a main city in the North, but it was still a large city. The huge teleportation formation was on the east side of the city, and it was guarded by a large number of soldiers.

Plot

Yunxiao informs Wan Yiqian that he
cannot accompany him to Thousand Leaves Island
 because he has
a private matter to attend to in Ishikawa City

Yunxiao then reveals that
Han Junting sent him a message
 stating that someone important is
waiting for him in Ishikawa City
. This person turns out to be
the true master of the Star and Moon School
, who is also Han Junting’s master.
