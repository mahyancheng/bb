The Pupil Race is an ancient lineage akin to the
Human and Monster races
.

While only a small minority possess autonomous physical bodies, the majority rely on parasitic attachment to hosts for sustenance. Consequently, individuals within this race vary significantly from one another.

The Immemorial Heaven Eye serves as the most common form of host within the Pupil clan.In the case of Li Yunxiao's Immemorial Heaven Eye, despite retaining the power of the pupil technique, its original will has long since perished.

The Moon Pupil
, or "Tsutsumi" (Novelhi translation), is the strongest branch of the Pupil race. Like other members of the Pupil clan, the Moon Pupil transcends physical embodiment; instead, it merges directly with the soul of its host, sharing in their life and death. It is this unique attribute that led the Tsutsumi to select an exceptionally powerful being like Gu Feiyang as its host.
