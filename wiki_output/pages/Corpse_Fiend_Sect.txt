The Corpse Fiend Sect is one of the
Hidden Families,
 a secretive and formidable faction that specializes in corpse refinement and control. According to the Sea Race, the sect's base is located within this vast sea region, carried by a massive undead turtle known as the
Immovable Forest
. This ancient creature, once buried in the deep sea, was refined into a colossal floating island by the sect's necromantic arts.

The sect's cultivation techniques bear some resemblance to Qiu Mujie's corpse-controlling methods, but they are far more refined and advanced. The
Immovable Forest
 can submerge deep underwater, remain hidden beneath the ocean floor, or rise to the surface like a drifting landmass, making the sect's stronghold nearly impossible to track. This ability to evade detection has allowed the Corpse Fiend Sect to operate in secrecy, perfecting their dark arts without interference from the outside world.

Background

The Corpse Fiend Sect was an immensely powerful and enigmatic force, one that had long maintained a strained relationship with the
Mu Family
. Like many of the hidden aristocratic families, the sect operated independently, rarely forming alliances with others. However, in recent times, various hidden sects had begun visiting one another, forging unexpected connections.

At the heart of the sect’s floating stronghold lay
Jing Qi’s Palace
, a grim and foreboding structure dominated by a massive stone coffin. As masters of corpse refinement, the sect had transformed the island into a macabre workshop, littered with the dried remains of sea beasts and an array of stone and jade coffins. The air was thick with corpse fiend energy, an oppressive aura that would cause great discomfort—if not outright horror—to ordinary individuals.
