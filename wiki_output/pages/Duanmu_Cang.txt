Plot

Eternal World

The Duanmu siblings, Duanmu Youyu and Duanmu Cang, arrived at a stone house seeking the legendary Bai Lun Jieyi, their ancestor’s mentor. To their surprise, they found her still alive but aged and weak.

Bai Lun Jieyi confirmed her identity and, seeing their talent, entrusted them with a black jade bracelet containing the remaining 70-80% of their lineage’s inheritance, as well as mystic weapons, elixirs, and jade slips. She also tested their progress in the Taichu Zhen Jue, a nine-level cultivation technique. While Youyu had reached the fifth level and Cang the third, Jieyi assured them they were on the right path.

She then revealed a prophecy concerning Li Yunxiao and the Demonic Tribulation, urging them to observe him closely and assist him if he gained the World God Monument’s recognition. However, she warned them to follow fate and choose their allegiance wisely.

As her time neared its end, she mentioned awaiting two more visitors and dismissed the siblings. Understanding the significance of their meeting, Youyu and Cang bowed nine times in gratitude before leaving the stone house.
