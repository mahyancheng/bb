Plot

Mu Bai Rong was deeply skeptical of Li Yunxiao, believing he had deceived the sect master and elders into overestimating his strength. Furious at the decision to let Yunxiao represent the Mu family in a martial arts competition, he attacked him despite Yunxiao being exhausted from refining a weapon. However, as the fight dragged on, it became clear that Yunxiao was only defending himself while Mu Bai Rong failed to gain the upper hand. Humiliated and enraged, Mu Bai Rong decided to kill Yunxiao to restore his dignity. In a fit of desperation, he unleashed his most powerful and secret technique—Thousand Utility Seal—a move he would normally reserve for life-or-death situations. But at this moment, he had lost all reason, consumed by pride and anger.
