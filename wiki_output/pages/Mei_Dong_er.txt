Appearance

A delicate and Pretty Woman was dressed in a flowery-collared brocade robe and had a Jade hairpin in her hair. Her body exuded a faint Yuan Qi fluctuation.

Background

Mei Dong'er hailed from a prestigious, yet complex family background. Though she bore the surname Mei, she was a distant branch of the renowned Mei family and thus, had no access to the wealth or privileges typically associated with her name. Like most others, she was raised within the Big Dipper Sect, where she cultivated her skills alongside ordinary children. Despite this, her innate talent shone through. By the age of fifteen, she had already reached the Six Directions Realm, a feat that few could achieve at such a young age. Over the next year, her rapid progression continued, as she shattered barriers and ascended to the peak of the Five-Star Martial Grandmaster realm. While her speed of advancement wasn’t unparalleled, it was certainly among the fastest in the sect, marking her as an exceptional talent.

History

Mei Dong’er was born with a rare and fatal condition known as the Five Righteous Que Qi, abody that was lacking in all five virtues, terminal disease so severe that even ninth-tier great alchemists couldn't cure it. With such an affliction, she was not expected to survive beyond the age of ten.

Originally, Mei Dong’er was meant to be punished alongside her parents, but due to her fragile condition, Aunt Jiu's mother spared her life and instead expelled her from the
Mei Family
. Five years ago, when Granny, who had taken her in, passed away, she left behind a will from Mei Dong’er's mother. Since then, Mei Dong’er has been determined to fulfill her mother's last wish—to return to Plum Valley.
