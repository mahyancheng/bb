Plot

While patrolling with his men, Long Hao spotted
Junliang
 in trouble. Seeing an opportunity to do him a favor, he was more than eager to step in and deal with Li Yunxiao.

However, before he could even act, Yunxiao decisively struck, shattering Jun Liang’s dantian and crippling him on the spot. The sheer brutality of the act sent Long Hao into a fury. Enraged, he drew his prized Mystic weapon the broadsword
Bluemoon
 and charged at Yunxiao, determined to make him pay.

To his shock, Yunxiao countered his attack with ease, dismantling his every move as if he were toying with a child. Then, with a single decisive strike, Yunxiao utterly destroyed
Bluemoon
, his so-called first-tier Mystic weapon. Long Hao stood frozen in disbelief his greatest weapon that cost all his money  reduced to scrap in an instant, and his pride crushed along with it.
