Appearance

The worm is an enormous creature, more than two meters wide, with a soft, cotton-like body that yields underfoot. Despite its delicate texture, it embodies the most solid gold spirit in the world. Its appearance is striking, with two golden tentacles extending from its head, each adorned with small, glowing orbs that flicker like lanterns.

Plot

After the battle between the two Five Elements True Spirits, the Nine Netherworlds came into contact with the earth, absorbing nourishment and continuing to evolve, thereby suppressing the Golden Spirit Qi. As a result, for countless years, only divine purple gold insects as small as rice grains were born. Now that the Nine Netherworlds have disappeared from this world, the suppression of the Golden Spirit Qi is gone. The Five Elements are creations of heaven and earth, and although Wufatian has lost the Nine Netherworlds, it has instead gained a new form of Golden Spirit. This shift may bring about an entirely new opportunity.

Power

the Divine Will purple gold worm don't have any special divine abilities. Just their five elements spiritual bodies are enough to look down on other existences.
