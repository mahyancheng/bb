Plot

After 100.000 years The Beiming family discovered an ancient martial arts ruin in Two World Mountain and initially sealed off the area to explore it alone. However, instead of finding treasures, they suffered heavy losses, with powerhouses falling one after another. Even the two high-level Martial Sovereigns overseeing the site perished.

Along with The Duanmu family use their divination skills The fact that the phenomenon here requires the use of a black-level divine lot is already enough to explain the problem.
