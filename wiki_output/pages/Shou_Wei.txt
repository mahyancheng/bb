Background

Shou Wei is an experienced martial artist. Before coming to South Fire City, he was only at the peak of the martial king level. After staying here for more than ten years, he has already broken through to the six-star martial master level. Moreover, he has been stuck at this level for three years, and he is afraid that he will have to stop here for the rest of his life. He also plans to mine for a few more years, and then find a small sect to become an elder and live out his retirement in peace, and train his own descendants.

Plot

He was angered when strangers occupied his assigned place at the
Big Dipper Sect
 . Initially hesitant to cause trouble, Li Yunxiao's sharp words reignited his fighting spirit, helping him break through his long-standing bottleneck and advance from a six-star to a seven-star martial master.

Empowered by this breakthrough, Shou Wei confronted the intruders but was overpowered by a stronger opponent a peak seven-star martial master who locked him with a powerful technique. Seeing Shou Wei at a disadvantage, Li Yunxiao secretly intervened, teleporting two allies

 and
Shangguan Yuyin
 to assist. Surprised by the sudden teleportation, the two quickly reacted, using their techniques to block the enemy’s attack. Realizing others had interfered, Shou Wei's opponent chose to retreat.

Though the conflict seemed settled, Shou Wei and his group were ambushed at midnight by a dozen figures. Outnumbered and severely injured,  but Yunxiao and his demon beast

 saved him. Yunxiao healed him with a sixth-grade pill and taught him a powerful technique, offering him a chance to reach the Seventh Constellation Realm within five years. Without revealing his name, Yunxiao left, leaving Shou Wei speechless at his generosity.
