Zhong Lishan, dean of
Blue Jewel Academy
, one of two Martial Kings in the state of Tianshui who had stepped into the Five Elements realm. who claimed to be the strongest man in the state of Tianshui.

History

In
Tianshui Kingdom
 sixty years ago was one of the most critical moments in the state's history. At that time,
King Tianshui’s
 rule was shaken when a
massive rebellion erupted in the south
. The rebel forces, stronger and more organized than expected, quickly overwhelmed the
state army
, routing them in multiple battles. The situation became so dire that the rebels
marched directly to the gates of the capital
, threatening to overthrow the royal family entirely.

With the
official military in disarray
 and no reinforcements arriving in time, the fate of Tianshui seemed sealed. At this critical moment, Zhong Lishan
the then-dean of Jialan Academy
 took a bold step he
rallied the academy’s students
 to form a makeshift
student army
. These young warriors, though lacking experience, fought with extraordinary bravery, using unconventional tactics to
stall the rebels
 and turn the tide of battle.

Not only did they successfully
defend the capital
, but they also
pushed the rebel forces back south
 and eventually
eradicated them entirely
. This decisive victory saved
Prince
Qin Zheng
 (the current king), who was still a young prince at the time, and cemented the
loyalty of Jialan Academy to the royal family
.

In recognition of their heroism, the former king
granted these students the title of "Guardians of the State."
 This marked the birth of the elite
Guardians of the State
, a group that would go on to serve as the kingdom’s strongest defenders.

Plot

Li Yunxiao
 Vs
Lan Xuan

Zhong Lishan attempted to intervene and stop Li Yunxiao from crippling Lan Xuan, but he was powerless to do so. Yunxiao's determination was absolute, and not even the dean of Jialan Academy could save Lan Xuan from his fate.







When Zhong Lishan tried to assert his dominance by unleashing his aura as Martial King, Yunxiao, already in a foul mood, responded with defiance. Without hesitation, he took an
Origin Blasting Pill
 and prepared to unleash another ultimate technique the
Great Wind and Cloud Palm
. The sight of this immediately sent a chill down Zhong Lishan’s spine, forcing him to withdraw his aura.

Reluctantly, he chose to back down. his figure flickered and vanished from the arena, unwilling to linger any longer in frustration.
