When Li Yunxiao heard about Princess Qin Ruxue’s illness and her worsening condition, he voluntarily offered to help. With Jian Rong’s assistance, he informed Zhang Qingfan about the Golden Needle Acupuncture Method, which could potentially cure the princess.

To avoid any misunderstandings, Li Yunxiao performed the treatment from 15 meters away, using Golden Needles to pierce through the air, separated by a curtain. He feared that if he treated her up close, the king might try to force him into marriage, as the princess would have to undress, exposing her body.

With Meng Wu assisting him, Li Yunxiao completed the treatment in the time it took to drink a cup of tea, leaving everyone shocked at how fast and effective it was.
