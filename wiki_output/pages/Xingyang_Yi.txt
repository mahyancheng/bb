Qingyang Yi
, the
Patriarch of the Qingyang Family
, was the mastermind behind sending
Xingyang Kun
, a powerful
Martial Grandmaster
, to
Martial Flame City
. His sole purpose was to eliminate
Li Yunxiao
, the one responsible for the death of his son. However, this decision would set off a chain of events that would ultimately lead to the downfall of the Qingyang Family.
