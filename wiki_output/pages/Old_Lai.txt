Plot

When the three
Liuming Mansion elders
—
Jing Yuan, Jing Ming, and Jing Gao
—attempt to kill
Li Yunxiao
, Old Lai recognizes the
potential disaster
 this could bring. He knows that Yunxiao is far more dangerous than they realize, and that an open fight could spiral into
chaos
, threatening the Merchant Union’s plans.

As the battle erupts, Old Lai steps in at the
critical moment
, intercepting an attack at great personal cost. Despite being injured, he immediately
shifts the conflict from violence to negotiation
, using his authority and reputation to force a temporary truce. Appealing to the elders' self-interest and reminding them of
Ding Ling’er’s absence
, he persuades them to hold back—at least for now.
