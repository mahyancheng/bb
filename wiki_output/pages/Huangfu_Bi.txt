Power

Huangfu Bi, master of the Soul Devourer Sect, is a legendary figure known for his unmatched strength and eerie mastery of soul techniques.

Golden Speaker, also known as the Heaven-Grade Golden Soul, is Huangfu Bi’s powerful summoning technique. Upon its arrival, green flames burst from its eye sockets, exuding a shocking level of intelligence. Unlike ordinary main souls, which are fully controlled by their masters, Golden Speaker appears to act independently, standing as an equal to Huangfu Bi. This was no surprise to the elders of the Soul Devouring Sect, suggesting a deeper truth—once a main soul reaches the heavenly grade, it may develop its own wisdom and consciousness.
 Gold speaker was completely different from ordinary gold souls. Golden speaker was completely independent individuals. When the soul devouring banner was cultivated to the highest level, it would be the primary soul of heaven, earth, black, and yellow. The Golden speaker was an existence that transcended these four levels. Moreover, it had been passed down from generation to generation in the soul devouring sect. It was impossible to cultivate it to this level by relying on one's own strength.

The Soul Fighting Technique is one of the core secret arts of the Soul Devouring Sect. It focuses on harnessing and weaponizing the power of the soul in battle, allowing the user to engage in direct combat with soul energy. Unlike the Soul Devouring Banner, which is used to capture and absorb souls, the Soul Fighting Technique is purely an offensive martial technique designed for soul-to-soul combat. Huangfu Bi's ability to combine both techniques is unprecedented, making him an anomaly within the Soul Devouring Sect and giving him an edge over other practitioners

The Pangu Banner is a legendary artifact of the Soul-Devouring Sect, passed down through generations of sect leaders. Rather than forging their own Soul-Devouring Banner, each leader inherits the Pangu Banner and uses it to absorb the previous one. Within the banner exists a vast internal world, containing the sun, moon, and flowing rivers—granting it immense power, even though it is not a true holy weapon.

The Cloud Dancing Wind Art is a high-level martial technique that harnesses the power of wind and movement to create overwhelming force and agility in battle. It is likely a technique that combines speed, unpredictability, and destructive power, resembling the natural flow of clouds and the fierce movement of storms.

Soul battle technique-Dragonfish transformation. The Golden speaker instantly became one with him and struck down with an incantation seal.
