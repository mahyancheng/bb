Peak of Perfection Realm

Void Prime Realm

Divine Transcendence, Peak of Perfection, Void Prime Realms

Due to the
absence of Rank 10

Laws,
 one cannot reach the Divine Realm in the Heavenly Martial Realm. Which means their Primordial Qi can't be transformed into Spirit Qi and their Dantian won't be transformed either. Hence, after surpassing the Peak 9 Star Martial Sovereign, one reaches "Pseudo-Realms".

The first one after surpassing 9 Star Martial Sovereign is the Divine Transcendence Realm.

After enough accumulation in the Divine Transcendence Realm, one reaches the “Peak of Perfection” Realm. Very few people managed to even surpass that Realm and reach the “Void Prime Realm”.

Later when the Rank 10 Rules return those Realms are no longer relevant, because as long as one is able to comprehend the 10th rank rules, they can convert their Primordial Qi to Spirit Qi as well as change their Dantian to become a true Divine Realm Expert.

Still, they have the same strength as the first Three Minor Realms of the Ten Directions Realm, but the Dantian of a True Divine Realm Expert is more than ten times larger and they use Spirit Qi instead of Primordial Qi, which is superior to the former.

Divine Transcendence Realm = Return to Truth Realm

Peak of Perfection Realm = Heavenly Mastery Realm

Void Prime Realm = Void Extreme Realm

Due to the fact that “
Demi-Martial Gods
” cannot utilize
Spiritual Qi
, their strength is drastically lower, Only a
Peak of Perfection
 expert can go head-to-head with a
Martial God
 at the
Return to Truth Realm
.

Nine Stars Peak Stage
 of the

 follow. The
Martial Dao

Heavenly Dao

Man
 is controlled by the
Heavens
, therefore they are linked.

Upon reaching the
Peak of Martial Dao
, it is possible to become one with the Dao that dwells within the
Martial Heart

Heavenly Dao
 and entering into synchrony with
Heaven
. It is a huge step that raises the strength of
Martial Dao
 experts to their peak.

Realm Break

 and the
Land of Reincarnation
, being such a dangerous place that even
Martial Gods
 at the
Creation Realm
 tend to be afraid of it.
