Xingyang Huo
 was ancestors Xingyang Family and one of the elder of Jutian Sect. He is the last surviving member of the
Xingyang family
, Whichs was wiped out by
Li Yunxiao
. He refined the
Bluelotus Earth Fire
, a rare flame, making his attacks comparable to those of a
Martial Emperor
. Obsessed with revenge and restoring his bloodline, but ultimately falls in battle against
Duan Yue
 and
Yunxiao
, losing both his life and his treasured fire. With the death of
Xingyang Huo
, a thousand-year-old aristocratic family crumbled.

Plot

Xingyang Huo sought out
Supreme Palace
 for revenge after the annihilation of the Xingyang family. As the sole survivor, he was determined to both avenge his fallen kin and ensure the continuation of his bloodline. He mercilessly slaughtered more than half of Supreme Palace’s disciples, and even the Supreme Palace Lord,
Ma Tianhe
, and his son perished after days of torture, despite their ignorance of the truth he sought.

By coincidence,
Li Yi
 was present in Supreme Palace when the incident occurred. When he was interrogated by Xingyang Huo, he shifted the blame for the annihilation of the Xingyang family onto Li Yunxiao. Before heading to
Martial Flame City
 to seek Yunxiao, Xingyang Huo ordered the remaining survivors of Supreme Palace to capture young girls in an attempt to repopulate the Xingyang family.

Later, when Xingyang Huo arrived in
Martial Flame City
, he was shocked to discover that the city was protected by a powerful array hidden within a small, unsightly pagoda. Despite his attacks bolstered by the
Bluelotus Earth Fire
, which was nearly as powerful as a strike from a genuine
Martial Emperor
 the pagoda remained completely unharmed. Just as he was reeling from this,
Yunxiao
 appeared before him.

Even though Xingyang Huo knew that Yunxiao possessed a flame far superior to his own, his pride would not allow him to back down. The moment Yunxiao appeared, the battle between them erupted instantly. Yunxiao unleashed his only wisp of the
True Phoenix Flame
, while Xingyang Huo countered with the
Bluelotus Earth Fire
. Their flames clashed in midair, sending shockwaves across the battlefield. The terrifying force of their exchange left both sides heavily injured, neither able to gain the upper hand.

Despite his injuries, Xingyang Huo refused to retreat. Gritting his teeth, he prepared to launch another assault on Yunxiao. However, just as he was about to strike, a powerful force descended from the sky
Duan Yue
 landed before him, stepping down from the
Bluewolf Chariot
. The unexpected interference sent a wave of shock through Xingyang Huo, the vast gap in cultivation between him and Duan Yue made him wary.

Realizing the seriousness of the situation, Xingyang Huo fought with all his might. However, the difference in strength was insurmountable. With Yunxiao’s
illusion techniques
 weaving through the battle, Xingyang Huo found himself ensnared, unable to distinguish reality from deception. His resistance crumbled under the combined assault. In the end, not only was he slain by Duan Yue, but his
Bluelotus Earth Fire
 was also forcibly seized.
