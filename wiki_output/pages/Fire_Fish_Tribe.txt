In the ancient times, the Fire Fish Clan was merely an ordinary sea group. It was precisely in the sea territory that a
True Spirit Phoenix
 was undergoing Nirvana on the
Kunwu Divine Tree
. During that Nirvana, the flames accidentally ignited one of their ancestors.

That ancestor originally thought it was a certain death, but little did they know that not only did they not die, but instead, under the nurturing of the Divine Spirit, their body experienced a significant rebirth. From then on, they not only possessed an extremely keen perception and longing for flames, but their body structure also became highly suitable for cultivation.

Later, this ancestor even stepped into the realm of Martial Sovereign, propelling their sea group to become a dominant presence in the vicinity! This is the gradual decline of the power of bloodline. Initially, the Nirvana Fire of the true spirit Phoenix transformed their ancestor's bloodline, but since then, generation after generation, the bloodline started to thin.

Nowadays, the power of their Fire Fish Clan's bloodline is no longer sufficient to allow them to break through to the Eight Wilderness/Desolates Realm. Moreover, if this continues, even becoming a Seven Constellations Martial Emperor in the future will become increasingly difficult. There is even a possibility, one day their Fire Fish Clan will regress to the level of a sea group once again.
