He is the King of Western Region. During the Ancient Demon Sealing War 100000 years ago, he snuck inside the seal of Demon Lord PU in hopes of refining his power and become the strongest entity.

Appearance

Old Man with white hair, a youthful face, jade-like skin, and a rosy complexion.

Personality

Bei Jinghong is an arrogant, stubborn, ambitious, and self-righteous individual who firmly believes he is the man of destiny. He has an overwhelming sense of entitlement, insisting that his strength, origins, and contributions to the Tianwu World make him the rightful owner of the World God Monument. His words reveal a deep resentment and desperation, unwilling to accept that someone else could be more worthy.

History

Bei Jinghong survived for 100,000 years by turning himself into a corpse, using an ancient preservation method to resist the passage of time. To minimize the erosion of his lifespan, he could only revive for one hour each year, spending the rest of the time in a death-like state. In total, this means that over 100,000 years, he has only truly "lived" for a little over 20 years.

Plot

Bei Jinghong awakened from his long slumber upon hearing the sound of the Dynasty Bell. Sensing a disturbance, he rushed over and discovered a young man locked in battle with three Overlords, having already severely injured two of them. Recognizing the dire situation, Bei Jinghong intervened to aid the wounded Overlords and soon engaged in conversation with Li Yunxiao.

During their exchange, Bei Jinghong was reunited with his profound artifact,
the Ancient

Dynasty Bell
, which had long been separated from him. Bei Jinghong proposed an alliance to break the ancient formation that had trapped Demon
Lord Pu
 for 100.000 years. He assured Yunxiao that Lord Pu was at his weakest state and, even if freed, would no longer pose a significant threat.

With their objectives aligned, Bei Jinghong, Yunxiao, and Lord Pu decided to work together to dismantle the powerful array formation.

To his surprise, the real reason Lord Pu agreed to the alliance was to deliver Yunxiao to the First Heaven when he was sealed, allowing him to absorb the remaining power of the Demon Emperor’s clone residing in Yunxiao’s body.

After Lord Pu revealed that Yunxiao was the chosen by the
World God Monument
 as owner, Bei Jinghong’s attitude toward Yunxiao changed drastically. Consumed by rage, he attempted to seize the monument and kill Yunxiao. However, Lord Pu reminded him that the monument had chosen Yunxiao, and Bei had no right to claim it. Furious, Bei turned his wrath on Lord Pu, and the two clashed.

The Agama Bone-Cutting Knife clashed against Bei’s Ancient Dynasty Bell, shattering its golden light instantly. The blade's energy tore through the bell, causing a massive explosion and leaving Bei Jinghong severely injured.

In his weakened state,
Ling Mudi
 approached Bei Jinghong and revealed himself as an old acquaintance. He tried to persuade Bei to reveal the location of the Spirit of the World God Monument, but Bei's stubbornness made it impossible. Determined to get the information, Ling Mudi was willing to cripple Bei or even search his soul.

Once again, Bei Jinghong attempted to attack the Formation Spirit, but he was knocked away with a single blow, leaving him severely injured and unconscious.

Seeing this, Ling Mudi instructed Yunxiao to trap Bei Jinghong inside the World God Monument and press him down with Tushita Peak for interrogation to uncover the Spirit’s location within the tablet.
