Personality

Known for her gentle and kind nature, she was well-liked by many within the association.

Background

Zi Ling was once just a humble maidservant, but fate took a dramatic turn when she saved a gravely injured man in Long Valley City. That man, a figure of great power and influence, never forgot her kindness. Before leaving, he entrusted the Shuai family with ensuring her well-being. She later was elevated to the status of a goddaughter within the Ink Feather Merchant Association. However, her arranged marriage took an unexpected turn when she was suddenly demoted to the position of a second wife to Shuai Minglang, the rising successor of the powerful Shuai family in Long Valley City.

This decision sparked outrage within the Ink Feather Merchant Association, as she was originally promised the status of a first wife. Yet, given the Shuai family's growing influence and their recent alliance with the Du family of Earth Dragon City, resistance was futile. Despite the frustration of those who cared for her, Zi Ling had little choice but to accept her fate. Her marriage was no longer just a personal matter but a strategic move in the ever-shifting power struggles of the merchant world.
