Plot

Bo Long has descended with a borrowed body and took possession of Narcissus' injured body, healing it before turning his focus to sealing the Demon Master,
Lord Pu
. Using his divine ability to borrow the power of the world, he harnessed the Lock of Realm Power and the Chains of Law, summoning 12 projections of the chains to bind Lord Pu. With the aid of 12 experts, they held the chains in place. Bo Long even channeled the power of the Heavenly Dao through the Lotus Platform, which contained a trace of the eye of heavenly Dao, usable only by its true owner. However, as he unleashed this immense force, his vitality drained rapidly, and he aged by decades in an instant.
