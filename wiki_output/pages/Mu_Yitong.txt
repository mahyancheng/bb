Mu Yitong, one of the four elders sent by
Mu Zhuang
 to assist
Mu Jie
, in capturing Li Yunxiao and reclaiming the Merciless Bell of the
Wuqing Sect
.

Plot

When Yunxiao unleashed the Divine Realm Tablet’s golden chains, Mu Yitong and his allies found themselves bound, unable to break free immediately. As tension mounted, Mu Yitong summoned the
Mountain-Splitting Heavenly Ding
, a massive puppet known for its ability to shift stars and overturn seas. Confident in its might, he commanded it to intercept Yunxiao’s
Tusita Heavenly Peak
, expecting it to counter the attack. However, to his horror, the puppet struggled under the mountain's pressure, its structure collapsing inch by inch.

Despite his best efforts, including reinforcing the puppet with formations, Yunxiao’s devastating lightning-infused hammer strike shattered the
Mountain-Splitting Heavenly Ding
, reducing it to fragments. Realizing the growing danger, Mu Yitong and the others broke free from the golden chains and retreated just as Yunxiao’s mountain struck the sea, causing a cataclysmic upheaval. After regrouping in the rain,  Mu Yitong and the others faced with the reality that capturing Yunxiao would be far more difficult than they had ever imagined.

Power

Kaishan Tianding was the pure power puppet with the strongest structure and the strongest power among all the puppets of the Mu family. It was almost close to the perfect physical body. The mountain splitter is the MU family’s most powerful strength-type puppet. It can easily overturn rivers and seas, shift stars, and even an immortal state warrior would find it hard to destroy it.
