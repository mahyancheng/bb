The Snow Country was once a powerful and mysterious land located in the extreme north, where ice and snow covered everything year-round. It was home to both humans and monsters, who seemingly coexisted under the rule of its monarchs. However, at some point in history, civil strife broke out, leading to its downfall. The last recorded event in the kingdom’s history was the ascension of its final king, after which no further records exist. Now, the once-thriving Snow Country lies in ruins, buried beneath the eternal ice, its history lost to time. Only fragments of murals and legends remain.
