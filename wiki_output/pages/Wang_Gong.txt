Plot

Wang Hong first appeared in the vicinity of
Yufeng City
 when the battle between his son and
Li Yunxiao
 spread, forcing his son to break the Life-Saving Jade which contained a trace of his Divine Sense. He briefly confronted Li Yunxiao but soon retreated, as the spirit technique that allowed him to possess his son's body had limitations.
