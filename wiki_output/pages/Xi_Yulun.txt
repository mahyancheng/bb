Personality

Xi Yulun is a cunning and ruthless schemer, loyal to the Soul Devouring Sect. Arrogant and manipulative, he twists words to corner his opponents while exploiting any weakness. Sharp and opportunistic, he respects power but doesn’t hesitate to strike when the advantage is his.

Plot

When he encounters
Su Ping
 and his group in Battle Soul Mountain, he immediately accuses them of killing sect members, using it as justification to escalate tensions. However, his true goal is revealed when he acknowledges that Tian Xingzi, the powerful master sitting atop the giant deer monster, is in an abnormal state.

Seizing this opportunity, Xi Yulun confirms the intelligence his sect received—likely from their spy, Youmi—and aims to manipulate the situation for his benefit. His ultimate objective is to weaken Wanxing Valley while asserting the Soul Devouring Sect’s control over Battle Soul Mountain. As tensions rise, he gathers all nine elders of his sect, indicating his willingness to wage an all-out war, regardless of the consequences.
