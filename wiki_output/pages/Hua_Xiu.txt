Appearance

A strange-looking man. He had a rough face, dark gray skin, long and fierce eyes, and a brown ball of flesh on his forehead, which seemed to have a horn. His black hands were exposed outside his long sleeves, and his ten fingers were as sharp as claws. There were actually scales shimmering on the back of his hands, and it was obvious that he was not human.

Plot

Xu Hua first appeared in the Eastern Region, in Feng Ling City. Entrusted by his master, his mission was to protect his young junior sister, Narcissus, as they searched for Li Yunxiao.
