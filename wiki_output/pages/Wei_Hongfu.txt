Plot

Martial Flame City Auction

When
Li Yunxiao
,
Ding Ling'er
, and their group encounter
He Feng
 from
Mando Chamber of Commerce
 and
Shui Luoyan
, Wei Hongfu steps in to maintain order. He shows his strength by effortlessly stopping Hefeng's attack on Li Yunxiao.

Wei Hongfu later reveals that he was sent to the Southern Region by Ten Thousand Treasures Store to oversee and protect their interests during the opening of the Mount Meru. He discusses the importance of safeguarding Ten Thousand Treasures Store's position in the region during this critical time when various forces may attempt to infiltrate the Southern Region.

He initially expresses frustration and incredulity when Li Yunxiao proposes that the Ten Thousand Treasures Store takes a back seat and lets the Alchemist of Alchemists handle the auction affairs during the opening of the Mount Meru. However, Li Yunxiao persuades him by explaining the benefits of the Ten Thousand Treasures Storer's involvement, including an increase in prestige and the Alchemist of Alchemist's contribution of precious elixirs and profound artifacts for bidding.

Wei Hongfu eventually agrees to Li Yunxiao's proposal and decides to support the auction, with the Ten Thousand Treasures Store playing a supporting role. He also shows goodwill towards Li Yunxiao and Ding Ling'er, as he believes Li Yunxiao's connections and abilities are extraordinary, making him a person to be cautious around.

As the Flame Martial City prepares for the opening of the Mount Meru, Wei Hongfu oversees the setup of the prohibitive array and the toll booth for all entering cultivators. He works to maintain the interests and reputation of the Ten Thousand Treasures Store during this critical time, while also respecting Li Yunxiao's suggestions and supporting the auction.
