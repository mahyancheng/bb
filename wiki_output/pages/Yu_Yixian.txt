Plot

Yu Yixian managed to preserve his life through an intricate scheme involving his soul and body. Originally, his body was meant to achieve the Immortal Extreme Yin Body, a powerful and unparalleled physique. However, achieving this required self-sacrifice, meaning he would have had to die in the process, essentially making a "wedding dress" for others—allowing someone else to reap the ultimate benefit.

To avoid this fate, Yu Yixian stopped just short of fully completing the transformation, leaving a tiny imperfection in his Yin Body. This small flaw prevented his complete sacrifice, allowing him to remain alive and hide within the body. At the same time, he sealed a part of his soul within it, biding his time for later generations to arrive.

However, this plan was disrupted by external events—most notably the Ghost King’s intervention, which forced Yu Shengfeng into a desperate situation. This unforeseen conflict prevented Yu Yixian from continuing his slow, careful plan and ultimately led to his downfall. Now, his remnant soul remains, but he is at the mercy of Yu Shengfeng, who intends to use him for his own ends.
