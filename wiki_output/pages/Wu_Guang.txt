Wa Guang, was son of
Wu Liantian
, the City Lord of Yangpu. When he first appears, he tries to buy both the Gulan Leaves and
Meng Wu
 as if they were mere commodities, when he offends Yunxiao and his group. He is quickly and mercilessly beaten up by them, Even after getting beaten, he still does not learn his lesson and calls for reinforcements. However, he is completely unprepared for Yunxiao’s response. When Yunxiao summons an army of two thousand elite warriors Heaven Core, Wu Guang finally panics and clings to his father for help.
