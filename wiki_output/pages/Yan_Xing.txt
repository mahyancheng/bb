Plot

Yan Xing suddenly launched a sneak attack on Li Yunxiao after sensing the extremely strong mutated water element within his body. Seeing how young Li Yunxiao appeared, Yan Xing assumed he would be an easy target. However, despite using only two moves, Li Yunxiao effortlessly blocked them.

Realizing that his opponent was far stronger than he had anticipated, Yan Xing was overcome with fear. Without hesitation, he attempted to flee back to his headquarters to report what he had discovered. Confident in his advanced stealth techniques, he believed he could escape unnoticed. However, he was unaware that Li Yunxiao was still silently following him.
