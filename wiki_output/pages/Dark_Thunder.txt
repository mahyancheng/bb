Plot

In the DuskFlame Empire, the Dark Thunder beast that was originally tamed by
Xu-Hongping
 was now Li-Yunxio 'pet'. Oringally Xu-Hongping and Dark thunder was ordered to stop and kill whoever that had passed the Soaring Phoenix town. Which was infested with dangerous bugs.

Li Yunxiao was accompanied by Ji-Meng, and ordered
Ji-Meng
 to keep
Xu-Hongping
 busy while he tames the Dark Thunder Beast.

While Ji-Meng was keeping Xu-Hongping at bay, Li Yunxaio took his time and played a calming-sweet tune to capture the beast. But the Thunder Beast was full of disgust but not knowing
Li-Yunxiao
, his eye technique,  was able to scare the Thunder Beast into submission. After that he was treated as if it was a dog gladly loving the pets given. So Thunder Beast happily made it's mind, seeing Li Yunxiao as it's owner.

Power

All demon beasts were savage and had mighty physical strength. Relying on the bloodthirsty power and mighty flesh, demon beasts were much stronger than human beings of the same level. But, their only weakness was that their divine sense was extremely weak, and they did not have intelligence.
