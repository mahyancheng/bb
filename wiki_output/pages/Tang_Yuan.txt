Tang Yuan was one of the participants in the
Mount Meru
 expedition. He teased Ding Linger, provoking a fight with her, and even challenged
Qian Wudi
 and
Shui Luoyan
 when they tried to intervene. When Li Yunxiao overheard Tang’s arrogant remarks, he offered the others a chance to earn his favor by beating Tang up in exchange for opening the barrier to the main palace. As a result, Tang was mercilessly beaten half to death by the crowd.
