The Fire Crow Empire is one of the three major empires in the
Southern Region
 of the
Tianwu Continent
. It boasts a total of nine auxiliary kingdoms, divided into the Upper Three Kingdoms, Middle Three Kingdoms, and Lower Three Kingdoms.

If a Martial Grandmaster (Six Zodiacs Realm) or a Fourth-rank Lord-level Alchemist is present in the Kingdom and is willing to stay to safeguard it, then this country will automatically rise to an Upper Kingdom. Each year, the Fire Crow Empire will allocate numerous cultivation resources to those within its territory. If there are not enough Upper Kingdoms (less than three), the remaining positions will be contested by the Middle Kingdoms. This could lead to fierce and brutal wars for supremacy.

Capital City

Shangyang was the capital of the Firecrow Empire, the most prosperous city within ten thousand miles. It was dozens of times the size of Tianshui's capital, with a population of about one hundred million.

Major Powers

It is important to note that the Heavens-Gathering Sect, Emotion-Severing Mountain, and Heavenly Jewel Sect are existences that surpass the empire's power.
