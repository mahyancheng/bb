Heavenly Martial Alliance

Xuanli Island

While Xuanli Island and the Heavenly Martial Alliance are allied forces and exist for the sole purpose of exterminating the demons/ devils from the Demon Realm, Li Yi's Hegemony Alliance was founded with the ulterior motive of taking advantage of the war. After the two sides wear down their forces, they plan to dominate the Heavenly Martial Realm and the Demon World.
