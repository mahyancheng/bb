One of Yunxiao's most used pets with outstanding defense and self-regenerative abilities.

Refinement — Story

Originally living in
Mount Meru
, one of the
four secret Realms
 of the
Heavenly Martial Realm
.

Li Yunxiao
 managed to catch the Stone King, which was a peak
Martial Grandmaster
, but evolved to a
Martial Emperor,
 while subduing it.

Later, Li Yunxiao refined the Stone King and became a half-artifact half-beast being, comparable to a
Martial Supreme
. Although it didnt actually become one until he later went out of the divine realm tablet and was able to face the lightning tribulations (there cant be tribulations in the tablet). It supported Li Yunxiao in his fights.

Later, Li Yunxiao refined it again with Northern Heaven Cold Star Iron, Memory Origin Gold and Heavenly Shine Gold. With that it reached the Nine Heavens
Martial Sovereign
 Rank with incomparable strong defenses, high self-regeneration and combat-power.

When Yunxiao visited Ocean Emperor's Palace, he used the smithy to further strengthen it.

During a fight with
Run Zong
, a member of the
Northern Sea
's Royal Family, Gourd Little King Kong got teleported away by an artifact of Run Zong, which utilized pink crystal dust.

Yunxiao managed to find it in the
Black Tortoise Palace
, a palace from ancient times which descended above the two world mountain, which is in the ruling area of the
Beiming Dark Palace
. It has been possessed by
Ling Mudi
, the former Palace Master of Black Tortoise Palace, an expert from 100,000 years ago.

After gathering sufficient materials, Yunxiao produces Divine Steel, with the help of Ling Mudi. With that, he refines a body for the latter and also improves the Gourd Little King Kongs body, so Ling Mudi no longer needs to possess it.
