He seeks control of the great forces of the World, and hides his schemes from the other Rulers of the
Holy Region
.

Appearance

His face was a plain and ordinary face, the kind that would be forgotten immediately even if one walked in a crowd. There was not the slightest bit of brilliance.

Personality

Gongyang Zhengqi
 was a firm, calculating, and authoritative leader who thrived on control and order. He had a sharp mind and unwavering confidence in his ability to govern. Pragmatic and unyielding, he was not one to tolerate disorder or dissent, often enforcing strict measures to ensure stability. His long tenure overseeing the
Holy Region
 made him believe he was the most capable of managing its affairs, and he wasn’t afraid to challenge or override his peers to maintain authority. Though his methods were rigid, he saw them as necessary for the greater good. His stern demeanor masked a sharp political mind, always a step ahead in power struggles.

Five Clouds Mountains

During the war against the monster race, Gongyang Zhengqi watched the battle unfold from the shadows. However, when
Wei Wuya
 appeared to aid the human forces, Zhengqi was forced to reveal himself. He emerged with hundreds of golden-armored warriors, similar to
Ghost Asura
. It was then revealed that Zhengqi had orchestrated a secret plot, using the 100,000 True Earth Seals to trap both the monster race and his own allies,

Gongyang Zhengqi's plan was to unlock the seal of Five Cloud Mountain, allowing the human and demon tribes to battle and weaken each other. His ultimate goal was to use the golden-armored warriors and the
Earth Alliance
 to eliminate the Monster tribe and take control of the weakened Holy Land, reorganizing it under his authority.

However, the Monster tribe's unexpected strength prolonged the war, forcing him to involve various Holy Land factions. The heavy losses, including the deaths of key directors, were not part of his plan, as he aimed to control a strong and unified Holy Land. His carefully crafted strategy began to unravel as circumstances spiraled beyond his control.
