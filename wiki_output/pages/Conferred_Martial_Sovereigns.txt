In-depth Information

The
Ten Martial Sovereigns
 didn't only represent the peak of the
Heavenly Martial World
, but their name was also like a shining star, majestic and intimidating. The so-called
Titled Martial Sovereigns
 were only ranked on the
Heaven and Earth Wind and Cloud List
 of the
Holy Region
. There are still many experts who didn't participate in this competition.

For example, the Leaders of the
Seven Superpowers
. Everyone of them has the cultivation of
Divine Transcendence
 - making them possible prospects to become a
Titled Martial Sovereign
. To not lose their reputation or cause an imbalance between the
Seven Superpowers
, which keep each other in check, they decided not to participate.

In addition to the
Titled Martial Sovereigns
 and the
Seven Superpowers
, there are many other peerless experts. The
Bo Imperial Family
 and the
Four Royal Families
 of the
Four Seas
, the
Tyrannic Monsters
 of the
Illusory Realm of Stars and Moons
, the
Three Great Saints
 and the
Five Rulers
 of the
Holy Region
, the
Overlords
 of some
Forbidden Lands
. As well as Leaders of some
Hidden Families and Sects
, they all possess the peak strength of the
Heavenly Martial World
.

Trivia

Divine Transcendence
.

Some of the people in the top 20 were only
Nine-Star Martial Sovereigns
.

It has been almost thirty years since the
Martial Arts Conference
 being held by
Holy Region
.
