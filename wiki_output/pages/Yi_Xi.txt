Personality

Yi Xi is arrogant, cunning, and pragmatic. He is quick to anger when his pride is challenged but can also be calculating when assessing a situation. He is not blindly reckless and knows when to retreat if necessary. He values his own survival and will exploit technicalities or loopholes to his advantage, as seen in his attempt to manipulate Tian Xingzi's promise to protect.

Plot

Yi Xi and
Shang Chen
 had been ordered by Wei Qing to pursue
Yuan Gaohan
main body and capture him. However, their mission took a disastrous turn when they encountered Li Yunxiao and
Tian Xingzi
 at
Battle Soul Mountain,
 A fierce battle broke out, and despite their efforts, Yi Xi and Shang Chen were steadily pushed into a disadvantageous position. Realizing they had no choice but to retreat, they attempted to flee.

As Yi Xi tried to follow Shang Chen in retreat, Li Yunxiao swiftly acted, unleashing the
Thirty-Six Northern Heaven Cold Stars
 to cut off Yi Xi’s path, trapping him in a cage of gleaming starlight. Struggling and desperate, Yi Xi found himself cornered.

At that moment, a chilling voice echoed in the air.
Qiu Mujie
, who had been hiding and silently watching Li Yunxiao’s battle with
Dark Division
, finally revealed himself. Stepping forward, he confronted his traitorous adopted son. Yi Xi’s face turned deathly pale as terror gripped him—he knew there was no escape.

Qiu Mujie wasted no time. Without mercy, he extended his hand and
directly extracted Yi Xi’s soul
, tearing it from his body to search his memories. Yi Xi’s screams of agony were brief, fading as his essence was pulled apart. Once Qiu Mujie had obtained what he needed, he coldly crushed the struggling remnants of Yi Xi’s soul, erasing him from existence.

His betrayal punished, Yi Xi’s life ended in utter helplessness—his final moments spent in overwhelming fear, unable to defy the fate he had brought upon himself.

Power

Yi Xi's technique involves refining the corpses of powerful warriors into corpse puppets using talismans. He summons seven coffins—one dark gold and six dark red—which explode to reveal lifelike, armored corpses. The central figure, a
Warlord
 in a golden crown and battle robe, exudes an imposing presence. Although the power of these corpse puppets was far less than when they were alive, These corpse puppets are highly durable and nearly indestructible, far surpassing ordinary ones due to specialized refinement.
