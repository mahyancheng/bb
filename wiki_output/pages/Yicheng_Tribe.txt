They followed an order from the
Guang Family
, the ruler of the Eastern Sea, to besiege a human, the Vanquisher Martial Sovereign – ⁣
Gu Feiyang
. As a result, along with many other Second Warlord-Rate Sea Clans, they suffered heavy losses. It's said that at least a hundred Martial Sovereigns died in that battle.

The Butterfly Bee/Yicheng Clan, in particular, saw all of its Martial Emperors and above perish. This led to a significant decline in their strength, allowing other Sea Clans to rise and seize their territory. The decline was so severe that they had to migrate to the Southern Sea for recuperation. Only through recuperation and breeding did they manage to regain their strength, which eventually led to their migration to the Southern Sea.
