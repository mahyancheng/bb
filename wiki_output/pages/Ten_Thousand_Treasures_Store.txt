History

The
Myriad Treasures Store
 is one of the oldest and most powerful merchant organizations in the world,
founded tens of thousands of years ago
. Its rise to power was not purely based on business acumen but was greatly aided by a
mysterious ancient treasure trove
 discovered by its founder. This treasure contained immense wealth, rare artifacts, and possibly even divine-level inheritances, which allowed the store to rapidly expand and eventually become
the number one Chamber of Commerce
 in the world.

Over time,
Myriad Treasures Store
 became the dominant force within the
Merchant Union
, controlling vast trade routes, precious resources, and rare cultivation techniques.

The
Great Bliss Formation
 is one of the
Three Ancient Ominous Formations
, known for its overwhelming and unpredictable power. This formation is so ancient and complex that very few people in the current era understand its true potential. Even with extensive knowledge of formations, only a fraction of its power can be activated—
even 10% of its full power is already devastating

the ten thousand word Wang token

With this token, Yunxiao could
mobilize all resources of the Merchant Union at any time
, as seeing the token was equivalent to seeing Wan Yiqian himself. Only
five such tokens existed in the entire world
, making it a priceless asset. Not even the elders have the Royal token of ten thousand words. Only the tower master, the Grand Elder, and a few prominent big shots in the heavenly martial arts realm can have it.
