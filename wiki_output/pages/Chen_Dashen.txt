Chen Dasheng was
Li Chunyang
 sworn brother and a once-formidable warrior of
Tianshui Kingdom
. He suffered severe injuries during the
Ranking Battle
 against Baizhan State, where he replaced
Li Chunyang
 in a crucial fight. The cold poison he contracted left him bedridden for 5 years, relying on
Li Chunyang’s energy and alchemical treatments
 to survive.

History

Five years ago,
King of Tianshui
Qin Zheng
 deliberately sent him to participate in the
Ranking Battle
, intending to weaken
Li Chunyang
 influence by eliminating those close to him. Though Chen Dasheng barely survived the battle, he was ambushed upon his return to the capital. If not for
Li Chunyang’s intervention
, he would have perished that very night.

To protect him,
Li Chunyang faked his death
, using a death row prisoner as a decoy while secretly tending to his injuries in a hidden chamber within his residence. However,
Dasheng was severely wounded by Yi Xiaoshan’s ice energy
, which seeped into his body, making his condition deteriorate over the years despite continuous treatment.

Plot

Chen Dasheng had been paralyzed for five years due to extreme cold poison, with previous treatments only easing symptoms but not curing him. Yunxiao used a Mysterious Fire Pill and pure Yang energy to expel the poison completely. As a result, Chen Dasheng regained feeling in his legs and was able to stand again, bringing great joy to him and Li Chunyang.

After
Li Yunxiao
 cured
chen Dasheng
 of his illness, he was given no time to rest.
Li Chunyang
 and Yunxiao urgently sought his help to repel an enemy army that had infiltrated
Tianshui Kingdom
. Recognizing the gravity of the situation,
Chen Dasheng
 was appointed as the
Commander-in-Chief
 of the mission, leading the effort to drive out the invaders.
