History

Langya Heaven
 was once a grand and powerful sect in ancient times, possessing immense knowledge and influence. However, despite its former glory, historical records contain little to no information about it, suggesting it deliberately concealed its existence or was erased from history.

The remnants of Langya Heaven hold powerful artifacts and secrets, and its
Eternal World
 can only be accessed by breaking four major restrictions:

Four Pavilions

Jade Library

The
Jade Pavilion
 is a mystical, floating structure in
Langya Heaven
, radiating a warm luster and a deep scholarly aura. It serves as an ancient
repository of knowledge
, containing countless
Jade Slips
 filled with powerful techniques, scriptures, and inheritances from a once-great sect.

Though it exists within Langya Heaven, the
Jade Pavilion has its own will
—not everyone who encounters it can access its wisdom. A
barrier of spiritual energy
 protects the Jade Slips, preventing warriors from taking them by force. Only those with fate and destiny aligned can receive its teachings.

At the heart of the Jade Pavilion lies a
mysterious teleportation array
, which leads to
108 different library spaces
. Those who enter are transported to different realms based on their unique fortunes, where they may obtain special inheritances or techniques.

Jade Pavilion is all-encompassing and has a vast collection of books contains powerful secret techniques.
