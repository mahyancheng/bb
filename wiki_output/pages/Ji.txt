Appearance

Ji was like a pool of stagnant water. Standing there, it seemed as if this person did not exist, and it was bottomless.

Plot

After the downfall of one Demon Lord and the humiliation of the demon race, Ji proposed that the remaining four Demon Lords combine their power to widen the crack. In the short term, this would allow demons below the Demon Lord level to pass through. However, in exchange, the four Demon Lords would be bound, and their cultivation levels would temporarily drop significantly for half a year.
