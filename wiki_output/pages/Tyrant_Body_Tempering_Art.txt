The
Tyrant Body Tempering Technique
 is an ancient and powerful
body refinement method
 found within the treasure trove of Myriad Treasures Store. It was a
peerless
 and nearly
godlike technique
, meant to push one’s physical body to near-indestructible levels, making the user akin to a
divine being
 in the mortal realm.

The technique was unique in that it
could not be learned through traditional means
, such as jade slips or written manuals. Instead, it required a
special medium of inheritance
, meaning it could only be
passed down to a destined individual
. Once inherited, it could not be transferred to another person, making it a
one-time-only
 opportunity.

Since reaching the
Immortal State
 had become impossible in the current world, the
Tyrant Body Tempering Technique
 was one of the few remaining methods for a cultivator to achieve
godlike power
 through sheer physical strength.

Wan Yiqian initially intended to pass down the
Tyrant Body Tempering Technique
 to a suitable successor who could help strengthen Myriad Treasures Store. After careful consideration, he approached
the Ao Family
, a
hidden aristocratic clan
 known for their expertise in physical cultivation.
