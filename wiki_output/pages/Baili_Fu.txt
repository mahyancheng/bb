However, Wu Dacheng relied on his mysterious movement technique, effortlessly dodging every attack while waiting for the perfect moment.

When the opportunity arose, he struck with a single precise punch, disrupting Baili Fu’s internal energy and causing his body to collapse from within. Seizing the advantage, Wu Dacheng unleashed a relentless barrage of attacks, leaving Baili Fu coughing up blood. Seeing no way to turn the tide, the Holy Wind Sect’s leader admitted defeat, leaving Baili Fu humiliated and resentful.
