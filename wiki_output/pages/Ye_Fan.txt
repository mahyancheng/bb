The mountain's peak undergoes rapid transformations, with spring, summer, autumn, and winter all manifesting at different levels. The mountain's appearance reflects the four seasons, with spring at the midpoint, peach blossoms, withered trees, and snow at the base.

 and his group, including Zhang Shaotian and others, enter the Immortal Mountain and are awed by the profound changes in the surroundings. Li Yunxiao reveals that the Soul Devouring Sect members possess a secret technique for soul-searching, which they can use to locate living and even deceased souls.
