Plot

After the devastating battle,
New Yan city
 was left in ruins, its vitality severely damaged. The city had suffered massive destruction, with two of its four teleportation formations completely destroyed, limiting movement in and out of the region. The city's infrastructure was in disarray, and the merchant Union, led by
Ding Shan
, immediately took control, ordering a
ten-day lockdown
 for reorganization and recovery.

In the aftermath,
Ding Shan expelled Myriad Treasures Store and Empyrean One Pavilion
 from the merchant Union, effectively forcing them to evacuate. Given the deep foundations these organizations had within the city, it was nearly impossible for them to relocate everything within the short deadline. However, Yunxiao, showing his usual resourcefulness, devised a plan to salvage the situation—
selling off fixed assets at a discount
 to the Star and Moon School and the Money Sect, ensuring they wouldn’t leave behind any valuable resources.

Tensions ran high as
Wan Yiqian

and Su Lianyi
—leaders of the expelled factions—struggled to accept this forced removal. Though they had no choice but to comply, they understood that Myriad Treasures Store and Empyrean One Pavilion were now inseparably linked in their survival outside the merchant Union.
