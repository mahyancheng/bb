Ying Lin
, the president of the thunderwind Chamber of Commerce's branch in Southfire city, He arrives at the
Big Dipper Sect
 in a massive
Seventh-Tier Golden Sun Battleship
, which is more valuable than an Eighth-Tier Profound Weapon, deliberately causing
intimidation
 and exerting pressure, unsettling both sect disciples and rogue cultivators.

Appearance

A man wearing a purple robe with dragon patterns embroidered on it.

Plot

He pretends to bring the battleship as a
gift
 for the sect’s rising stars, presenting it as a
championship prize
 to create goodwill and openly
mocks
Zhang Linghua
 and the Big Dipper Sect, calling their protective formation a “toy” that wouldn’t matter to his Chamber of Commerce.

Because Zhang linghua has advanced to the rank of a martial Supreme, Ying Lin had no choice but to use his Profound Weapon to ambush everyone that went to Land of Death, "
the mirror of the calm lake
", an eighth-grade profound level weapon treasure was refined by an Alchemist master of my thunderwind Chamber of Commerce for more than half a year, and he spent a lot of money to buy a drop of hundred rivers primordial water to fuse with it. The
Hundred Rivers Primordial Water
 is a colorless and odorless substance, undetectable even by the most powerful spiritual senses. Highly toxic, it is a force that ordinary martial artists cannot withstand. Once it enters a person's body, it gradually erodes their vitality, suppressing their talent and weakening their cultivation base over time. Even the most formidable warriors would find it nearly impossible to advance in their cultivation, their strength slowly diminishing until they could no longer progress.
As a substance close to the very origin of the water element, even a single drop of
Hundred Rivers Primordial Water
 is exceedingly rare and precious. Its potency is unparalleled, making it a terrifying weapon against even the strongest practitioners.

To refine the
Dancing Jade-Like Lake Mirro
r
, the Thunderwind Chamber of Commerce poured the entire spiritual essence of an elemental stone mine into its creation. This profound weapon, was granted to Ying Lin by the Chamber’s headquarters as a testament to his exceptional management of the Southfire City branch.
The
Mirror of the Calm Lake
 became the branch’s most treasured possession.
