the president of the Mando Chamber of Commerce.

Plot

Xu Wansen is a respected and influential figure in the business world, known for his intelligence and strategic thinking. He is a leader of one of the major Chambers of Commerce and is well aware of the power struggles between rival factions. Unlike others who may blindly resist, Xu Wansen understands when he is outmatched and prefers to act with dignity rather than suffer humiliation.

When confronted by Ding Shan’s ruthless scheme to use him as a
"medicinal herb"
 to further his own power, Xu Wansen acknowledges defeat with grace. He recognizes
Ding Shan
 ambition but warns that controlling two Chambers of Commerce will not automatically grant him dominance, as other powerful factions—such as the
Ten Thousand Treasures Store
 and
Money Gang
—are always waiting for an opportunity to strike.

In his final act, Xu Wansen chooses to
die on his own terms
, avoiding further disgrace by
taking his own life
 rather than being manipulated or tortured. His insight and composure in his last moments show that he is not only a seasoned businessman but also a man of
principle and honor
.
