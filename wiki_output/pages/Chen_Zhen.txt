Chen Zhen
 and Han Bai tried to protect Li Yunxiao from Du Feng and Luo Jie, but unfortunately, despite Han Bai's strength as a 4-chakra Martial Apprentice, Luo Jie was a 5-chakra Martial Apprentice. When confronting him, his hand broke, and with a few breaths, Qin Ruxue came to try to push them away and protect Li Yunxiao, but in the end, Li Yunxiao defeated the two in moments.
