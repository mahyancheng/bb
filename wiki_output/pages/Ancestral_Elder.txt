The Ancestral Elder of the Mo family in Black Iron City is the family's spiritual pillar, holding a status even higher than the sect masters of the seven superpowers. His strength is so profound that not even the experts of the Sanctuary or the leaders of the seven superpowers dare to claim they can defeat him.

Appearance

A Sage-like figure, He held a piece of Jade in his hand, and every step he took contained the laws of heaven and earth. It was as if he was the embodiment of the laws of heaven and earth, and his every move was a martial Dao.

Background

For many years, even the six Grand Supreme Elders have not seen his true body, only knowing that he cultivates in Black Iron City without knowing his exact location. To most of the Mo family's younger generation, the Ancestral Elder is a distant legend—many have never even seen his clone, let alone his real form. His rare appearance causes great excitement and awe among the Mo family disciples.

Plot

In the past, the Ancestral Elder had a brief confrontation with
Gu Feiyang
 when he arrived in Black Iron City to fulfill the promise
Mo Douchen
 had made. However, since Mo Douchen had already passed away, the Ancestral Elder offered to fight in his place. They exchanged a few moves, and even the Ancestral Elder had to admit that Gu Feiyang was more talented than Mo Douchen, the most gifted member of the Mo family. He also acknowledged that in a few years, he would no longer be a match for Gu Feiyang.

Later, the Ancestral Elder supported Mo Xiaochuan’s decision to become Gu Feiyang’s disciple and even requested a favor from Gu Feiyang regarding Mo Xiaochuan’s deceased father.
