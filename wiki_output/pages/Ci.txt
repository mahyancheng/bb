Plot

Five Cloud Mountain

High Priest Ci and Li appeared at Five Cloud Mountain to stop Huang and Ai, advising against breaking the seal. They warned that releasing the monsters before the monster race was united would lead to greater chaos. However, due to their differing views, Huang attempted to eliminate them. As Huang attacked, Ci and Li tried to retreat.  Although they managed to escape, Ci's true energy was damaged by Huang's countless Silver Snakes attack.

In the all out war between monsters and humans, the arrival of human reinforcements turned the tide of the battle in human favor. Shang and Mo suggested a strategic retreat, but Huang saw this as betrayal. Revealing his breakthrough to the Void Extreme Divine Realm, Huang confronted Shang but was stopped by Ci. After giving Ci a final chance to side with him only to be refused once again, Huang executed Ci without mercy.

Technique

Spiritual Light Reversal is a technique that summons a long snake with silver-brown ghost patterns capable of causing dizziness at first glance. These Ghost-Patterned Silver Dragons were cultivated over decades by Ai, who feared that
Yu Shengfeng
 soul possession technique would threaten the Demon Race. Devoting half her life, she created this divine ability to restrain him, designed to bite souls and exploit the weaknesses of the Six Obstacles Removal Art—making it the perfect counter to Yu Shengfeng’s technique. If the
Ghost King
 hadn't fought with the eight
Ghost Asura
 and killed all the ghost snakes and silver dragons with his terrifying power, Yu Shengfeng would have been killed. (Novel Ch 1470)
