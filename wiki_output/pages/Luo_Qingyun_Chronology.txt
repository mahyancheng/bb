Plot

Qionghua Island:

He engaged in a fierce battle with
Li Yunxiao
, using "Universal Art - Return to Ruins" countered by Yunxiao's "Sword Art - Star Annihilation." Luo Qingyun revealed the Spirit Heaven Ring, entrancing many with its sound. Li Yunxiao struggled against this mental attack. Their battle intensified as they unleashed powerful techniques. Luo Qingyun transformed into a dragon with the Soaring Dragon Body technique, and Li Yunxiao used the Great Illusory Fist, threatening Qionghua Island. Luo Qingyun underwent demonification, gaining monstrous strength. Their clash created an independent space, showcasing their mastery. Luo Qingyun used "Dragon's Dominion Four Extremes" with a dragon's shadow. Li Yunxiao responded with a phoenix shadow, leading to a cataclysmic collision, causing a black hole. The battle affected Mingxin Lake, but the Enforcers and the Elders hesitated to intervene. Luo Qingyun fell into the sea but survived using the Heaven Spirit Ring. Li Yunxiao extracted some of his blood, revealing a planned escape route and sparing Luo Qingyun. He collected crystal stones, and
Tu Lei
 surrendered on Luo Qingyun's behalf. Li Yunxiao won, and the competition ended.

Mount Meru:

During their exploration, they encountered the powerful and mysterious Di Jia, who had been sealed for a long time. The confrontation with Di Jia turned out to be disastrous for the group as they were no match for his black Demon Qi.
In the midst of the battle, Luo Qingyun was severely injured and almost lost his life. However, he managed to survive and confronted
Di Jia
 once again, using the Desolate God's Moon Spear to attack. However, even with his powerful strikes, he couldn't defeat Di Jia, and the demon easily brushed off his attacks. Eventually,
Xu Qing
 used a technique to make a Martial Sovereign's divine consciousness descend to suppress the Black Demon Shadow temporarily. In a desperate attempt, Lu Daozi and the others managed to escape through a hole created by
Lu Daozi's
 Martial Sovereign equal-attack, leaving Di Jia weakened and frustrated. Li Yunxiao and Luo Qingyun used the Heavenly Spiritual Ring to escape the inner hall, and the Soaring Heaven Palace's defenses opened, causing the inner hall to collapse and create a massive whirlpool at the bottom of the sea. Many corpses were left in the aftermath of the intense battle.
