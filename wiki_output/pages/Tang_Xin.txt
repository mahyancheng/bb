Plot

Song Yueyang City

Upon Li Yunxiao’s arrival in Song Yueyang City for the Alliance Merchant Martial Arts and Alchemy Competition, he invited Tang Xin and
Qian Wudi
 to discuss valuable information regarding the Heaven and Earth Chess Game and to uncover the truth about Tang Jie’s time in the Demon Origin Plains, particularly whether he had truly obtained Noah’s Ark. In exchange for this information, Li Yunxiao requested their cooperation in helping the
Tianyun Merchant Guild
 survive the impending crisis.

Crimson Crescent City Wedding

After a long period of secluded cultivation, Tang Xin finally broke through to the Martial Emperor realm. However, upon emerging, he was met with urgent news—if he did not appear within three days, the First Master would likely send someone to forcefully retrieve him, or worse, replace him entirely.

The true purpose of the upcoming wedding was clear to all: to solidify an alliance with the Jiang family and cement Tang Qing’s rule. The recent battle with the Sea Race had left the Eastern Region weakened, with Red Moon City suffering heavy losses. Yet, Tang Qing’s power had only grown stronger. With this marriage, his control over Red Moon City would become absolute. To many, this wedding symbolized the end of the old era and the dawn of the Tang family’s dominance.
