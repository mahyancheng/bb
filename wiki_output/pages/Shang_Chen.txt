Shangchen, the head of the Dark Division.

Plot

After Li Yunxiao drove Shang Chen away, Shang Chen realized that he could not return to the Holy Land without an explanation for his failure. Desperate, he turned to another major faction hostile to
Myriad Stars Valley
 the
Devouring Soul Sect
. There, he sought the aid of Huangfu Bi. Huangfu Bi, in turn, agreed to help Shang Chen eleminate Yuan Gaohan. This was because
Li Yunxiao
 had previously defeated the Golden Speaker, a formidable golden soul, leaving
Huangfu Bi
 in urgent need of a peak-level magic soul to compensate for the loss.

Shang Chen pursued Li Yunxiao, who had entered the earth to collect Golden Spirit Energy. Shang Chen engaged in a fierce battle against Li Yunxiao that has gone into the earth to collect the golden spirit energy, unleashing his ultimate technique. As the battle intensified, the
Divine Purple Gold Bug
 joined the fight, turning it into a three-way clash of immense power. Each combatant pushed their abilities to the limit, shaking the very fabric of space. However, Shang Chen was soon overwhelmed by the combined might of Tushita Peak and the Divine Purple Gold Bug. Trapped with no escape, he struggled in vain as the two forces collided. In an instant, his body was shattered, dissolving into black light and vanishing without a trace. His Qi Tian Sword trembled under the crushing pressure before finally snapping apart, reduced to mere fragments.

Power

The Qitian sword

Sky Splitter, The sword's light surged, and the ancient characters "Qitian Sword" shimmered transparently. A vast power erupted, pressing down with immense force. In that instant, Shang Chen unleashed his full potential, achieving perfect unity with his sword. This was exactly half of the divine skill "Creating the World"—his ultimate technique.

Dark Art, This secret technique seems to be able to devour everything.

Trivia

Dark Division
