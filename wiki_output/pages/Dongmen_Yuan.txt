Plot

Dongmen Yuan was captured by the
merchant Union
 and sentenced to execution for his crimes. During his public beheading, a
ninth-rank demonic scorpion
 suddenly appeared and attacked the execution site.

At first, people thought the scorpion had been sent by
Ling Baiyi
 to
rescue Dongmen Yuan
, but instead, it
attacked him directly
. With its massive pincers, the scorpion
slashed through the air
, creating violent tornado-like astral winds. These deadly wind blades struck Dongmen Yuan,
slicing his body into pieces
.

His
head was severed
, flying far away, his face frozen in
unwillingness and resentment
 as he died instantly.

This brutal and unexpected death
shocked everyone
, making them realize that Ling Baiyi was so ruthless that he would
kill his own subordinate
 rather than let him be executed by others.
