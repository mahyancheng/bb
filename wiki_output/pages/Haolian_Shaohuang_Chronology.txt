Plot

Demon Origin Plains:

Young Emperor Hao Lian traverses the Demon Plain, displaying a deep connection with nature that allows him to move unnoticed among its creatures. Even a Demon Snake, normally hostile, climbs over him without aggression. The snake catches a Five-Elements Spirit Devouring Rat, and while devouring it, Hao Lian displays a sense of pity for the creatures.

The
Storm Mercenary Group
, led by
Chen Chuanjiu
, observes Hao Lian and recognizes his mastery over the Laws of Heaven and Earth. They attempt a surprise attack, but Hao Lian remains calm and unresponsive. He retrieves the half-eaten Spirit Rat from the snake's mouth, hinting at his compassion for all living beings.

Hao Lian's display of power and empathy astonishes his enemies. When they attack again, he uses a green battle armor to protect the Demon Snake and Spirit Rat. The armor shatters under their assault, seemingly injuring Hao Lian. However, he tricks his attackers by escaping into a pit and later reemerges to eliminate
Ouyang Qi
