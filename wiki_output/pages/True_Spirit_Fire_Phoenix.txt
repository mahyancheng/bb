Background

the real Dragon and the heavenly Phoenix are born by gathering the essence of heaven and earth. They are the embodiment of the true 'Dao' of the heavenly martial realm, just like the
Brahma Zifu apocalyptic godly Thunder
. They are 'spiritual creatures' to carry out the Dao on behalf of heaven. When the heavenly martial realm is in chaos or crisis, the real Dragon and the heavenly Phoenix will be born.

the inheritance of the celestial Phoenix relies on the power of the bloodline to pass on its inheritance. When the heavenly Dao needs it, someone with the bloodline of the celestial Phoenix will appear and grow into the new generation of the celestial Phoenix. Because of that The heavenly Phoenix bloodline was considered an invisible bloodline. It was extremely rare in the inheritance, and even if it appeared, it was difficult to stimulate its power. However, the inheritor of the bloodline back then was extremely talented, far above feini. However, Qianqian died before she could step into the world King realm and grow into a true Heavenly Phoenix, thats the reason why heavenly Phoenix bloodline appear since 100.000 Thousand Years ago.
