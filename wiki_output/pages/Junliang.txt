As Jun Liang opened a stall at the market selling rare herbal ingredients,
Meng Wu
 approached, hoping to buy a vial of Magic Water for her ailing little brother. However, she didn’t have enough money to afford it. Desperate, she tried to negotiate, but Jun Liang saw an opportunity to exploit her predicament.

With ill intentions in his heart, he made an indecent proposal he would give her the Magic Water, but only if she agreed to be his girlfriend for three months. His true motive was clear, as he coveted her innocence. When she hesitated, he attempted to grope her, forcing himself upon her.

Just as Meng Wu was about to fall into despair, Li Yunxiao appeared, his presence like a cold blade cutting through the filth of the situation. Without a word, he intervened, stopping Jun Liang in his tracks. Seeing through his deceitful scheme, Yunxiao did not hesitate. With merciless precision, he struck, shattering Jun Liang’s dantian and crippling him on the spot.
