Plot

Light Song Forest

Ye Fan
,
Tao Guan
,
Feng Zhu
, and Qi Guang confront
Li Yunxiao
 in the Light Song Forest. Li Yunxiao cleverly takes Yi Fan hostage to initiate a negotiation. The Sacred Fire Temple seeks the Yang Key and believes it's linked to Noah's Ark. During the discussion, they tentatively agree to cooperate, aiming to rescue Tang Jie, take Yang Key and locate Noah's Ark. However, an explosion disrupts their conversation, leading to speculation about Tang Jie's rescue and the involvement of various factions.

As they observe the chaos,
Zou Chen
 offers his Time-fixing Plate to assist the crowd in tracking auras. Zou Chen uses the Time-fixing Plate to trace a lead to the east of the Demon Plains, where Noah's Ark might be located. Li Yunxiao's group proposes a plan to intercept the Skeleton Mercenary Group, discovering a teleportation array within their headquarters. They activate it and arrive in the Demon Plain, while other factions continue their pursuit of Noah's Ark.

Demon Origin Plains

After teleporting to the Demon Plain, Li Yunxiao's group discusses their encounter with the Skeleton Mercenary Group. The conversation shifts to
Ye Nantian
's notes about breaking through to the Divine Realm. Li Yunxiao seeks to view the notes, leading to a deal: he helps them obtain Noah's Ark in exchange for access to the notes. Tension arises when
Feng Zhu
 challenges Li Yunxiao's skills. Suddenly, the legendary creature "
Wu
" appears behind Li Yunxiao, leaving the group awestruck. The Wu enters its own body and disappears, a rare and enigmatic event that emphasizes the rarity and significance of the encounter.

Continuing their journey, the group finds a preserved corpse of a powerful Martial Supreme killed by
Young Master Hao Lian
. Concerns about Hao Lian's motives arise. Dark clouds gather, signaling the arrival of forces from other territories. Three formidable warships, two Rank 7 Golden Sun Warships and a Rank 8 Netherworld Warship, appear in the sky.  Amidst the warships,
Xuan Bing
 commands an attack from formidable warships, forcing Li Yunxiao's group to narrowly escape. Amidst the battle, the Imperial Bell emerges, withstanding attacks.
Feng Zhu
 and
Qi Guang
 join, using “Holy Skill” techniques to clash with Xuan Bing. The World God Monument appears and causes a warship to sink, leading to chaos.

Li Yunxiao suppresses the Netherworld Warship using the
World God Monument
, causing it to sink irreparably. Xuan Bing and his forces are left in shock and desperation over the loss of the two warships. Interrogating captives, they learn about involvement from the Feather Frost Sect, led by Martial Sovereign. The group continues its quest cautiously, sensing hostile auras ahead. Investigating the strange death of an eighth-rank Soul-shattering Tapir, the possibility of a Peak Martial Sovereign's presence raises concerns, as their pursuit of Noah's Ark could be threatened. Despite the fear and uncertainty, the members of the Sacred Fire Temple reaffirm their determination to continue their quest for Noah's Ark. They are motivated by their ancestral legacy and the opportunity to restore their sect's glory.
