One of the two strongest human organizations of the world, and considered the de facto rulers of the Tianwu continent. Their word is law across the continent, with no power willingly defiant before them.

Background

About 100,000 years ago, during the final years of the
Demon Lord's reign,
 the world's experts gathered in Misty Snow Sacred City to discuss how to deal with demon lord. At that time, it was only the simplest organization, and their goal was also very clear, which was to exterminate the demon lord.

Later, the successfully sealed the demon lord, and in order to prevent him from returning to the world, these people did not leave, but used Misty Snow Sacred City as a stronghold and established the organization
Holy Region
, with the responsibility of monitoring the demon lord's seal.

General Information

Holy Region is like a continent floating in the void, just like the
Sea of Soul Formation
. They can be reached either by teleportation arrays on the
Tianwu Continent
 or by tearing the space (Martial Sovereigns). Other than that, there are no ways to reach it.

The Holy Region is equally governed by a council of 5 rulers with 3 high elders overseeing the organization.

Apart from them, there exists a multitude of directors, vice directors, leaders and soldiers who work in a great variety of tasks to preserve the stability of the Holy Region and Tianwu Continent.

The Blade of Judgment

The Blade of Judgment is an unknown-grade Xuan Artifact, enshrined as the Holy Region Absolute Punishment Weapon, The blade of judgement can only be used with the approval of three rulers.  The Blade of Judgment is a fearsome weapon of absolute destruction, wielded by the Sanctuary to maintain dominance over the world.

It is not an ordinary blade—it is a cursed weapon, forged from the blood and resentment of countless fallen experts.
For centuries, the Blade of Judgment has been used to execute the strongest warriors, absorbing their essence, grievances, and evil energy, making it stronger with each kill. The accumulated hatred and bloodlust within it have turned it into a terrifying force, capable of warping reality itself.
When unleashed, the blade engulfs the battlefield in an Asura-like purgatory, where the cries of the slain echo through the air. It strikes with unstoppable power, overwhelming even the most powerful beings, making them tremble in fear.

The magnitude of this Xuan Artifact power was first demonstrated in history during the Human vs Monster war at the Five Cloud Mountains, where Wei Qing, a
Divine Transcendent
, used the Weapon to its full power and nearly killed the King of Monsters,
Huang
, who was just one step away from reaching the
Primary Void Realm
, and who as a Monster possessed a physical body stronger than an ordinary Human. Therefore, it is obvious that it possesses more power than an ordinary Holy Artifact.
