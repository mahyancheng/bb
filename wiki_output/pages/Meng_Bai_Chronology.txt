History

Her father was a brave captain who once served the state but died on a mission three years ago. Since then, he and older sister, Meng  Wu, lost their main source of income and had to survive on a meager pension, forcing them to move to the suburbs.

At fourteen, Meng Bai had already opened five chakras, showing greater potential.

However, this year, Meng Bai suddenly became absent-minded, frequently falling into a coma, and his body shifted between hot and cold for unknown reasons.
