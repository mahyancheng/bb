History

Ever since
Li Yunxiao
 caused chaos in Red Moon City, the once-powerful Ruan family, once one of the city's three major families, has been steadily declining. They can no longer compare to the dominant Ning and Jiang families. Although Red Moon City remains one of the seven major forces in the Eastern Region, it now occupies one of the weakest positions. The city is home to many complex factions, with the Ning and Jiang families holding the most power. Decades ago, the Ruan family was a major force, but after most of their masters were killed by Gu Feiyang, their influence diminished, and they lost the prestige they once held.

later After experiencing the fall of Jiang Churan, the invasion of Tang Qing, the continuous internal strife, the external resistance against the sea tribe, and a series of major events that hurt the bones, the Redmoon city had long fallen to the bottom of the seven major forces, and even not on the same level.

Plot

The grand wedding in Red Moon City, meant to unite the Tang and Jiang families, turned into a battlefield the moment Li Yunxiao appeared. Chaos erupted as countless forces clashed for their own interests, turning the city into a scene of devastation.

Top experts from across the realm gathered—peak nine-star powerhouses, divine transcendence experts, sect masters, titled martial sovereigns, leaders of the Holy Lands, the terrifying Ghost King, the unknown Demonic Lord, and even the Sea Emperor, who had arrived in a borrowed body. Yet, in this blood-soaked battleground, once-mighty figures were reduced to mere pawns. Even Saint weapons, unseen for tens of thousands of years, became as common as street goods.

Amid the chaos, Tang Qing and his son perished, leading to the complete collapse of the Tang family’s influence. When the dust settled, Red Moon City fell under the control of the Sanctum, with Luo Qingyun appointed as City Lord and Li Yi as Vice City Lord.
