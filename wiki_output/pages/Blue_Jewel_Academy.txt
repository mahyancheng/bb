Blue Jewel (Jialan Academy) is the most prestigious martial institution in Tianshui, governed by its own strict rules, which even the emperor must respect. Led by
Zhong Lishan
, the strongest man in the state, the academy enforces absolute discipline any violation results in severe punishment, as seen when a powerful family was destroyed for seeking revenge on a student.

Despite its strict order, the academy encourages strength-based competition, allowing students to fight freely. It is both a proving ground and a battlefield, where only the strong can survive and rise in power.

Location

Maple Grove
 was one of Jialan Academy's most beautiful landscapes and a popular cultivation spot during the day. However, at night, it became a favored meeting place for secret trysts, especially in the cool, moonless season. Since most students shared dormitories with several others, Maple Grove served as a private retreat for those seeking solitude or intimacy.
