Despite his formidable strength, Wu Jinzun's defenses crumbled. His armor was destroyed, and his body was severely wounded, rendering him powerless. Yunxiao, maintaining complete control of the situation, coldly declared that the Luoqu Chamber of Commerce had no choice but to submit to
Tianyun Merchant Guild
. Wu Jinzun, heavily injured, collapsed in defeat.
