Plot

After Yaozhe pursued the monster that stole the key, he discovered Yunxiao battling Mr. Yang. Confronting Yunxiao, Yaozhe was quickly overwhelmed by Yunxiao's powerful sword techniques and suffered severe injuries. Forced to retreat into the void, he barely escaped with his life. Not long after, the Monster Emperor and Ai arrived in the Qianyue Mansion territory and rescued him.

In the mids of war Zhe successfully set up the Thousand Machine Array within a hundred-mile range to seal off the space, preventing human forces from escaping Five Cloud Mountain and ensuring their complete annihilation. He brought ten thousand monster reinforcements under Huang's command. Entrusted by Huang, Zhe used a profound artifact a mirror as the formation's core to control and maintain the array.
