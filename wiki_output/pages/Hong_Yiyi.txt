Plot

First Encounter

Hong Yiyi reveals her motive to collaborate in eliminating the
Four Extremes Sect
 from the
Light Song Forest
. Despite the vast difference in power between her mercenary group and the influential sect, Hong Yiyi's knowledge of Li Yunxiao's personal grudge with the Four Extremes Sect adds depth to her proposition.

The tension escalates as Hong Yiyi skillfully transitions from playful banter to a more serious tone, hinting at her awareness of Li Yunxiao's connections and even mentioning his association with the
Legendary Martial Sovereign
,
Li Huachi
. As their verbal sparring continues, Hong Yiyi's anger flares due to Li Yunxiao's remarks about her age. She threatens to involve Commander
Hao Lian
, but Li Yunxiao's unwavering demeanor hints at his confidence.

The conversation takes an intriguing turn when Hong Yiyi attacks Li Yunxiao using a technique known as "Pink Bone Erosion." Li Yunxiao effortlessly defends himself with his demonic powers and the Devil Sky Armor. He surprises Hong Yiyi by revealing his awareness of her identity as a member of the
Empyrean One Pavilion
 in the Light Sing Forest. This revelation leaves Hong Yiyi pondering the true extent of Li Yunxiao's knowledge and capabilities.

Hong Yiyi eventually discloses her mission to capture
Tang Jie
, the Young Master of the Four Extremes Sect, alive and discreetly. She proposes a collaboration with Li Yunxiao, suggesting they seize the ongoing Mercenary Meeting, the Heroes Assembly, as an opportunity to achieve their goal. In exchange, Li Yunxiao requests the rare and valuable Nine Evil Underworld Water as a reward.
