Pu Shu was one of the three overlords of the thirty-three heavens From Sealed Land where
Lord Pu
 was sealed. When Pu Shu first met Yunxiao at the fifth layer, he appeared reasonable and even assisted in guiding Yunxiao deeper into the sealed land. However, upon reaching the fourth layer, it became clear that this was all part of a carefully orchestrated trap.

Appearance

A man with two horns on his head, He was taller and stronger than ordinary humans, with bright eyes and extremely high intelligence. His entire body exuded the aura of a superior. Although his expression was calm, the divine light in his eyes contained a pride that was difficult to hide.

Plot

The moment they arrived, a powerful formation was triggered, suppressing their divine senses and drastically increasing the gravitational force amplifying it by a hundred thousand times. Yunxiao quickly realized that Pu Shu, along with the other overlords, had deliberately led him into this ambush.

Their true intention was to eliminate Yunxiao before he could grow stronger. They viewed him as a future threat someone who could one day rival them in the competition for cultivation resources within the sealed land.

unxiao, affected by the intense gravity, unleashed his Tusita Peak. Its weight increased more than tenfold, overwhelming the spatial rules and causing the fourth layer to collapse instantly. The destruction triggered a chain reaction, forcing the third and fifth layers to merge, creating a distinct boundary between the differing densities of demonic Qi.

Pu Shu and the other overlords, shocked by the sheer power of the Tusita Peak, hastily offered an alliance to escape the Sealed Land. However, enraged by their earlier betrayal, Yunxiao declared that if they could withstand a single move from him, he might reconsider their offer.

Yunxiao unleashed the
Destroying Purple Lightning
, instantly shattering Pu Shu’s arms before blasting a hole through his chest. Pu Li and Pu Zai were shocked, their faces turning pale. In just one move, Pu Shu was left crippled if not dead, his strength would still be greatly diminished.
