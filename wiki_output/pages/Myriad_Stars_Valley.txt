Plot

When news of the giant deer, appearing in
Battle Soul Mountain
 spread, Myriad Stars Valley, under Tian Xingzi’s authority, mobilized all its forces to secure the mountain. Despite Battle Soul Mountain being located within the Soul Devouring Sect’s territory, Myriad Stars Valley issued a strict order—no one was allowed near the mountain. They even hired powerful experts to ensure its control. Only later did Tian Xingzi reveal his true purpose. To take the divine purple gold worm, but his ambitions didn’t stop there. His ultimate goal was to subdue the giant deer and make it the guardian beast of Myriad Stars Valley.
