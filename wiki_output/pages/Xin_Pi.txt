Plot

The Zhou Great Family Crisis

Xin Pi played a crucial role in mediating the conflict between Yunxiao and the Zhou Great Family. When Yunxiao threatened to activate the self-destruction of the Green Phoenix Floating Battleship and the Six-Universe Star Observation formation, causing panic among the onlookers, Xin Pi stepped in. He pleaded with Yunxiao to stop, fearing the catastrophic consequences that would follow.

Xin Pi recognized the danger posed by Yunxiao's threat and understood that the Zhou family's reputation and the lives of many innocent people were at stake. He urgently appealed to Yunxiao to reconsider and offered to mediate a peaceful resolution between the parties involved. Despite the initial reluctance and defiance from Yunxiao, Xin Pi's persistence and understanding of the gravity of the situation eventually convinced Yunxiao to halt the self-destruction.

Furthermore, during the negotiation process, Xin Pi played a key role in agreeing to Yunxiao's conditions on behalf of the Zhou family. He conceded to Yunxiao's demands for the release of
Qin Ruxue
, the compensation of Five Million Mid-Grade Primordial Stones, a public apology to
Tianshui Kingdom
, and compensation of Fifty Million Mid-Grade Primordial Stones for Yunxiao's losses. Xin Pi's agreement was driven by the understanding that the consequences of refusing Yunxiao's conditions and allowing the self-destruction of the warship would be catastrophic for the Zhou family and the entire Shangyang city.

The Golden Crow Arena

Xin Pi tried to mediate the situation when Li Yunxiao arrived at the arena with a powerful Martial Grandmaster level demonic beast, stunning everyone. The Zhou family accused Li Yunxiao of cheating in the duel and demanded proof of his beast-taming abilities. Li Yunxiao demonstrated his control over the demonic beast, making it obey his commands, silencing the accusers and impressing the crowd. Later, when Li Yunxiao refused to fight without the beast,

Zhou Yushan
 and counterattacked with exceptional comprehension and skill in his sword technique.

Xin Pi observed the duel between Li Yunxiao and Zhou Yushan and noticed Li Yunxiao's use of seals that even surpassed the Floating Life Seal of
Yang Di
. He discussed this with other experts, speculating that Li Yunxiao might be a successor of one of Gu Feiyang's disciples. Xin Pi also witnessed the intense clash between Li Yunxiao's Heaven and Earth Seal and Zhou Yushan's Snow & Frost Bright Sword, resulting in Zhou Yushan's disappearance from the stage. Xin Pi was shocked by Li Yunxiao's strength and calmly assessed the situation, realizing that there was no one in the
Southern Region
 capable of killing him.

After the duel, Li Yunxiao demanded 100 Million middle-grade Spirit Stones from Xin Pi to settle the matter. The Zhou Great Family suffered a significant blow to their reputation due to these events. Zhou Yushan's death and Zhou Yangbiao's punishment.

Later, he brought the stones to Li Yunxiao in the Duskflame's Association of Alchemist, and he was present when Li Yunxiao defeated a three Rank-Four Alchemist and takes the fifth-tier badge.

 and

Li Yunxiao
 arrives at the Tiger King Chariot, Xin Pi becomes relieved, as he was worried about Li Yunxiao's absence. He later gets into a confrontation with Chu Yu, another Martial Emperor, but is interrupted by Huo Sen, who urges them to focus on the competition for the slots.

As the competition progresses, Xin Pi remains confident in Li Yunxiao's abilities, particularly after witnessing his performance against a Martial Grandmaster in Shangyang City. Xin Pi also supports Li Yunxiao when Chu Yu tries to provoke him. However, he also becomes wary of potential conflicts escalating into a larger-scale war between Empires.
