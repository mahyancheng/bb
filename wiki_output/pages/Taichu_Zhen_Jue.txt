The Taichu Zhen Jue was an ancient divine technique created to control time, allowing its wielder to manipulate its flow and create time domains. However, over generations, the Taichu lineage misused it to peer into fate, bringing them into conflict with the will of heaven.As one of the Four Great Divine Techniques, it stood equal to the Great Realm Divine Art and Great Evolution Divine Art, rivaling even the Devil Lord’s Ice Fiend Heart Flame. The technique had nine levels, but few ever reached its peak. Duanmu Youyu and Duanmu Cang had only reached the fifth and third levels, while Duanmu Qi stopped at the sixth and Bai Lun Jieyi at the eighth. The final level remained hidden within the Jiuyao Xing Staff, waiting for one destined to unlock it.
