Plot

Qionghua Island

He was having a conversation with
Xin Pi
 and
Huo Sen
 in a temporary building by Mingxin Lake. They discussed the rumor of a young genius named
Li Yunxiao
, who supposedly killed a Martial Grandmaster at the age of 15. Chu Yu expressed doubts about the rumor, but Xin Pi revealed that Li Yunxiao did fight a Martial Grandmaster expert and exchange one blow.

When Li Yunxiao arrived with the Tiger King Chariot, Chu Yu's guards tried to stop him, leading to a confrontation. Li Yunxiao displayed his strength and even caused the Tiger King Chariot to explode, leading to tensions between Chu Yu and Li Yunxiao. Chu Yu and Xin Pi also exchanged hostile words, with Chu Yu showing anger towards Li Yunxiao's disrespect.

Chu Yu was secretly approached by the Zhou Family from the
Fire Crow Empire
, who offered a large bargaining chip to have Li Yunxiao killed during the competition. Chu Yu considered adding a mysterious disciple named
Luo Qingyun
 to participate in the competition, believing that Luo Qingyun will defeat Li Yunxiao. However, he also sensed the dangerous situation that might arise due to his decision.
