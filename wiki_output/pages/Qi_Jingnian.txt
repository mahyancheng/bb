Plot

Qi Jingnian hates Li Yunxiao because Yunxiao killed his elder brother, Qi Taisui. Qi Taisui was the master of the Northern Falling Water Stream and practiced an evil cultivation method that involved abducting women, using them as human cauldrons to extract their primordial Yin, and then killing them. When Yunxiao discovered these atrocities, he executed Qi Taisui, believing it to be justified. However, Qi Jingnian, being Qi Taisui’s younger brother, holds a deep grudge against Yunxiao for his brother’s death. Despite the shameful nature of Qi Taisui’s actions,

Qi Jingnian’s anger and desire for revenge against Yunxiao (Gu Feiyang) are clouded by his own contradictions. He claims he was in seclusion cultivating a powerful Divine Art when his brother was killed, but Mao Yingyan exposes a flaw in his story—Qi Jingnian had been freely traveling in the Western Region during that time. This revelation makes it clear that Qi Jingnian did not immediately seek revenge, likely because he either didn't care as much back then or only found it convenient to act now. His flustered response and change of reasoning further undermine his credibility, making him appear more driven by face-saving than true loyalty to his brother.
