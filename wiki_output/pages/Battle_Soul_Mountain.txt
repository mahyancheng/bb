Battle Soul Mountain,the lawless land of
Jiangyu City
 is divided into the outer and inner parts. In the outer part, the gravity can be up to a hundred times, while the inner area is constantly changing. Sometimes it is normal gravity, and sometimes it can suddenly increase to hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands.

Plot & Event

Ten years ago, the
Devouring Soul Sect
 Sect learned that
Tian Xingzi
 had suffered a severe injury during his training and required a powerful earth-type monster to heal his wounds. Seizing this opportunity, the sect meticulously devised a plan to lure him into a trap. Their leader carefully arranged everything, using the Nine Netherworld Dirty Earth to refine a formidable monster and strategically setting up traps within Battle Soul Mountain. For a decade, they waited patiently, preparing for the moment when Tian Xingzi and the forces of Myriad Stars Valley would walk into their scheme.

However, what they didn't realize was that Tian Xingzi’s so-called "serious injury" from ten years ago was, in fact, a deception—a trap he had set for them. Even Tian himself hadn’t foreseen that
Huangfu Bi
, the Soul Devouring Sect's leader, would be capable of orchestrating such a complex counterattack. As both sides finally moved into position, a confrontation decades in the making was about to erupt, with schemes within schemes unfolding in an unpredictable battle of wits and power.

After the  conflict between the Devouring Soul Sect and Myriad Star Valley, the outer part of Battle Soul Mountain was left in ruins, partially blown apart. Both factions suffered heavy casualties, with countless experts perishing in the brutal battle.
