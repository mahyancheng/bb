He is the city lord of
Yufeng City
 in the Northern Region. Since the teleportation array in Yufeng City was damaged, he organized a small trade fair, inviting prominent figures from the city to exchange their rarest treasures. He also invited
Mei Jiu
 to host the event.

Apprarance

He wore a blue robe, his eyes were as clear as lake water, and his face was full of smiles.

Plot

During the fair, he traded the Soul-Raising Tree, formed from the essence of the Kunwu Divine Tree, for the wreckage of an eighth-grade Netherworld Warship that Li Yunxiao possessed.

Later, in an act of generosity reminiscent of
Lei Feng
, he provided Li Yunxiao with free information about a location where mutated water elements might be found.
