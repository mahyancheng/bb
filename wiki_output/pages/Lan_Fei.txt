Plot

Lan Fei appeared to settle the score with Yunxiao after Yunxiao had previously defeated his subordinates. To make a statement, Lan Fei first overpowered Yunxiao’s two friends before confronting him directly. However, despite his confidence, he was swiftly defeated by Yunxiao in a single punch. Adding insult to injury, Yunxiao gave him a choice—either lose his family jewels or hand over all his wealth. Left with no option, Lan Fei was robbed of his fortune, including his family's prized jade pendant, the Five-Colored Divine Stone.

Later on, after his failed attempt to scam Li Yunxiao, Lan was expelled from the academy, losing his status and reputation.
