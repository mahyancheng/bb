Heaven and Earth Power Chart

's good friends,

's adopted son, and one of the Elders of
Sea of Soul Formation
.

Appearance

The man’s figure was slender and beautiful, his facial features simple and elegant, and his purple robe gave people a sense of vitality.

Personality

Xuan Hua is carefree and mischievous, often teasing others to the point of irritation. He dislikes overthinking and prefers to go with the flow, which sometimes makes him appear foolish in serious situations. Because of this,
Liu Feiyan
 occasionally calls him an idiot, though Xuan Hua never takes it to heart. His ridiculous antics leave even those around him speechless, making it hard to believe that someone like him holds the title of Martial Sovereign.

Plot

Five Cloud Mountain

Xuan Hua arrived at Five Cloud Mountain alongside
Zhen Yu
, sent by the Sea of Soul Formation after receiving High Priest Ci’s secret message. Initially indifferent to the conflict, Xuan Hua was forced into battle when
Huang
, the Demon Emperor, attacked. Despite his strength, Xuan Hua was quickly overwhelmed, realizing Huang had reached the peak of perfection. Seeing no chance of victory, he and Zhen Yu chose to retreat, watching from a distance.

Power

The Star-Shattering Force—also known as The Golden Crow Avoids the Sun—unleashes a legendary weapon. A massive silver bow, inlaid with yellow accents, descends, enveloped in purple Qi. Countless tiny gemstones, like stars scattered across the night sky, adorn its surface. This divine weapon is the Broken Star Bow, paired with the Cloud-Splitting Arrow, wielded by the formidable Lord Xuan Hua.

Xuan Hua's Cloud Splitting Arrow was also derived from the Star Destruction technique. In this world, aside from Gu Feiyang's mastery of the Star Destroyer Sword Skill, I am the one who truly understands it best.

Trivia

He loved the bow as much as his life.

Xuan Hua and Yao Jinliang were constantly at odds, as Xuan Hua found Yao Jinliang to be an eyesore.
