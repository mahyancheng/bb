Five Cloud Mountain

Amid the war against the monster race, He appeared alongside
Si Tingyu
 and
Cangwu Qiong
, bringing reinforcements to support the human forces. He engaged in a duel against
Ai
, the greatest alchemist of the monster race.
During the intense battle between Ai and Amaterasu, their spiritual powers clashed, causing fluctuations in the earth's rhythm. Both were injured, with Amaterasu in worse condition. Recognizing Amaterasu's weakness due to age, Ai suggested ending the battle. Amaterasu, feeling guilty over her loss, agreed.

As they began to withdraw their spiritual powers, a black-robed figure silently approached. Without warning, the figure struck Ai, shattering his head and killing him instantly. The sudden betrayal shocked everyone, especially Amaterasu, who was devastated. The attacker revealed himself as Shentu Yixiao, head of the Shadow Department.
