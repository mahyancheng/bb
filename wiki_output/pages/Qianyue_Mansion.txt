Trivia

The key to the seal of Wuxia Mountain is the token of the head of Qianyue Mansion, passed down from generation to generation. It was used as a token at the beginning, implying that the heads of Qianyue Mansion in all generations must defend it to the death.

The key was originally given to our ancestors by the Holy Land for safekeeping.*}{r|1975}}
