Plot

when he struck Li Yunxiao, he awakened something far worse—Demon Lord Pu. Furious at being wounded, Demon Lord Pu shattered Kun Lang’s sword with a single glare. Dark runes surged, trapping Kun Lang in an instant. Before he could react, his body and soul were obliterated, erased without a trace.

Power

Kun Lang, a legendary master of the Soul Devouring Sect, wielded the Soul Flow Sword, a technique that turned his very soul into a lethal weapon. Unlike physical blades, this sword bypassed all defenses, striking directly at an opponent’s soul. Having spent centuries absorbing countless spirits, Kun Lang’s blade was nearly unstoppable—capable of instantly killing even ninth-tier Great Art masters.

When Li Yunxiao faced him, he quickly realized that physical attacks were useless against the intangible weapon. Kun Lang mocked his resistance, warning that his blade did not just cut—it erased existence itself. Even Huangfu Bi admitted that Battle Soul Mountain, a graveyard of heroes, was the perfect place for Li Yunxiao to perish.
