Background

Xuanli Island is a mysterious and powerful force in the Tianwu Realm, often shrouded in secrecy. Many of its strongest members were originally from the Holy Land, but due to the passage of time and potential conflicts, the idea of taking over the Holy Land was ultimately abandoned.

Despite its long absence from the world, Xuanli Island still holds significant influence and has maintained a stance of cooperation rather than domination over the Holy Land and other major forces. It seeks to unite various factions in preparation for the coming demonic calamity, rather than upsetting the balance of power in the realm.

The island is also interested in the Yellow Springs Hellfire and the underworld lands, with its members personally investigating these locations. Its relationship with the Tianwu League is one of alliance rather than opposition, as its main goal is to gather all available forces to combat future threats.

History

the Realm of Eternal Life. The island was originally created to prepare for the Demonic Tribulation, a catastrophe prophesied to occur 100,000 years later. However, not everyone believed in this prophecy many warriors sought entry into the Realm of Eternal Life simply to prolong their lifespan, rather than to fight against the impending crisis.

For 100,000 years, Xuanli Island has sought out powerful individuals who enter the Realm of Eternal Life, offering them incentives to join. However. The requirements to join were simple: swear allegiance to Xuanli Island and commit to fighting in the Demonic Tribulation, in exchange for access to its vast resources.
