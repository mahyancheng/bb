History

Another fragment of the devil essence, which turned into Di Ye. Originally sealed in the burial ground / boneyard near Blood God Palace. It was thought the sealing place contains the secrets to ascend to the Divine Realm, because of descendants of servants from the demon emperor who manipulated records in the Sea of Soul Formation. In reality it just sealed the Devils Fragment. Because of those records from the 7 original seals on that place 6 have already been removed.

Yunxiao obtained his Ancient Saber (a peak 9th grade weapon) from that place, as well as a dragons tear and water close to the origin of water to activate the last area in his Divine Realm Tablet. The last sealing part, a dragons shell, got almost completely destroyed in the fight between Zhuo Qingfan (2nd on the List of Titled Martial Sovereigns) and Di Ye. The latter escaped during that fight.
