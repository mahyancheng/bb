Plot

As chaos erupted following the death of the
Gluttonous Snake
, which caused a black hole, the Sect Master of the Corpse Fiend Sect,
Jing Qi
, arrived with his elite corpse puppets and the rest of the sect’s members. A fierce battle between the two factions immediately broke out.
Amidst the conflict, Mu Yurong, poisoned by the Five Great Extinction Poisons, knew his fate was sealed. Determined to take Jing Qi down with him, he attempted to self-destruct in a final act of defiance. However, Jing Qi easily countered his efforts, using his corpse-controlling techniques to suppress the explosion. Helpless, Mu Yurong’s body stiffened as his energy drained away, and he was gradually transformed into a lifeless corpse puppet.
