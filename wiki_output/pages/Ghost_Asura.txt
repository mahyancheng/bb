The Ghost Asura was a product of a failed refinement of true Spirit's blood. It has no soul at all and only has a physical body. It's almost undying and extremely powerful. the most ideal killing machine created by
Wei Qing
 along with
Qiu Mujie
, with the support of the
Holy Region
 and Long Family, using humans with strong dragon bloodlines as the foundation for his experiments.

Appearance

Some had the head of a bull and the body of a snake, with four horns. Some had two horns on their heads, but they were of different species. The other had four heads and eight arms, which was even more terrifying than a true fiend Dharma idol.

Background

The Ghost Asura, though not as monstrous as
Qiu Mujie
, was fueled by semi-finished dragon’s blood. Lacking emotions, senses, or fear, it was even harder to defeat. However, dragon blood couldn’t be refined alone—it required a dragon descendant’s body as a container.

The experiment had a high failure rate, with most subjects reduced to ashes. Only a select few with strong bloodlines were chosen, like the nine Ghost Asuras.
Ruo Xiang
 had also been a candidate but failed, while
Luo Qingyun
 alone succeeded. Otherwise, there might have been a tenth Ghost Asura.

The other failed experiments are called Shuras, categorized by strength into Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Iron. Among them, Ghost Shuras are the most valuable, having nearly reached the Tenth Order Divine Blood. Only Gold Shuras pose a real threat, while the others are essentially worthless.

Power

Ghost Asuras had 'ultimate bodies' like Qiu Mujie. In addition to the half-finished dragon blood, the concentration of their blood was even higher than that of Yun Xiang. Even if they encountered a peak nine-star expert, they would not be defeated.

Unlike Qiu Mujie, who used the Battleship Fish to convert vital stones into endless energy, the Ghost Asuras couldn’t achieve perpetual regeneration. However, they compensated with the Vital Eating Pill, allowing them to rapidly recover strength—a groundbreaking and unnatural innovation. Each Ghost Asura also wore a spatial ring, likely filled with primordial cores to sustain their power.

Trivia

To control ghost Asuras with semi-finished bloodlines, you must have Luo Qingyun or others people, who has the real dragon blood.

According to
Zi Xiao Ji
, Lord
Wei Qing
 research on these ghost Asuras costs one-third of the sacred zone's annual budget.

It need quite a few of the ingredients to creat Ghost Asura, is the bodies of ancient beasts or even true spirits. To refine dragon blood, one must possess the bloodline of a Dragon.

Although they didn't have much intelligence, they still had the emotion of anger and killing.
