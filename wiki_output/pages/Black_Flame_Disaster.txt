Plot

True Spirit Fire Phoenix

The True Spirited Fire Phoenix and the Blackfire Fiend clashed in a battle that shook the heavens. The phoenix’s graceful agility and True Flames met the fiend’s corrosive black gas and raw destruction, tearing the sky apart and creating endless void rifts. For seven days and nights, their struggle raged, until both were left gravely wounded.

In the end, the Blackfire Fiend could fight no longer, retreating into the Tiandang Mountains, allowing Primordial Qi to flow back. But victory came at a cost—the phoenix, fatally wounded, flew away, its life force fading.
