Plot

During the battle, Huang Xiaolong was present when
Luo Qingyun
 used a powerful mental attack through the mesmerizing sound of the Spirit Heaven Ring to affect
Li Yunxiao
. He observed Li Yunxiao's struggle in countering the mental attack due to his lower cultivation level and witnessed the intense clash between the two fighters.

When Li Yunxiao activated the
World God Monument
 and unleashed a vast sea of flames to combat Luo Qingyun's dragon bloodline abilities, Huang Xiaolong and the other enforcers had to intervene and set up a barrier to prevent the battle from causing further destruction to the island.

Huang Xiaolong was also part of the decision-making process regarding the outcome and termination of the crystal stone competition. He, along with the other enforcers, decided to activate the teleportation array and send all the disciples back after the competition ended.

He was also present when Li Yunxiao announced his plan to auction entry quotas to the Veiled Desolation in Flame Martial City. Although this decision astonished some participants.
