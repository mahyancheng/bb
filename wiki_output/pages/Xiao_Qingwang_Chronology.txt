Reunion

When he reunites with Chen Dasheng and Li Chunyang, he is shocked to see them alive and even more astonished by Li Chunyang’s advancement to Martial King. After learning about Chen Dasheng’s suffering, he regrets not being able to help earlier. When Yunxiao offers a cure for his cold poison, Xiao Qingwang is deeply grateful and agrees to fulfill three requests in return, as long as they do not put him in an overly difficult position.

124 Generals(the first requests)

When the Central Army, led by
Prince
Qin Yang
, refused to mobilize against the invading
Baizhan Army
, they expected to act without consequence. But Xiao Qingwang did not tolerate defiance. In a display of absolute authority, he summoned the
five elite units of the State Guardians
 and
ordered the capture of all 124 generals
. No negotiation. No mercy. His judgment was swift—
they had disobeyed the imperial edict and would be executed
.
