History

Back then, He along with
Ren Ximin,
 sought to break through the limitations of martial arts by practicing demonic techniques. Both of them believed that since the Tianwu Realm lacked complete rules, the Demon Realm, which had intact laws, could provide a way to surpass martial limits.

To achieve this, they used the Tiandang Mountains, a bridge between the two realms, as their experimental ground. However, demonic cultivation was highly dangerous, so they needed test subjects "guinea pigs" to refine their methods. One of their unfortunate victims was
Hua Qianshu
, whom they manipulated.

Hua Qianshu’s involvement eventually drew in his master,
Gu Feiyang
, unknowingly dragging him into their scheme. This not only led to the failure of their plan but also resulted in the downfall of one of the top Titled Martial Sovereigns, Gu Feiyang.

Plot

When visiting the Holy Region Yunxiao tries to take his life. Cangwu Qiong unwilling to get killed used the Universe Light Plate to commit suicide and also self-destructs the 10th grade Xuan Artifact to drag Yunxiao down with him, but ultimately couldn't even scratch him.
