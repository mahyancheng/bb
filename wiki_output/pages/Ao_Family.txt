General Information

One of the most powerful hidden families, known for their high proficiency in physical body cultivation.

Background

The
Ao Family
 is one of the
hidden reclusive families
 that have remained outside of mainstream power struggles for centuries. While they are not as openly influential as the
Seven Great Forces or the Sanctuary
, they possess
immense strength
, particularly in
physical combat and body-refining techniques
.

The
Ao clan specialized in powerful physical techniques
, making them ideal candidates for inheriting the
Tyrant Body Tempering Technique
.
Wan Yiqian
 sought them out, and they sent
Ao Changkong
—a young but incredibly talented warrior—to test his compatibility with the inheritance.
