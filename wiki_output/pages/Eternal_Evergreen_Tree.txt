 to create a celestial barrier. Despite Shang's efforts, Little Qing breaks free and launches a devastating attack, creating a chaotic scene of lightning, explosions, and energy clashes.

During the battle,
Ge
 sacrifices his life to block Little Qing's attack, stabilizing the situation momentarily. Little Qing counters with a powerful thunder attack, and the two sides exchange blows. Ge's sacrifice leaves an emotional impact on his old friends.
Li Yunxiao
 rushes to save Little Qing, and the appearance of the Tianyi Chamber of Commerce adds a new layer of complexity to the unfolding events.

As the battle between Shang and Li Yunxiao unfolds, the confrontation leads to a collision between the
Universe God Monument
 and the Supreme Palace Armillary Sphere, cracking the axis of the Armillary sphere and injuring both fighters.

Shang is ultimately defeated and heavily injured by Li Yunxiao's overwhelming palm technique. And Little Qing disappears from the scene, leaving a cryptic message for Shang.

 and Little Qing strategize to counter
Hao Lian
's pursuers. They manipulate the Four Seasons Enchantment to alter the landscape. While the Water Rat King is cornered by
Che Xuyao
 and
Feng Yi
, and Little Qing warns the Rat Emperor against breaking the enchantment.

After a fierce exchange, Li Yunxiao discloses his desire to reach the Ancient Desolate Land, and Little Qing agrees to potentially help him, acknowledging their debt from Li Yunxiao's previous assistance. As Little Qing departs, Li Yunxiao questions him about the location of Noah's Ark, but he offers no further information.

Later,
Yu Yangzhou
's escape astounds Little Qing, who realizes Yangzhou triggered the Virtual Eye and Rain Summoning while heavily injured and managed to escape. Little Qing decides to find Yangzhou and eliminate him, as he suspects Yangzhou might be just hiding.

However, in another place,
Li
's attempt to break the formation triggers catastrophic consequences, Little Qing, who has been observing, warns that disaster is looming. The formation's instability leads to the sudden rise of an enormous ice mountain that engulfs Li, while the surrounding area experiences chaotic shifts between the four seasons.

The mountain's peak undergoes rapid transformations, with spring, summer, autumn, and winter all manifesting at different levels. The mountain's appearance reflects the four seasons, with spring at the midpoint, peach blossoms, withered trees, and snow at the base. Meanwhile, an immense boundary of the four seasons emerges in the distance, revealing the Immortal Mountain of lord
Throne

Four Seasons Immortal Mountain

Inside the Immortal Mountain, Little Qing and the Rat Emperor discuss the dire situation. Little Qing explains that the revelation of the true formation's core will activate the Immortal Mountain's power, causing the four seasons to rotate and crush all life within the formation, including themselves. To buy time for Young Emperor Hao Lian's breakthrough, Little Qing plans to stall and strengthen himself. He hopes that once he becomes more powerful, he can break open a sealed space below his main body and retrieve Noah's Ark.
