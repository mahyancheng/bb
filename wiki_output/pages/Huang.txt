Plot

Five Cloud Mountain

Huang and Ai arrived at Five Cloud Mountain to fulfill the last wish of the past demon emperors, aiming to release their people who had been imprisoned for thousands of years. However, upon their arrival, they were confronted by
Li
 and High Priest
Ci
, who advised against breaking the seal. They warned that releasing the monsters before the monster race was united would lead to greater chaos.

Disagreeing with them, Huang attempted to eliminate Li and Ci, but as the conflict escalated, Li and Ci chose to retreat and avoid further confrontation.

After Xuan Hua arrived and was repelled by Huang, the Holy Region forces, led by Wei Qing and Hei Yuhu, came to the Five Cloud Mountain. Determined to eliminate the monster race once and for all, Wei Qing unleashed the Ruling Blade for the first time, engaging in a fierce clash with the Monster Emperor, Huang.

The impact of their battle was devastating, reducing the Thousand Mountains Prefecture to ruins. Huang suffered severe injuries, but Wei Qing pressed on, launching another attack. As Huang tried to defend himself, he transformed into his true form, exchanging another fierce blow. However, the Ruling Blade struck deep, its evil energy corroding Huang's body. Large portions of his flesh began to rot, forcing him back into his human form.

Though victorious, Wei Qing had reached his limit. The immense strain of wielding the Ruling Blade caused all his acupoints to explode, releasing clouds of blood mist from his body.

After this brutal exchange, both forces went all out, igniting a full-scale war.

In the all-out war between the monster and human races, the tide suddenly turned in favor of the humans with the arrival of reinforcements. Faced with this shift, Shang and Mo suggested a strategic withdrawal. However, Huang perceived this as betrayal. To assert his dominance and prove his power, he shockingly destroyed his own host beast, the Nandou Purple Deer, severing their bond to demonstrate his ruthless resolve.

Huang then revealed his breakthrough to the Void Extreme Divine Realm, solidifying his authority. He executed Ci, the high priest, without hesitation and gravely injured Shang, intending to imprison him and extract the secrets of the armillary sphere. Mo, witnessing Huang's merciless actions, was forced into submission.

With a new, powerful contract demonic beast integrated into his strength, Huang led the monster race in a final, desperate assault against the humans.

Power

Huang possesses an innate ability unique to his Heavenly Monster tribe, allowing him to share strength and magical powers with his host beast and even integrate with it. After reaching the Void Realm, he severed the bond with his original host and formed a new contract with Wu. This granted him the ability to unleash a black hole that devours not only his opponents' power but almost everything in its path.

Trivia

He can only maintain Void Prime state for a few minutes.
