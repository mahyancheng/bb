Four Extremes Sect

Personality

Luo Ying had always been a man of his word.

Plot

When Tang Jie attempted to capture Yunxiao and even threatened his own brother, Tang Xin, Luo Ying decisively intervened, stopping the conflict and asserting his authority. He made it clear that internal strife within the sect would not be tolerated, forcing Tang Jie and his faction to retreat.

Recognizing Tang Jie's growing arrogance and the resources backing him, Luo Ying resolved to return to the sect and confront the Sect Master about his stance.
