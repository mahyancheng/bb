The
Mu Family
, one of the
Hidden Families
, resides on Tongtian Island, a massive and meticulously crafted man-made island located deep in the ocean. To reach it, one must pass through an endless fog infused with pink crystal dust, a natural spatial barrier that conceals the island from outsiders. Only those familiar with its intricacies, like Mu Zheng, can navigate through it successfully.

Once past the fog, Tongtian Island reveals itself as a thousand-acre expanse of breathtaking landscapes, shrouded in mist formed by abundant spiritual energy, giving it an ethereal, fairy-tale-like appearance. The island is a testament to generations of the Mu Family’s craftsmanship, with mountains, rivers, and lakes arranged in perfect harmony.{{r|1713}}

Unlike the Corpse Fiend Sect's Unmoving Return to the Forest, which was built atop the corpse of a giant turtle, Tongtian Island is a fully man-made marvel, constructed bit by bit by the Mu ancestors over centuries. While the eerie magic of the giant turtle makes the Corpse Fiend Sect’s base unique, Tongtian Island exudes grandeur, craftsmanship, and immense spiritual refinement.

The Mu Family takes immense pride in their puppetry and combat prowess, standing on par with the seven superpowers. Their defenses are nearly impenetrable, with the fog barrier serving as the first line of protection. Additionally, the island’s internal formations and spatial defenses are considered unparalleled, making it unnecessary to station guards outside.{{r|1714}}
