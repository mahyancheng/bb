The Wheel of Reincarnation is a super-grade formation weapon, created to imitate the laws of Samsara (Reincarnation). Unlike ordinary mysterious weapons, which typically possess only one spirit, and even super-quality ones that may have two or three, this artifact contains thirty-three spirits known as the "Gong Cao". Each of these spirits was once a powerful god, their souls refined into the weapon to sustain its immense power.

However, true reincarnation is an elusive and unpredictable force, beyond the reach of even the most advanced formations or mysterious weapons. The creator of this artifact, despite their mastery, was unable to directly harness the power of reincarnation. As a result, they devised a formation where thirty-three powerful individuals acted as the core, channeling the laws of Samsara into the weapon.

Once activated, Wheel's greatest abilities is the power to create its own domain a projection of the true place of reincarnation, trapping numerous enemies inside and preventing them to escape and The power of reincarnation seeps into every being, suppressing not only living beings but even others Xuan weapons/Artifact. Those caught in its domain will find their strength rapidly drained, their very existence eroded by Samsara's power. A terrifying aspect of this artifact is its immortality effect. The Gongcao spirits, even after being slain, will revive as long as the Wheel of Reincarnation remains intact. This makes it an almost unstoppable force, as those who fall to its power will continuously resurrect, bound by the eternal cycle of reincarnation.
