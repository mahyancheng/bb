Li Chunyang, the former
Li Family
 patriarch and the number one veteran of the military, was a revered warrior of
Tianshui Kingdom
. Though believed dead, he had gone into hiding, secretly observing the power struggle between
Prince
Qin Yang
 and
Prince
Qin Yue
 while planning the best path for his family's future.

Background

Despite his age, Li Chunyang remained a formidable Warrior. He had
broken through the realm of Five Elements
 and ascended to the rank of
Martial King
. His strength alone made him a deciding factor in the political landscape of Tianshui. However, rather than blindly involving himself in the conflict, he chose to
stay hidden
, waiting for the most beneficial path for the
Li Family's survival and prosperity
.

His grandson,
Yunxiao
, was the one who pulled him out of hiding, demonstrating a level of intelligence, foresight, and dominance that even Li Chunyang did not expect. Realizing Yunxiao's potential and his alliance with
Prince
Qin Yue
, Li Chunyang made a decisive choice: he would throw the full weight of the
Li Family
 behind Yunxiao and Qin Yue, ensuring their rise to power. Though he had once been a loyal subject of
King
Qin Zheng
, he understood that times were changing, and if Qin Yue was destined to ascend the throne, then the
Li Family would rise alongside him
.
