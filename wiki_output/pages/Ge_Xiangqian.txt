Plot

Duskflame's Alchemist Association

Ge Xiangqian is one of the three Rank-Four Alchemist masters present during the confrontation with
Li Yunxiao
. When Li Yunxiao proposes a duel against all three of them simultaneously, Ge Xiangqian becomes offended by his arrogance and challenges him. However, Li Yunxiao calmly explains that the outcome of the duel depends on the stakes involved, and if they are too low, he won't be interested.

Xin Ze presents a seventh-tier quality
Cosmic Sun Note Jade
, which greatly enhances an alchemist master's refining abilities. The other two alchemist masters,
Lu Haochu
 and
Ge Xiangqian
, offer a
Heavenly Flame Battle Flag
 and a pair of
Purple Cloud Centipede Wings
, respectively, as their gambling stakes.

To everyone's astonishment, Li Yunxiao claims that someone will bring the 100 million mid-grade primal stones for the gambling bet soon. Xin Ze, initially skeptical, is proven wrong when his brother,
Xin Pi
, arrives and hands over the 100 million mid-grade primal stones as promised.

Despite the disbelief and shock from the other alchemist masters, their confidence in winning the bet is gradually shaken as he observes Li Yunxiao's demeanor, which shows deep certainty of victory against the three of them.

The Alchemy Competition

As the competition begins, Li Yunxiao surprises everyone by suggesting that each of the three alchemist masters will condense one primal stone, while he alone will condense two primal stones simultaneously. This shocks the three alchemist masters, as it increases the difficulty of the competition significantly.

Despite their anger and disbelief, they continue with the competition. Li Yunxiao impresses them with his mastery of the Twelve Forms of Flying Flower and Falling Snow, a set of refining techniques created by the renowned alchemist, Gu Feiyang. Li Yunxiao's use of these advanced techniques and his overall proficiency in alchemy leave the three alchemist masters in awe and shock.

Finally, Ge Xiangqian can no longer hold back and attacks first, using the same method as Li Yunxiao to condense his primal stone. The competition is now underway, and everyone is eager to see who will come out victorious.

Ge Xiangqian managed to raise the primal stone to a Mid-grade level but exhausted a lot of energy in the process, leaving him visibly fatigued. Next, Lu Haochu took over, using his Yamata Branch Heart Cultivation Mantra to condense the primal stone. His technique was beautiful and dreamy, but he also struggled to match Li Yunxiao's level of refinement.

Li Yunxiao, on the other hand, effortlessly advanced his primal stone to the middle grade, showcasing his superior understanding and control of the Twelve Forms of Flying Flower and Falling Snow. He surprised everyone by using a new and mysterious technique called the Scripture of Rippling Mirage. The technique impressed even Baili Gongjin, a rank six alchemist, who recognized its profoundness and admitted his admiration for Li Yunxiao's mastery.

After Baili Gongjin shared the story of his encounter with Lord Gu Feiyang and his advice, Lu Haochu attempted to condense a primal stone using his powerful soul force. However, his technique lacked finesse and appeared clumsy compared to Li Yunxiao's mastery. He raised the primal stone to a High-grade level but felt fatigued after the effort. In response, Li Yunxiao managed to advance the primal stone to a high-grade level, impressing everyone with his skills and talent.

Now, Xin Ze is attempting to advance the primal stone to the supreme-grade level, while Li Yunxiao is doing the same. Despite Li Yunxiao's exhausted state, he surprises everyone by suddenly revitalizing and displaying incredible control over his soul power and the primordial stone, keeping up with Xin Ze's progress. The two are in a fierce competition to see who can reach the supreme-grade level first.

But, later, Li Yunxiao even succeeded in forming a Innate Primordial Elixir, a divine object, which amazed all the alchemists present. Even the Supreme-grade primal stone he used to create it transformed into the Inner Core, which symbolized the Innate Primordial Elixir. Witnessing Li Yunxiao's extraordinary skill and calm demeanor, the other alchemists, including Xin Ze, Ge Xiangqian, and Lv Haochu, were deeply impressed. In a show of respect and admiration, the three fourth-grade Alchemists knelt down and expressed their admiration for Li Yunxiao's prowess.
