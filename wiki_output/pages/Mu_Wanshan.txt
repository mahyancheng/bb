Plot

Mu Wanshan attacked Yunxiao out of rage and misunderstanding. The Mu family had arranged her marriage to him without her consent, leaving her feeling helpless and betrayed. Even her trusted grandfather had agreed, and none of the young disciples who once admired her opposed the decision, making her feel utterly abandoned. Blaming Yunxiao, she tried to kill him, but her attacks were effortlessly deflected. His calm demeanor only frustrated her more. After being easily overpowered, she fell into despair and attempted to take her own life, only to be stopped by Yunxiao, who urged her to seek the true cause of her troubles instead of acting recklessly.
