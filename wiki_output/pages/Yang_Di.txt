History

He lived in the
Southern Region
, in the
Tianshui Kingdom
, his homeland, after his Master Gu Feiyang. He created a statue identical to
Gu Feiyang
 appearance which was placed in the Capital Academy.

After the Princess illness incident, he refused to set foot in Tianshui Kingdom again and lived in the
Duskflame Empire
 taking care of his disciple, until he reached the Seventh Grade of Alchemy and was allowed to enter the
Sea of Soul Formation
, where he was welcomed by
Lu Congzi
. According to his own words.

After the events in the Eternal World,
Ye Nantian
,
Li Yunxiao
,
Zhuo Qingfan
 and others go to the Soul Formation Sea to exterminate the Demonic Cultivators, where Lu Congzi reveals that he has made Yang Di his demonic slave. This news left Li Yunxiao helpless, as killing a demon slave's Master would result in the demon slave's death, therefore, there was almost no hope of saving his disciple.

Trivia

The Year 1001 is the year that Yang Di was promoted to third-tier alchemist and became the president of the Tianshui branch.
