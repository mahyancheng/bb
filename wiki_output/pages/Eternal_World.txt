The
Eternal World
 was created
100,000 years ago
 by ancient experts as a sanctuary after the
disappearance of the Ten Rules of Heaven
, the fundamental laws of martial power. Seeking immortality in an era without
Rank 10 Laws
, these experts sealed themselves away, living in seclusion. Entrance to the Eternal World is blocked by
four powerful seals
, maintained by the
Four Pavilions
 in the
Langya Heaven Mystic Realm
. Only when these seals are broken can outsiders enter.The most powerful force within the Eternal World is
Xuanli Island
,

Background

The
Eternal World
 is a sealed, isolated realm located within the
nest of the ancient Heavenly Phoenix
. It was created through the power of the Phoenix’s most
precious feather
, which contains a vast amount of divine energy. This energy grants those inside a state of
immortality
, allowing them to sustain themselves indefinitely with powerful divine abilities.

However, this immortality comes at a cost the Eternal World has been
cut off from the outside world
 for countless years. Over time, the
power of the Heavenly Phoenix
 that sustains it has begun to
weaken
, making it increasingly difficult to maintain eternal life. Those within the realm are forced to enter a
deep sleep
 to preserve themselves, leading to an eerie, death-like atmosphere where communication is rare.

Despite its divine origins, the Eternal World is a
prison as much as a sanctuary
 those inside cannot easily leave, and if they do, their bodies will rapidly
wither and perish
 due to their reliance on the Phoenix’s power. Only using devine technique  like
Gu Qingqing
, being one such inhabitant, has only been able to exist outside by using a
fragment of her divine soul
, while her true form remains dormant inside.

Structure & Creation

The Eternal World is a
vast continent
 bathed in a dim, fiery-red glow, with no sunlight and barren landscapes of rolling mountains and endless rock formations. It was
created using the three True Tail Feathers of the Celestial Phoenix
, making it a place of immense spiritual energy. Over time,
Phoenix Fire Phosphorus Stones
 formed, absorbing the spiritual Qi from the
Phoenix Nest
 and the
Realm of Heavenly Martial Arts
.

To
preserve the Eternal World
, a massive energy-locking structure was designed:

A
Heaven-Protecting River
, stretching for tens of kilometers, prevents spiritual energy from dissipating. The only energy in the eternal world is this Phoenix Fire phosphorus stone. It’s also the source of the power of this heaven-protecting River that is tens of kilometers long. Everyone will find an abundant Phoenix Fire scaly stone mine to cultivate in seclusion.In this heaven protecting River formed by the celestial Phoenix’s true power, one’s divine sense couldn’t be spread out at all

Four Great Pavilions
 act as seals and energy channels, absorbing external spiritual energy and injecting it into the sky. These are:

Jade Book Pavilion

Heavy Equipment Tower

Heavenly Treasure Pavilion

Emperor Pill Tower

These pavilions serve a dual purpose sealing the
true body of the Eternal World
 and ensuring that spiritual energy within the realm remains abundant.

Trivia

The terrain in the eternal world is hard to identify and changes frequently. Even  needle with fixed coordinates has to be used multiple times to avoid going in the wrong direction due to changes in the terrain.

In the eternal world, no one knew how many old monsters there were, but everyone had their own territory. In order to avoid being disturbed, they would leave this mark the seal of the forbidden area  on their territory to tell others that this place was theirs and that they were not to trespass. The consequences of trespassing into someone else’s forbidden area are very serious.
