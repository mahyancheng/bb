Huyan Ming was the only alchemist among the
Supreme Six
. As a fourth-tier Alchemy Lord, he enjoyed a great reputation even in the Firecrow Empire, and his status was not lower than that of
Qi Zhenzi
, which made him an important figure who suffered no rebuke of others.

Plot

Mount Phoenix

Huyan Ming,  with others member the Supreme Six, sought the Ancient True Spirit Phoenix’s inheritance alongside his companions. Though highly skilled in breaking ancient seals, he grew frustrated with Qi Zhenzi’s impatience.

After Sun Xiumei reported the deaths of two members, Li Yunxiao, who had been secretly pursuing her, was discovered and had no choice but to reveal himself. Sun Xiumei immediately pointed to him as the culprit, shocking the group. Huyan Ming, in particular, was astonished by Yunxiao’s talent as a second-tier alchemist. However, before anyone could act, the seal suddenly broke, pulling them all into the remnant of a fire phoenix’s consciousnesse realm.

Confident in his superior soul power, Huyan Ming sought to claim two shares of the Phoenix True Fire, unaware of Li Yunxiao’s true strength. A battle erupted, but within the consciousness realm, where soul power reigns supreme, Yunxiao unleashed his ultimate skill, overpowering their combined attack. As the realm collapsed, one was killed, while the remaining four were gravely injured and forced to retreat, leaving Yunxiao victorious.

Supreme Palace

Unaware that the
Supreme Palace
 had been annihilated by
Xingyang Huo
 after, including their lord
Ma Tianhe
, he along with
Yi Xiaoshan
 and
Qi Zhenzi
 returned, only to find the palace empty and desolate. To their surprise, Li Yunxiao had arrived before them, carrying out his task of absorbing all the Qi veins to fill the
World God Monument
.

Yunxiao then challenged Qi Zhenzi, declaring that if he lost, they must submit to him. With
Duan Yue
 overseeing the battle and preventing any escape, Yunxiao and Qi Zhenzi exchanged several moves. In the end, Yunxiao crushed Qi Zhenzi to death using the World God Monument. Shocked that Yunxiao could kill Qi Zhenzi so easily, He and
Yi Xiaoshan
 had no choice but to pledge their loyalty to him. They were then placed inside the World God Monument, for him Yunxiao put him in the square inch mountain, to refined pills.
