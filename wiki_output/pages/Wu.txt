Wu
 is one of the true spirits of heaven and earth, but whether it's at the Ten Directions Divine Realm or not is unknown.

General Information

Among the many ancient true spirits, this one is the most mysterious. No one has ever witnessed it taking action, and it seems to lack sentience, or its intelligence is nearly nonexistent. Every time it appears, it merely hovers in space before slowly vanishing. Its disappearance isn't a retreat into the void, but rather it devours itself.

Once, a powerful expert attempted to tame a 'Wu' as his own beast companion, trying various methods. Eventually, 'Wu' sustained an injury and began to devour itself slowly. After a long period, when 'Wu' reappeared, it was injured!

Some later scholars specifically researched 'Wu.' After all, ancient true spirits had completely disappeared. To unveil the secrets of the Ten Directions Divine Realm, 'Wu' became the ultimate subject of study. What astonished everyone was that 'Wu' possesses an exceptionally unique spatial aspect within its body, distinctly different from our common understanding of the void. After 'Wu' devours itself, its entire body enters that space. Nobody knows how many long years will pass before it re-emerges.

However, over these many years, few have witnessed 'Wu' appearing, and even if they did, they wouldn't recognize it. It doesn't harm anyone.
