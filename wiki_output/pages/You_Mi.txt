Background

You Mi was once a highly talented disciple of Wanxing Valley, personally brought in by Tian Xingzi due to his exceptional potential. Raised as the adopted son of the sect leader, he was given a prestigious position within the sect. However, his recruitment was never about sentiment—it was purely because of his talent. Deep inside, You Mi harbored resentment, believing that his value to the sect was conditional.

To solidify their influence, Wanxing Valley sent You Mi as an undercover agent into the Soul Devouring Sect, one of their greatest enemies. Over the years, his position rose, eventually becoming Deputy Sect Leader.

However, during his time there, his loyalty wavered. Realizing that the Soul Devouring Sect valued him more than his "adoptive family," he chose to betray Wanxing Valley, siding with Xi Yulun and the Soul Devouring Sect in a devastating betrayal.

Plot

His treachery was revealed when he used Li Yunxiao’s previous attack to weaken the puppet general, allowing him to insert a soul-devouring banner into its body, triggering its destruction. Su Ping, shocked and enraged, confronted You Mi, but the traitor only laughed, declaring that he was never truly one of them. His motivations were clear: power, recognition, and revenge against those who saw him as nothing more than a tool.
