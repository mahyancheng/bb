Zhang Qingfan, was the Chief Alchemist of the Tianshui Kingdom, entrusted by the King of Tianshui to care for and monitor Qin Ruxue’s worsening condition.

Plot

As the princess's
Qin Ruxue
 condition worsened, he heard from
Jia Rong
 that Li Yunxiao might be able to cure her illness. At first, he was skeptical—how could a young boy possibly know a method that even he, a Three-Tier Alchemist, did not?

However, after learning that Li Yunxiao might be Yang Di’s disciple, his doubt turned into urgency. With Li Yunxiao missing, he mobilized all the power the Alchemist Association could muster to track down his whereabouts.
