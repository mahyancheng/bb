The Northern Heaven Cold Star Sword is a Xuan Artifact refined from Northern Heaven Cold Star Iron. They are strong 9th Tier Xuan Artifacts. Originally fighting with only one sword, Yunxiao later refines more with the help of
Yuan Gaohan
. He uses the swords to form Arrays, which he learned from the
Heavenly Night Palace
.

Upon using 18 Swords Yunxiao starts using a
Sword Case
, a Xuan Artifact also refined by Yuan Gaohan, to better control the sword array and also minimize the energy consumption.
