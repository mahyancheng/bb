Ai
==

The greatest Alchemist of the Monster Race a peerless genius that only appears once every tens of thousands of years and probably the strongest Alchemist in the Heavenly Martial Realm.

History

He challenged the human race to Alchemy competitions and made them suffer a crushing defeat until Gu Feiyang showed up and managed to beat him using tricks.

He first appeared in the Western Region's Ancient Land in the battle at Five Cloud Mountain, where he supported the Monster Race in opening the seal of Five Cloud Mountain to free their sealed Clansmen. In the battle, he fought on par with the
Holy Region's
 High Elder
Tian Zhao Zi
, a human race Peak 9th Tier Alchemist. Ultimately winning due to his younger age, which resulted in him having more stamina in a battle of souls.

Plot

Five Cloud Mountains

During his journey to the Five Cloud Mountains with Huang, the current Monster Emperor, Ai tries several times to undo the seal of the Five Cloud Mountains under
Huang
 orders, which becomes possible with a formula passed down by the Master of the Fuyao Sacred Sect. She remains neutral, trying to appease the hostility between
Huang
,
Mo
 and
Shang
 Faction throughout the war, and engages in a fight with Tian Zhao Zi, leaving him alive out of respect for the senior of the Dao of Alchemy, and becoming desperate after the death and destruction of so many Monsters during the battle.

Martial Flame City

After the battle against Supreme Gui Xu in the Monster territory (Illusory Realm of Stars and Moon), the entire territory is destroyed and the surviving Monsters take refuge in
Yanwu City
. Concerned about the possibility of Mo becoming the Monster Emperor after Huang death and Shang disappearance, in addition to the current state of the Monster Race, Ai proposes an Alchemy match with
Li Yunxiao
 in exchange for some terms that benefit whichever side wins. With this, Ai demonstrates his Supreme perfection in Alchemy by creating a non-Maha Character that condenses the Laws of the World after understanding and consolidating the structure of all things, equal to creation from Noah Ark, but in order to create a Character that contains the Laws of the World that is not an Ancient Maha Character, obviously, this Character was not on the same level as the Ancient Maha Character, but it was similar. After the fight she assumes defeat, as Li Yunxiao not only saved her creation after creating a
Heavenly Supreme Artifact
 (Sword that Will Rise and Fall), focusing the forces of the World on destroying the Sword, as he also broke the Chains of Law, something that simply shocked the minds of everyone present, with this he grants his creation to Li Yunxiao for the purpose of establishing a good relationship.

Ancestral Elder
===============

The Ancestral Elder of the Mo family in Black Iron City is the family's spiritual pillar, holding a status even higher than the sect masters of the seven superpowers. His strength is so profound that not even the experts of the Sanctuary or the leaders of the seven superpowers dare to claim they can defeat him.

Appearance

A Sage-like figure, He held a piece of Jade in his hand, and every step he took contained the laws of heaven and earth. It was as if he was the embodiment of the laws of heaven and earth, and his every move was a martial Dao.

Background

For many years, even the six Grand Supreme Elders have not seen his true body, only knowing that he cultivates in Black Iron City without knowing his exact location. To most of the Mo family's younger generation, the Ancestral Elder is a distant legend—many have never even seen his clone, let alone his real form. His rare appearance causes great excitement and awe among the Mo family disciples.

Plot

In the past, the Ancestral Elder had a brief confrontation with
Gu Feiyang
 when he arrived in Black Iron City to fulfill the promise
Mo Douchen
 had made. However, since Mo Douchen had already passed away, the Ancestral Elder offered to fight in his place. They exchanged a few moves, and even the Ancestral Elder had to admit that Gu Feiyang was more talented than Mo Douchen, the most gifted member of the Mo family. He also acknowledged that in a few years, he would no longer be a match for Gu Feiyang.

Later, the Ancestral Elder supported Mo Xiaochuan’s decision to become Gu Feiyang’s disciple and even requested a favor from Gu Feiyang regarding Mo Xiaochuan’s deceased father.

He is a renowned Six-Tier Emperor Alchemist and the president of the
Duskflame Empire
's Alchemist Association. As a High Tier Alchemist, he is a god-like existence in Shangyang City, and no one dare to make a conflict with him, not even the Four Great Families and the Xin Imperial Family could.

Plot

The Zhou Great Family Crisis

During the confrontation between Yunxiao and the Zhou family, an old man named Baili Gongjin, who was a renowned Six-Tier Emperor Alchemist and the president of the
Duskflame Empire
's Alchemist Association, appeared. Baili Gongjin expressed shock and complex emotions upon seeing Yunxiao and confirmed that the pill given by the Zhou family was indeed poisonous. This revelation caused panic among the onlookers and raised suspicions about the Zhou family's intentions.

Zhou Yangbiao
, the leader of the Zhou family, requested Baili Gongjin to verify the pill and prove its innocence. However, Baili Gongjin confirmed that the pill was indeed toxic. The situation intensified when one of the Zhou family elders, Zhou Bo, voluntarily tested the pill and tragically died from its effects. This shocked everyone present, as Zhou Bo was a Peak Nine-Star Martial Grandmaster and considered invulnerable to most poisons.

Amid the chaos, Baili Gongjin's suspicion shifted toward Yunxiao, who was accused of poisoning Zhou Bo. However,
Xin Pi
, a member of the Xin Imperial Family, expressed doubts about Yunxiao's involvement and suggested that Baili Gongjin might be the one responsible. The true nature of the poison and the culprit remained unclear, leading to a tense and uncertain atmosphere.

Yunxiao expressed gratitude towards Baili Gongjin,
Wang Chen
,
Cheng Feng
,
Mo Zhai
 for their care and support. This surprised and shocked the onlookers, including Wang Chen, Cheng Feng, Mo Zhai, and
Zhou Changfa
.

Zhou Changfa demanded an explanation from Baili Gongjin regarding the pill used in the conflict. However, Baili Gongjin defended himself against the accusation and denied any involvement in tampering with the pill. Mo Zhai from the Mo family supported Baili Gongjin, claiming that Yunxiao was attempting to sow discord among them. Later, the angry Baili Gongjin cut all the connections between the Duskflame Alchemist Association and the Zhou Great Family, leaving them without high-quality resources.

The Golden Crow Arena

Baili Gongjin, was observing the competition in the Golden Crow Arena through a water screen projection in a luxurious room at the Alchemist Association. When Li Yunxiao used the Mortal World Seal during the duel. Baili Gongjin recognized the seal as one of the three styles imparted by Gu Feiyang to Yang Di, the Floating Life Seal, Mortal World Seal, and Heaven and Earth Seal. He was shocked and speculated that Li Yunxiao might be the successor of one of Gu Feiyang's disciples.

Baili Gongjin was amazed by the power displayed by Li Yunxiao's seal, and expressed regret that he hadn't stopped the duel if he knew Li Yunxiao possessed the Mortal World Seal. He also discussed this revelation with other experts, including
Yuan Hao
, and they were all stunned by Li Yunxiao's extraordinary abilities and the possible connection to Gu Feiyang's legacy. This revelation put the Zhou family in a difficult situation, as they now faced potential repercussions if Li Yunxiao was indeed connected to Gu Feiyang's lineage.

Bailun Jieyi
============

Appearance

The old man had a head full of silver hair and was wearing a navy blue shirt with a crescent-colored ribbon tied around his waist. His eyes were clear and he looked leisurely and contented.

Background

Bai Lun is a mysterious and little-known figure in the Tianwu Realm, yet his lineage has played a crucial role in shaping major events for hundreds of thousands of years. Unlike prominent sect leaders or martial emperors, Bai Lun operates from the shadows, his influence extending far beyond what most people realize.

His calculations and foresight have guided the course of history, and even the Duanmu family, known for their powerful divination abilities, inherited part of his legacy. In fact, the
Duanmu Family
 divination arts are said to be merely a fragment of Bai Lun’s profound knowledge.

Even more astonishing, the
Eternal World
, one of the most mysterious and sought after places in the Tianwu Realm, was refined by another master at Bai Lun’s suggestion.

Plot

Heaven of Langya

After Yunxiao was severely injured in his battle against the two mighty experts, Zhan Yu and Zhan Bo, who attempted to kidnap Fe Ni, Bai Lun Jieyi appeared just in time to save him from the brink of death.
Not only did he stabilize Yunxiao's injuries, but he also guided Fe Ni, helping her break through her cultivation. Recognizing Yunxiao's destiny as the Master of the World God Monument, Bai Lun Jieyi used his remaining lifespan to impart crucial guidance.
In his final act, he performed a powerful technique, sacrificing what little time he had left to provide Yunxiao with the time and space coordinates that held the key to the war between the two worlds. His actions ensured that Yunxiao could continue his path toward his ultimate fate, carrying the weight of the world's destiny on his shoulders.

As Bai Lun Jieyi neared the end of her life, she remained a key figure in preserving the Taichu lineage and protecting its secrets. Despite being weak, she held on, waiting for three important visitors Duanmu Youyu, Yin Yu, and Feng Yaoli.

First, she entrusted Duanmu Youyu and Duanmu Cang with the Taichu inheritance, passing down knowledge, treasures, and the Jiuyao Xing Staff, ensuring the lineage's survival.

Then, Yin Yu, once trapped for years, arrived demanding the location of an unknown power. However, Bai Lun Jieyi had erased her own memory, making it impossible for him to extract the information. Enraged, Yin Yu prepared to forcibly read her mind, but before he could act, Feng Yaoli appeared.

Feng Yaoli, also seeking the Taichu secrets, confronted Yin Yu, sparking a conflict. Meanwhile, Wei Qing and his group, who had initially allied with Yin Yu, abandoned him, leaving him vulnerable.

Even in her final moments, Bai Lun Jieyi remained composed, ensuring the Taichu legacy was safely passed down while her enemies fought among themselves. Her role was pivotal in preserving the ancient knowledge that would shape the future of the Tianwu Realm.

Power

The Taichu Zhen Jue(Taichu Devine Art) The Taichu Zhen Jue was an ancient divine technique created to control time, allowing its wielder to manipulate its flow and create time domains. However, over generations, the Taichu lineage misused it to peer into fate, bringing them into conflict with the will of heaven. The Taichu Zhen Jue Divided into nine levels, Bai Lun Jieyi, one of the most accomplished practitioners, had reached only the eighth.

Trivia

Bai Lun Jieyi extended his life far beyond normal limits by consuming the Three Life Fruit and sealing himself in the Realm of Eternal Life. However, his fate was ultimately sealed when he attempted to deduce a forbidden place, drawing the punishment of heaven, which directly severed his remaining lifespan.

Ban Bingbai is the commander of the City Guards of Yangpu. At first, when confronting Yunxiao’s group, he follows his duty as the commander, attempting to uphold the law by questioning them and preparing to arrest them based on Wu Guang’s orders. However, he quickly realizes that these youths are not ordinary. When Yunxiao fires the Cloud Piercing Arrow an elite military signal Ban Bingbai immediately recognizes its significance and starts sweating. He understands that the people he’s dealing with have a powerful background, far beyond his ability to handle.

As soon as Yunxiao’s two-thousand-strong army arrives, Ban Bingbai is paralyzed with fear. The overwhelming killing intent and the presence of a Martial Lord leave him no choice but to stand down. He quickly realizes that Wu Guang has caused an enormous disaster, and he refrains from taking further action. Instead, he anxiously waits for Wu Guang’s father, City Lord Wu Liantian, to arrive and take control of the situation.

Battle Soul Mountain
====================

Battle Soul Mountain,the lawless land of
Jiangyu City
 is divided into the outer and inner parts. In the outer part, the gravity can be up to a hundred times, while the inner area is constantly changing. Sometimes it is normal gravity, and sometimes it can suddenly increase to hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands.

Plot & Event

Ten years ago, the
Devouring Soul Sect
 Sect learned that
Tian Xingzi
 had suffered a severe injury during his training and required a powerful earth-type monster to heal his wounds. Seizing this opportunity, the sect meticulously devised a plan to lure him into a trap. Their leader carefully arranged everything, using the Nine Netherworld Dirty Earth to refine a formidable monster and strategically setting up traps within Battle Soul Mountain. For a decade, they waited patiently, preparing for the moment when Tian Xingzi and the forces of Myriad Stars Valley would walk into their scheme.

However, what they didn't realize was that Tian Xingzi’s so-called "serious injury" from ten years ago was, in fact, a deception—a trap he had set for them. Even Tian himself hadn’t foreseen that
Huangfu Bi
, the Soul Devouring Sect's leader, would be capable of orchestrating such a complex counterattack. As both sides finally moved into position, a confrontation decades in the making was about to erupt, with schemes within schemes unfolding in an unpredictable battle of wits and power.

After the  conflict between the Devouring Soul Sect and Myriad Star Valley, the outer part of Battle Soul Mountain was left in ruins, partially blown apart. Both factions suffered heavy casualties, with countless experts perishing in the brutal battle.

Bei Jinghong
============

He is the King of Western Region. During the Ancient Demon Sealing War 100000 years ago, he snuck inside the seal of Demon Lord PU in hopes of refining his power and become the strongest entity.

Appearance

Old Man with white hair, a youthful face, jade-like skin, and a rosy complexion.

Personality

Bei Jinghong is an arrogant, stubborn, ambitious, and self-righteous individual who firmly believes he is the man of destiny. He has an overwhelming sense of entitlement, insisting that his strength, origins, and contributions to the Tianwu World make him the rightful owner of the World God Monument. His words reveal a deep resentment and desperation, unwilling to accept that someone else could be more worthy.

History

Bei Jinghong survived for 100,000 years by turning himself into a corpse, using an ancient preservation method to resist the passage of time. To minimize the erosion of his lifespan, he could only revive for one hour each year, spending the rest of the time in a death-like state. In total, this means that over 100,000 years, he has only truly "lived" for a little over 20 years.

Plot

Bei Jinghong awakened from his long slumber upon hearing the sound of the Dynasty Bell. Sensing a disturbance, he rushed over and discovered a young man locked in battle with three Overlords, having already severely injured two of them. Recognizing the dire situation, Bei Jinghong intervened to aid the wounded Overlords and soon engaged in conversation with Li Yunxiao.

During their exchange, Bei Jinghong was reunited with his profound artifact,
the Ancient

Dynasty Bell
, which had long been separated from him. Bei Jinghong proposed an alliance to break the ancient formation that had trapped Demon
Lord Pu
 for 100.000 years. He assured Yunxiao that Lord Pu was at his weakest state and, even if freed, would no longer pose a significant threat.

With their objectives aligned, Bei Jinghong, Yunxiao, and Lord Pu decided to work together to dismantle the powerful array formation.

To his surprise, the real reason Lord Pu agreed to the alliance was to deliver Yunxiao to the First Heaven when he was sealed, allowing him to absorb the remaining power of the Demon Emperor’s clone residing in Yunxiao’s body.

After Lord Pu revealed that Yunxiao was the chosen by the
World God Monument
 as owner, Bei Jinghong’s attitude toward Yunxiao changed drastically. Consumed by rage, he attempted to seize the monument and kill Yunxiao. However, Lord Pu reminded him that the monument had chosen Yunxiao, and Bei had no right to claim it. Furious, Bei turned his wrath on Lord Pu, and the two clashed.

The Agama Bone-Cutting Knife clashed against Bei’s Ancient Dynasty Bell, shattering its golden light instantly. The blade's energy tore through the bell, causing a massive explosion and leaving Bei Jinghong severely injured.

In his weakened state,
Ling Mudi
 approached Bei Jinghong and revealed himself as an old acquaintance. He tried to persuade Bei to reveal the location of the Spirit of the World God Monument, but Bei's stubbornness made it impossible. Determined to get the information, Ling Mudi was willing to cripple Bei or even search his soul.

Once again, Bei Jinghong attempted to attack the Formation Spirit, but he was knocked away with a single blow, leaving him severely injured and unconscious.

Seeing this, Ling Mudi instructed Yunxiao to trap Bei Jinghong inside the World God Monument and press him down with Tushita Peak for interrogation to uncover the Spirit’s location within the tablet.

Beifeng Nan
===========

Appearance

Dressed in white robe, he carried an indifferent expression, and his face was like jade and his exquisite facial features were carved into a beautiful face were so striking that even men would envy his beauty.

History

Beiming Nan, along with three thousand warriors, had perished sealing the demon at Two World Mountain a hundred thousand years ago—even his lord had fallen, leaving him as nothing more than a remnant soul. Yet, none of them had ever complained. Life and death had long lost their meaning. He willingly became a rotting corpse, standing guard for an eternity. Now, with little soul power remaining, his existence was fading—he wouldn’t be able to hold on for much longer.

Plot

Beiming Nan, having lived for 100,000 years, was resigned to his inevitable demise. With no Godly State experts left under the sky, he intended to entrust his Eternal Imperial Sword to Yunxiao, ensuring it wouldn’t be lost or fall into unworthy hands. However, Yunxiao refused and instead offered a way to suppress his injuries using the Divine Realm Tablet and a soul cultivation technique. Though initially doubtful, Beiming Nan couldn’t ignore his lingering will to live and agreed to seek permission from the technique’s original owner within the tablet. After Ling Mudi, his master, was taken into the Divine Realm Tablet by Yunxiao, Beiming Nan followed as well and chose to aid Yunxiao on his journey.

Five Cloud Mountain

After witnessing
Meng Bai
 large-scale attack, Yunxiao and
Beifeng Nan
 try to combined the Thunder Realm with the Seven Illusions Green Nightmare, creating the devastating technique "
Crazy and Cool Spinning Yo-Yo for Eternity
." The attack unleashed a deadly world of thunder and poison, instantly turning four thousand elite Monster to dust.
Shang’s Armillary Sphere and Heaven-Sealing Seal lessened the destruction, but the move still reversed the battle's tide and became legendary. However, the attack's backlash severely injured Yunxiao and Beifang Nan, forcing both of them to endure internal damage despite their powerful body techniques.

Power & Technique

Back then, Beifeng Nan directly refined the Seven Illusions Green Damask and fused it with his Heaven and Earth Venomous Body. Through this process, he forcibly opened the Eight Gates and sanctified his body, achieving a complete physical transformation without relying on the power of the Ten Rules. However, his actions led to deep regret his once perfect body deteriorated into a rotting corpse, leaving him in a state neither human nor ghost, cursed to exist for 100,000 years.

The seven Illusion Green damask of the major five poisons of extinction. His Seven Illusion Green Nightmares are actually wood poisons. And focus on single attack.

One controls the world for eternity, eight diamonds reflect the shadow, the mind becomes the sword. A green poison appeared, and within it, thousands of swords appeared, slashing down one after another.

Beifeng can summon countless corpse puppets from his shattered poisonous sword. Each puppet's body glows with a faint green hue.

After seeing Meng bai use his eight charm Vermillion saliva (one of the 5 major poisons) and combining it with the Rudra Mystic Water (a mutated water element), Yunxiao suggested doing the same with his thunder world and Beifeng nan's poison, because the seven Illusion Green damask of the major five poisons correlates to wood, the move isn't all powerful but it was able to spread to a very wide range, which attracted world destroying divine lightning of Shangqing Zifu. Move is called "cool and alluring spinning yo-yo".

Trivia

He once slew a Ghost King at its peak strength.

Like Meng Bai, Beifeng Nan possessed the Heaven and Earth Venomous Body, a rare divine constitution. Reaching great completion meant opening all eight gates and achieving a sanctified body. which was why he was still alive after a hundred thousand years.

Big Dipper Sect
===============

The Big Dipper sect was one of the most powerful local forces in Southfire city and occupied the best Feng Shui lines. Moreover, there were traces of fire element in the spiritual energy. It was obvious that this area of the earth vein contained fire golden crystals, which were a great wealth of resources.

General Information

After
Zhang Linghua
 confirmed as a Martial Sovereign of the Nine Heavens, the Big Dipper Sect's prestige soared. The news spread rapidly, solidifying its status as the strongest force in Southfire City.

History

The Big Dipper Sect and the Sky Scorpion Sect were once part of the same powerful family, dominating the Eastern Region. Over time, internal conflicts split them into two factions. The root of the conflict was an elusive treasure hidden by the first sect master of the Northern Scorpion Sect, a powerful figure who controlled the Southern Fire Golden Crystal Mountain range. On his deathbed, he foresaw the sect's potential decline and buried all of its wealth to be discovered by future disciples when they were strong enough to protect it.

Centuries later, the Northern Scorpion Sect began to weaken. Their enemies, growing more powerful, saw this as an opportunity to destroy the sect. In a major assault, hundreds of Martial Emperor-level warriors were mobilized in an attempt to wipe out the Northern Scorpion Sect once and for all. To survive, the sect's leader at the time accessed a portion of the founder’s treasure, allowing them to repel their enemies. However, this marked the start of the sect’s decline.

Although the North Scorpion sect had declined at that time, it was still an existence that was not weaker than the seven superpowers now. Its enemies failed in the end and eventually sought refuge with another force in the Eastern Region, which is the Jiang family of the current
Crimson Crescent City
.

Over the years, the North Scorpion Sect weakened, eventually splitting into the
Big Dipper Sect
 and the
Sky Scorpion Sect
. Despite their separation, they remained dominant forces in
Southfire City
.

Later, the
Thunderwind Chamber of Commerce
 intervened in the region’s conflicts, nearly wiping out both sects. However, the two sects unexpectedly fought back, leading many to believe they had once again accessed the legendary treasure.

Bo Mu
=====

Ancestors of bo family.

History

In the past Qiu had encountered a crisis: his
Dharmakaya (true body)
 had become a liability, and he needed it to be sealed away temporarily. He turned to Bo Mu, entrusting him with this task. As a sign of gratitude and faith, Qiu Nu gifted him the
True Sun Mantra
, a profound technique imbued with the power of the dragons. a highly valuable technique that later became an inherited secret within Bo Mu’s family.

However, the tides of fate turned cruel. At some point after the sealing of Qiu Nu’s Dharmakaya,
Bo Mu was captured by the Demon Master
, enslaved through a forbidden technique, and forced to serve under demonic influence. The once-proud Sea God became a mere tool, shackled to the will of the demons.

Qiu Nu, witnessing this, was faced with a difficult choice. He could risk his own power to free Bo Mu or let fate take its course. In the end,
he chose betrayal over loyalty
. Rather than helping his former ally, He ambushed Bo Mu instead, ensuring that their past contract was rendered meaningless. The act severed the last remnants of trust between them.

Plot

Qiu Nu demands the return of his sealed body, but Bo Mu offers him an alternative swearing loyalty to
Li Yunxiao
 for 500 years. Qiu Nu refuses, calling it an insult to his status as a
Dragon
. Facing no other choice, he bargains: he will submit, but only if Yunxiao kill
Yin Yu
.

Initially refusing to submit, he is forced to reconsider when Bo Mu offers him a way out swearing loyalty to Li Yunxiao for 500 years. Qiu's pride prevents him from accepting, but as his forces are defeated and he got corner by
Pan Yi
, he desperately tries to negotiate.

However, Yunxiao refuses his surrender, ordering his execution. In the ensuing battle, Qiu is severely injured and attempts to flee. His loyal follower, Da Nu, sacrifices herself to buy him time, but Yunxiao's forces relentlessly pursue him. Overwhelmed and humiliated, Qiu realizes he has lost everything.

As chaos erupts, reinforcements from the Four Seas arrive, revealing a deeper conspiracy. With the appearance of the
Abyss Master, Nine Abyss
, the battlefield shifts once again, leaving Qiu’s fate uncertain amidst greater forces at play.

Bo Yuqing
=========

Appearance

A man in a long green robe The man’s face was cold and his facial features were exquisite, had an exquisite sword at his waist and his left hand was holding the hilt. He looked like a Jade tree in the wind.

Plot

Back then
Lu Congzi
 arrived in a hurry and informed Bo Yuqing that something had happened to their master
Yu Shengfeng
. Without hesitation, Bo Yuqing followed him and helped break through the array, unaware that he was being deceived. Yu Shengfeng had already been bewitched by the Aegirine Neon Stone, and taking advantage of the situation, Lu Congzi manipulated Bo Yuqing into joining forces with him to kill Yu Shengfeng. Fortunately, though Yu Shengfeng was severely injured, his soul managed to escape.

After obtaining the aegirine stone, Bo Yuqing sought to refine it in hopes of achieving an Extreme Yin Body. Lu Congzi then taught him the forbidden art of "Death Sacrifice." Ignorant of its true nature, Bo Yuqing failed to realize that the only way to refine the stone was to sacrifice himself—using his own death as the catalyst. As a result, he wasted ten years without making any progress. Had he not stopped practicing in time, he would have died long ago.

What Bo Yuqing never realized was that Yu Shengfeng had deliberately fallen into the trap, believing he could turn the situation in his favor. However, he never expected Lu Congzi to conceal his true strength so deeply that even he failed to detect it. At the critical moment, Yu Shengfeng miscalculated, leading to a near-fatal mistake one he almost regretted for the rest of his life. Yet, what disappointed him the most was not just his own failure, but the fact that Bo Yuqing had ultimately chosen to strike alongside Lu Congzi.

Technique

Wailing sword rain wind-evil tune, The entire space seemed to have turned into a huge black hole, with only countless white feathers floating inside, giving off an endless sense of desolation The cold sword cut through the darkness, creating countless sword shadows. It was accompanied by an unusually strong spiritual power, and white feathers flew.

The Death Sacrifice technique is the only method to refine the aegirine stone, requiring the refiner to sacrifice their own soul. Among all the past generations of demonic servants, only Grandmaster Yu Yixian had successfully cultivated this forbidden art. His mastery of Death Sacrifice became a legacy, a so-called blessing for future generations, though its true nature remained a double-edged sword—offering immense power at the cost of one's own existence.

Trivia

Plot

Demon Origin Plains

Chen Chuanjiu, along side with
Zheng Yunfeng
 and
Ouyang Qi
, observes
Young Emperor Hao Lian
 in the Demon Plain. Recognizing Hao Lian's deep connection with nature, Chen, and his companions plan a surprise attack. Chen initiates a powerful martial technique, but Hao Lian remains unperturbed, displaying a calm demeanor. Instead of defending himself, Hao Lian approaches a Demon Snake and retrieves a half-eaten Five-Elements Spirit Devouring Rat from its mouth, showing compassion for the creatures.

In a subsequent encounter, Young Emperor Hao Lian protects the Demon Snake and Spirit Rat from harm using a green battle armor, which shatters under Chen Chuanjiu and his companions' combined attack. Believing Hao Lian to be injured or dead, they enter a passage he opens. However, Hao Lian has hidden inside a pit, and when Chen and Zheng Yunfeng enter the passage, he surprises them by reemerging, killing Ouyang Qi, and leaving a warning.

Chen Chuanjiu
, intervenes with a massive sword strike aimed at defeating Hao Lian and taking the Immortal Mountain for himself.

The confrontation results in a cataclysmic clash of powers that shatters the space, creates a devouring black hole, and ultimately triggers the activation of the Immortal Mountain's power ahead of schedule.

 to survive.

History

Five years ago,
King of Tianshui
Qin Zheng

Li Chunyang’s intervention
, he would have perished that very night.

Li Chunyang faked his death
, using a death row prisoner as a decoy while secretly tending to his injuries in a hidden chamber within his residence. However,
Dasheng was severely wounded by Yi Xiaoshan’s ice energy
, which seeped into his body, making his condition deteriorate over the years despite continuous treatment.

Plot

Yunxiao used a Mysterious Fire Pill and pure Yang energy to expel the poison completely. As a result, Chen Dasheng regained feeling in his legs and was able to stand again, bringing great joy to him and Li Chunyang.

 cured
chen Dasheng
 of his illness, he was given no time to rest.

Constellation Old Monster
=========================

SPOILER ALERT!

He is the Sect Master of the
Star Mansion Sect
 from the
Eastern Region
. As a Nine Heavens Martial Sovereign and a 500 years old cultivator, he is considered a well known existence in the Eastern Region and the entire
Tianwu Continent
.

Background

He has a peculiar fondness for girls around the age of
thirteen
 or
fourteen
. The Star Constellation Sect even specially built a palace to raise these girls for that old eccentric's "enjoyment."

The girls who are liked by him are kept as servants after deflowering them, while those that are not, are personally killed by him.

During the major power chart ranking, the old monster refused to participate because of the lacking of his skills.

Plot

Martial Flame City Crisis

After the fall of the Mount Meru, rummors accusing
Li Yunxiao
 as the culprit behind the destruction of Star Constellation Sect's Heavenscent Empire branch began to appear across the continent.

Taking advantage of such rummors, the Old Monster denounced that Li Yunxiao was the culprit behind the destruction of the sect’s branch and had even stolen the Star Mansion battleship. Personally travelled to Yanwu City to seek revenge.

Everything as a ruse to get control over the newly enriched land of the city.

He demanded that Li Yunxiao revealed himself. But nobody showed in front of him. Because of it, the Old Monster threatened to kill everyone in the city.

Li Yunxiao responded arrogantly from the City Lord's Mansion, insulting and challenging the Old Monster.

Infuriated, the Old Monster unleashed a powerful attack, which Li Yunxiao valiantly attempted to defend against using a series of powerful defensive arrays, Xuan artifacts and techniques.

Despite Li Yunxiao's efforts, the attacks's overwhelming power proved too much for him, and he was ultimately knocked into the ground, leaving the city in awe of the Old Monster's might. However, Li Yunxiao's resilience proved to be greater than the old monsters attack and resisted it.

After being shocked by Li Yunxiao's survival and his display of techniques to withstand the Martial Sovereign's punch, Constellation Old Monster, enraged by the mockery of Yunxiao, was about to strike again when
Li Huachi
, also known as Heavenly Zither Martial Sovereign, appeared on the scene.

Constellation Old Monster was taken aback and retreated in fear. Li Huachi instilled a sense of protection over Yanwu City, surprising everyone who thought he had come to seize the city.

Li Huachi explained that he owed someone a favor and had come to repay it by protecting Yanwu City. This revelation left everyone shocked, wondering about the significance of Yanwu City that could invite a Titled Martial Sovereign's protection.

Constellation Old Monster found himself in a difficult situation with the presence of Li Huachi, but also felt embarrassed and tried to save face by boasting about his improved Stormy Waves Technique. However, his arrogance only led to Li Yunxiao to mock him again, causing Old Monster to become further enraged.

With indifference for his attitude, Li Huachi promised the old monster that if he could resist a single attack from him, he would no longer  meddle in his affairs. The old monster, convinced in the ease of the task, accepted.

He unleashed his Raging Waves Technique to attack Li Huachi. In response, Li Huachi used his zither to play the Divine Charm, a segment of an ancient divine music, and created a sound wave that effortlessly neutralized the attack and took the old monster's life.

Corpse Fiend Sect
=================

The Corpse Fiend Sect is one of the
Hidden Families,
 a secretive and formidable faction that specializes in corpse refinement and control. According to the Sea Race, the sect's base is located within this vast sea region, carried by a massive undead turtle known as the
Immovable Forest
. This ancient creature, once buried in the deep sea, was refined into a colossal floating island by the sect's necromantic arts.

The sect's cultivation techniques bear some resemblance to Qiu Mujie's corpse-controlling methods, but they are far more refined and advanced. The
Immovable Forest
 can submerge deep underwater, remain hidden beneath the ocean floor, or rise to the surface like a drifting landmass, making the sect's stronghold nearly impossible to track. This ability to evade detection has allowed the Corpse Fiend Sect to operate in secrecy, perfecting their dark arts without interference from the outside world.

Background

The Corpse Fiend Sect was an immensely powerful and enigmatic force, one that had long maintained a strained relationship with the
Mu Family
. Like many of the hidden aristocratic families, the sect operated independently, rarely forming alliances with others. However, in recent times, various hidden sects had begun visiting one another, forging unexpected connections.

At the heart of the sect’s floating stronghold lay
Jing Qi’s Palace
, a grim and foreboding structure dominated by a massive stone coffin. As masters of corpse refinement, the sect had transformed the island into a macabre workshop, littered with the dried remains of sea beasts and an array of stone and jade coffins. The air was thick with corpse fiend energy, an oppressive aura that would cause great discomfort—if not outright horror—to ordinary individuals.

Crazy and Cool Spinning Yo-Yo for Eternity
==========================================

Yunxiao and Bei Fengnan combined their powers by merging the Thunder Realm with the Seven Illusions Green Nightmare. Yunxiao named this devastating technique the "Crazy and Cool Spinning Yo-Yo for Eternity."

Their combined attack created a vast world of thunder and poison, spreading across the endless sky. Wherever the green light passed, everything withered, and the world lost its color and sound. Those caught within the Thunder Realm were stunned and gradually turned to dust without resistance.

This powerful move reversed the tide of battle, securing the human race's fortune for thousands of years. The technique became legendary, known as one of the most terrifying large-scale attacks in history. In a single strike, four thousand elite demons were reduced to ashes, with half of them killed or severely injured.

Crimson Crescent City
=====================

General Information

One of the
7 major forces
. Located in Eastern Region.

History

Ever since
Li Yunxiao
 caused chaos in Red Moon City, the once-powerful Ruan family, once one of the city's three major families, has been steadily declining. They can no longer compare to the dominant Ning and Jiang families. Although Red Moon City remains one of the seven major forces in the Eastern Region, it now occupies one of the weakest positions. The city is home to many complex factions, with the Ning and Jiang families holding the most power. Decades ago, the Ruan family was a major force, but after most of their masters were killed by Gu Feiyang, their influence diminished, and they lost the prestige they once held.

later After experiencing the fall of Jiang Churan, the invasion of Tang Qing, the continuous internal strife, the external resistance against the sea tribe, and a series of major events that hurt the bones, the Redmoon city had long fallen to the bottom of the seven major forces, and even not on the same level.

Plot

The grand wedding in Red Moon City, meant to unite the Tang and Jiang families, turned into a battlefield the moment Li Yunxiao appeared. Chaos erupted as countless forces clashed for their own interests, turning the city into a scene of devastation.

Top experts from across the realm gathered—peak nine-star powerhouses, divine transcendence experts, sect masters, titled martial sovereigns, leaders of the Holy Lands, the terrifying Ghost King, the unknown Demonic Lord, and even the Sea Emperor, who had arrived in a borrowed body. Yet, in this blood-soaked battleground, once-mighty figures were reduced to mere pawns. Even Saint weapons, unseen for tens of thousands of years, became as common as street goods.

Amid the chaos, Tang Qing and his son perished, leading to the complete collapse of the Tang family’s influence. When the dust settled, Red Moon City fell under the control of the Sanctum, with Luo Qingyun appointed as City Lord and Li Yi as Vice City Lord.

Due to the
absence of Rank 10

Laws,
 one cannot reach the Divine Realm in the Heavenly Martial Realm. Which means their Primordial Qi can't be transformed into Spirit Qi and their Dantian won't be transformed either. Hence, after surpassing the Peak 9 Star Martial Sovereign, one reaches "Pseudo-Realms".

The first one after surpassing 9 Star Martial Sovereign is the Divine Transcendence Realm.

After enough accumulation in the Divine Transcendence Realm, one reaches the “Peak of Perfection” Realm. Very few people managed to even surpass that Realm and reach the “Void Prime Realm”.

Later when the Rank 10 Rules return those Realms are no longer relevant, because as long as one is able to comprehend the 10th rank rules, they can convert their Primordial Qi to Spirit Qi as well as change their Dantian to become a true Divine Realm Expert.

Still, they have the same strength as the first Three Minor Realms of the Ten Directions Realm, but the Dantian of a True Divine Realm Expert is more than ten times larger and they use Spirit Qi instead of Primordial Qi, which is superior to the former.

Dao Fruit
=========

Eating a Dao fruit allows the cultivator to comprehend the Dao Intent according to the grade of the fruit and greatly enhances their Yuan Qi. Dao Fruits exist from the 1st to 9th grade, with 1st grade containing First Origin Realm Dao Intent and 9th grade the Martial Sovereign Dao Intent. They are primarily used for the comprehension of the Martial Dao and rarely to enhance a cultivators Yuan Qi.

i.e.

Seven Constellation Dao Fruit allows comprehension of the Martial Emperors Dao Laws, which means after consuming it they only need to increase their Yuan Qi to reach the peak of Martial Emperor Realm and no longer need to worry about the comprehension of the Dao.

Dark Division

Plot

In the DuskFlame Empire, the Dark Thunder beast that was originally tamed by
Xu-Hongping
 was now Li-Yunxio 'pet'. Oringally Xu-Hongping and Dark thunder was ordered to stop and kill whoever that had passed the Soaring Phoenix town. Which was infested with dangerous bugs.

Li Yunxiao was accompanied by Ji-Meng, and ordered
Ji-Meng
 to keep
Xu-Hongping
 busy while he tames the Dark Thunder Beast.

While Ji-Meng was keeping Xu-Hongping at bay, Li Yunxaio took his time and played a calming-sweet tune to capture the beast. But the Thunder Beast was full of disgust but not knowing
Li-Yunxiao
, his eye technique,  was able to scare the Thunder Beast into submission. After that he was treated as if it was a dog gladly loving the pets given. So Thunder Beast happily made it's mind, seeing Li Yunxiao as it's owner.

Power

All demon beasts were savage and had mighty physical strength. Relying on the bloodthirsty power and mighty flesh, demon beasts were much stronger than human beings of the same level. But, their only weakness was that their divine sense was extremely weak, and they did not have intelligence.

SPOILER ALERT!

The ultimate cultivator and ruler of the
Demon Realm
. In ancient times, he launched a full offensive against the whole
Heavenly Martial Realm
 while leading his armies. After passing  a long period of time within the Martial Realm, the Demon Emperor got influenced by the energies of the Realm, forcing his body and personality to split, giving birth to
Lord Pu
. Later on the emperor was defeated and split into
several parts
 by
Ancient Almighty Experts
, which were sealed in various places on the Heavenly Martial Continent and other secret locations.

Those parts can be divided into
5
 portions of
Devil Essence
,
5
 pieces
Neon Rainbow Stone
. The stones split into Yin and Yang parts, which resulted in
5 Neon Stones
 (Yin Parts) and
5 Rainbow Stones
 (Yang Part).
Lord Pu
 was not split up, but completely sealed in the Southern Region, depleting its spiritual energy in the process and taking the 10th rank rules of the entire Heavenly Martial Realm away.

Background

A
Demon Emperor
 is a supreme existence in the
Devil World
, far above ordinary
Devil Lords
. The title is not merely a rank but a recognition of absolute authority and power. To become a
one
, one must not only reach the
World King Realm
 but also refine a
Six Paths Devil Weapon. 100.000 thousand years ago even with four world Kings,  if the Demon Emperor hadn't suddenly split into two, the outcome of the battle would still be unknown.

Yu Shengfeng
, his successor, possessed Yu Yixian's body with the intention of getting an Exreme Yin Divine Body.

Conscious Body

Demon Realm
===========

General Information

The Demon Realm is adjacent to the
Heavenly Martial Realm
. On several places those two Realms are colliding and slowly merging, which are: Tiandang Mountains (where Gu Feiyang died), at the border of the Sea of Soul Formation.

One of the native objects to the Demon Realm are the
Neon Rainbow Stones
, untainted and unrefined they are called Origin Stones.

The inhabitants of the Demon Realm are called Demons or Devils. When those Demon creatures get injured they decompose into lower level demon creatures, until they turn into demon qi at one point. Which is also the reason why it's so difficult to kill them.

For example a Demon Lord turns into a Ten Direction Evil Spirit, when killed. If further cut down it turns into an Evil Spirt, which after getting cut down again finally turns into pure Demon Qi.

Demons

Demons
 are formed either by yin-yang intertwining or when pure Demon Qi concentrated in a place.  At the start, there are a total of 8
Demon Sovereigns
 discovered in the current Demon Realm all located in the
Central Continent
 Followed by 2

Domain

There are 3 domains/Regions in the demon realm.

Central Continent

Mostly divided into 8 territories each are ruled and controlled by 8 Demon Sovereigns. There are many unexplored regions, Although they exist more, they are not located in this Central Continent, either they are not known or they are hidden. Among the 3 domains Central Continent is consider safest and most well-regulated land.

The Central Continent is multiple times larger than the Tianwu Continent(For example In order to participate in the Material Exchange of the Zheng tribe the seven demon lords from the Northwest tribe had to travel for almost 2 years).

But because of the lack of alchemist only the main cities of each territories have Super scale Teleportation Formation. Other Large Cities only have Medium size Teleportation Formation.

Ancient Desolate Vicious Domain

The vast space outside of the Central Continent, Because there is no rules to speak of in this region. It was a land where the strong devours the weak. However there are 17 or more powerful aristocratic families or hidden families that dominates the region. The strongest among the Demon Commanders of the Sacred Families are the Eight Ancestors, all of them possess the strength of a Peak Demon Commander, the strongest among them are Bai Shu and He, who have shown signs of ascending to the Holy Demon Realm.

Yuan County

Yuan County is a territory inferior to the Eight Central Regions, they have three major factions under their command, three families led by Peak Second Grade Demon Lords. Famous for its Transforming Qilin Demon Bones, the Buddha Corridor is a mysterious place that emerged countless years ago, he is the source of the Transforming Qilin Demon Bones, a place filled with dangers, It is said that the chance of death when entering the central location of the Buddha Corridor is extremely high even for experts, but by purchasing a Buddha Map, one can Yuan County is located in the Ice Region, which has two Demon Commanders ruling over it. safely enter the central location. Yuan County is located between the Eight Central Regions and the Archaeus Region.

Archaeus Region

The source of the attacks on the Heavenly Martial Realm is a mysterious force that has appeared out of nowhere in the Demon Realm. Even many Demon Commanders only vaguely knew this place, Only the 8 demon Sovereigns visited the Archaeus Region. Any demon lord that came from Archaeus Region are called Holy Envoy, with Holy Demons at its command, they have control over all Eight Regions.

Environment and Inhabitants

Just like the Heavenly Martial Realm, the Demon Realm has many different inhabitants and special environments.

Yin-Yang Intertwining

Yin and Yang are present in all things and beings in the Universe, therefore, Demons are no exception and have genders, Woman and Man. After a Man and a Woman with Demonic Qi present in their body copulate, the Yin and Yang will intertwine and evolve, potentially forming a life form like a child.
These Demons that arise through sex are normally weaker than common Demons, but they have common intelligence and do not need to consume other Demons to evolve their intellect. They are very common among all Tribes.

Demonic Fog Light

Appears in many places in the Demon Realm. Suppresses the six senses, can be broken with the power of the five elements.

Mammoth Wizdom Lizard

A monster from the Demon Realm. It's strength is equal to a 2nd Tier Demon Lord.

Head Abalone

A flying monster.

Nether Nine Abalone

It has weak attack, high defense and flying speed. Usually used by demons as an aircraft. It's a Minor Demon.
Minor Demons are a special life form, which are produced after the demon qi of a deceased demon attaches itself to a physical body. Most of them don't have intelligence except a few cases.

World Devouring Demon

An incredibly rare creature in the Demon Realm, it has six degrees of evolution, equivalent to the Realms of the Demon Realm. World-Devouring Demons are considerably superior to Demons in power, for example, if a Demon who has just reached the Demon Commander state has the strength of an expert in the Middle Stage Good Fortune Realm, then a World Devouring Demon who has just reached the Fifth Grade will have the strength of a Peak Stage Good Fortune expert.
These Demons were named this way because they have the incomprehensible ability to devour World Power, are incredibly great tonics for Demonic Cultivators, and can strengthen the bond of any individual who absorbs them with the Heavenly Dao and the Heaven and Earth elements of the Demon Realm, lessening the suppression of the Realm's Power in outside beings, and bringing their existences closer to the superior quality of demonic beings.

Holy Magic Stone

Also called “Boundary Crystal”. It's equivalent to the Heavenly Martial Realms Dragon Crystal. After a Holy Demon dies, its body slowly crystallizes over billions of years which turns into the Holy Individuals of the Heavenly Martial Realm who are infected by Demonic Qi and suffer Qi Deviation adapt a more aggressive consciousness, This can happen either through Demonic Qi or through the assimilation of Neon Stones. An individual's Cultivation tends to increase after demonization due to the superior nature of Demonic Qi.

Jade Demon Pearl

This priceless Pearl  is born after the death of a Holy Demon by the effects of the Five Decrepit Phenomena, that is, it requires the Holy Demon to survive for at least tens or hundreds of thousands of years. A Sovereign Demon's Body is formed by the Rainbow Stone, so is a Holy Demon, but the Demon Jade Pearl is like a Mutant Rainbow Stone.
This object is similar to the Outerworld Dark Stone, but has a different hue.

Sacred Ice Jade

The Yuan County Region has an unknown material that has spread throughout the elements of Buddha Corridor, called Sacred Ice Jade, an individual who has absorbed traces of Demonic Qi in Buddha Corridor, absorbs this Yin Qi and after dying, will develop a Transforming Qilin Demon Bone, a Bone that contains remnants of the deceased individual Understanding of the Rules and Demonic Qi.

Demonization

Individuals infected by Demonic Qi or Neon Stones who have suffered Qi deviations are demonized, adopting a more aggressive consciousness. Cultivation tends to increase due to Demonic Qi infection, as the nature of the Demonic Realm is superior to the Heavenly Martial Realm. Individuals who can find a correct and suitable path for their minds can escape the erosion of thoughts by Demonic Qi, even if only partially, and manage to remain with their mindsets.

Primordial Era

Ancient times where varied and possibly physical species inhabited the Demon Realm. Demonic Apes are an extinct species that dominated the Demon Realm for millions of years, It is said that when they reach adulthood they can enter the Demon Sovereign Realm without interruption, therefore, they ran wild as the rulers of the World.

Ancient Demon Realm

After a World collapses, a World Emblem is formed, it can be used to condense the space of a Saint Artifact into a true World under the control of the creator, This occurred millions or billions of years ago in the Demon Realm, resulting in the formation of one of the Six Paths Demon Artifacts, the Avici Scroll. The Book contains numerous lost techniques from the Ancient World, as well as extinct creatures, as the Chaos Fire Demon Dragon, a creature formed by the Power of the Realm and which holds a strength greater than a Holy Demon, similar to the True Spirits or True Dragon of the Heavenly Martial Realm, he was one of the first or the first creature of the Demonic Realm.

Trivia

the disappearance of the Ten Rules 100,000 years ago was linked to the Demon-Sealing War.

Beifeng Nan
 revealed that the Ten Rules had already vanished before the war even began. Their absence may have contributed to the chaos that followed.

Devouring Soul Sect
===================

General Information

The Devouring Soul Clan was an extremely unique existence among the
Seven Major Forces
, and also the most mysterious. They had very limited interactions with the outside world, giving off a somewhat reclusive feeling. However, they held great power and ruled over the Western Region alongside the
Myriad Stars Valley
.

Within the breadth of influence and the number of experts, perhaps the Myriad Stars Valley had the upper hand. But when it came to sheer terror, the martial practitioners of the Heavenly Martial Realm would rather face ten experts from the Myriad Stars Valley than a single member of the Devouring Soul Clan. Because this bizarre race practiced a secret technique that involved extracting souls.

Originally, such a malicious and evil sect should have aroused public outrage and been eradicated long ago. A Holy Land had indeed launched numerous attacks against the Devouring Soul Clan over tens of thousands of years, especially a large-scale campaign several thousand years ago that nearly wiped out the entire Devouring Soul Clan. However, a powerful member of the Devouring Soul Clan emerged later, leading the remnants to counterattack and plunging the entire continent into chaos and bloodshed.

Particularly at that time, the leader of the Holy Land and his sect were completely wiped out, disappearing from the continent. The place where the Devouring Soul Clan now resided was the spiritual mountain and river of that sect from back then. It was after that incident that the Devouring Soul Clan began to moderate their behavior, even in their soul extraction practices, so as not to provoke excessive anger on the continent. They also became more discreet in their actions and had very limited contact with external sects.

Important Information

In the Soul Devouring Sect, there were only three kinds of people who could be promoted to the position of an elder and enjoy all kinds of worship:

The first was that their cultivation had advanced to the level of Martial Sovereign.

The second was that their Soul Devouring Gonfalon had advanced to the Ninth-Grade.

The third was that they had completely refined a Ninth-Grade Profound Artifact.

Two Great Fighting Techniques

The members of the Soul Devouring Sect usually cultivate one of the two techniques.

Soul Devouring Banner

Used by most people of the Sect. It's a Xuan Artifact used to imprison the souls of humans, monsters, and other living beings. The main soul of the Banner, the Soul Slave, is divided into different grades from weak to strong: Yellow, Black, Earth, Heaven. The more souls and soul power the soul slave is fed, the higher its rank becomes. Sect Elders typically have an earth or heaven rank Soul Slave.

The Sect Master's Soul Banner and Soul Slave is different from the rest, it transcended the Heaven grade and is passed down from one generation of Sect Masters to the next. It's called "
Golden Speaker
", resides in the "
Pangu Banner
" and can either fight alongside the Sect Master or fuse with him and greatly enhance his offensive and defensive capabilities.

Soul Battle Technique

The minority of Sect Members use Soul Battle Techniques because of the higher difficulty. In the early stage, a beast's soul is fused with the host and grows together with them. In battles, they temporarily fuse with the host and greatly enhance his Soul Power. They live in a symbiotic relationship, with the host profiting from each other's soul power to grow stronger. Once fused with a soul, it's said to be incredibly difficult to separate them again.

Huangfu Bi
, the Sect Master, uses the "
Great Soul Derivation Technique
". It's a Soul Technique derived after his ancestors partially comprehended the
Great Expansion Divine Technique
.

Trivia

Back then, the first masterThe Golden speaker's was fortunate enough to witness the great expansion divine technique once. However, he was unable to fully master it. He could only rely on his own talent to forcefully memorize the divine technique. After that, he modified it through various techniques and created the great expansion soul refining technique of the soul Devourer sect.

Di Jia

History

After the
Demon Emperor
 got split into five portions of devil essence, each portion became an individual being. Di Jun was originally sealed in the outer space in the Ancient Pagoda and an array of seven chunks of northern heaven cold star iron. An artificial true spirit, the "
crocodile
" (which is created by the immemorial astral wind, an element close the the origin of the wind element), served as the guardian of that formation.

Yunxiao travelled to the outer space, with the intention of obtaining the immemorial astral wind to open the wind territory in his divine realm tablet.

He and the Starlight Soul body of Yuan Gaohan, a 9th tier alchemist, destroy the formation to obtain the northern heaven cold star iron, which leads to the release of Di Jun.

Plot

After the devastating battle,
New Yan city
 was left in ruins, its vitality severely damaged. The city had suffered massive destruction, with two of its four teleportation formations completely destroyed, limiting movement in and out of the region. The city's infrastructure was in disarray, and the merchant Union, led by
Ding Shan
, immediately took control, ordering a
ten-day lockdown
 for reorganization and recovery.

In the aftermath,
Ding Shan expelled Myriad Treasures Store and Empyrean One Pavilion
 from the merchant Union, effectively forcing them to evacuate. Given the deep foundations these organizations had within the city, it was nearly impossible for them to relocate everything within the short deadline. However, Yunxiao, showing his usual resourcefulness, devised a plan to salvage the situation—
selling off fixed assets at a discount
 to the Star and Moon School and the Money Sect, ensuring they wouldn’t leave behind any valuable resources.

Tensions ran high as
Wan Yiqian

and Su Lianyi
—leaders of the expelled factions—struggled to accept this forced removal. Though they had no choice but to comply, they understood that Myriad Treasures Store and Empyrean One Pavilion were now inseparably linked in their survival outside the merchant Union.

Eternal Evergreen Tree
======================

SPOILER ALERT!

He is one of the two Spirit Trees that were born since the creation of the world tens of thousands of years and was formed from the Yi wood Qi in the world.

Plot

Demon Origin Plains

In the midst of a chaotic battle above the Demon Plain, Little Qing, engages in a fierce confrontation with
Shang
 and his companions. Little Qing transforms into lightning and battles Shang, who uses the
Supreme Palace Armillary Sphere
 to create a celestial barrier. Despite Shang's efforts, Little Qing breaks free and launches a devastating attack, creating a chaotic scene of lightning, explosions, and energy clashes.

During the battle,
Ge
 sacrifices his life to block Little Qing's attack, stabilizing the situation momentarily. Little Qing counters with a powerful thunder attack, and the two sides exchange blows. Ge's sacrifice leaves an emotional impact on his old friends.
Li Yunxiao
 rushes to save Little Qing, and the appearance of the Tianyi Chamber of Commerce adds a new layer of complexity to the unfolding events.

As the battle between Shang and Li Yunxiao unfolds, the confrontation leads to a collision between the
Universe God Monument
 and the Supreme Palace Armillary Sphere, cracking the axis of the Armillary sphere and injuring both fighters.

Shang is ultimately defeated and heavily injured by Li Yunxiao's overwhelming palm technique. And Little Qing disappears from the scene, leaving a cryptic message for Shang.

Illusionary Realm of the Water Moon Flower Mirror

Within the illusion, the
Spirit Devouring Rat Emperor
 and Little Qing strategize to counter
Hao Lian
's pursuers. They manipulate the Four Seasons Enchantment to alter the landscape. While the Water Rat King is cornered by
Che Xuyao
 and
Feng Yi
, and Little Qing warns the Rat Emperor against breaking the enchantment.

Little Qing suggests a risky plan to save the rat population and the Rat Emperor agrees, to this strategy, ordering his subordinates to cease their attack on the experts. As the illusionary landscape shifts and changes, the Water Rat King is eventually captured by Che Xuyao and his companion, who attempt to refine the Five Elements Beast Taming Ring with the Five Rat Kings.

Later, Li Yunxiao's proficiency in harnessing the power of the Four Seasons Boundary stuns even Little Qing, making him realize that his capabilities extend far beyond his expectations. In a tense face-off, Li Yunxiao faces Little Qing, who has manifested the power of the rules of heaven, lightning. Little Qing questions Li Yunxiao's intentions and accuses him of seeking his real body. After a fierce exchange, Li Yunxiao discloses his desire to reach the Ancient Desolate Land, and Little Qing agrees to potentially help him, acknowledging their debt from Li Yunxiao's previous assistance. As Little Qing departs, Li Yunxiao questions him about the location of Noah's Ark, but he offers no further information.

Later,
Yu Yangzhou
's escape astounds Little Qing, who realizes Yangzhou triggered the Virtual Eye and Rain Summoning while heavily injured and managed to escape. Little Qing decides to find Yangzhou and eliminate him, as he suspects Yangzhou might be just hiding.

However, in another place,
Li
's attempt to break the formation triggers catastrophic consequences, Little Qing, who has been observing, warns that disaster is looming. The formation's instability leads to the sudden rise of an enormous ice mountain that engulfs Li, while the surrounding area experiences chaotic shifts between the four seasons.

The mountain's peak undergoes rapid transformations, with spring, summer, autumn, and winter all manifesting at different levels. The mountain's appearance reflects the four seasons, with spring at the midpoint, peach blossoms, withered trees, and snow at the base. Meanwhile, an immense boundary of the four seasons emerges in the distance, revealing the Immortal Mountain of lord
Throne
.

Four Seasons Immortal Mountain

Inside the Immortal Mountain, Little Qing and the Rat Emperor discuss the dire situation. Little Qing explains that the revelation of the true formation's core will activate the Immortal Mountain's power, causing the four seasons to rotate and crush all life within the formation, including themselves. To buy time for Young Emperor Hao Lian's breakthrough, Little Qing plans to stall and strengthen himself. He hopes that once he becomes more powerful, he can break open a sealed space below his main body and retrieve Noah's Ark.

Eternal World
=============

The
Eternal World
 was created
100,000 years ago
 by ancient experts as a sanctuary after the
disappearance of the Ten Rules of Heaven
, the fundamental laws of martial power. Seeking immortality in an era without
Rank 10 Laws
, these experts sealed themselves away, living in seclusion. Entrance to the Eternal World is blocked by
four powerful seals
, maintained by the
Four Pavilions
 in the
Langya Heaven Mystic Realm
. Only when these seals are broken can outsiders enter.The most powerful force within the Eternal World is
Xuanli Island
,

Background

The
Eternal World
 is a sealed, isolated realm located within the
nest of the ancient Heavenly Phoenix
. It was created through the power of the Phoenix’s most
precious feather
, which contains a vast amount of divine energy. This energy grants those inside a state of
immortality
, allowing them to sustain themselves indefinitely with powerful divine abilities.

However, this immortality comes at a cost the Eternal World has been
cut off from the outside world
 for countless years. Over time, the
power of the Heavenly Phoenix
 that sustains it has begun to
weaken
, making it increasingly difficult to maintain eternal life. Those within the realm are forced to enter a
deep sleep
 to preserve themselves, leading to an eerie, death-like atmosphere where communication is rare.

Despite its divine origins, the Eternal World is a
prison as much as a sanctuary
 those inside cannot easily leave, and if they do, their bodies will rapidly
wither and perish
 due to their reliance on the Phoenix’s power. Only using devine technique  like
Gu Qingqing
, being one such inhabitant, has only been able to exist outside by using a
fragment of her divine soul
, while her true form remains dormant inside.

Structure & Creation

The Eternal World is a
vast continent
 bathed in a dim, fiery-red glow, with no sunlight and barren landscapes of rolling mountains and endless rock formations. It was
created using the three True Tail Feathers of the Celestial Phoenix
, making it a place of immense spiritual energy. Over time,
Phoenix Fire Phosphorus Stones
 formed, absorbing the spiritual Qi from the
Phoenix Nest
 and the
Realm of Heavenly Martial Arts
.

To
preserve the Eternal World
, a massive energy-locking structure was designed:

A
Heaven-Protecting River
, stretching for tens of kilometers, prevents spiritual energy from dissipating. The only energy in the eternal world is this Phoenix Fire phosphorus stone. It’s also the source of the power of this heaven-protecting River that is tens of kilometers long. Everyone will find an abundant Phoenix Fire scaly stone mine to cultivate in seclusion.In this heaven protecting River formed by the celestial Phoenix’s true power, one’s divine sense couldn’t be spread out at all

Four Great Pavilions
 act as seals and energy channels, absorbing external spiritual energy and injecting it into the sky. These are:

Jade Book Pavilion

Heavy Equipment Tower

Heavenly Treasure Pavilion

Emperor Pill Tower

These pavilions serve a dual purpose sealing the
true body of the Eternal World
 and ensuring that spiritual energy within the realm remains abundant.

Trivia

The terrain in the eternal world is hard to identify and changes frequently. Even  needle with fixed coordinates has to be used multiple times to avoid going in the wrong direction due to changes in the terrain.

In the eternal world, no one knew how many old monsters there were, but everyone had their own territory. In order to avoid being disturbed, they would leave this mark the seal of the forbidden area  on their territory to tell others that this place was theirs and that they were not to trespass. The consequences of trespassing into someone else’s forbidden area are very serious.

The Evil Spirit would help Yunxiao destroy the Blood God Palaces' beast made of multiple rank 9 Xuan artifacts, while Yunxiao would find a 9 star martial Sovereigns' body for it to possess.

A couple years later in the
East seas
'
Rain Land
, Yunxiao Kills and gives the Evil Spirit the body of an Ancient True Dragon Bloodline of 9 star martial Sovereign cultivation level.

During the Battle in
Crimson Crescent City
, Where
Teng Guang
 tried to sacrifice himself to blow up his own Formation, the Monster Clan led by
Shang
 and
Li
, leave
Chang 'an
 to trap and kill Li Yunxiao. After Killing their way through the trap, Yunxiao Searches his soul and lets the Evil Spirit possess him.

Near the end of the novel, after tracking down the body of
Qiu
, and with only a wisp of spiritual sense in Qiu's body, with the help of
Nine Abyss

God Monument
. Later with the help of the Monster clan, the Evil Spirit possesses Qiu's
Dharma Body

Li Yunxiao
 and
Luo Qingyun
. He was shocked by the display of power and talent by both fighters and witnessed the intense clashes between their formidable techniques.

Fang De was also involved in deciding the outcome of the crystal stone competition, with the remaining crystal stones unaccounted for due to the damaged array. Ultimately, he decided to end the competition and activate the teleportation array to send everyone back.

Feng Buping, was a
Blue Jewel Academy
 dean of students, with a nicknamed God of Slaughter. The reason why he was called the 'God of Slaughter' by the students was not only because of his strict law enforcement, but also his selflessness and fairness.

Appearance

A middle-aged man, whose hair had stood on their ends.

Feng Yaoli
==========

Feng Yaoli, the king of the fallen country of Little Bingtian in the far north, who used his wife's life to refine weapons.

Appearance

Huo Dou Form Feng Yaoli's body had grown twice in size, and his entire body was a faint blue. A pair of golden and silver horns grew out of his head, and there were two-colored lightning bolts crackling on them.

Plot

Eternal World

Feng Yaoli arrived at
Bailun Jieyi
 stone house, also seeking the secrets of the Taichu Divine Art’s inheritance. There, he confronted
Yin Yu
, who ultimately killed Bai Lun Jieyi and searched his soul and
Wei Wuya
 that try to stoping him to snatch Bailun Jieyi Body from Yin Yu. However, upon doing so, Yin Yu suffered a powerful backlash, severely injuring his soul consciousness. Witnessing this, Feng Yaoli chose to withdraw, opting not to escalate the conflict any further.

Later had once been fooled by Yunxiao and accidentally made a heart oath that he would never attack Duanmu Youyu again. That was why he had formed an alliance with Yin Yu, trying to snatch the nine luminaries star staff from Duanmu Youyu through Yin Yu.

Power

Feng Yaoli was a True God-level being from the past who possessed the Huo Dou Body, granting him the ability to wield both the power of the Huo Dou bloodline and his own true power Cold True Essence. This Cold True Essence was an embodiment of extreme cold energy, similar to the power of the Beiming family, yet fundamentally different. Feng Yaoli’s cold was absolute, an extreme and pure frost, while the Beiming family’s power carried a hint of yin energy, leaning toward the dominance of Extreme Yin Power.

This person's cultivation, profound level weapon, physical body, and magical powers were all extraordinary. Even an empty realm warrior would not be able to suppress him. Only an existence like the Misty Rock Lord would have a certain chance of victory.

Leng Jian Bingshuang (The Cold Sword’s Frosty Blade) is a Divine/Holy Weapon. It was forged through an extraordinary process—a fortune teller and Feng Yaoli refined an entire kingdom’s space into the sword itself. In doing so, they transformed the Snow Country into an independent realm contained within Leng Jian Bingshuang. Within this space, Feng Yaoli reigns as its absolute master, wielding complete control over its domain.

The Tai Chi Sealing Heaven Seal - innate magical power of the Huodou clan. under the Taiji Heaven Sealing Seal, everything in the Three Realms and Five Elements is sealed. this move consumes a lot of energy, will become extremely weak after performing it.

The Taichu Zhen Jue is one of the Four Great Divine Techniques, possessing the power to counter and rival the Devil Lord’s Ice Fiend Heart Flame. In ancient times, two legendary masters the Realm King and the God of Evolution—each cultivated their own supreme techniques: the Great Realm Divine Art and the Great Evolution Divine Art, respectively. The Taichu Zhen Jue stands on equal footing with these divine arts, neither inferior nor lacking in power. The Taichu Divine Art is an ancient and powerful technique originally created to control the power of time. It grants its practitioner the ability to manipulate time flow, accelerate or decelerate time, and even create time domains. However, over generations, the Taichu lineage misused this divine art not for its intended purpose but to peer into the past and future, attempting to uncover the secrets of fate.
 Just like his senior brother
Bailun Jieyi
, one of the most accomplished practitioners, he had reached only the eight level from nine levels.

Trivia

Divine sword, Leng Jian Bing Shuang, later passed to a good friend
Ling Mudi
 it played a significant role in the battle to seal the demons, and is one of the divine objects to seal the demons.

Feng Zhu
========

Feng Zhu was one of the two Elder  of the Holy Fire Temple under
Ye Fan
 Commands. He, along with other high-ranking members, was on a mission to search for and retrieve their ancestral divine artifact.

Plot

Light Song Forest

Ye Fan
,
Tao Guan
, Feng Zhu, and
Qi Guang
 confront
Li Yunxiao
 in the Light Song Forest. Li Yunxiao cleverly takes Yi Fan hostage to initiate a negotiation. The Sacred Fire Temple seeks the Yang Key and believes it's linked to Noah's Ark. During the discussion, they tentatively agree to cooperate, aiming to rescue Tang Jie, take Yang Key and locate Noah's Ark. However, an explosion disrupts their conversation, leading to speculation about Tang Jie's rescue and the involvement of various factions.

As they observe the chaos,
Zou Chen
 offers his Time-fixing Plate to assist the crowd in tracking auras. Zou Chen uses the Time-fixing Plate to trace a lead to the east of the Demon Plains, where Noah's Ark might be located. Li Yunxiao's group proposes a plan to intercept the Skeleton Mercenary Group, discovering a teleportation array within their headquarters. They activate it and arrive in the Demon Plain, while other factions continue their pursuit of Noah's Ark.

Demon Origin Plains

After teleporting to the Demon Plain, Li Yunxiao's group discusses their encounter with the Skeleton Mercenary Group. The conversation shifts to
Ye Nantian
's notes about breaking through to the Divine Realm. Li Yunxiao seeks to view the notes, leading to a deal: he helps them obtain Noah's Ark in exchange for access to the notes. Tension arises when
Feng Zhu
 challenges Li Yunxiao's skills. Suddenly, the legendary creature "
Wu
" appears behind Li Yunxiao, leaving the group awestruck. The Wu enters its own body and disappears, a rare and enigmatic event that emphasizes the rarity and significance of the encounter.

Continuing their journey, the group finds a preserved corpse of a powerful Martial Supreme killed by
Young Master Hao Lian
. Concerns about Hao Lian's motives arise. Dark clouds gather, signaling the arrival of forces from other territories. Three formidable warships, two Rank 7 Golden Sun Warships and a Rank 8 Netherworld Warship, appear in the sky.  Amidst the warships,
Xuan Bing
 commands an attack from formidable warships, forcing Li Yunxiao's group to narrowly escape. Amidst the battle, the Imperial Bell emerges, withstanding attacks.
Feng Zhu
 and
Qi Guang
 join, using “Holy Skill” techniques to clash with Xuan Bing. The World God Monument appears and causes a warship to sink, leading to chaos.

Li Yunxiao suppresses the Netherworld Warship using the
World God Monument
, causing it to sink irreparably. Xuan Bing and his forces are left in shock and desperation over the loss of the two warships. Interrogating captives, they learn about involvement from the Feather Frost Sect, led by Martial Sovereign. The group continues its quest cautiously, sensing hostile auras ahead. Investigating the strange death of an eighth-rank Soul-shattering Tapir, the possibility of a Peak Martial Sovereign's presence raises concerns, as their pursuit of Noah's Ark could be threatened. Despite the fear and uncertainty, the members of the Sacred Fire Temple reaffirm their determination to continue their quest for Noah's Ark. They are motivated by their ancestral legacy and the opportunity to restore their sect's glory.

Fire Fish Tribe
===============

In the ancient times, the Fire Fish Clan was merely an ordinary sea group. It was precisely in the sea territory that a
True Spirit Phoenix
 was undergoing Nirvana on the
Kunwu Divine Tree
. During that Nirvana, the flames accidentally ignited one of their ancestors.

That ancestor originally thought it was a certain death, but little did they know that not only did they not die, but instead, under the nurturing of the Divine Spirit, their body experienced a significant rebirth. From then on, they not only possessed an extremely keen perception and longing for flames, but their body structure also became highly suitable for cultivation.

Later, this ancestor even stepped into the realm of Martial Sovereign, propelling their sea group to become a dominant presence in the vicinity! This is the gradual decline of the power of bloodline. Initially, the Nirvana Fire of the true spirit Phoenix transformed their ancestor's bloodline, but since then, generation after generation, the bloodline started to thin.

Nowadays, the power of their Fire Fish Clan's bloodline is no longer sufficient to allow them to break through to the Eight Wilderness/Desolates Realm. Moreover, if this continues, even becoming a Seven Constellations Martial Emperor in the future will become increasingly difficult. There is even a possibility, one day their Fire Fish Clan will regress to the level of a sea group once again.

Four Seas
=========

General Information

Due to the immense size of the
Sea Clan
, even the King of the Four Seas finds it difficult to count the exact number. Therefore, based on the strength of each clan, the Sea Clan is divided into ten levels for easier management.

At the pinnacle stands the powerful
Bo Family
, the Co-Lords of the Four Seas, revered as godlike beings and not included in the levels.

Below the Sea Emperor Bo Family, the First-Rate is occupied by the Royal Families of the Four Seas, managed by the four major sea clans. They are the
Guang
,
Qin
,
Shun
, and
Run
 clans, representing superpowers.

In the Second-Rate of the Sea Clan, there must be ten
Martial Sovereign
-level powerhouses or more presiding over it. They are like dominant rulers in their respective regions.

For the Third-Rate of the Sea Clan, a
Martial Sovereign
 powerhouse is required.

The Fourth-Rate of the Sea Clan needs a
Martial Supreme
 powerhouse to govern it.

The Fifth-Rate of the Sea Clan requires the presence of a
Martial Emperor
 powerhouse within the clan.

For the Sixth-Rate of the Sea Clan, having a
Martial Grandmaster
 powerhouse is sufficient, similar to the status of a subordinate nation/kingdom within the
Duskflame Empire
.

As for the Seventh-Rate of the Sea Clan, represented the last-ranked, only a
Martial King
 powerhouse is required for entry.

Apart from these Seven classifications there are numerous Sea Clans beneath them, that are difficult to count. They are not referred to as 'Sea Clan' and are collectively known as the Sea Groups.

The Legendary Sea Alchemists
Ha Shi
,
Xue Lai
 and
An Sen
, who are Ninth-Tier Alchemists, have the same prestige as the Four Great Sea Kings.

Rainbow Mist

The Rainbow Mist Sea is a highly unique phenomenon in the open sea. The once tranquil sea surface suddenly becomes covered in a rainbow-like multicolored mist, blanketing everything. Even divine senses struggle to penetrate it for long distances. Once the rainbow mist phenomenon appears, the original sea area becomes unrecognizable; this mist can create spatial channel effects. Those who enter it will simultaneously be transported to an unknown sea area. Therefore, the Rainbow Mist Sea holds immense exploratory value. A chart that marks a fixed Rainbow Mist Sea is a priceless treasure, with immeasurable value. Of course, the risks are also great. If it leads directly to the territory of high-level sea creatures, it would result in complete tragedy.

Sea Creatures/Demonic Beasts

In the sea, sea creatures can exert their unique advantages, while humans can only hunt those of lower realms. Generally speaking, as long as you don't venture into deeper waters, there won't be too much danger. However, precisely because of this, the safe zones have already been hunted out, leading many hunting parties to take risks and venture into deeper waters for higher profits.

Purple-Patterned Nine-Infant Serpents
(Violet Nine-Striped Moths or Purple-Striped Nine Nascent Serpents)

The Purple-Patterned Nine-Infant Serpent is rumored to possess the bloodline of an
Ancient True Dragon
.

In its infancy, it's merely at the Sixth-Rank Demonic Beast.

Upon maturity, it automatically evolves to the Seventh-Rank Demonic Beast.

If it can survive for over 500+ years, it can further evolve to the Eighth-Rank Demonic Beast.

The Purple-Patterned Nine-Infant Serpent with a lifespan of 1000+ years can even break through to the Ninth-Rank Demonic Beast.

Beyond the Ninth-Rank, if it can withstand the tribulation of the heavens, it can transform from a False-Dragon or a Serpent into a True Dragon. Regaining the bloodline of an Ancient True Dragon and advancing into the realm of the Ten-Directions Divine Realm.

Trivia

the royal families of the four Seas were a race that had a more successful inheritance. Although the power of their bloodline was still declining with the passage of time, they were still much stronger than other Dragon descendants.

As the competition begins, Li Yunxiao surprises everyone by suggesting that each of the three alchemist masters will condense one primal stone, while he alone will condense two primal stones simultaneously. This shocks the three alchemist masters, as it increases the difficulty of the competition significantly.

Despite their anger and disbelief, they continue with the competition. Li Yunxiao impresses them with his mastery of the Twelve Forms of Flying Flower and Falling Snow, a set of refining techniques created by the renowned alchemist, Gu Feiyang. Li Yunxiao's use of these advanced techniques and his overall proficiency in alchemy leave the three alchemist masters in awe and shock.

Finally, Ge Xiangqian can no longer hold back and attacks first, using the same method as Li Yunxiao to condense his primal stone. The competition is now underway, and everyone is eager to see who will come out victorious.

Ge Xiangqian managed to raise the primal stone to a Mid-grade level but exhausted a lot of energy in the process, leaving him visibly fatigued. Next, Lu Haochu took over, using his Yamata Branch Heart Cultivation Mantra to condense the primal stone. His technique was beautiful and dreamy, but he also struggled to match Li Yunxiao's level of refinement.

Li Yunxiao, on the other hand, effortlessly advanced his primal stone to the middle grade, showcasing his superior understanding and control of the Twelve Forms of Flying Flower and Falling Snow. He surprised everyone by using a new and mysterious technique called the Scripture of Rippling Mirage. The technique impressed even Baili Gongjin, a rank six alchemist, who recognized its profoundness and admitted his admiration for Li Yunxiao's mastery.

After Baili Gongjin shared the story of his encounter with Lord Gu Feiyang and his advice, Lu Haochu attempted to condense a primal stone using his powerful soul force. However, his technique lacked finesse and appeared clumsy compared to Li Yunxiao's mastery. He raised the primal stone to a High-grade level but felt fatigued after the effort. In response, Li Yunxiao managed to advance the primal stone to a high-grade level, impressing everyone with his skills and talent.

Now, Xin Ze is attempting to advance the primal stone to the supreme-grade level, while Li Yunxiao is doing the same. Despite Li Yunxiao's exhausted state, he surprises everyone by suddenly revitalizing and displaying incredible control over his soul power and the primordial stone, keeping up with Xin Ze's progress. The two are in a fierce competition to see who can reach the supreme-grade level first.

But, later, Li Yunxiao even succeeded in forming a Innate Primordial Elixir, a divine object, which amazed all the alchemists present. Even the Supreme-grade primal stone he used to create it transformed into the Inner Core, which symbolized the Innate Primordial Elixir. Witnessing Li Yunxiao's extraordinary skill and calm demeanor, the other alchemists, including Xin Ze, Ge Xiangqian, and Lv Haochu, were deeply impressed. In a show of respect and admiration, the three fourth-grade Alchemists knelt down and expressed their admiration for Li Yunxiao's prowess.

=======

Appearance

His face was calm and his eyes were intelligent. with six golden beads between his fingers, each of which was engraved with a small seal character, which read: soldier, elephant, horse, chariot, cannon, and soldier.

Background

The general was the most mysterious person in the myriad Stars Valley. He followed the myriad Stars Valley’s sect master, Tian Xingzi, like a shadow and had never been separated. Even the people of the myriad Stars Valley never knew of the general’s identity.

History

Back then, Tian Xingzi brought this very General to wager against Teng Guang in a game of strategy. But even with such a formidable creation, he still lost

Power

The Chessboard General and his Six Puppet Knights were formidable, each representing a key piece in a deadly game of strategy and power. These puppets were not mere machines; they possessed intelligence, agility, and an eerie semblance of life. Their deep-set eyes flickered with eerie light as they moved with mechanical precision.

Wind-Chasing Cannon (Pao) –  A broad-shouldered, short-built puppet carrying a five-foot-long cylindrical cannon on his shoulder. He is impulsive, aggressive, and eager for battle, always the first to engage the enemy. His attacks are explosive and devastating, capable of unleashing destructive energy with immense force.

Blood-Eyed Knight (Shi Wushuang) – Slender and quick, with a head shaped like a crescent moon and red Bloodthirsty Demon Eyes that glow ominously. His gaze can see through his opponents, detecting their strength and weaknesses. Emotional and attached to his comrades, he has a strong sense of loyalty but is prone to reckless actions when enraged.

Sky-Devouring Elephant (Xiang) – A massive, heavily-armored brute with overwhelming strength. His enormous golden sickle could cleave through the battlefield like a storm.

Soldier (Ma Feifei) – A standard frontline warrior, disciplined and steadfast. Though seemingly unremarkable, his movements and battle instincts make him a reliable fighter.

Trivia

The General was created as a perfect vessel for Tian Xingzi's descent. Unlike ordinary possession techniques, which have limitations, the General was specially refined to ensure a high degree of compatibility, allowing Tian Xingzi to exert his full power when taking over the body.

Since the General and the other puppets are not truly living beings, they are essentially immortal. Even if they are killed or destroyed, Tian Xingzi can simply create new ones,

Plot

During the fair, he traded the Soul-Raising Tree, formed from the essence of the Kunwu Divine Tree, for the wreckage of an eighth-grade Netherworld Warship that Li Yunxiao possessed.

Ghost Asura
===========

The Ghost Asura was a product of a failed refinement of true Spirit's blood. It has no soul at all and only has a physical body. It's almost undying and extremely powerful. the most ideal killing machine created by
Wei Qing
 along with
Qiu Mujie
, with the support of the
Holy Region
 and Long Family, using humans with strong dragon bloodlines as the foundation for his experiments.

Appearance

Some had the head of a bull and the body of a snake, with four horns. Some had two horns on their heads, but they were of different species. The other had four heads and eight arms, which was even more terrifying than a true fiend Dharma idol.

Background

The Ghost Asura, though not as monstrous as
Qiu Mujie
, was fueled by semi-finished dragon’s blood. Lacking emotions, senses, or fear, it was even harder to defeat. However, dragon blood couldn’t be refined alone—it required a dragon descendant’s body as a container.

The experiment had a high failure rate, with most subjects reduced to ashes. Only a select few with strong bloodlines were chosen, like the nine Ghost Asuras.
Ruo Xiang
 had also been a candidate but failed, while
Luo Qingyun
 alone succeeded. Otherwise, there might have been a tenth Ghost Asura.

The other failed experiments are called Shuras, categorized by strength into Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Iron. Among them, Ghost Shuras are the most valuable, having nearly reached the Tenth Order Divine Blood. Only Gold Shuras pose a real threat, while the others are essentially worthless.

Power

Ghost Asuras had 'ultimate bodies' like Qiu Mujie. In addition to the half-finished dragon blood, the concentration of their blood was even higher than that of Yun Xiang. Even if they encountered a peak nine-star expert, they would not be defeated.

Unlike Qiu Mujie, who used the Battleship Fish to convert vital stones into endless energy, the Ghost Asuras couldn’t achieve perpetual regeneration. However, they compensated with the Vital Eating Pill, allowing them to rapidly recover strength—a groundbreaking and unnatural innovation. Each Ghost Asura also wore a spatial ring, likely filled with primordial cores to sustain their power.

Trivia

To control ghost Asuras with semi-finished bloodlines, you must have Luo Qingyun or others people, who has the real dragon blood.

According to
Zi Xiao Ji
, Lord
Wei Qing
 research on these ghost Asuras costs one-third of the sacred zone's annual budget.

It need quite a few of the ingredients to creat Ghost Asura, is the bodies of ancient beasts or even true spirits. To refine dragon blood, one must possess the bloodline of a Dragon.

Although they didn't have much intelligence, they still had the emotion of anger and killing.

Ghost King
==========

Appearance

Ghost King is more than 30 meters tall, like a giant spirit he had a green face and fangs, its huge mouth was as red as a basin of blood, and its eyes flickered with a sinister look.

Background

Ghost King It is said that it is the same kind of existence as
Ramayana
 an existence that has existed for a long time. In the past he made a bet with the leader of the Ancestor of the Jiuli tribe, Great Demon Zhi  and lost he then signed this unfair contract. That's why they can summon Ghost King with a certain amount of offerings. And he will contribute as much power as the summoner offer.

Plot

Having successfully severed Yi Fen’s last connection to Noah’s Ship, the Ghost King took full control of the legendary warship. However, his focus quickly shifted to Lin Yunxiao, whose growing power filled him with unease. Ignoring Long Qianmiao, who was extracting the power of the Heavenly Phoenix, the Ghost King furiously charged at Lin Yunxiao, roaring in disbelief, With a massive green palm print infused with the Light of Reincarnation, he struck down, shattering space itself. Yet, just as the attack was about to land, a barrier of golden and black runes emerged, blocking his devastating blow. Shocked, the Ghost King unleashed the Eternal Reincarnation Blade, its power surging through the Great Wheel of Samsara. Despite relentless slashes, the barrier held firm until it finally shattered—but not before Lin Yunxiao opened his eyes, revealing one golden and one black pupil.

A deep, primal fear gripped the Ghost King’s soul. Beads of sweat rolled down his forehead as two True Fiend Dharma Idols—one golden, one black—manifested behind Lin Yunxiao. Each had three heads and six arms, their expressions embodying both divine serenity and demonic wrath. As their power merged, they formed a towering Giant Spirit Dharmakaya, its arms wielding golden and black energy spheres. The Ghost King, refusing to accept defeat, unleashed his strongest strike, summoning the Wheel of Samsara and the Eternal Reincarnation Blade to cut down his foe. But the Giant Spirit Dharmakaya effortlessly blocked both attacks, shattering the blade’s energy into chaos. Fear twisted the Ghost King’s face as Lin Yunxiao made his final move—a black saber, descending from the golden-black nebula.

As the saber fell, space itself began to collapse.

The Ghost King, believing himself invincible, had executed his plans flawlessly, even obtaining Noah’s Ship. However, when faced with Lin Yunxiao, his power was meaningless. He unleashed the Reincarnation Light, an ultimate attack capable of erasing all existence. Yet, Yunxiao’s True Fiend Dharma Idol effortlessly countered it with the Aghan Bone Cleaver, a blade so powerful that it fractured time and space itself. The Ghost King’s strongest technique was shattered in moments, and the very world split in half from Yunxiao’s attack. Terrified, the Ghost King tried to flee, but the blade’s energy pursued him relentlessly.
He made a desperate final stand with Heaven Burning Moon, but his defenses crumbled instantly. Severely wounded and consumed by demonic energy, he collapsed, barely clinging to life. The once unstoppable ruler of Samsara was reduced to a powerless figure, struggling to survive.

The Ghost King attempted to ambush Lin Yunxiao, but it was a trap. Yunxiao had been expecting the attack and lured him in. He summoned the Aghan Bone Cleaver, now radiating golden light, and struck with overwhelming force. The Ghost King, realizing his mistake too late, tried to flee, but the saber strike was inescapable. His body swelled uncontrollably before violently exploding, scattering ghostly energy across the battlefield.

The shockwave injured many warriors, even forcing Wei Qing to spit blood. As the battlefield fell silent, it became clear—the Ghost King had been completely destroyed, his existence erased.

Power

The Ghost King is so powerful that even beings of divine transcendence cannot match him. Wei Qing states that to face the Ghost King, one would need more than eight Ghost Asuras or three experts of divine transcendence to have a chance against him. He even wields the Small Wheel Three-Phase Life Transformation Reincarnation Wheel—an ancient artifact of unparalleled power refined directly from the force of reincarnation. Although this profound weapon contains only a trace of the reincarnation rules, when activated with long preparation, it enables him to unleash 100% of his power already reached the God Realm without being suppressed or restricted by the Heavenly Martial Realm law.

Ghost King’s ultimate ability he can merging directly with
Great Wheel of Reincarnation
. A massive green skull appeared above him, its hollow eyes burning with eerie flames. As its mouth opened into a pitch-black void, it devoured the Thirty-Three Gongcao. By merging directly with the Wheel of Samsara, he could assimilate everyone trapped within its domain. Bathed in the light of reincarnation, they would be melted into pure energy, becoming his nourishment and strengthening him endlessly.

Gluttonous Snake
================

Gluttonous Snake, is a descendant of a true spirit with powerful spatial abilities. Its cultivation revolves entirely around endless consumption—it constantly devours everything in its path, as if it can never be full. As it eats, its body grows proportionally, and when it reaches a certain limit, the consumed matter condenses within it, forming an internal space of varying size and quality. Some of these internal spaces can be as vast as half a city, capable of housing millions of people. This ability makes the Gluttonous Snake an ideal refuge for hidden families or sects, allowing them to exist in secrecy within the creature’s body.

Trivia

the internal space of the snake is restricted by the rules.
Narcissus

Great Wheel of Reincarnation
============================

The Wheel of Reincarnation is a super-grade formation weapon, created to imitate the laws of Samsara (Reincarnation). Unlike ordinary mysterious weapons, which typically possess only one spirit, and even super-quality ones that may have two or three, this artifact contains thirty-three spirits known as the "Gong Cao". Each of these spirits was once a powerful god, their souls refined into the weapon to sustain its immense power.

However, true reincarnation is an elusive and unpredictable force, beyond the reach of even the most advanced formations or mysterious weapons. The creator of this artifact, despite their mastery, was unable to directly harness the power of reincarnation. As a result, they devised a formation where thirty-three powerful individuals acted as the core, channeling the laws of Samsara into the weapon.

Once activated, Wheel's greatest abilities is the power to create its own domain a projection of the true place of reincarnation, trapping numerous enemies inside and preventing them to escape and The power of reincarnation seeps into every being, suppressing not only living beings but even others Xuan weapons/Artifact. Those caught in its domain will find their strength rapidly drained, their very existence eroded by Samsara's power. A terrifying aspect of this artifact is its immortality effect. The Gongcao spirits, even after being slain, will revive as long as the Wheel of Reincarnation remains intact. This makes it an almost unstoppable force, as those who fall to its power will continuously resurrect, bound by the eternal cycle of reincarnation.

Trivia

With sufficient preparation, the Ghost King can use the Great Wheel of Reincarnation to bypass the laws of Heavenly Martial Arts, allowing him to unleash his full power without any restriction. Within the domain created by the Great Wheel of Reincarnation, he is completely unbound by external limitations, making him an overwhelming force.

Heavenscent Empire
==================

The Heavenscent Empire is the strongest among the three empires in the southern region of the Tianwu Continent. The most powerful organization of the empire isthe Thousand Crane Pavilion and its most prosperous city is the Qinghai Town.

Qinghai Town

Qinghai Town is a gathering place for more than half of the cultivators in the empire. Although it is called a small town, it is larger than ordinary cities, with a population of at least several tens of millions. It is renowned for its prosperity, ranking at the forefront within the country.

Heavenspan Island
=================

The
Mu Family
, one of the
Hidden Families
, resides on Tongtian Island, a massive and meticulously crafted man-made island located deep in the ocean. To reach it, one must pass through an endless fog infused with pink crystal dust, a natural spatial barrier that conceals the island from outsiders. Only those familiar with its intricacies, like Mu Zheng, can navigate through it successfully.

Once past the fog, Tongtian Island reveals itself as a thousand-acre expanse of breathtaking landscapes, shrouded in mist formed by abundant spiritual energy, giving it an ethereal, fairy-tale-like appearance. The island is a testament to generations of the Mu Family’s craftsmanship, with mountains, rivers, and lakes arranged in perfect harmony.{{r|1713}}

Unlike the Corpse Fiend Sect's Unmoving Return to the Forest, which was built atop the corpse of a giant turtle, Tongtian Island is a fully man-made marvel, constructed bit by bit by the Mu ancestors over centuries. While the eerie magic of the giant turtle makes the Corpse Fiend Sect’s base unique, Tongtian Island exudes grandeur, craftsmanship, and immense spiritual refinement.

The Mu Family takes immense pride in their puppetry and combat prowess, standing on par with the seven superpowers. Their defenses are nearly impenetrable, with the fog barrier serving as the first line of protection. Additionally, the island’s internal formations and spatial defenses are considered unparalleled, making it unnecessary to station guards outside.{{r|1714}}

Holy Region
===========

One of the two strongest human organizations of the world, and considered the de facto rulers of the Tianwu continent. Their word is law across the continent, with no power willingly defiant before them.

Background

About 100,000 years ago, during the final years of the

Sea of Soul Formation
. They can be reached either by teleportation arrays on the
Tianwu Continent
 or by tearing the space (Martial Sovereigns). Other than that, there are no ways to reach it.

The Blade of Judgment

The Blade of Judgment is an unknown-grade Xuan Artifact, enshrined as the Holy Region Absolute Punishment Weapon, The blade of judgement can only be used with the approval of three rulers.  The Blade of Judgment is a fearsome weapon of absolute destruction, wielded by the Sanctuary to maintain dominance over the world.

It is not an ordinary blade—it is a cursed weapon, forged from the blood and resentment of countless fallen experts.
For centuries, the Blade of Judgment has been used to execute the strongest warriors, absorbing their essence, grievances, and evil energy, making it stronger with each kill. The accumulated hatred and bloodlust within it have turned it into a terrifying force, capable of warping reality itself.
When unleashed, the blade engulfs the battlefield in an Asura-like purgatory, where the cries of the slain echo through the air. It strikes with unstoppable power, overwhelming even the most powerful beings, making them tremble in fear.

The magnitude of this Xuan Artifact power was first demonstrated in history during the Human vs Monster war at the Five Cloud Mountains, where Wei Qing, a
Divine Transcendent
, used the Weapon to its full power and nearly killed the King of Monsters,
Huang
, who was just one step away from reaching the
Primary Void Realm
, and who as a Monster possessed a physical body stronger than an ordinary Human. Therefore, it is obvious that it possesses more power than an ordinary Holy Artifact.

.

Hua Qianshu
, the first and most beloved disciple of
Gu Feiyang
, was once a determined and gifted martial artist. However, his struggle with his own limitations eventually led him down the path of
Demonic Cultivation
.

History

Hua Qianshu was once a talented martial artist and a disciple of
Gu Feiyang
. However, due to his limited talent, he struggled to break through to higher realms. Desperate to overcome his limitations, he turned to forbidden demonic cultivation.

Gu Feiyang, determined to save Hua Qianshu, sought a way to expel the demonic energy possessing him. After discovering a method in ancient records, he traveled to the East China Sea, where it was said a technique existed to purge demonic influence. However, this pursuit led to a massacre, as Gu Feiyang slaughtered countless people from
Eastern Sea
 and killed over 100
Martial Sovereigns
 while being hunted across the
Four Seas
 in his desperate attempt to find a cure.

Later, Hua Qianshu was approached by
Cangwu Qiong
 and
Ren Ximin
, who sought test subjects for their experiments in breaking the shackles of martial arts through demonic cultivation. Along with other martial artists who willingly became test subjects, Hua Qianshu ventured into the
Tiandang Mountains
 a place where the laws of the Demon Realm and the Tianwu Realm intertwined hoping to comprehend demonic power and achieve greater strength.

Knowing that his talent alone was insufficient, Hua Qianshu deliberately involved his master, Gu Feiyang, in the expedition to the Tiandang Mountains, This decision ultimately led to Gu Feiyang’s demise, causing Ren Ximin and Cang Wuqiong’s plan to fail.

Plot

After
Gu Feiyang
 death at the whims of Ren Xifan and
Cangwu Qiong
, Hua Qianshu became a
Martial Sovereign
 a few years later and began practicing Demonic Techniques under Cangwu Qiong command.

Later,
Ren Ximin
 gathered Hua Qianshu along with other subordinates to practice Demonic Techniques under the command of
Di Jia
 who became their Demonic Master, forcing them to become Di Jia Demon Slaves, which resulted in Hua Qianshu becoming Di Jia strongest subordinate.

Later, with Di Jia death at the hands of
Zhuo Kun
, a thread of Demonic Qi from Di Jia remains sailed into Hua Qianshu body and was refined by Hua Qianshu, who took possession of his connection to the
Heavenly Demonic Weapon
. This process freed Hua Qianshu mind.

Power

After venturing into the Tiandang Mountains, Hua Qianshu and twelve others obtained the power of the fallen True Spirits. Hua Qianshu inherited the power of the phoenix—though not the ancient phoenix, it still granted him divine fire. However, after his demonization, this divine fire was corrupted and transformed into a powerful demonic flame.

With the infusion of True Spirit power and their descent into demonic cultivation, Hua Qianshu and his companions experienced a significant surge in strength, surpassing that of ordinary Heaven-Control Realm warriors.

Hua Qing is not easily swayed by words and acts decisively, as seen in his immediate attempt to subdue Fei Ni and prevent her from reaching the Council of Elders. Though he has a straightforward and somewhat rigid personality, he is not inherently malicious. Fei Ni even notes that despite his stubbornness, he remains an upright person.

Plot

When Fei Ni returned to the Long family, he immediately confronted her, fully believing the accusations that she had colluded with Li Yunxiao and murdered the clan leader. Despite their past rivalry, he acknowledged her rapid growth in strength, Determined to prevent a "traitor" from approaching the Council of Elders, Hua Qing attempted to suppress Fei Ni, proposing to seal her energy before allowing her to proceed. However, Fei Ni outright refused, declaring that the Long family was on the brink of destruction and that she had no time for unnecessary battles. Undeterred, Hua Qing launched a fierce attack, believing that eliminating her was his duty.

His strike—a powerful slash from his greatsword—was utterly ineffective, cutting through empty air as Fei Ni effortlessly evaded. Shocked by her newfound mastery, Hua Qing barely had time to react before Fei Ni struck back, sending him flying with a devastating palm strike. The impact shattered his bones, leaving him horrified at the gap in their strength.

Five Cloud Mountain

Huang and Ai arrived at Five Cloud Mountain to fulfill the last wish of the past demon emperors, aiming to release their people who had been imprisoned for thousands of years. However, upon their arrival, they were confronted by
Li
 and High Priest
Ci
, who advised against breaking the seal. They warned that releasing the monsters before the monster race was united would lead to greater chaos.

Disagreeing with them, Huang attempted to eliminate Li and Ci, but as the conflict escalated, Li and Ci chose to retreat and avoid further confrontation.

After Xuan Hua arrived and was repelled by Huang, the Holy Region forces, led by Wei Qing and Hei Yuhu, came to the Five Cloud Mountain. Determined to eliminate the monster race once and for all, Wei Qing unleashed the Ruling Blade for the first time, engaging in a fierce clash with the Monster Emperor, Huang.

The impact of their battle was devastating, reducing the Thousand Mountains Prefecture to ruins. Huang suffered severe injuries, but Wei Qing pressed on, launching another attack. As Huang tried to defend himself, he transformed into his true form, exchanging another fierce blow. However, the Ruling Blade struck deep, its evil energy corroding Huang's body. Large portions of his flesh began to rot, forcing him back into his human form.

Though victorious, Wei Qing had reached his limit. The immense strain of wielding the Ruling Blade caused all his acupoints to explode, releasing clouds of blood mist from his body.

After this brutal exchange, both forces went all out, igniting a full-scale war.

In the all-out war between the monster and human races, the tide suddenly turned in favor of the humans with the arrival of reinforcements. Faced with this shift, Shang and Mo suggested a strategic withdrawal. However, Huang perceived this as betrayal. To assert his dominance and prove his power, he shockingly destroyed his own host beast, the Nandou Purple Deer, severing their bond to demonstrate his ruthless resolve.

Huang then revealed his breakthrough to the Void Extreme Divine Realm, solidifying his authority. He executed Ci, the high priest, without hesitation and gravely injured Shang, intending to imprison him and extract the secrets of the armillary sphere. Mo, witnessing Huang's merciless actions, was forced into submission.

With a new, powerful contract demonic beast integrated into his strength, Huang led the monster race in a final, desperate assault against the humans.

Power

Huang possesses an innate ability unique to his Heavenly Monster tribe, allowing him to share strength and magical powers with his host beast and even integrate with it. After reaching the Void Realm, he severed the bond with his original host and formed a new contract with Wu. This granted him the ability to unleash a black hole that devours not only his opponents' power but almost everything in its path.

Huangfu Bi
==========

Appearance

The figure had a dark complexion and two small gray mustaches on his upper lip. He looked like a wealthy country squire, but his eyes were fierce, as if lightning flashed in them.

Plot

Battle Soul Mountain

Huangfu Bi arrived at
Battle Soul Mountain
 alongside the elders of the Soul Devouring Sect, intent on eliminating and confronting
Myriad Stars Valley
 and its sect leader,
Tian Xingzi
. A fierce battle erupted between the two factions, with both sides suffering heavy losses. At first, Huangfu Bi seemed to gain the upper hand. He successfully eliminated Myriad Stars Valley’s vice sect leader, several elders, and even their general, pushing his enemies to the brink of collapse. However, just as victory appeared within his grasp, Tian Xingzi joined forces with Li Yunxiao, turning the tide of battle. The fierce counterattack nearly cost Huangfu Bi his life. At a critical moment, when he was on the verge of being slain by Li Yunxiao, he was saved by
Nanqiu Yu
, who intervened just in time to pull him from the jaws of death.

Five Cloud Mountain

Huangfu Bi, along with several Soul Devouring Sect elders, arrived at Five Cloud Mountain to aid in the war against the monster race. Attempting to stop Mo from absorbing thousands of fallen warriors, Huangfu Bi led a charge but was quickly outnumbered by powerful monsters,  Trapped and desperate, he fought fiercely as the three elders were torn to pieces around him. Left alone, Huangfu Bi slaughtered relentlessly, struggling to carve a path to escape.

Amid the chaos, Yunxiao and Beifeng launched a devastating combined attack, forcing Huangfu Bi into a desperate attempt to escape. However, Mo ambushed him. Despite merging with the Golden Speaker and defending with his Devouring Banner, Huangfu Bi's defense crumbled. His banner was destroyed, the Golden Speaker went berserk and devoured his soul, and Mo drained his blood essence, killing him instantly.

Power

Huangfu Bi, master of the Soul Devourer Sect, is a legendary figure known for his unmatched strength and eerie mastery of soul techniques.

Golden Speaker, also known as the Heaven-Grade Golden Soul, is Huangfu Bi’s powerful summoning technique. Upon its arrival, green flames burst from its eye sockets, exuding a shocking level of intelligence. Unlike ordinary main souls, which are fully controlled by their masters, Golden Speaker appears to act independently, standing as an equal to Huangfu Bi. This was no surprise to the elders of the Soul Devouring Sect, suggesting a deeper truth—once a main soul reaches the heavenly grade, it may develop its own wisdom and consciousness.
 Gold speaker was completely different from ordinary gold souls. Golden speaker was completely independent individuals. When the soul devouring banner was cultivated to the highest level, it would be the primary soul of heaven, earth, black, and yellow. The Golden speaker was an existence that transcended these four levels. Moreover, it had been passed down from generation to generation in the soul devouring sect. It was impossible to cultivate it to this level by relying on one's own strength.

The Soul Fighting Technique is one of the core secret arts of the Soul Devouring Sect. It focuses on harnessing and weaponizing the power of the soul in battle, allowing the user to engage in direct combat with soul energy. Unlike the Soul Devouring Banner, which is used to capture and absorb souls, the Soul Fighting Technique is purely an offensive martial technique designed for soul-to-soul combat. Huangfu Bi's ability to combine both techniques is unprecedented, making him an anomaly within the Soul Devouring Sect and giving him an edge over other practitioners

The Pangu Banner is a legendary artifact of the Soul-Devouring Sect, passed down through generations of sect leaders. Rather than forging their own Soul-Devouring Banner, each leader inherits the Pangu Banner and uses it to absorb the previous one. Within the banner exists a vast internal world, containing the sun, moon, and flowing rivers—granting it immense power, even though it is not a true holy weapon.

The Cloud Dancing Wind Art is a high-level martial technique that harnesses the power of wind and movement to create overwhelming force and agility in battle. It is likely a technique that combines speed, unpredictability, and destructive power, resembling the natural flow of clouds and the fierce movement of storms.

Soul battle technique-Dragonfish transformation. The Golden speaker instantly became one with him and struck down with an incantation seal.

Trivia

In 50 Years he is the only person ever to cross War Soul Mountain near
Jiangyu City
 and return alive.

He was the most hated person by all the magic practitioners in the world Because his specialized in extracting people's souls.

Chu Yu
 and
Xin Pi

When
Li Yunxiao
 arrives at Mingxin Lake with the Tiger King Chariot, he attracts attention and is met with hostility from some participants. Chu Yu's guard, a burly man with a Rank Five warhammer, confronts Li Yunxiao aggressively, resulting in a clash between them.

He then triggers an explosion with the Tiger King Chariot, causing a massive display of power. Chu Yu and Xin Pi both intervene to prevent the situation from escalating into a battle between Martial Emperors.

Huo Sen plays a role in diffusing the tension and advising them to focus on the competition for the slots. However, he also shows admiration for Li Yunxiao's audacity and wishes to see if the young man's life can withstand such bold actions.

Huo Sen is cautious about the possibility of trouble and warns that if anything untoward happens, there are thousands of people present who might retaliate against Chu Yu and Xin Pi. His remark serves as a warning to maintain peace during the competition.

Later, Chu Yu's dark expression hints at a scheme involving
Luo Qingyun

The Blue Jewel Academy

Gu Feiyang was reborn in Li Yunxiao's body from the Tianshui Kingdom, in his first appearance, dazzling all his classmates. He knew twelve other ways to craft an ordinary mysterious weapon in addition to the thirty-six methods written down by Yang Di…

The Zhou Great Family Crisis Arc

Yunxiao provokes the Zhou Great Family and demands an immediate fight with
Zhou Yushan
, but
Zhou Yangbiao
 states that the fight will take place in seven days when his son is out of seclusion. Yunxiao refuses to trust the healing medicine given by Zhou Yangbiao and asks for an alchemist to verify its safety.
Baili Gongjin
, the president of the
Duskflame Empire
's Alchemist Association, steps forward to examine the medicine and expresses his astonishment at Yunxiao's abilities. This further angers Zhou Yangbiao, who feels humiliated by the turn of events.

Yunxiao accuses the Zhou Great Family of attempting to poison him, causing a stir among the onlookers. Baili Gongjin, an esteemed alchemist, examines the pill and confirms it is indeed poisonous. However, Zhou Bo, the seventh elder of the Zhou family, volunteers to test the pill and ends up dying from the poison. The shocking turn of events leaves the crowd in disbelief. Zhou yangbiao, enraged by the accusation and the death of Zhou Bo, confronts Yunxiao, but their confrontation is interrupted by the appearance of the Green Phoenix Floating Battleship, a massive and intimidating presence.

Yunxiao claims to possess the powerful Green Phoenix Floating Battleship, causing shock and fear among the crowd. The Martial Emperor Supreme elder
Zhou Changfa
 of the Zhou family confront Yunxiao, demanding the warship's surrender. In response, Yunxiao threatens to self-destruct the warship, causing panic.
Xin Pi
 and his companions intervene, offering to mediate and prevent the destruction. Yunxiao reluctantly agrees, but as the warship stops, Zhou Changfa, the Supreme Elder of the Zhou family, attacks Yunxiao with a powerful killing intent.

Yunxiao is confronted by Zhou Changfa, who launches a powerful attack. Yunxiao manages to block the attack using a talisman, surprising everyone present. He then swiftly rushes towards the Green Phoenix Floating Battleship, intending to activate its self-destruction. Xin Pi and others plead with Yunxiao to stop and offer to mediate. Yunxiao agrees, but continues to threaten the self-destruction. He eventually lands on the warship and demands the release of
Qin Ruxue
, compensation, and an end to the hiding of the Zhou family in the duel. Zhou Changfa agrees to the last condition but refuses the other demands.

Yunxiao threatens to activate the self-destruction of the Green Phoenix Floating Battleship and the six-universe Star Observation formation. Xin Pi, on behalf of the Zhou family, agrees to Yunxiao's demands to prevent the destruction. Qin Ruxue is released, and Yunxiao demands compensation of 55 million mid-grade primordial stones. He also warns the Zhou family not to hide in the duel. Yunxiao takes Qin Ruxue and leaves on the battleship. Zhou Changfa and the Zhou family express anger and resentment towards Yunxiao. Meanwhile, Yunxiao acknowledges and thanks several individuals, including
Wang Chen
,
Cheng Feng
,
Mo Zhai
, and Baili Gongjin. Leaving them in the midst of accusations from both Zhou Changfa and his Zhou Great Family.

Destroying
Zhou Yushan
 Arc

Li Yunxiao arrives at the arena with a powerful Martial Grandmaster level demonic beast, stunning everyone. Many had bet against him but now fear his advantage. Some speculate that he used a pill to control the beast temporarily. The Zhou family accuses him of cheating, demanding proof of his beast-taming abilities. Li Yunxiao demonstrates his control over the demonic beast, making it obey his commands, silencing the accusers and impressing the crowd. Later, He names it "Mountain Splitting, Jade Devouring." The Zhou family accuses him of cheating in the duel.
Xin Pi
 tries to mediate, but Li Yunxiao demands compensation to put away the beast. Later, he didn't fight with it as an exchange for Sixty Million Mid-Grade Primal Stones.

In the duel, Li Yunxiao shows incredible agility and physical strength, surprising everyone with his
Heavenly Tyrant Body Tempering Technique
. He neutralizes the Martial King Zhou Yushan's powerful strike and counterattacks with his own sword technique, demonstrating exceptional comprehension and skill. Li Yunxiao also delivers a humiliating slap to Zhou Yushan's face, asserting his dominance in the battle. His performance garners admiration and fear from the spectators, making
Xin Ruyu
 view him as a formidable rival.
Leng Hongling
 remains composed and suggests that Zhou Yushan should still have an advantage if Li Yunxiao relies solely on body techniques.

Later, Zhou Yushan activates the Fifth Layer of the Forgotten Love Heavenly Book, which impresses
Zhou Changfa
 and others as it fulfills the condition for him to marry
Leng Hongling
. He wields the Cold Moon Sword, a powerful Sixth-Tier Xuan Artifact, displaying an overwhelming aura and releasing moonlight that threatens to crush Li Yunxiao. However, Li Yunxiao remains calm and recites poetry, appreciating the Cold Moon Sword's craftsmanship. He skillfully controls the Tiger Tooth Sword, which is eventually shattered by the Wugou Frost. Despite the significant power difference, Li Yunxiao showcases remarkable skill and control, handling the dangerous situation with ease, leaving everyone astonished by his abilities and calm demeanor.

Later. He used the Dusty World Seal, and later the enhanced Heaven and Earth Seal, he counters Zhou Yushan's powerful attacks and withstands the impact. While Zhou Yushan's fate is uncertain after the collision, Li Yunxiao emerges unscathed and confidently challenges his opponent, displaying his dominance and ability to survive even against powerful adversaries. The onlookers are left in awe of his abilities, leading to speculations especially
Xin Pi
,
Baili Gongjin
 and
Yuan Hao
 about his background and potential connections to Gu Feiyang.

Later, Li Yunxiao effortlessly neutralizes Zhou's powerful strike using his "One-Finger Flower Pinch" technique. He then subdues Zhou Yushan, defeating him without killing him, and challenges anyone who dares to provoke him in the future. However,
Jiang Wuji
, a Two-Star Martial Grandmaster, interferes and tries to attack Li Yunxiao. Li Yunxiao uses a soul attack to make Jiang Wuji kneel before him, astonishing everyone present. A few breaths later, Yunxiao killed Jiang Wuji and Zhou Yushan with The
World God Monument
. In moment of terror and anger,
Jiang Wuwei
 and
Zhou Yangbiao
 prepare to attack Yunxiao with all thier might as a Two-Star Martial Grandmaster and a Nine-Star Martial Grandmaster respectively. But a green flame is unleashed in front of Yunxiao to protect him from their combined assault.

it was the Three-Star Martial Emperor
Duan Yue
 who intervenes with the Earthy Green Lotus Fire, scaring off Zhou Yangbiao and Jiang Wuwei. Leng Hongling confronts Li Yunxiao but is unable to take back the WuGou Frost Snow Sword. Li Yunxiao demands one billion middle-grade Spirit Stones from Xin Pi, to settle the matter. Xin Pi handles the situation calmly and cunningly, leaving everyone amazed at his audacity and intelligence. He also shows no sympathy for Zhou Yangbiao's punishment, further impressing the others with his cold and ruthless nature. The Zhou Great Family suffers a significant blow to their reputation after Zhou Yushan death and Zhou Yangbiao's punishment.

Duskflame's Alchemist Association

Li Yunxiao challenges three Rank-Four Lord-Grade Alchemist masters –
Xin Ze
,
Lu Haochu
, and
Ge Xiangqian
 – to a high-stakes duel, displaying arrogance that offends them. The alchemists, offended yet intrigued, accept the challenge and offer their most prized treasures as gambling stakes. Xin Ze presents a
seventh-tier Cosmic Sun Note Jade
, enhancing alchemical refining. Lu Haochu offers a
Heavenly Flame Battle Flag
, and Ge Xiangqian stakes a pair of
Purple Cloud Centipede Wings
.

When Ge Xiangqian becomes angry about Li Yunxiao's contempt for his pair of Purple Cloud Centipede Wings,
Yuan Hao
 expresses his desire for the wings, offering to pay up to 60 million mid-grade primal stones for them. Li Yunxiao then includes the wings as part of the gambling stakes.

Throughout the confrontation, Xin Ze is visibly angry and irritated by Li Yunxiao's dismissive attitude towards his treasures and insistence on betting with primal stones. He questions Li Yunxiao's understanding of the value of the seventh-tier Cosmic Sun Note Jade and tries to argue that it is worth much more than the proposed 50 million primal stones. Later,
Baili Gongjin
 expresses an offer to pay up to 50 million mid-grade primal stones for it. Li Yunxiao then includes the wings as part of the gambling stakes.

To everyone's astonishment, Li Yunxiao claims that someone will bring the 100 million mid-grade primal stones for the gambling bet soon. Xin Ze, initially skeptical, is proven wrong when his brother,
Xin Pi
, arrives and hands over the 100 million mid-grade primal stones as promised. Despite the disbelief and shock from the other alchemist masters, Their confidence in winning the bet is gradually shaken as he observes Li Yunxiao's demeanor, which shows deep certainty of victory against the three of them.

As the competition begins, Li Yunxiao surprises everyone by suggesting that each of the three alchemist masters will condense one primal stone, while he alone will condense two primal stones simultaneously. His mastery of refining techniques, including the Twelve Forms of Flying Flower and Falling Snow, amazes. Li Yunxiao's adept use of the Scripture of Rippling Mirage, a mysterious technique, adds to the astonishment.

As the alchemists compete, Li Yunxiao maintains superior refinement and control, advancing his primal stone beyond the others. He unveils a technique called the "Scripture of Rippling Mirage," impressing even Baili Gongjin. Li Yunxiao consistently demonstrates mastery, impressing Baili Gongjin.

Just when it seemed like Li Yunxiao was about to win, Xin Ze decided to risk it all and swallowed a valuable rank seven beast soul pellet, "Purple Qi from the East," which significantly boosted his soul power. With renewed strength, he successfully advanced his primal stone to the supreme-grade level, surpassing Li Yunxiao's pseudo-supreme grade.

In the final stages, Li Yunxiao pushes his primal stone beyond supreme-grade, borrowing power from the
Kunwu Divine Tree
's sapling. He creates the Innate Primordial Elixir, astonishing the alchemists. Witnessing Li Yunxiao's exceptional skill and demeanor, the alchemists, including his opponents, are left deeply impressed, kneeling in respect and admiration for his prowess.

Qionghua Island Arc

Leng Quan
 encounter

Li Yunxiao encountered
Leng Quan
, who had set up the Rain Element Formation, one of the seven strongest elemental formations, on Qionghua Island. Li Yunxiao recognized the formation and demanded the formation diagram from Leng Quan, claiming he planned to merge the seven elemental formations into one.

To understand the power of the Rain Element Formation, Li Yunxiao tested his strength against Leng Quan in a fierce battle. Despite Leng Quan's higher cultivation, Li Yunxiao's true qi advantage cracked Leng Quan's fists and caused him to bleed. However, Leng Quan concealed other disciples within the formation to maintain its effectiveness.

Li Yunxiao surprised Leng Quan by detecting the hidden disciples and revealed that he also practiced Water-based martial techniques. He unleashed the "Water Dragon's Song," inspired by observing a water snake, but Leng Quan countered with his "Azure Tyrant Palm."

Leng Quan challenged Li Yunxiao to face the combined strength of five Martial Grandmasters, and the battle intensified. Li Yunxiao used the power of the
World God Monument
 to break Leng Quan's water-based entanglements and employed the "Great Boundary God Art," overwhelming Leng Quan and his disciples.

Leng Quan and his team surrendered after being overwhelmed by Li Yunxiao's strength. Reluctantly, Leng Quan handed over the crystals and the Rain Barrier formation map to Li Yunxiao. However, he was left puzzled and frustrated by the unexpected appearance of a sea of flames during the battle. The enforcement members were also astonished by the turn of events and the outcome of the battle.

Luo Qingyun
 encounter

Later, He engaged in a fierce battle with
Luo Qingyun
, utilizing powerful martial skills like the "Sword Art - Star Annihilation" with the Frosty Brightness of Wu Gou to counter Luo Qingyun's "Universal Art - Return to Ruins."

During their clash, Luo Qingyun revealed the power of the Spirit Heaven Ring, which could create a potent mental attack through the sound of the copper ring. This attack affected many on the island, leaving them entranced, and even Li Yunxiao struggled to resist it due to his Martial Lord cultivation level.

The battle between Li Yunxiao and Luo Qingyun escalated, with both displaying extraordinary techniques and martial prowess. Luo Qingyun transformed into an ancient dragon using the Soaring Dragon Body technique, while Li Yunxiao unleashed the Great Illusory Fist, creating a distorted space filled with illusions.

Their intense battle created an independent domain-like space, showcasing their mastery of martial techniques beyond their cultivation levels. Luo Qingyun summoned a true dragon's shadow using the "Dragon's Dominion Four Extremes" divine technique, and Li Yunxiao responded with his own phoenix shadow, using a powerful sword technique that cut through the dragon's body, causing an explosive force that created a black hole above Qionghua Island. The tremendous power from the battle affected Mingxin Lake, causing massive waves and elemental energy fluctuations, catching the attention of
Xin Pi
 and
Huo Sen
, though they couldn't interfere due to the rules.

After surviving the intense battle, Luo Qingyun suffered severe injuries and fell into the sea. Li Yunxiao, who had planned an escape route, hid in the depths of the sea to avoid the devastating attack that reshaped the land into a vast sea. Although Luo Qingyun harbored hatred and humiliation, he couldn't resist Li Yunxiao's overpowering strength, and Li Yunxiao decided not to push further, conserving his strength.

Li Yunxiao collected some of Luo Qingyun's blood and emerged victorious in the competition with over a thousand crystal stones. The remaining 132 crystal stones couldn't be found due to the damaged array, leading to the decision to activate the teleportation array to send everyone back.

Later, Li Yunxiao announced his plan to auction entry quotas to the Veiled Desolation in Flame Martial City. Although this decision astonished some participants, including
Fang De
 and even
Xin Pi
, who already knew it.

Leng Xingbo
 encounter

Li Yunxiao encountered
Leng Xingbo
, the Lord of Emotion Severing Mountain, on the foot of a mountain. Leng Xingbo was a formidable expert at the Eight Disolates Martial Supreme Realm. Leng Xingbo had come to reclaim his treasured sword, the Wu Gou Frosty Brilliance Sword, which Li Yunxiao had won during his duel on the Golden Crow Arena.

Despite Leng Xingbo's intimidating presence, Li Yunxiao remained calm and engaged in a casual conversation with him. Leng Xingbo praised Li Yunxiao's courage and even considered taking him as his disciple and betrothing his daughter,
Hong Ling
, to him. However, Li Yunxiao declined the offer, revealing that he was responsible for the death of Hong Ling's husband.

When Leng Xingbo retrieved the Wu Gou Frosty Brilliance Sword, he felt something was amiss as the sword had lost its brilliance and spirit. Li Yunxiao explained that the sword had found its best destination and died without regrets, conveying emotions despite being an unfeeling sword. Leng Xingbo was deeply moved by this realization and achieved a breakthrough, breaking through a long-standing bottleneck in his cultivation.

As a reward, Leng Xingbo decided to betroth his daughter, Hong Ling, to Li Yunxiao. However, Li Yunxiao, feeling overwhelmed, proposed holding an auction in three days in Flame Martial City, where Leng Xingbo could bring Hong Ling to find a suitable son-in-law.

After their conversation, Leng Xingbo left, and Li Yunxiao continued on his journey, pondering the need for valuable weapons beyond the Wu Gou Frosty Brilliance Sword and the Realm God Stele, and headed towards Flame Martial City on a green wolf battle chariot.

The Mount Meru
 Arc

Upon the opening of the Sumeru Mountain Secret Realm above
Martial Flame City
, Yunxiao took control of the arrays, laid out by the experts, which were originally intended to only let people in who obtained or purchased the
quota crystal
.

In order to enter, one had to pay a fee to Li Yunxiao to get entry into the secret Realm. After entering the Secret Realm, he let
Luo Yunshang
 out of the
World God Monument
 and left it behind to absorb the dense spirit Qi. Shortly after, Yunxiao caught a "little green demon" and gave it Luo Yunshang and taught her how to control it (its strong point is high agility).

Shortly after, they discover people fighting a
Stone Beast
. While fighting it, the Stone Beast advances from the Martial Grandmaster to the Martial Emperor Realm. Because of that, the people decide to run away. While escaping, Yunxiao and the others come across a bunch of people who fight for a seven constellation
Dao Fruit
. Luo Yunshang manages to snatch it with the help of the little green demon.

Before people can get agitated about it, the Stone Beast manages to catch up. Sitting in the same boat, the people join forces to take it down. After destroying the Stone Beast's physical body, its "heart" remains, which allows it to recover its body again. Before that happens, Yunxiao manages to subdue it.

After that,
Wang Qiang
, whom Yunxiao saved from the little green demon previously, takes Luo Yunshang hostage in an attempt to get the Dao Fruit. However, before Yunxiao can make a move, a passage opens and swallows all people present. Yunxiao enters it as well and finds himself in a passage. Wandering in the passage, he finds
Tadpole-Like Characters
 on the walls, similar to those of his
Godly Evolution Technique
 and
Godly Realm Technique
. He manages to activate those characters, which opens up another passage.

Following the passage his Qi greatly increases, and he breaks through several stars, furthermore some
mysterious energy
 accumulates in his dantian. At the end of the passageway, he finds a jade platform with a
golden sword
 on it. After taking it, he arrives inside the so-called Soaring Heaven Palace, which gives massive benefits according to legends. Meanwhile, the other people who got swallowed by the passage, but didn't activate the characters, arrive outside the Soaring Heaven Palace where many other people are also gathered. There, Ding Ling'er is also in the crowd and manages to free the hostage taken Luo Yunshang from Wang Qiang.

Ding Ling'er gets into a quarrel with Tang Yuan, who tries to pursue her, but Qian Wudi interferes. After that, they discover Yunxiao coming out of the Divine Palace, only a barrier separating the two parties. Yunxiao brings the people to humiliate Tang Yuang in exchange for opening up the barrier.

After entering the Palace, they arrive in a hall. In order to go deeper inside, they have to open a sealed stone door. Managing to solve some arrays the door opens up, however without bypassing the dragon pressure one cannot enter. Yunxiao, who obtained
Luo Qingyun
's blood (in previous arcs) can enter together with Ding Ling'er and Luo Yunshang without problems since the blood contains a trace of the dragon's bloodline. Arriving in a hall, the three meet a Demon Dragon Soul who turns out to be Gu Feiyang's sword spirit. At that moment,
Luo Yunshang
 and
Ding Ling'er
 also learn of Yunxiao's real identity.

The
Demon Dragon
 having a grudge with Yunxiao tries to kill the latter. Yunxiao and the two women flee out of the hall, the people still being outside follow up and flee together with Yunxiao. After a short time, the Demon Dragon manages to catch up. Yunxiao and the others, forced to fight him, suppress the Dragon Soul and try to capture it. Getting beaten up, the Dragon flees back to the Palace and hides.

Yunxiao who chased the Demon Dragon back to the Palace manages to convice the latter to once again become his sword spirit. Yunxiao learns that the Soaring Heaven Palace, he previously was in, only is a "reflection" of the original one. The entrance to the real Palace is at the bottom of the sea of qi nearby. To open the gates to the real palace, he uses the
golden sword
, which he previously obtained in the passageway, as a key. Before entering, five people appear, who turn out to be disciples from the
Seven Major Forces
. who were also waiting for the palace to open. Li Yunxiao allowed them to go ahead and lead the way.

They encountered various challenges, including petrified obstacles, a bridge with a Divine Sense barrier, and a powerful Gravity Formation caused by
Living Soil
. During the confrontation with
Cao Yaxing
's group, Li Yunxiao was able to obtain a
purple cauldron
, which seemed to be of higher value than the five Nine-Rank Profound Artifacts found in the inner hall. This choice surprised and impressed the others, leading to tensions and confrontations over the remaining treasures.

Inside the inner hall, they faced
Liu Yongheng
, who was possessed by a mysterious and powerful entity named
Di Jia
. The possession caused chaos, and Liu Yongheng's true strength remained a mystery. As they fought for the treasures and the Living Soil, Di Jia displayed overwhelming power, defeating many members of the group.

Li Yunxiao and Luo Qingyun tried to resist Di Jia's power, but their efforts seemed futile. Di Jia revealed that their energies were effective against the Black Demon Qi, but not strong enough to overcome it. Despite the dire situation, Li Yunxiao encouraged the group to work together and find a way to defeat Di Jia.

During the battle,
Xu Qing
 used a technique to make a
Martial Sovereign
's divine consciousness descend to suppress the Black Demon Shadow temporarily. In a desperate attempt,
Lu Daozi
 and the others managed to escape through a hole created by Lu Daozi's Martial Sovereign equal-attack, leaving Di Jia weakened and frustrated.

Li Yunxiao and Luo Qingyun used the Heavenly Spiritual Ring to escape the inner hall, and the Soaring Heaven Palace's defenses opened, causing the inner hall to collapse and create a massive whirlpool at the bottom of the sea. Many corpses were left in the aftermath of the intense battle.

Martial Flame City
 Crisis Arc

Qi Feng
 confronted
Li Yunxiao
, who was refining the Rank Nine Mysterious Artifacts in the
World God Monument
. Qi Feng wanted Li Yunxiao to accompany him to the Sanctuary to explain certain matters, including the destruction of the Constellation Sect's branch in
Qinghai Town
. Li Yunxiao refused and a fierce battle ensued. Despite Li Yunxiao's efforts, he was outmatched by the Martial Supreme Qi Feng, who used powerful martial arts and even summoned a Fleeting Life Seal. However, Li Yunxiao's ancient bell, a Ninth Rank magical artifact, shattered the Fleeting Life Seal, impressing Qi Feng with his strength and luck. Qi Feng eventually chose to leave without further pursuing the matter.

Star Constellation Old Monster
, arrived at Yanwu City to seek revenge for the destruction of his Star Constellation Sect's branch and the killing of his people. He demanded that Li Yunxiao, the culprit, reveal himself. However, nobody dared to admit it. The Old Monster threatened to kill everyone in the city if Li Yunxiao didn't show himself. Li Yunxiao responded arrogantly from the City Lord's Mansion, insulting and challenging the Old Monster.

Infuriated, the Old Monster unleashed a powerful aurora attack, which Li Yunxiao valiantly attempted to defend against using a series of powerful techniques and defensive arrays. Despite Li Yunxiao's efforts, the aurora's overwhelming power proved too much for him, and he was ultimately knocked into the ground, leaving the city in awe of the Old Monster's might. However, Li Yunxiao's bold defiance and refusal to be intimidated impressed many in the city, including some Constellation Sect members who secretly admired his bravery.

Li Huachi
, also known as Heavenly Zither Martial Sovereign, one of the
Ten Supreme Martial Sovereigns
, arrived on the scene and sided with Li Yunxiao, leaving everyone in awe of his presence and protection over Yanwu City. Li Huachi's appearance shifted the situation in the city, as he used his zither to effortlessly neutralize the Old Monster's attacks and defeated him with ease. Li Huachi then protected Yanwu City and chased away the Constellation Sect disciples who had fled in fear.

Later,
Yao Jinliang
, another Titled Martial Sovereign, and
Wei Qing
, a mysterious figure, arrived in Yanwu City searching for the Meng siblings. Li Huachi confronted them and refused to let them take the siblings. Wei Qing used his divine will to communicate through his demonic beast, Kun Nu, and Li Huachi threatened to kill Wei Qing's divine will if they acted recklessly.

Eventually, Li Huachi agreed to help find the Meng siblings to prevent the destruction of the southern region, and he put all the people below to sleep for three days with a tune. After the incident, the
Holy Region
 issued an iron law prohibiting anyone other than people from the Southern Region from interfering in Yanwu City's matters.

Light Song Forest
 Arc

Hai Lin
 encounter

Li Yunxiao and his companions find themselves in the Demon Origin Plains after a teleportation mishap. They encounter a merchant group led by
Hai Lin
, who has a chronic illness. Li Yunxiao's alchemy skills gain their trust. They seek a cure for Hai Lin's illness caused by a demonic beast's bloodline power.

Li Yunxiao suggests three ways to cure Hai Lin: hunting powerful demonic beasts, finding the Eternal Evergreen Tree, or Quintet Spirit Devouring Rats. They head to the Light Song Forest, facing chaos and violence. They encounter and fight off a huge group of The Quintet Spirit Devouring Rats under an illusion attack.

Li Yunxiao uses his skills to control and weaken the Spirit Rats. The caravan breaks through, heading back to the Light Song Forest. They encounter a Seven Constellation Realm Rank-7 Demonic Beast summoned by
Gu Yuesheng
. After trapping the beast, they gain power from starlight.

Later, Li Yunxiao confront Gu Yuesheng and
Situ Heng
, from the
Skull Mercenary Group
, and defeat them.
Duan Yue
, also joined the fight. The caravan regroups and heads back to the Singing Forest, facing minor threats. They reach the city safely and plan to report their mission's outcome.

Hai Beifei
 Encounter

Li Yunxiao is approached by Hai Beifei, who seeks his help to save his son Hai Lin. Hai Lin's bloodline power is uncontrollable, and a method exists to suppress it, but it would strip the person of their divine body cultivation. Hai Beifei offers Li Yunxiao the position of eighth team captain in their mercenary group and assistance in his formula path if he sacrifices his divine body to help Hai Lin.

Li Yunxiao suspects that Hai Beifei would have forcibly taken his divine body's power if he hadn't rescued Hai Lin and the group. He confronts Hai Beifei, refusing the offer and warning against forcing him into such a situation. After witnessing Li Yunxiao's strength and his unique divine body and demonic flame, Hai Beifei becomes cautious. Li Yunxiao intends to train in the Ancient Desolate Lands and seeks information on reaching there. Hai Beifei reveals that the only entrance is through the rare Eternal Evergreen Tree, since the Ancient Desolate Lands located in Outer Space.

Realizing the significance of the tree, Li Yunxiao and Hai Beifei decide to work together to find the Eternal Evergreen Tree to enable Li Yunxiao's entry into the Ancient Desolate Lands. In return, Li Yunxiao promises to help Hai Lin with his bloodline issue once they obtain the wood element essence from the tree. Hai Beifei makes Li Yunxiao the captain of the eighth team in the rookie mercenary group during the search for the Eternal Evergreen Tree, allowing Li Yunxiao access to more resources and support from the group.

Mr Yu
 encounter

He engages in a fierce battle against
Li Yunxiao
 in an underground space. The confrontation escalates as they exchange powerful blows, with Li Yunxiao utilizing his divine body's abilities to counter Master Yu's attacks. During the fight, Master Yu recognizes Li Yunxiao's strong
Divine Body
. This leads to a tense exchange where Li Yunxiao demands to know Master Yu's identity. The battle showcases Master Yu's exceptional strength and his use of the half power of a Rank Nine weapon, pushing Li Yunxiao to his limits and highlighting the vast power disparity between them.

Li Yunxiao employs his Heavenly Spirit Ring to defend against Master Yu's rank nine sword attack, only for Master Yu to reveal his remote control over the sword, leading to the destruction of Li Yunxiao's Spirit Ring. Li Yunxiao then relies on his
World God Monument
 to withstand the assault. As the battle continues, Li Yunxiao surprises Master Yu with his mental attack abilities. A mental showdown ensues, where Li Yunxiao's World God Monument and mental strength confront Master Yu's Tail Light Sword and mental domain. Despite Li Yunxiao's resilient display, he eventually retreats under the overwhelming might of Master Yu. The conflict intensifies as Li Yunxiao summons
Duan Yue
, a
stone beast
 and employs the True Phoenix Fire, only to be thwarted by Master Yu's resilience. The situation becomes even more dire as Li Yunxiao escapes into his Universe God Monument for safety, leaving the outcome of this formidable clash unresolved.

Later, Master Yu successfully activates a powerful formation known as the Cloudy Sky Crystal Enchantment. He releases three Legendary Monsters. With great effort and sacrifice, Master Yu manages to break the Cloudy Sky Crystal Enchantment, releasing the three monsters encased in a transparent sphere. Despite his depletion, Master Yu uses his remaining energy to guide the monsters out of the formation and collapses afterward.

Meanwhile, within the Universe God Monument, Li Yunxiao regains consciousness and communicates with a stone beast that informs him about the events in the outside world. Upon learning that the Great Demons have been released, Li Yunxiao initially worries, but he is reassured by
Genryu
 that the monsters' power will likely be greatly diminished after so many years. Li Yunxiao then discovers a white fog emanating from the cave, which contains pure energy. He uses the Single Energy of Creation technique to absorb this energy, aiding in his recovery from his injuries.

Noah's Ark
 Born Arc

Ye Fan
 Encounter

Li Yunxiao confronts a group of individuals from the Sacred Fire Temple, led by a young man named Yi Fan, Tao Guan, Feng Zhu and Qi Guang. The Sacred Fire Temple is seeking the Yang Key, a treasure linked to Noah's Ark, and believes that the key is with them. Li Yunxiao cleverly takes Yi Fan hostage, forcing Tao Guan, Feng Zhu and Qi Guang into a tense negotiation. Li Yunxiao demands cooperation and information in exchange for Yi Fan's safety.

During the discussion, they tentatively agree to cooperate, aiming to rescue Tang Jie, take Yang Key and locate Noah's Ark. However, an explosion disrupts their conversation, leading to speculation about Tang Jie's rescue and the involvement of various factions.

As they observe the chaos,
Zou Chen
 offers his Time-fixing Plate to assist the crowd in tracking auras. Zou Chen uses the Time-fixing Plate to trace a lead to the east of the Demon Plains, where Noah's Ark might be located. Li Yunxiao's group proposes a plan to intercept the Skeleton Mercenary Group, discovering a teleportation array within their headquarters. They activate it and arrive in the Demon Plain, while other factions continue their pursuit of Noah's Ark.

After teleporting to the Demon Plain, Li Yunxiao's group discusses their encounter with the Skeleton Mercenary Group. The conversation shifts to
Ye Nantian
's notes about breaking through to the Divine Realm. Li Yunxiao seeks to view the notes, leading to a deal: he helps them obtain Noah's Ark in exchange for access to the notes. Tension arises when
Feng Zhu
 challenges Li Yunxiao's skills. Suddenly, the legendary creature "
Wu
" appears behind Li Yunxiao, leaving the group awestruck. The Wu enters its own body and disappears, a rare and enigmatic event that emphasizes the rarity and significance of the encounter.

Continuing their journey, the group finds a preserved corpse of a powerful Martial Supreme killed by
Young Master Hao Lian
. Concerns about Hao Lian's motives arise. Dark clouds gather, signaling the arrival of forces from other territories. Three formidable warships, two Rank 7 Golden Sun Warships and a Rank 8 Netherworld Warship, appear in the sky.  Amidst the warships,
Xuan Bing
 commands an attack from formidable warships, forcing Li Yunxiao's group to narrowly escape. Amidst the battle, the Imperial Bell emerges, withstanding attacks.
Feng Zhu
 and
Qi Guang
 join, using “Holy Skill” techniques to clash with Xuan Bing. The World God Monument appears and causes a warship to sink, leading to chaos.

Li Yunxiao suppresses the Netherworld Warship using the
World God Monument
, causing it to sink irreparably. Xuan Bing and his forces are left in shock and desperation over the loss of the two warships. Interrogating captives, they learn about involvement from the Feather Frost Sect, led by Martial Sovereign. The group continues its quest cautiously, sensing hostile auras ahead. Investigating the strange death of an eighth-rank Soul-shattering Tapir, the possibility of a Peak Martial Sovereign's presence raises concerns, as their pursuit of Noah's Ark could be threatened. Despite the fear and uncertainty, the members of the Sacred Fire Temple reaffirm their determination to continue their quest for Noah's Ark. They are motivated by their ancestral legacy and the opportunity to restore their sect's glory.

Qing Luo
 Encounter

Qing Luo confronts
Li Yunxiao
 and his companions in an 8th Rank Underworld Warship representing the
Tianyi Pavilion
. Suspicion arises about Li Yunxiao leaking information about
Noah's Ark
. Li Yunxiao strategically responds, implying he joined the
Rookie Mercenary Group
 for opportunities. The conversation escalates, and
Shen Li
 suspect the identities of the individuals accompanying Li Yunxiao.

Li Yunxiao warns Qing Luo about hasty accusations. The conversation shifts to the Skeleton Mercenary Group's whereabouts. Li Yunxiao audaciously devours Martial Intent Dao Fruits, shocking Qing Luo. She suppresses her anger, needing his help to locate the group. Shen Li warns about Li Yunxiao's tactics.

As the conversation continues, Li Yunxiao's knowledge creates mystery around him. He shifts focus to the Nine Evil Yellow Spring, implying a reward for aiding the Tianyi Pavilion. Qing Luo reluctantly agrees to Li Yunxiao's conditions for assistance in finding the Skeleton Mercenary Group. Li Yunxiao's manipulation and connection to
Li Huachi
 raise questions. They discuss strategy for navigating the Demon Plain and the potential involvement of Li Huachi. Qing Luo extends an olive branch, agreeing to provide materials.

Later, a mysterious and powerful youth dressed in green is discovered within a sphere of lightning energy in the Empty Space by Qing Luo and her group. The mysterious youth absorbs lightning and gazes at Li Yunxiao, uttering the name "Little Wu." His enigmatic behavior leaves Qing Luo and her group baffled and intrigued, adding complexity to the unfolding events in the Demon Plain.

Shang
 & the Great Monsters Encounter

Later,
Xiao Wu
's voice alerts Li Yunxiao to an intense battle involving the
Eternal Evergreen Tree
. Li Yunxiao realizes the urgency of their situation and suggests entering the Demon Origin Plainse.
Qing Luo
 decides to enter the Demon Origin Plains, and the Netherworld Battleship isolates itself from the vortex's darkness before disappearing from the void.

Upon emerging above the Demon Origin Plains, Li Yunxiao's group navigates the dangerous environment. Meanwhile, a fierce battle above the Demon Origin Plain sees
Yi Qing
 fighting
Fu
 with his sword. Fu's Xuan Flower Axe shatters Yi Qing's sword, seemingly defeating him.
Shang
 intervenes, introducing himself to
Little Qing
 as a user of the
Supreme Palace Armillary Sphere
. Shang seeks Little Qing's help to restore his nearly depleted artifact, leading to a tense exchange.

Little Qing attacks Shang, and Shang's allies defend him. A powerful confrontation ensues with lightning and energy filling the sky. Little Qing's lightning imprisons Shang, but Shang's Supreme Palace Armillary Sphere creates a celestial barrier. Little Qing breaks free using the Rule of Heaven's power and attacks. The intense battle showcases Shang and Little Qing's formidable abilities.

Little Qing's counter-attack threatens to annihilate everything.
Ge
 sacrifices himself to block Little Qing's devastating
Void Jade Azure Violet Palace Brahma World Annihilation Divine Thunder
 attack. Ge's sacrifice stabilizes the situation momentarily, preventing the annihilation of their group. The act of selflessness and bravery has a profound impact on his old friends and Shang. Li Yunxiao rushes to save Little Qing, and the appearance of the
Tianyi Chamber of Commerce
 adds a new layer of complexity to the unfolding events.

Li Yunxiao clashes with Shang, and their profound weapons clash, leading to an injured standoff. The Monsters overpower Qing Luo's group with ninth-grade mysterious artifacts.
Mu Wu
 &
Yuwen Ao
 join the battle against the monsters. Li Yunxiao faces
Mister Yu
, using
Genryu
's help to overpower him. The monsters retreat after the battle. Qing Luo acknowledges Li Yunxiao's capabilities. Li Yunxiao advises tracking the Monster Clan's aura, believing their reputation will deter others from provoking them. Qing Luo follows Li Yunxiao's guidance, pursuing Tang Jie.

You Die or I Die

After the Great Monsters agreed to join forces with
Tang Jie
 and putting on him a Seven Fiend Seal, and after Tang Jie managed to gain control over
Dan Yangze
, He who had opposed him, was subdued and subjected to the effects of the Seven Fiend Seal, rendering him incapacitated. Tang Jie and his group refocused their efforts on dealing with Li Yunxiao and his allies.

After Tang Jie's failed attempt to bravely face the attacks, he and the other Great Monsters fled when faced with the
World God Monument
's descending strike by Li Yunxiao.
Fu
, attempted to strike the battleship with a powerful ninth-grade Xuan Artifact called the Xuan Flower Axe. To counter this,
Ye Fan
 revealed a Martial Will Pill that was enhanced with Nine Heavens Sovereign Qi, capable of withstanding the Xuan Artifact's impact. The
Tianyi Pavilion
 halted their attacks to regroup and prepare for the second round, while Fu remained poised to strike. However, Shang, suspected that the Tianyi Pavilion might have a countermeasure or trap in place, and the situation remained tense.

After a fierce battle between
Mister Yu
 against Li Yunxiao and
Gourd Little King Kong
, Yu and Yunxiao heavily injured. Suddenly,
Shen Feng
 came on the back of the Rank Eight Demonic Beast, the Nine-winged Spirit Snake Bird, Yu requested Shen Feng's assistance in eliminating Li Yunxiao, to which Shen Feng agreed. However, at the crucial moment, a giant flying artifact, the
Money Chamber of Commerce
, intervened.
Qian Wudi
, appeared on the artifact and engaged in a verbal exchange with Li Yunxiao. After Li Yunxiao and Qian Wudi's intense negotiation, Qian Wudi agrees to trade Heavenly Soul Herb, 1.2 billion mid-grade Primordial Stones, and additional resources for a mysterious item Li Yunxiao possesses.

This item turns out to be the Seven Constellations Martial Will Fruit, a potent treasure that Qian Wudi desires to boost his power. The exchange takes place amidst tense confrontations between various factions. Shen Feng, tries to attack Li Yunxiao, but
Zhang Hanzhe
 intervenes, leading to a standoff. Ultimately, the trade is made, with Li Yunxiao giving Qian Wudi the Seven Constellations Martial Will Fruit in exchange for Heavenly Soul Herb and primordial stones. Tang Jie and his group from the Four Extremes Sect left the scene, while Qian Wudi and his forces secured the area around Li Yunxiao to ensure his safety as he absorbs the powerful Heavenly Soul Herb. The situation remains tense, with factions watching each other closely, and Qian Wudi retreats to cultivate in seclusion, leaving his subordinates to guard the area.

Zhang Shaotian
 &
Little Qing
 Encounter

Inside the Illusionary Realm of the Water Moon Flower Mirror, the group continues to struggle with the complex illusion. They discover that the illusion is structured like a series of barriers within barriers, each layer becoming more intricate and challenging to navigate. Suddenly, Zhang Shaotian and his juniors confront Li Yunxiao,
Ye Fan
 and their companions. They demand information on how to break the array and offers to spare Li Yunxiao's life if he complies.

Li Yunxiao initiates an attack against Zhang Shaotian and his group. Li Yunxiao employs his Eye Technique and Spring Life Qi to confound and suppress Zhang Shaotian, temporarily gaining the upper hand. However, Zhang Shaotian manages to counteract the attack and escapes the restraints. The Soul Devouring Clan members vow to follow the Sacred Fire Temple group through the illusion. Li Yunxiao successfully uses his array skills to shift the Tiger King War Chariot into the Summer Boundary, the next layer of the Four Seasons Boundary.

Li Yunxiao shifts the Tiger King War Chariot to the Summer Boundary, elevating his cultivation remarkably by absorbing earth's rules. After a fierce exchange with
Little Qing
, Li Yunxiao discloses his desire to reach the Ancient Desolate Land, and Little Qing agrees to help due to past debt.

After Little Qing's departure, Li Yunxiao and the Sacred Fire Temple members discuss the significance of Little Qing's response and conclude that Noah's Ark must indeed be present. Suddenly, the surroundings tremble violently, and Li Yunxiao deduces that someone is forcefully breaking the formation. He urges everyone to return to the war chariot and activates, prepares to investigate the other three seasons to understand the situation further.

Four Seasons Immortal Mountain Appearance

Later, in another place,
Li
's attempt to break the formation triggers catastrophic consequences, Little Qing, who has been observing, warns that disaster is looming. The formation's instability leads to the sudden rise of an enormous ice mountain that engulfs Li, while the surrounding area experiences chaotic shifts between the four seasons.

The mountain's peak undergoes rapid transformations, with spring, summer, autumn, and winter all manifesting at different levels. The mountain's appearance reflects the four seasons, with spring at the midpoint, peach blossoms, withered trees, and snow at the base. Meanwhile, an immense boundary of the four seasons emerges in the distance, revealing the Immortal Mountain of lord
Throne
.

Li Yunxiao explains that breaking the formation requires either taking and breaking the Immortal Mountain, an almost impossible task, or relying on Little Qing, who is the only one capable of truly controlling the formation. The group's hopes rest on Little Qing's ability to free them from its grasp.

Li Yunxiao successfully defends himself against an ambush by Zhang Shaotian and his fellow Soul Devouring Sect disciples. Utilizing his control over the rule of Autumn, he overpowers one of the disciples and eliminates him. Zhang Shaotian is taken aback by Li Yunxiao's ability to wield the power of rules and realizes the threat he poses.

Li Yunxiao proposes a cooperation to escape the barrier and seize Throne's Immortal Mountain. Zhang Shaotian is intrigued by the potential of obtaining the Immortal Mountain and agrees to the plan, with the condition that Li Yunxiao shares the secret method to condense the laws of heaven and earth, which could bolster his strength to contend with the Martial Sovereigns from Myriad Star Valley.

With Zhang Shaotian's brute force, they retrieve a powerful artifact, a long gray banner, from the body of a deceased junior disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect. The banner's main soul has been extracted, and its power diminished, but the artifact still holds a malevolent aura.

Inside Four Seasons Immortal Mountain

Li Yunxiao
 and his group, including Zhang Shaotian and others, enter the Immortal Mountain and are awed by the profound changes in the surroundings. Li Yunxiao reveals that the Soul Devouring Sect members possess a secret technique for soul-searching, which they can use to locate living and even deceased souls. This technique sparks both intrigue and discomfort among the group. Zhang Shaotian employs his Soul Devouring Sect's soul-searching ability through a golden soul slave to find traces of other individuals within the vast mountain. That leaded to a fight against
Tang Jie
 and his Companions.

As Zhang Shaotian's Soul Devouring Gonfalon faces off against Tang Jie's Vermilion Bird Saber, the confrontation creates a stunning clash of power. Tang Jie's profound artifact is a ninth-grade weapon, and its overwhelming strength surprises Zhang Shaotian, making him realize the potential benefits of refining a ninth-grade profound artifact in conjunction with his Soul Devouring Gonfalon. This revelation adds to Zhang Shaotian's determination to capture Tang Jie and take advantage of his connection to the Vermilion Bird Saber.

As the battle unfolds, Tang Jie's fear reaches its peak as he witnesses the horrifying power of the golden soul slave when Zhang Shaotian extract the soul of the living
Dan Yangze
. However,
Shen Feng
 intervenes to save Tang Jie, suppressing the soul slave and briefly turning the tide of the battle. Zhang Shaotian retreats, and a standoff ensues between Shen Feng and Li Yunxiao's group.

Tang Jie seeks to persuade Shen Feng to eliminate their enemies, but Shen Feng hesitates due to the dangerous environment and the potential for wasting his strength. Li Yunxiao engages in a tense verbal exchange with Shen Feng, asserting that he is not afraid and even challenging Shen Feng's strength. Shen Feng eventually decides not to engage in a direct confrontation, opting to leave the situation for later resolution outside the barrier. Amid the tension, Li Yunxiao raises a new topic, inquiring about any discoveries Shen Feng might have made during his time in the Immortal Mountain.

Shen Feng shares his findings about the Immortal Mountain's strange environment and the disappearance of Mister Yu and his group. They discover a peculiar cliff that absorbs divine sense and essence upon contact, revealing a hidden space resembling a giant chessboard.
Shang
 and the other Great Monsters, including
Yu
, also appear in this space. Tang Jie's eagerness for revenge against Li Yunxiao intensifies. Shang orders an attack against Li Yunxiao and his group, including Zhang Shaotian. However, the unique environment suppresses the use of Primordial Qi and Essence, rendering the attackers powerless. Li Yunxiao's true power becomes apparent as he effortlessly defeats Tang Jie despite the restrictions, leaving the group of Great Monsters stunned.

Light Song Forest
=================

There are hundreds of different forces, and three of them even claim to be the Kings of Mercenaries, refusing to submit to each other, resulting in countless clashes and numerous casualties.

These three individuals are the leaders of the three largest mercenary forces in Qingge Forest. They are Skull Mercenary Group's leader,
Shen Feng
 ruled over the South, Storm Mercenary Group's leader,
Chen Chuanjiu
 ruled over the East, and Rookie Mercenary Group's leader,
Haolian Shaohuang
 ruled over the North. There is also another Mercenary Groups, but they're small and under the leadership of the Three Big Groups.

As for the West of the City is a chaotic place. None of the three mercenary groups have the upper hand. As there were no rules or restrictions, this place became the place with the highest number of deaths in the Light Song Forest every day. But many martial artists still poured in tirelessly, because the greatest joy here was that there were no rules or restrictions.

Ling Mudi
=========

SPOILER ALERT!

He is the King of the Northern Region. He participated in the Ancient Demon Sealing War 100,000 years ago.

Personality

Ling mudi personality was once calm and wise, like a kind elder, but the influence of the Rainbow Stone had gradually eroded his mind, pushing him into a demonic state. Under its effects, his thoughts became chaotic, his emotions unstable, and his actions ruthless, as if he were no longer the same person. Even after the stone was removed, the corruption of tens of thousands of years could not be undone instantly. Though he regained some of his former clarity, he admitted that he might never fully return to the Ling Mudi of old—not until his very soul faded away.

Background

100,000 years ago, Ling Mudi was invited by Lord Universe God to take part in the Demon-Sealing War. As one of the Four Domain Monarchs, ruling over the Eastern, Western, Southern, and Northern Domains, his status was once above that of the current Seven Sect Masters, nearly on par with the Masters of the Two Holy Lands. Back then, these monarchs stood at the pinnacle of power, playing a crucial role in shaping the fate of the world during the great war.

Plot

after his remnant soul come from the void he then  possessed the gourd Little King Kong.

Beifeng Nan and Ling mudi, once allies, clashed over the fate of the Rainbow Stone. Beifeng Nan believed it should aid the new generation, honoring their fallen comrades' sacrifice. Ling Mudi, however, saw it as a sacred relic too dangerous to fall into unknown hands. Their differing ideals led to a battle.

Ling Mudi acknowledged Li Yunxiao as the master of this generation’s World Deity and the chosen one. Given his age and achievements, even if he had lived a hundred thousand years ago, he would still have been an extraordinary genius. He truly deserved to possess the Divine Realm Tablet. Ling Mudi had a deep connection with the tablet’s previous owner and stated that its reappearance signaled the arrival of another great tribulation.

Power

Ling Mudi is undoubtedly one of the greatest alchemists of all time. His unparalleled skill allows him to extract the power of fundamental rules, and with the right materials, he can forge divine steel and craft tenth-tier items.

The Seven-Colored Tusita Heaven, crafted by Lord Ling Mudi, is an ancient profound-level weapon with power rivaling Saint weapons. However, due to incomplete materials, only a three-colored version was created using three Extreme Earth-type origins. Before the Demon-Sealing War, the warriors of Two World Mountain sought to complete it but failed to obtain the remaining four supreme earth elements. Now in Yunxiao’s hands, this tricolored Tusita Heaven still possesses immense weight and earth energy. If fully cultivated, it could manifest the divine ability of the Boundless Pure Land, that has infinite weight and heaviness would probably kill anyone who touched it, becoming an unrivaled force under the current sky.

Rainbow stone can also nourish the soul

Background

Plot

Long Qionmiao, appeared in
Crimson Crescent City
 after
Teng Guang
 800 Array that trap many expert was destroyed. In alliance with
Wei Qing
, he moved to force
Fei Ni
 surrender her Dao Fruit fragment. This demand shocked Fe Ni, as her Long family supposed to be above the world and not form alliances with others. Determined to give the fragment to
Li Yunxiao
 and remain by his side, even hoping to marry him in the future, she refused his command. Yet Long was unwavering; her rare bloodline was vital to his family's long-held ambitions, and he would reclaim her at any cost.

In the ensuing conflict,
Li Yunxiao
 intervened with fierce determination. With no other choice against experts like Long Qianmiao,
Wei Qing
 and the others, he unleashed his final ace: the Million Sword Illustration a Supreme Sword Array divine treasure fused with the will of the Heavenly Dao. He even threatened to detonate all thirty-six profound armaments, warning that the resulting explosion would unleash uncontrollable power and leave few survivors
Crimson Crescent City
. Even a divine transcendent him might not be able to block the blast if all thirty-six ninth-grade armaments exploded at once. This threat forced him and the remaining experts in Red Moon City to proceed with extreme caution, caught in Yunxiao's deadly trap.

The area within a thousand feet fell into dead silence. As one of the seven sect masters, he could not tolerate being threatened by a young man in front of so many experts; if this news spread, he would lose all face and it would be a real joke if he were dragged down by a crazy young man. However, when he sensed the cold Qi of the Northern Heaven Cold Star Sword beside him, he swallowed his anger and promised Yunxiao that he would no longer interfere with Fei Ni's marriage. He made it clear, though, that this promise reflected only his own will, not that of his family or the others.

After the Dragon essence and Phoenix light were forcefully extracted by
Lord Pu
, long qianmiao’s strength fell from divine transcendence. Such a drop in realm would be difficult to recover for the rest of his life. In the realm of heavenly martial arts, there would probably be no more legends of this person.

Li Yunxiao
. In the end, he willingly allowed her to deliver the final blow. Before his death, he acknowledged that her power had already surpassed his past self and entrusted her with the True Dragon Sword and the sect leader token, appointing her as the new leader of the sect.

Even
Ghost king

According to the legend, in the flow of time, the Sword of the Dragon was fought over by countless strong cultivators.

By absorbing the power of the Nirvana Body of the Celestial Phoenix, he strengthened this domain, elevating its power to new heights. Unlike ordinary domains, Dragon Field is a manifestation of the True Dragon’s bloodline, which no longer exists in the Heavenly Martial Realm but resides in the legendary Dragon Realm. Though the power of the Dragon Realm far surpasses anything in the present world, Long Qianmo’s ability to create Dragon Field proves his extraordinary mastery over his bloodline.

Yu Yixian
, a demonic slave of the
Demon Emperor Di
.

Backstory & Plot

After discovering that his Master planned to use his body as a vessel for the “afterlife inheritance” experiment to obtain the
Extreme Yin Divine Body
, he manipulated the situation to make his Master place the Neonite Stone into the body of
Bo Yuqing
, his brother-disciple, with this, they killed Yu Shengfeng together, but they were unable to eliminate his Soul, which wandered until it found the Rainbow Powder.

After becoming the Master of the Sea of Soul Formation, he took in a young red-haired girl as his daughter and trained her to become one of the elites of the Sea of Soul Formation,
Liu Feiyan
. And after consolidating his position, he began to silently spread the use of the
Demonic Qi
 present in the Devi Well for the use of Alchemy and Martial Arts. Reaching greater heights of power and techniques.

During the arrival of
Ai
, the great Alchemist of the Monster Race in the human territories, both
Tian Zhao Zi
 and Lu Congzi were hesitant about confronting the young woman, until Liu Feiyan recommended that they call
Gu Feiyang
, who accepted after Lu Congzi bestowed a Tenth-Grade Herb on him. With Gu Feiyang victory, he didn't need to risk his public image.

After learning of the incidents in
Crimson Crescent City
 involving his former Master and brother-disciple, Lu Congzi ordered his adopted daughter to go there and capture Bo Yuqing. After Bo Yuqing arrived at the Sea Soul Formation, he had made his brother-disciple mind, or at least he thought he had, and brought him to his side.

After
Li Yunxiao
 arrived in Lu Congzi territory after the events of the Human vs. Monster War, he once again bestowed the title of Honorary Elder of the Sea of Soul Formation to Li Yunxiao, so that he would be stuck to it.

With the arrival of Yu Shengfeng at the place after the promise made by his Master to Liu Feiyan,
Xuan Hua
 and Li Yunxiao, Lu Congzi remained quiet and apathetic towards his Master provocations, as he noticed that one of the figures beside his Master was
Perfected Meng Ling

But, he ordered
Yuan De
 to test his Master's strength, hoping to know if he had truly reached the
Physical Body Harmonization Stage
, after the battle, He faces Li Yunxiao and Yu Shengfeng in the secret space below the entrance to the
Demon Realm
, and after hearing Bo Yuqing psychological revelation, Yu Shengfeng dies on the spot at the hands of his brother-disciple.

. And is forced to reveal his trump card, summoning a
Second Grade Demon Lord
 into his body, and fighting with the

Heavenly Martial Alliance

Extreme Virtual Realm
-level Demons against Li Yunxiao and
Ye Nantian
's subordinates, Lu Congzi leaves them trapped in a magical mist with Demonic properties.

Inside the Devil Well, Lu Congzi traps Ye Nantian who self-destructs one of the layers of Noah's Ark to escape. Later, Li Yunxiao and the others reach the secret space below the Devil's Well, where they see Ye Nantian defeated and trapped by the demons in the Wall of Demonic Faces.

After the battle, Lu Congzi goes to the
Devil Realm
 and works with Man to steal a
Demonic Monkey Egg

Six Wings

Heavenly Martial Realm
 and the
Demon Realm
, allowing all individuals to reach the level of a Second Grade Demon Lord, with some reaching the level of a Peak Demon Lord.

Sword that Will Rise and Fall
, revealing the strength of a World King of the Hundred Tribulations Realm, which scares Lu Congzi.

=========

He is a Fourth-Tier Alchemist from the
Duskflame Empire
's Alchemist Association. Even if he is not a High-Tier Alchemist, he is still a renowned figure in the Shangyang City.

Plot

Duskflame's Alchemist Association

Lu Haochu is one of the three Rank-Four Alchemist masters who confront
Li Yunxiao
 when he proposes a duel against all of them simultaneously. He is offended by Li Yunxiao's arrogance and agrees to take part in the duel.

Xin Ze presents a seventh-tier quality
Cosmic Sun Note Jade
, which greatly enhances an alchemist master's refining abilities. The other two alchemist masters,
Lu Haochu
 and
Ge Xiangqian
, offer a
Heavenly Flame Battle Flag
 and a pair of
Purple Cloud Centipede Wings
, respectively, as their gambling stakes.

To everyone's astonishment, Li Yunxiao claims that someone will bring the 100 million mid-grade primal stones for the gambling bet soon. Xin Ze, initially skeptical, is proven wrong when his brother,
Xin Pi
, arrives and hands over the 100 million mid-grade primal stones as promised.

Despite the disbelief and shock from the other alchemist masters, their confidence in winning the bet is gradually shaken as he observes Li Yunxiao's demeanor, which shows deep certainty of victory against the three of them.

The Alchemy Competition

As the competition begins, Li Yunxiao surprises everyone by suggesting that each of the three alchemist masters will condense one primal stone, while he alone will condense two primal stones simultaneously. This shocks the three alchemist masters, as it increases the difficulty of the competition significantly.

Despite their anger and disbelief, they continue with the competition. Li Yunxiao impresses them with his mastery of the Twelve Forms of Flying Flower and Falling Snow, a set of refining techniques created by the renowned alchemist, Gu Feiyang. Li Yunxiao's use of these advanced techniques and his overall proficiency in alchemy leave the three alchemist masters in awe and shock.

Finally, Ge Xiangqian can no longer hold back and attacks first, using the same method as Li Yunxiao to condense his primal stone. The competition is now underway, and everyone is eager to see who will come out victorious.

Ge Xiangqian managed to raise the primal stone to a low-grade level but exhausted a lot of energy in the process, leaving him visibly fatigued. Next, Lu Haochu took over, using his Yamata Branch Heart Cultivation Mantra to condense the primal stone. His technique was beautiful and dreamy, but he also struggled to match Li Yunxiao's level of refinement.

Li Yunxiao, on the other hand, effortlessly advanced his primal stone to the middle grade, showcasing his superior understanding and control of the Twelve Forms of Flying Flower and Falling Snow. He surprised everyone by using a new and mysterious technique called the Scripture of Rippling Mirage. The technique impressed even Baili Gongjin, a rank six alchemist, who recognized its profoundness and admitted his admiration for Li Yunxiao's mastery.

After Baili Gongjin shared the story of his encounter with Lord Gu Feiyang and his advice, Lu Haochu attempted to condense a primal stone using his powerful soul force. However, his technique lacked finesse and appeared clumsy compared to Li Yunxiao's mastery. He raised the primal stone to a High-grade level but felt fatigued after the effort. In response, Li Yunxiao managed to advance the primal stone to a high-grade level, impressing everyone with his skills and talent.

Now, Xin Ze is attempting to advance the primal stone to the supreme-grade level, while Li Yunxiao is doing the same. Despite Li Yunxiao's exhausted state, he surprises everyone by suddenly revitalizing and displaying incredible control over his soul power and the primordial stone, keeping up with Xin Ze's progress. The two are in a fierce competition to see who can reach the supreme-grade level first.

But, later, Li Yunxiao even succeeded in forming a Innate Primordial Elixir, a divine object, which amazed all the alchemists present. Even the Supreme-grade primal stone he used to create it transformed into the Inner Core, which symbolized the Innate Primordial Elixir. Witnessing Li Yunxiao's extraordinary skill and calm demeanor, the other alchemists, including Xin Ze, Ge Xiangqian, and Lv Haochu, were deeply impressed. In a show of respect and admiration, the three fourth-grade Alchemists knelt down and expressed their admiration for Li Yunxiao's prowess.

The Nine Yang Sacred Technique was Shenxiao Temple’s greatest treasure, granting immense power through dual cultivation. When a woman with a Nine Yang True Body engaged in intimacy for the first time, she transferred pure Yang energy to her partner, boosting his cultivation. In return, she awakened Yin energy, balancing her power and accelerating her growth. Due to the rarity of Nine Yang True Bodies, few had ever practiced the technique, but those who did became peerless experts.

Overview

Plot

Mount Meru

After Mount Xumi released its spiritual energy, Yanwu City became one of the most treasured cultivation grounds in the Tianwu Realm, attracting countless warriors from all regions. The city expanded over tenfold and rose to lead the entire Southern Region.

Martial Flam City Crisis

After  Mount Xumi’s disappearance, the spiritual energy has started to decline, A few years ago, a strange phenomenon appeared above Tianshui Kingdom, releasing astonishing spiritual energy, which was continuously absorbed by Yanwu City's spirit-gathering formation.

In response, major sects from the Southern Region sent experts to investigate. They concluded that a massive spiritual vein existed near Tianshui Kingdom, but despite extensive searches, they found nothing. Even warriors from the other three regions continued their exploration for a long time but eventually gave up.

Now, with Yanwu City's spiritual energy depleting, concerns are growing over how long it will last. To slow down consumption, the city has begun restricting foreign warriors, requiring those who wish to cultivate there to pay a large sum of Yuanshi.

Southern Sealed Land

Yanwu City is experiencing a severe spiritual energy crisis, with reserves rapidly depleting and cultivation becoming unsustainable. To slow this decline, the City Lord’s Mansion has imposed restrictions, but without discovering a new energy source, the city's future remains uncertain.

A past attempt to locate the source failed despite the promise of control over East Yanwu City as a reward. Now, discussions are underway to increase the stakes, but many fear that even offering half the city won’t help if the source remains undiscovered.

Meanwhile, power struggles are intensifying. Major sects like Tianzhu Sect and Duanqing Mountain are secretly backing factions to infiltrate Yanwu City, while smaller sects also compete for control over its spiritual veins. As internal and external forces fight for dominance, Yanwu City stands on the brink of collapse.

Coup d'état

During the Martial Flame City crisis, Xin Ruyu, backed by a major force from the Duskflame Empire and supported by one of the Seven Major Powers in Tianwu, took advantage of the chaos to stir up trouble. With Yanwu City's spiritual energy depleting, he openly declared his intent to seize control, claiming that the Li family was no longer fit to rule.

However, before his plans could unfold, Yunxiao suddenly arrived at Martial Flame City, putting an abrupt end to Xin Ruyu's ambitions. In a decisive move, Yunxiao crippled Xin Ruyu, while the sect masters who had sided with him were given a chance at pardon on the condition that they destroy their own dantians as a form of punishment.

Later, while searching the soul of one of the fallen experts, Yunxiao discovered a shocking truth: the force backing Xin Ruyu was none other than
Beiming Dark Palace
, one of the Seven Major Powers.

Before the Storm

After stopping
Xin Ruyu
 and the
Duskflame Empire
’s forces from taking over
Martial Flame City
,
Li Yunxiao
 gathered key figures to discuss an even greater looming threat.
In the meeting, familiar faces like
Ji Meng
,
Xu Han
,
Zhang Qingfan
,
Jia Rong
,
Qian Duoduo
,
Li Chunyang
, and
Li Changfeng
 were present, along with elite
Student Army
 members.
Su Lianyi
,
Ding Ling’er
, and others also emerged from the
World God Monument
 to join the discussion.
Yunxiao revealed that the
Demon Emperor
’s seal had been broken, and the
Ten Directions Rules
 would soon spread. As Martial Flame City was the closest hub, powerful warriors seeking to break into the Divine Realm would soon gather, making the city vulnerable.
To prepare, Yunxiao proposed an alliance between Martial Falme City,
Shenxiao Palace
, and the
Tianling Long Family
, creating a fixed channel to unite their forces and stand against the impending crisis.

At the same time, the City Lord’s Mansion took control of the Tianyuan Chamber of Commerce and the Jinqian Gang, merging them into the Yanwu City Chamber of Commerce. Surprisingly, both factions cooperated, with the Jinqian Chamber even donating its assets and pledging support.

With 100,000 years’ worth of sealed spiritual energy soon to be released, Yanwu City was poised for massive growth, expected to expand tenfold. This transformation would make it a major economic and cultivation hub, reshaping the balance of power in the world.

Martial arts competitions
=========================

Martial arts competitions Held in
Luofu Island
 by hidden families to get to know each other, increase their prestige, and understand the situation of other sects.

History

Martial arts competitions weren’t very important. They were just a way for the hidden families to get to know each other, increase their prestige, and understand the situation of other sects. They could be considered a more important form of communication, but they were just communication and didn’t have much of a relationship of interest. But it’s different this time. It’s directly related to two major matters, the quota to enter the heaven of Langya and the distribution of the
Ancient Treasure Trove
.

Rule

the martial arts competition must be young disciples of each sect, and their
bone age
 is limited to
thirty years old
 and below, each sect will have at least one quota. There will be a total of 12 places in the martial arts competition. Whether it’s going to the eternal world or the secret treasure of the true dragon Next, it will be distributed according to the martial arts ranking. for the first place, will get thirty quotas as a reward for the the heaven of Langya.

Trivia

Since
Jing Qi
 cultivated the Corpse Fiend Technique, which refines the body into a corpse fiend, his bone age remains fixed at the year he first practiced this divine ability. Although he is much older, his bone age is technically 23 years old, allowing him to qualify as a participant in the tournament.

Background

Mei Dong'er hailed from a prestigious, yet complex family background. Though she bore the surname Mei, she was a distant branch of the renowned Mei family and thus, had no access to the wealth or privileges typically associated with her name. Like most others, she was raised within the Big Dipper Sect, where she cultivated her skills alongside ordinary children. Despite this, her innate talent shone through. By the age of fifteen, she had already reached the Six Directions Realm, a feat that few could achieve at such a young age. Over the next year, her rapid progression continued, as she shattered barriers and ascended to the peak of the Five-Star Martial Grandmaster realm. While her speed of advancement wasn’t unparalleled, it was certainly among the fastest in the sect, marking her as an exceptional talent.

History

Mei Dong’er was born with a rare and fatal condition known as the Five Righteous Que Qi, abody that was lacking in all five virtues, terminal disease so severe that even ninth-tier great alchemists couldn't cure it. With such an affliction, she was not expected to survive beyond the age of ten.

Mei Family

Ninth Jiu says that Mei Dong'er mother stole the Key to the Wudang River space, which caused the decline of the Mei Family, and such a disappointment on the part of Ninth Jiu's mother that she commit suicide.

During the conversation, Ninth Aunt tells that this Wudang River was a sea of mysterious Spiritual Qi that existed in a space that existed in the Mei Family's territory, which contained a poison that gave the Mei Family's Treasure Analysis skill.

After Li Yunxiao discovered that the necklace that Mei Dong'er mother had was the key, and that it was only used to treat Mei Dong'er illness that she had exhibited at birth, Mei Dong'er cries to the point of fainting, handing over the Key shortly before this to Ninth Jiu, as after these long years, her illness has already been treated.

Mei Dong'er becomes an incredibly important member of the Mei Family, as Li Yunxiao asks Ninth Aunt to take care of Mei Dong'er, which she approves of. About 4 years later, Li Yunxiao reunites with Ninth Aunt and Mei Dong'er during a
Ten Thousand Treasures Store
 Auction in New Yan City, with Li Yunxiao noting that Mei Dong'er was treated well as she became a High-Level Martial Supreme under the Mei Family's care.

During a conversation between Li Yunxiao, Ninth Aunt, and Mei Dong'er, Ninth Aunt says that after Li Yunxiao entered the Wudang River, the Spiritual Qi and poison present became incredibly stronger and denser.

Later it was known that this Wudang River is connected to Earth Domain .

Later, While searching for the Earth Realm and the Yellow Springs Hellfire with Pan Yi and Zhan Chen, Yunxiao encountered Meng Wu. However, just like Meng Bai, she had been placed under a spell by Wei Qing and had no memory of him.

Divine Realm Tablet
 to counter it, but to his shock, even this holy artifact was affected the surface became crystallized, and its power was suppressed.

Realizing the danger, Yunxiao unleashed the Ice Fiend Heart Flame and the Xin Guili Flame, causing a dazzling explosion. The immense energy created a massive vortex in the lake, pulling all three of them in. As they were swept along by the spinning force, Yunxiao's eyes remained fixed on Meng Wu.

<nowiki>As the whirlpool carried them apart, Meng Wu looked at Yunxiao and finally asked for his name. Her figure gradually faded into the distance, like a crystal-blue silhouette, disappearing from sight.

Mo Xiaochuan, was one of the
Gu Feiyang
 disciple.

Personality

He has an unconditional trust in his
Master
 and an extremely outstanding willpower.

Background

Among
Gu Feiyang
 disciples he has the worst talent, at most it can be considered mediocre. But due to his strong willpower and hard work he manages to reach the 3 Star Martial Sovereign Realm upon reuniting with
Li Yunxiao
. From this point onwards he mostly cultivates in the World God Monument and helps his
Master
 in fighting enemys.

History

As a child, he passed through the
Mo Family
 forbidden territory. As a trial to become Gu Feiyang disciple, he underwent a torturous and incomparably agonizing process of pain at the hands of his Ancestor spirit, becoming the scabbard of the Demon-Slaying Sword, a Martial Technique with such strong spiritual force that it is considered a Ninth-Grade Xuan Artifact.

After leaving his
Master
, Mo Xiaochuan returned to the
Mo Family
 in Black Iron City, where the
Ancestral Elder
 passed down
the Thousand Cricket Vast Art
 to him. They warned him not to seek revenge until he had fully mastered it. He trained in seclusion for ten years in the forbidden area, persistently requesting to learn the
Thousand Feet Noble Art
, which the ancestral patriarch finally agreed to teach him.

Mo Huayuan
, had been exiled to South Fire City after offending an expert from the
Holy Region

Four years ago, Hua Yuan sought rare herbs from the Thunderwind Chamber of Commerce, unintentionally exposing Mo Xiaochuan’s condition. He was handed over to
Ying Lin
, who took him into the Maze in hopes of using him to locate a hidden mine. There, Mo Xiaochuan followed an ancient aura to the Suanni’s Soul Altar, where he encountered a mysterious statue. As he struggled against its corrupting energy, an evil spirit invaded his mind, forcing him into servitude.

Ironically, the Northern Underworld Cold Yin Qi inside him helped resist the spirit’s control, allowing brief moments of clarity. However, as the Yin Qi weakened, his consciousness faded more frequently. Now, with the Yin Qi finally expelled, the evil spirit had been fully suppressed, and he was free at last.

Plot

History (Ch. 287 - 321)

Upon the opening of the Sumeru Mountain Secret Realm above
Martial Flame City
, Yunxiao took control of the arrays, laid out by the experts, which were originally intended to only let people in who obtained or purchased the
quota crystal
.

In order to enter one had to pay a fee to Li Yunxiao to get entry into the secret Realm. After entering the Secret Realm he let
Luo Yunshang
 out of the
Divine Realm Tablet
 and left it behind to absorb the dense spirit qi. Shortly after Yunxiao caught a "
little green demon
" and gave it Luo Yunshang and taught her how to control it (its strong point is high agility).

Shortly after they discover people fighting a
Stone Beast
. While fighting it, the Stone Beast advances from the Martial Grandmaster to the Martial Emperor Realm. Because of that the people decide to run away. While escaping Yunxiao and the others come across a bunch of people who fight for a seven constellation
Dao Fruit
.  Luo Yunshang manages to snatch it with the help of the
little green demon
.

Before people can get agitated about it, the Stone Beast manages to catch up. Sitting in the same boat the people join forces to take it down. After destroying the Stone Beasts physical body its "heart" remains, which allows it to recover its body again. Before that happens Yunxiao manages to subdue it.

After that Wang Qiang, whom Yunxiao saved from the little green demon previously, takes Luo Yunshang hostage in an attempt to get the Dao Fruit. However before Yunxiao can make a move a passage opens and swallows all people present. Yunxiao enters it as well and finds himself in a passage. Wandering in the passage he finds
tadpole-like characters
 on the walls similar to those of his
great expansion divine technique
 and great realm divine technique. He manages to activate those characters which opens up another passage.

Following the passage his Qi greatly increases and he breaks through several stars, furthermore some
mysterious energy
 accumulates in his dantian. At the end of the passageway he finds a jade platform with a
golden sword
 on it. After taking it he arrives inside the so-called Xumi Divine Palace, which gives massive benefits according to legends. Meanwhile the other people who got swallowed by the passage, but didn't activate the characters, arrive outside the Xumi Divine Palace where many other people are also gathered. There Ding Ling'er is also in the crowd and manages to free the hostage taken Luo Yunshang from Wang Qiang.

Ding Ling'er gets into a quarrel with Tang Yuan who tries to pursue her, but Qian Wudi interferes. After that they discover Yunxiao coming out of the Divine Palace, only a barrier separating the two parties. Yunxiao brings the people to humilate Tang Yuang in exchange for opening up the barrier.

After entering the Palace they arrive in a hall. In order to go deeper inside they have to open a sealed stone door. Managing to solve some arrays the door opens up, however without bypassing the dragon pressure one cannot enter. Yunxiao, who obtained
Luo Qingyun
's blood (in previous arcs) can enter together with Ding Ling'er and Luo Yunshang without problems since the blood contains a trace of the dragons bloodline. Arriving in a hall the three meet a
Demon Dragon
 Soul who turns out to be Gu Feiyang's sword spirit.
At that moment Luo Yunshang and Ding Ling'er also learn of Yunxiao's real identity
.

The demon dragon having a grudge with Yunxiao tries to kill the latter. Yunxiao and the two women flee out of the hall, the people still being outside follow up and flee together with Yunxiao. After a short time the Demon Dragon manages to catch up. Yunxiao and the others, forced to fight him, suppress the Dragon Soul and try to capture it. Getting beaten up, the Dragon flees back to the Palace and hides.

Yunxiao who chased the Demon Dragon back to the Palace manages to convice the latter to once again become his sword spirit. Yunxiao learns that the Xumi Divine Palace, he previously was in, only is a "reflection" of the original one. The entrance to the real Palace is at the bottom of the sea of qi nearby. To open the gates to the real palace he uses the
golden sword
, which he previously obtained in the passageway as a key.

Before entering five people appear, who turn out to be disciples from the
seven major forces
.

His knowledge and innovations in puppetry were far beyond his time, and his theories hinted at groundbreaking advancements.

History

One of his most ambitious ideas, recorded in a jade slip, was the concept of developing puppets into an independent race, granting them intelligence equal to that of humans.
Mu Chen was also responsible for crafting the Royal Chariot, which he believed was the pinnacle of puppet craftsmanship, representing a qualitative leap in puppet evolution.
Among his many achievements, he also created the Twelve Dingjia Puppets, each of which was a ninth-rank puppet equipped with unique divine abilities. These puppets were an integral part of the Six Ding Six Jia Formation, which had the potential to set up the legendary Twelve Divine Beings Killing Formation, one of the three great ancient ominous formations.
Despite his remarkable contributions, the Mu family’s renowned Three Great Puppetry Techniques—Transforming Beans into Soldiers, Six Ding Six Jia, and the mysterious number one technique—did not entirely reflect Mu Chen’s ideology.

nobility and foresight
, displaying the
aura of a ruler in the making
.

However, his path to the throne was
fraught with political danger
, as his older brother,
Prince
Qin Yang
, held the strongest claim. Refusing to submit to fate,
Qin Yue gathered powerful allies
, including the mysterious
Bai Mou
, Li Yunxiao and
Li Family
 to position himself as a serious contender.

His greatest advantage and potential downfall was
the favor of his ailing father, King
Qin Zheng

King Qin Zheng, the shrewd and pragmatic ruler of Tianshui, spent decades navigating wars and political intrigues. Despite being over seventy and physically frail, his sharp mind remained focused on maintaining power. Unlike most rulers who prioritized a stable succession, his primary concern was securing his own rule.

Plot

Qin Zheng’s actions in his later years revealed his true nature as a
cunning strategist
 who refused to relinquish control. His eldest son,
Prince Qin Yang
, was once seen as the undisputed heir due to his
military achievements and influence
. However, in a sudden shift, the king began
alienating Qin Yang and gradually stripping him of power
, instead
elevating Prince Qin Yue
 a move that confused the court.

Rather than openly declaring an heir, Qin Zheng
intentionally created a rivalry
 between Qin Yang and Qin Yue. By doing so, he kept both princes preoccupied with each other, preventing them from turning their ambitions toward the throne itself. This tactic allowed him to
maintain absolute authority
, as neither son could act against him without being countered by the other.

Qinghai Town
============

Qinghai Town is a gathering place for more than half of the cultivators in the Heavenscent empire. Although it is called a small town, it is larger than ordinary cities, with a population of at least several tens of millions. It is renowned for its prosperity, ranking at the forefront within its country.

Information

The Tianxiang Empire is adjacent to the Southern Sea, possessing astonishingly abundant marine resources. Near the Southern Sea lies a small town known as Qinghai Town. Although the town is small, it's one of the most bustling places in the entire
Southern Region
 of the
Tianwu Continent
. People from all over are constantly coming and going, engaged in various business activities.

In addition to ordinary merchants, representatives from major powers and commercial alliances also have stations in Qinghai Town. Furthermore, a large number of beast hunters gather from all directions, making a living by hunting sea creatures in exchange for various resources.

Qiu
===

He is the third son of
Yin Yu
 and the most talented of the Nine Sons. Due to the Laws of the Ten Directions disappearing, his Cultivation stagnated at the peak of the Dharma Body Realm, but, he was the one with the greatest chance among the Nine Sons of entering the World King Realm, or rather, attain the legendary
Sacred Body
.

Plot

After the battle against the Ancestral Mother of Monsters,
Six Wings
, in the Yin Yu Dragon Domain which later became the Land of Ten Thousand Spirits, Qiu asked
Bo Mu
, the Sea Goddess, to guard his Dharma Body beneath the Ocean Emperor Palace so that Yin Yu would not come after him in the future to steal his Dragon Essence.

After the
Eternal World
 merged with the
Heavenly Martial Realm
, and some events occurred,
Li Yunxiao
 and
Duanmu Youyu
 felt bad premonitions and deduce that a terrible event would happen in the
Four Seas
. Later they arrive at the Four Seas with some companions and come face to face with an incredibly strong member of a Clan of the Ocean Depths who intervened between the fighting of two Sea Tribes.

After killing the
Divine Transcendence
 expert of the Ocean Depths Clan, they investigated the battle and asked for information, discovering that an individual named Qiu had caused disasters by the ocean. With that,
Bo Long
 called the
Four Sea Kings
 to the Sea Forest as reinforcements, and thus the Four Kings were no longer in their Palaces and territories.

After arriving at the Sea Forest, Li Yunxiao and his team come face to face with the leaders of the largest Clans in the Deep Sea, one of them being
Gu Hong
 Grandfather, who appears alongside his grandson. These more than half a dozen
Void Prime
 experts discuss with Li Yunxiao and his companions, until Qiu shows his face and Bo Long comes out of the palace to welcome him.

After a great battle,
Bo Mu
 takes on an energy form with her consciousness, practically returning to life. She intervenes in the battle, and Li Yunxiao fights with Qiu, until Yin Yu and
Feng Yaoli
 appear.

After a fierce battle between the forces of Qiu, Yin Yu who was supported by Feng Yaoli and Nine Abyss, inside the Sea Goddess Palace, or rather, the Saint Demon Palace,
Fei Ni
 is enraged by the Qiu words about his kind and kills Qiu, who later emerges in his true body, now with a mere shred of consciousness, which later allows the Evil Spirit (Li Yunxiao's companion), take his body.

During the battle, it is revealed that Yin Yu has subjugated the Four Sea Kings and several of the A-Rank and S-Rank Tribes of the Four Seas to fight for him, which results in their deaths at the hands of Li Yunxiao and his comrades during the battle, leaving the Four Seas leaderless. Among those who were subdued by Yin Yu, there was also the Leader of the Dragon Guards of the Land of Rain, the Dragon Head, who attained Divine Transcendence and died becoming food for Yin Yu.

Qiu Mujie
=========

Former Member of the Alchemist Association, wanted by the Sea of Soul Formation.

Appearance

He was old and had a Vulture-like face.

Personality

Qiu Mujie is a ruthless and fanatical alchemist who values his pursuit of the highest art above all else, even at the cost of countless lives. He sees ordinary people as insignificant and believes their sacrifice for his research is an honor. His complete disregard for morality and his obsession with experimentation have earned him the nickname "Mad Jie."

Background

In the study of the human body, there was no one in the world who was better than him.

History

After Qiu Mujie became a wanted man by the Sea of Soul Formation, Wei Qing offered him protection in exchange for his assistance in a grand project. Together, they secretly conducted experiments to create a god. To support this, Wei Qing invested immense resources into Qiu Mujie’s research on Body Fusion.

Meanwhile, Qiu Mujie secretly worked on perfecting his ultimate body, finding ways to overcome its shortcomings and eliminate the backlash of fusion. Though his results were groundbreaking, they were merely a small branch of Wei Qing’s larger experiment—one that Wei Qing remained unaware of.

Eventually, Wei Qing no longer needed Qiu Mujie, having likely mastered the true method of achieving full physical perfection. Seeing no further use for him, he attempted to kill Qiu Mujie, discarding both the scientist and the Countercharge Balancing Technique he once relied on.

Plot

Later, Qiu Mujie was sent by
Wei Qing
 specifically to capture Li Yunxiao. Wei Qing was well aware that Qiu Mujie’s submissiveness was merely an act and that he had long harbored intentions of betrayal. That was why he secretly assigned Xiao Xiao and Huan Mie, two peak nine-star Martial Emperor experts, to monitor him in the shadows.

Qiu Mujie clashed with Li Yunxiao in Fengling City after attempting to seize
Narcissus
. Both sides unleashed their trump cards, with Qiu Mujie even revealing his true form—a half-mermaid beast—pushing Li Yunxiao into a desperate struggle that left him injured and forced back. However, before the battle could reach its conclusion, interference came from multiple sides. Forces from
Crimson Crescent City
, the
Sea of Soul Formation
, and Wei Qing’s subordinates all joined the fray. Even
Yu Shengfeng
 made an appearance, suppressing everyone and ultimately putting an end to the fight.

Technique

Qiu Mujie’s ultimate body was a terrifying fusion of countless supreme traits from various powerful races. His body incorporated the feet of a Truth Listener, the feathers of a Black Swamp bird, the arms of a Golden Ape, the ominous claws, and the thousand Immemorial Heaven’s Eyes—each an extraordinary existence on its own. Yet, his transformation didn’t stop there. He possessed green eyes, a strange horn on his forehead, feelers on his head, a copper nose, the ears of a Silver Eagle, dragon scales covering his body, and the long tail of a Suan Ni,Centaur, mermaid etc. A living assembly of a hundred races, Qiu Mujie had defied the natural order, achieving an unprecedented balance that allowed him to retain his divine sense despite his monstrous form.

Qiu Mujie’s quasi-Sage body possesses a unique trait—he can harness both his sea of Qi and his demonic core simultaneously. Moreover, he has several spare dantian demonic cores stored within the bodies of demonic beasts. This allows him to bypass restrictions placed on his cultivation. If someone attempts to suppress him, he can simply self-destruct his original dantian to break free, just as he did when Yu Shengfeng tried to seal his power—immediately replacing it with one of his spare cores.

He was perhaps the first in history to achieve such an unimaginable transformation without suffering conflict or backlash.

Qiu Mujie’s recovery technique is both bizarre and effective. A ripple forms on his chest, with his belly button as the center, before suddenly expanding into a fist-sized opening. From within, a fish head slowly emerges, absorbing essence pills and instantly converting them into Yuan power. The energy flows through his body, rapidly healing his injuries until he is fully restored within moments. Though undeniably powerful, its strange appearance left Yunxiao both impressed and embarrassed, suggesting that Qiu Mujie find a way to make it more aesthetically acceptableas even he might consider using it if it looked better.

Kurosawa Feather/feather of the dark swamp has an extremely powerful spatial ability combine with his powerful mental energy. With a slight flap of his wings, the runes on his black feathers flashed, and he can instantly teleported away.

The Qi Transformation Vortex is Qiu Mujie's ultimate technique, achieved by self-destructing eleven ninth-tier demonic cores simultaneously. When multiple ninth-tier cores explode at once, the resulting force rivals the attack of a Divine Transcendence expert. He resorted to this technique when pushed to the brink by Nanfeng Xuan,

Trivia

He is from Mount ganbo.

Qiu Mujie has been hiding for so many years all because of Wei Qing’s protection.

Qiu Mujie had countless disciples, but they were all experimental subjects, and only two of them were his true disciples.

His green eyes were plucked from the ancient eye clan's ferocious beast.

The Grudge between
Li Yunxiao
 and Qiu Mujie was that The Purple Cloud Peak had sent yang yuanshu to kill ning keyue and colluded with Wei Qing. It was just that Qiu Mujie did not know about these grudges.

Li Yunxiao
 praise him and have to admit that Qiu Mujie was the most talented Alchemist in the world because his ultimate Body.

Qiu Mujie’s ultimate ambition was to lead his army in a ruthless assault on the Sea of Soul Formation, paving the way for his vision of a supreme nation of alchemists. In his ideal world, all living beings would revere the Dao of magic, and everything would exist solely to serve its pursuit. He believed that to master divine skills, one must be willing to sacrifice everything—body, soul, and will—offering themselves entirely to the path of alchemy.

Qiu Mujie life goal was to sanctify his physical body and had researched for his entire life for it.

However, Yunxiao refused, instead offering heavenly materials and earthly treasures to heal Teng Guang. Among them was the Nine-Five Supreme Pill, shocking Teng Guang, who questioned its origin. Yet, despite taking the pill, he remained disheartened, knowing his Dao Foundation was destroyed, leaving him with no hope of further advancement.

Yunxiao insisted that as long as one is alive, there is always a chance. With a sigh, Teng Guang reluctantly accepted, beginning his recovery—but his lifeless eyes revealed that his spirit had already crumbled.

Technique

the Great Void Illusory Realm/The great illusionary land
 A true king-level killing array which create his own World and turned illusionary into reality, is a deadly formation that activates when his life is in danger. it ensures that if he perishes, All the living Even those divine transcendence experts can not escapeand  will be buried alongside him.  This is his final, most fearsome life-saving measure.

This Divine Formation Diagram is one of the ten ultimate techniques of Guang. As the light of the formation's first earthly phase intensified, the entire world was engulfed in lightning and demonic Qi. Under its radiance, everything became clear—the formation manifested as a massive cross-shaped vortex of light, spanning several acres. When the spiraling force of light descended, it split the earth for a thousand miles, creating a bottomless, terrifying chasm.

The Heaven and Earth Ruyi Yin Thunder Fire Formation was a devastating technique. Teng Guang’s towering golden figure formed in the sky, commanding billions of Yin Thunder Fire Beads to create a massive array. With a single hand seal, the beads detonated, flattening the land and leaving behind an unfathomably deep sinkhole filled with chilling energy.

World Cage is Teng Guang’s powerful technique that creates a subspace supported by five sky-high pillars. These pillars transform into five massive mountains that descend from above, trapping everything within their crushing domain. Although his World Cage was impregnable, it was still inferior to the Taiwu profound Yin soul slaying formation of the
Crimson Crescent City
.

God-slaying, and it was extremely powerful. It could kill all living beings within the formation light.

the heavenly immortal mountain was not as overbearing as the Tushita heaven, it was full of the power of the rules of the Four Seasons and was a profound level weapon.

seven profound-level weapons—each embodying wind, rain, fire, thunder, frost, snow, and fog—to form a powerful elemental formation. After years of refinement, he merged these forces into a single, majestic domain, with each weapon serving as a core, creating a world of its own. As their energies intertwined, they filled the sky with overwhelming power.

Trivia

Dead Cause - He was blown up with his Thirteen Fatal Formation while attacking Six Wing invasion in realm of Heavenly master arts.

Teng Guang was one of the few people who immediately saw through
Li Yunxiao
 true identity as Gu Feiyang at first glance.

Teng Guang deeply admired and was most impressed by Gu Feiyang, whose bold and unconstrained ideas mirrored his personality. Gu Feiyang’s insights provided great inspiration in Teng Guang’s pursuit of the Heavenly Dao, It was truly an unforgettable time.

divine being
 in the mortal realm.

The technique was unique in that it
could not be learned through traditional means
, such as jade slips or written manuals. Instead, it required a
special medium of inheritance
, meaning it could only be
passed down to a destined individual
. Once inherited, it could not be transferred to another person, making it a
one-time-only
 opportunity.

Since reaching the
Immortal State
 had become impossible in the current world, the
Tyrant Body Tempering Technique
 was one of the few remaining methods for a cultivator to achieve
godlike power
 through sheer physical strength.

Wan Yiqian initially intended to pass down the
Tyrant Body Tempering Technique
 to a suitable successor who could help strengthen Myriad Treasures Store. After careful consideration, he approached
the Ao Family

Red Dragon Staff
, which enhances his projection ability and allows him to fly even in his non-physical form.

Plot

New Yan City

Wan Yiqian, approached Li Yunxiao, in the
New Yan city
 hoping to enlist his help against
Ling Baiyi
, who had disrespected the merchant alliance. Though normally cautious, Wan admitted this was one of the riskiest moves in his life. He offered Yunxiao a rare merchant token, granting full access to the Union’s resources, showing his sincerity. Yunxiao, however, was uninterested, believing the plan was too dangerous. Wan tried to persuade him, reminding him of their past agreement and his strong martial heart. Despite Yunxiao’s refusal, Wan hinted at deeper secrets, insisting that the Myriad Treasures Tower could offer him great benefits. He invited Yunxiao to discuss further in a safer place, wary of prying eyes. Though still hesitant, Yunxiao accepted the token, knowing its value, and pondered the situation as Wan’s projection vanished.

After the battle in
New Yan City
,
Wan Yiqian
 suffered a devastating blow, both physically and politically. As the head of
Myriad Treasures Store
, the most powerful faction in the
Merchant Union
, he had long been a dominant force in the business world. However,
Ding Shan's betrayal
 and his
expulsion from the Council of the Business Alliance
 shattered his standing overnight.

The shock of being cast out left
Wan Yiqian
 in a furious and desperate state. His rage nearly pushed him to self-destruction—
he attempted to detonate his dantian and the Cosmic Light Plate
 in a last-ditch effort to take
Ding Shan
 down with him. However, his attempt was thwarted by
Cangwu Qiong
, the ruler of the Sanctuary, who effortlessly sealed his divine weapon and stripped him of his chance at vengeance. At that moment,
Wan Yiqian realized that Ding Shan had been backed by the Sanctuary all along
,

Originally part of Ten Thousand Treasure Store's Ancient Treasure Trove, the
Tyrant Body Tempering Art
 was inside a medium of inheritance. Wan Yiqian sold it to the
Ao Family
, one of the
Hidden Families
.

Later, as a token of gratitude they gave Wan Yiqian the first part of the
Tyrant Body Tempering Art
 in a Jade Slip and the promise to owe him a favor.

Wan Yiqian sold Gu Feiyang
Tyrant Body Tempering Art
, but didn't tell him that he only got the first part of that technique. He wanted to see the consequences of only cultivating the first half of that technique.

Power

The cosmic light plate was a profound level weapon. The other half of it was called the universe light plate. The combination of the two was famous even in the ancient times.

Trivia

Wan Yuan
========

Wan Yuan, was one of the expert that invited by
Ding Shan
 to refining the
Nine Yin Nine Yang Pill.

Plot

Wan Yuan suffered a horrifying fate due to the failed alchemy process involving the
Nine Yin Nine Yang Pill
. Initially, he was struggling to maintain his strength, but after consuming
Ding Shan’s secret restoration pill
, he felt an overwhelming surge of power. Encouraged by this sensation, he continued pushing forward in the process. However, something went terribly wrong.

Instead of being replenished,
his body began to rapidly wither
, as if all his energy and life force were being
drained away
. His
eyes sank in, his skin shriveled, and his veins became disturbingly visible
 beneath his pale flesh. In mere moments, he was reduced to
a skeletal husk.

This terrifying scene sent
shockwaves through the group
, as they all began to experience
similar symptoms
—extreme exhaustion, wrinkling skin, and fading vitality. The situation revealed that Ding Shan had orchestrated some kind of sinister energy-draining
alchemy formation
, absorbing the life force of everyone present
except himself and Yunxiao
, who had also begun
absorbing the surrounding yin-yang energy
 to strengthen himself.

As the realization dawned on the group,
panic and chaos erupted
. It became clear that
Ding Shan had betrayed them

drain their strength for his own benefit

Plot

To become a monument, firstly abandon the flesh, and secondly become a slave to the World God monument. To say good to the guardian of this world. For example, the True Dragon, the nature, are the same as the World God monument. It is born of the boundaries of one world and inherits the will of this world.

But to become a monument, not only to abandon the flesh, but also in the blood will leave the mark of the spirit of the monument. This brand is actually a double-edged sword. In your descendants, because of the blood, you get the favor of the boundary. No matter, in talent, cultivation, and opportunity, it will be far better than ordinary people . But because of this kind of care, your achievements will always be suppressed in the territory of the king, and will be controlled by the boundary forces.

The original messages were recorded in the World God monument, the consciousness left by the kings of the ages. Although it was incomplete and chaotic, but because the information covered was very comprehensive, Li Yunxiao completely digested it, and suddenly grasped the seven eight. In the past, before the World God monument, the World God monument will refine it with great power, or plant it, destroy its body and make it a servant, just boarding in the World God monument. At the same time, the servant is washed by the boundary force to help him reach the World King Realm.

This process, when each generation of World God monument is majored in the peak of the creation, will be automatically triggered. And rare contenders, most of which can only be accepted as a spirit, become a slave to the World God monument. But there are also some extremely powerful existences. Although they are only the peak of the creation, they can compete with the power of the World King, thus maintaining the interdependence and not being refined by the World God monument. But since then it has been suppressed by the World God monument, it is difficult to take a step forward.

If someone rushed to the World King, the World God monument will be helpless and could not control them. What's more, after the revitalization process of the World God monument was triggered, not only was it not refining the World God monument, but it was mainly anti-customer, directly refining the World God monument. But such a presence is rare even in the endless years of Heavenly Martial World.

The ruthless consciousness that Li Yunxiao got was seldom, but it was too long to be recognized.
 After refine the World God monument By Li Yunxiao, The power that comes out of the World God monument at the moment is very different from the previous one. The gap is like the Martial Warrior and the Martial Sovereign. Although only one word is missing, it is a far cry.

The bearer of the World God Monument is Titled as the World God/God of the Universe, capable of controlling the rules of the Realm.

Trivia

the divine realm tablet not only has its own world, but it also involves the realm power of the heavenly martial realm and connected to the realm power of the heavenly martial realm.

Wu
==

Wu
 is one of the true spirits of heaven and earth, but whether it's at the Ten Directions Divine Realm or not is unknown.

General Information

Among the many ancient true spirits, this one is the most mysterious. No one has ever witnessed it taking action, and it seems to lack sentience, or its intelligence is nearly nonexistent. Every time it appears, it merely hovers in space before slowly vanishing. Its disappearance isn't a retreat into the void, but rather it devours itself.

Once, a powerful expert attempted to tame a 'Wu' as his own beast companion, trying various methods. Eventually, 'Wu' sustained an injury and began to devour itself slowly. After a long period, when 'Wu' reappeared, it was injured!

Some later scholars specifically researched 'Wu.' After all, ancient true spirits had completely disappeared. To unveil the secrets of the Ten Directions Divine Realm, 'Wu' became the ultimate subject of study. What astonished everyone was that 'Wu' possesses an exceptionally unique spatial aspect within its body, distinctly different from our common understanding of the void. After 'Wu' devours itself, its entire body enters that space. Nobody knows how many long years will pass before it re-emerges.

However, over these many years, few have witnessed 'Wu' appearing, and even if they did, they wouldn't recognize it. It doesn't harm anyone.

Power

In fact,  he was quite strong, and with his endless nonsense, he dared to say anything, which was why he could deceive people time and time. But unfortunately, the gap between him and the real li Yunxiao was too great.

When Yunxiao threatened to activate the self-destruction of the Green Phoenix Floating Battleship and the Six-Universe Star Observation formation, causing panic among the onlookers, Xin Pi stepped in. He pleaded with Yunxiao to stop, fearing the catastrophic consequences that would follow.

Xin Pi recognized the danger posed by Yunxiao's threat and understood that the Zhou family's reputation and the lives of many innocent people were at stake. He urgently appealed to Yunxiao to reconsider and offered to mediate a peaceful resolution between the parties involved. Despite the initial reluctance and defiance from Yunxiao, Xin Pi's persistence and understanding of the gravity of the situation eventually convinced Yunxiao to halt the self-destruction.

Furthermore, during the negotiation process, Xin Pi played a key role in agreeing to Yunxiao's conditions on behalf of the Zhou family. He conceded to Yunxiao's demands for the release of
Qin Ruxue
, the compensation of Five Million Mid-Grade Primordial Stones, a public apology to
Tianshui Kingdom
, and compensation of Fifty Million Mid-Grade Primordial Stones for Yunxiao's losses. Xin Pi's agreement was driven by the understanding that the consequences of refusing Yunxiao's conditions and allowing the self-destruction of the warship would be catastrophic for the Zhou family and the entire Shangyang city.

The Golden Crow Arena

Xin Pi tried to mediate the situation when Li Yunxiao arrived at the arena with a powerful Martial Grandmaster level demonic beast, stunning everyone. The Zhou family accused Li Yunxiao of cheating in the duel and demanded proof of his beast-taming abilities. Li Yunxiao demonstrated his control over the demonic beast, making it obey his commands, silencing the accusers and impressing the crowd. Later, when Li Yunxiao refused to fight without the beast,
Zhou Changfa
 negotiated and compensated him with Sixty Million Mid-Grade Primal Stones to put it away.

Zhou Yushan
 and counterattacked with exceptional comprehension and skill in his sword technique.

Xin Pi observed the duel between Li Yunxiao and Zhou Yushan and noticed Li Yunxiao's use of seals that even surpassed the Floating Life Seal of
Yang Di
. He discussed this with other experts, speculating that Li Yunxiao might be a successor of one of Gu Feiyang's disciples. Xin Pi also witnessed the intense clash between Li Yunxiao's Heaven and Earth Seal and Zhou Yushan's Snow & Frost Bright Sword, resulting in Zhou Yushan's disappearance from the stage. Xin Pi was shocked by Li Yunxiao's strength and calmly assessed the situation, realizing that there was no one in the
Southern Region
 capable of killing him.

After the duel, Li Yunxiao demanded 100 Million middle-grade Spirit Stones from Xin Pi to settle the matter. The Zhou Great Family suffered a significant blow to their reputation due to these events. Zhou Yushan's death and Zhou Yangbiao's punishment.

Later, he brought the stones to Li Yunxiao in the Duskflame's Association of Alchemist, and he was present when Li Yunxiao defeated a three Rank-Four Alchemist and takes the fifth-tier badge.

Mount Meru
 secret realm.

Chu Yu
 and
Huo Sen

 arrives at the Tiger King Chariot, Xin Pi becomes relieved, as he was worried about Li Yunxiao's absence. He later gets into a confrontation with Chu Yu, another Martial Emperor, but is interrupted by Huo Sen, who urges them to focus on the competition for the slots.

As the competition progresses, Xin Pi remains confident in Li Yunxiao's abilities, particularly after witnessing his performance against a Martial Grandmaster in Shangyang City. Xin Pi also supports Li Yunxiao when Chu Yu tries to provoke him. However, he also becomes wary of potential conflicts escalating into a larger-scale war between Empires.

Additionally, Xin Pi is unaware of the plot involving the Zhou Family, one of the four big families of the Fire Crow Empire, who secretly seeks to have the

Xin Ze
======

He is one of the Xin Imperial Family, the great uncle of the
Duskflame
's emperor, and a Fourth-Tier Alchemist from the
Duskflame Empire
's Alchemist Association. Even if he is not a High-Tier Alchemist, he is still a renowned figure in the Shangyang City duel to his relationship to the current emperor.

Plot

Duskflame's Alchemist Association

Xin Ze is one of the three Rank-Four Alchemist masters present during the confrontation with Li Yunxiao. When
Li Yunxiao
 challenges all three of them to a duel, Xin Ze becomes offended by his arrogance and accepts the challenge. He, along with the other two alchemist masters, show off their most precious treasures to use as gambling stakes.

Xin Ze presents a seventh-tier quality
Cosmic Sun Note Jade
, which greatly enhances an alchemist master's refining abilities. The other two alchemist masters,
Lu Haochu
 and
Ge Xiangqian
, offer a
Heavenly Flame Battle Flag
 and a pair of
Purple Cloud Centipede Wings
, respectively, as their gambling stakes.

To everyone's astonishment, Li Yunxiao claims that someone will bring the 100 million mid-grade primal stones for the gambling bet soon. Xin Ze, initially skeptical, is proven wrong when his brother,
Xin Pi
, arrives and hands over the 100 million mid-grade primal stones as promised.

Despite the disbelief and shock from the other alchemist masters, their confidence in winning the bet is gradually shaken as he observes Li Yunxiao's demeanor, which shows deep certainty of victory against the three of them.

The Alchemy Competition

As the competition begins, Li Yunxiao surprises everyone by suggesting that each of the three alchemist masters will condense one primal stone, while he alone will condense two primal stones simultaneously. This shocks the three alchemist masters, as it increases the difficulty of the competition significantly.

Despite their anger and disbelief, they continue with the competition. Li Yunxiao impresses them with his mastery of the Twelve Forms of Flying Flower and Falling Snow, a set of refining techniques created by the renowned alchemist, Gu Feiyang. Li Yunxiao's use of these advanced techniques and his overall proficiency in alchemy leave the three alchemist masters in awe and shock.

Finally, Ge Xiangqian can no longer hold back and attacks first, using the same method as Li Yunxiao to condense his primal stone. The competition is now underway, and everyone is eager to see who will come out victorious.

Ge Xiangqian managed to raise the primal stone to a low-grade level but exhausted a lot of energy in the process, leaving him visibly fatigued. Next, Lu Haochu took over, using his Yamata Branch Heart Cultivation Mantra to condense the primal stone. His technique was beautiful and dreamy, but he also struggled to match Li Yunxiao's level of refinement.

Li Yunxiao, on the other hand, effortlessly advanced his primal stone to the middle grade, showcasing his superior understanding and control of the Twelve Forms of Flying Flower and Falling Snow. He surprised everyone by using a new and mysterious technique called the Scripture of Rippling Mirage. The technique impressed even Baili Gongjin, a rank six alchemist, who recognized its profoundness and admitted his admiration for Li Yunxiao's mastery.

After Baili Gongjin shared the story of his encounter with Lord Gu Feiyang and his advice, Lu Haochu attempted to condense a primal stone using his powerful soul force. However, his technique lacked finesse and appeared clumsy compared to Li Yunxiao's mastery. He raised the primal stone to a High-grade level but felt fatigued after the effort. In response, Li Yunxiao managed to advance the primal stone to a high-grade level, impressing everyone with his skills and talent.

Now, Xin Ze is attempting to advance the primal stone to the supreme-grade level, while Li Yunxiao is doing the same. Despite Li Yunxiao's exhausted state, he surprises everyone by suddenly revitalizing and displaying incredible control over his soul power and the primordial stone, keeping up with Xin Ze's progress. Xin Ze then revealed a powerful soul refining technique, "Rising Moon Over the Sea," to push his primal stone to a pseudo-supreme grade. In response, Li Yunxiao also utilized an ancient scripture to keep up and maintain a pseudo-supreme grade. The two yuan stones were evenly matched, but Li Yunxiao's yuan stone was slightly larger, indicating a potential advantage.

Just when it seemed like Li Yunxiao was about to win, Xin Ze decided to risk it all and swallowed a valuable rank seven beast soul pellet, "Purple Qi from the East," which significantly boosted his soul power. With renewed strength, he successfully advanced his primal stone to the supreme-grade level, surpassing Li Yunxiao's pseudo-supreme grade. Li Yunxiao, already exhausted and at the end of his energy, borrowed soul power from the sapling of the
Kunwu Divine Tree
, threatening it with the Vast Heaven Universe Metal if it refused to assist him. With the combined power of his main body using the
Great Evolution God Art
, Li Yunxiao managed to infuse even more power into his yuan stone. Pushing it past the supreme-grade and attempting to break through to the Innate Primordial Elixir level.

Li Yunxiao succeeded in forming the Innate Primordial Elixir, a divine object, which amazed all the alchemists present. Even the Supreme-grade primal stone he used to create it transformed into the Inner Core, which symbolized the Innate Primordial Elixir. Witnessing Li Yunxiao's extraordinary skill and calm demeanor, the other alchemists, including Xin Ze, Ge Xiangqian, and Lv Haochu, were deeply impressed. In a show of respect and admiration, the three fourth-grade Alchemists knelt down and expressed their admiration for Li Yunxiao's prowess.

Martial Emperor
. Obsessed with revenge and restoring his bloodline, but ultimately falls in battle against
Duan Yue
 and
Yunxiao
, losing both his life and his treasured fire. With the death of
Xingyang Huo
, a thousand-year-old aristocratic family crumbled.

Plot

Supreme Palace
 for revenge after the annihilation of the Xingyang family. As the sole survivor, he was determined to both avenge his fallen kin and ensure the continuation of his bloodline. He mercilessly slaughtered more than half of Supreme Palace’s disciples, and even the Supreme Palace Lord,
Ma Tianhe
, and his son perished after days of torture, despite their ignorance of the truth he sought.

By coincidence,
Li Yi
 was present in Supreme Palace when the incident occurred. When he was interrogated by Xingyang Huo, he shifted the blame for the annihilation of the Xingyang family onto Li Yunxiao. Before heading to
Martial Flame City
 to seek Yunxiao, Xingyang Huo ordered the remaining survivors of Supreme Palace to capture young girls in an attempt to repopulate the Xingyang family.

Later, when Xingyang Huo arrived in
Martial Flame City
, he was shocked to discover that the city was protected by a powerful array hidden within a small, unsightly pagoda. Despite his attacks bolstered by the
Bluelotus Earth Fire
, which was nearly as powerful as a strike from a genuine
Martial Emperor
 the pagoda remained completely unharmed. Just as he was reeling from this,
Yunxiao
 appeared before him.

Even though Xingyang Huo knew that Yunxiao possessed a flame far superior to his own, his pride would not allow him to back down. The moment Yunxiao appeared, the battle between them erupted instantly. Yunxiao unleashed his only wisp of the
True Phoenix Flame
, while Xingyang Huo countered with the
Bluelotus Earth Fire
. Their flames clashed in midair, sending shockwaves across the battlefield. The terrifying force of their exchange left both sides heavily injured, neither able to gain the upper hand.

Duan Yue
 landed before him, stepping down from the
Bluewolf Chariot
. The unexpected interference sent a wave of shock through Xingyang Huo, the vast gap in cultivation between him and Duan Yue made him wary.

Realizing the seriousness of the situation, Xingyang Huo fought with all his might. However, the difference in strength was insurmountable. With Yunxiao’s
illusion techniques
 weaving through the battle, Xingyang Huo found himself ensnared, unable to distinguish reality from deception. His resistance crumbled under the combined assault. In the end, not only was he slain by Duan Yue, but his
Bluelotus Earth Fire
 was also forcibly seized.

Appearance

An old man with a curly beard.

Power

Yi Hongming possesses the bloodline of Zhuyan, a powerful ancient beast resembling a red-furred ape with a white head, massive feet, and a golden "Yan" character on its chest.

Yi Qing
=======

Xuan Bing
 and the corpses of the Flying Frost Sect. Their overwhelming strength left a deep impression on him.

Upon hearing that one of the attackers resembled Tang Jie, Yi Qing immediately grasped the gravity of the situation. If Tang Jie was truly involved, then the danger was far greater than he had initially anticipated

After careful deliberation, Yi Qing made a decisive choice to pursue Tang Jie and his mysterious group, Later, during the battle between his side and the mysterious monster group, he and his subordinates were annihilated.

Yi Xi
=====

Appearance

A young man with  ugly face, he about thirty years old.

Personality

Yi Xi is arrogant, cunning, and pragmatic. He is quick to anger when his pride is challenged but can also be calculating when assessing a situation.

He values his own survival and will exploit technicalities or loopholes to his advantage, as seen in his attempt to manipulate Tian Xingzi's promise to protect.

Plot

Shang Chen
 had been ordered by Wei Qing to pursue
Yuan Gaohan
main body and capture him. However, their mission took a disastrous turn when they encountered Li Yunxiao and
Tian Xingzi
 at
Battle Soul Mountain,

As Yi Xi tried to follow Shang Chen in retreat, Li Yunxiao swiftly acted, unleashing the
Thirty-Six Northern Heaven Cold Stars
 to cut off Yi Xi’s path, trapping him in a cage of gleaming starlight. Struggling and desperate, Yi Xi found himself cornered.

At that moment, a chilling voice echoed in the air.
Qiu Mujie
, who had been hiding and silently watching Li Yunxiao’s battle with
Dark Division
, finally revealed himself. Stepping forward, he confronted his traitorous adopted son. Yi Xi’s face turned deathly pale as terror gripped him—he knew there was no escape.

Qiu Mujie wasted no time. Without mercy, he extended his hand and
directly extracted Yi Xi’s soul
, tearing it from his body to search his memories. Yi Xi’s screams of agony were brief, fading as his essence was pulled apart. Once Qiu Mujie had obtained what he needed, he coldly crushed the struggling remnants of Yi Xi’s soul, erasing him from existence.

Power

Yi Xi's technique involves refining the corpses of powerful warriors into corpse puppets using talismans. He summons seven coffins—one dark gold and six dark red—which explode to reveal lifelike, armored corpses. The central figure, a
Warlord
 in a golden crown and battle robe, exudes an imposing presence. Although the power of these corpse puppets was far less than when they were alive, These corpse puppets are highly durable and nearly indestructible, far surpassing ordinary ones due to specialized refinement.

Man
" possessed the Yin yu body, he fought fiercely against Yunxiao’s group, shattering the
Realm of Eternal Life

Heavenly Martial Realm's
 rules activated, suppressing the Demon King’s power. This gave the Yin Yu a chance to reclaim his body and, in his fury, he killed the other Devil Lord

His condition was clear—the marriage between Tang Xin and Jiang Ruobing must be annulled, and the Four Extremes Sect must withdraw from Red Moon City.

Originally, his body was meant to achieve the Immortal Extreme Yin Body, a powerful and unparalleled physique.

To avoid this fate, Yu Yixian stopped just short of fully completing the transformation, leaving a tiny imperfection in his Yin Body. This small flaw prevented his complete sacrifice, allowing him to remain alive and hide within the body. At the same time, he sealed a part of his soul within it, biding his time for later generations to arrive.

However, this plan was disrupted by external events—most notably the Ghost King’s intervention, which forced Yu Shengfeng into a desperate situation. This unforeseen conflict prevented Yu Yixian from continuing his slow, careful plan and ultimately led to his downfall. Now, his remnant soul remains, but he is at the mercy of Yu Shengfeng, who intends to use him for his own ends.

Plot

As the princess's
Qin Ruxue
 condition worsened, he heard from
Jia Rong
 that Li Yunxiao might be able to cure her illness. At first, he was skeptical—how could a young boy possibly know a method that even he, a Three-Tier Alchemist, did not?

However, after learning that Li Yunxiao might be Yang Di’s disciple, his doubt turned into urgency. With Li Yunxiao missing, he mobilized all the power the Alchemist Association could muster to track down his whereabouts.

Zhang Shaotian
==============

He is a Nine-Star Martial Supreme and an Elite Disciple from of the
Western Region
's
Major Forces
, the
Devouring Soul Sect
. As the most of the sect's disciples, he cultivated the Profound Artifact known as Soul Devouring Banner, used to imprison the souls of humans, monsters, and other living beings.

Plot

Demon Origin Plains

Zhang Shaotian and his four junior members, arrive on the scene, revealing their sinister nature and the terrifying power of their sect. They unveil a black banner bearing a frightening image, representing the Devouring Soul Sect's brutal reputation for extracting souls. This sight instills fear and recognition among the gathered warriors, including
Zou Chen
 and
Kang Wu
.

Kang Wu, once defiant and confident, is reduced to submission before the Devouring Soul Sect, showing the sect's fearsome influence. Despite the warriors' initial resistance, they find themselves trapped in a desperate battle against the Soul Devouring Banner wielded by the Devouring Soul Sect members. The sect employs soul-extracting techniques to immobilize and capture some of the warriors, subjecting them to the horrifying process of soul extraction.

Zhang Shaotian's junior members display cruel delight in the martial artists' suffering, likening it to their enjoyment of extracting souls from demonic beasts. The horrifying power of the Soul Devouring Banner is demonstrated as the martial artists' souls are consumed, leaving behind lifeless bodies. This nightmarish scene of despair showcases the callous and ruthless cultivation methods of the Devouring Soul Sect.

As the Devouring Soul Sect members continue to extract souls, an unexpected turn of events unfolds. A horde of Five Elements Spirit Devouring Rats, possessing wings and the ability to fly, emerges from the ground. These rats overwhelm the sect members, forcing them to flee in the face of this unexpected threat.

Later, he killed two juniors of the four who were with him, which leaded his Soul Devouring Barrier to reach the 9th Rank. Just as they continued their journey they encounter
Qing Luo
 and her companions from the
Empyrean One Pavillion
, eventually, they killed her and all her companions and continued their journey.

Illusionary Realm of the Water Moon Flower Mirror

Inside the Illusionary Realm of the Water Moon Flower Mirror, Zhang Shaotian and his juniors confront
Li Yunxiao
,
Ye Fan
 and their companions. They demand information on how to break the array and offers to spare Li Yunxiao's life if he complies. Li Yunxiao initiates an attack against Zhang Shaotian and his group. Li Yunxiao employs his Eye Technique and Spring Life Qi to confound and suppress Zhang Shaotian, temporarily gaining the upper hand. However, Zhang Shaotian manages to counteract the attack and escapes the restraints. The Soul Devouring Clan members vow to follow the Sacred Fire Temple group through the illusion. Li Yunxiao successfully uses his array skills to shift the Tiger King War Chariot into the Summer Boundary, the next layer of the Four Seasons Boundary.

Later, in another place,
Li
's attempt to break the formation triggers catastrophic consequences, Little Qing, who has been observing, warns that disaster is looming. The formation's instability leads to the sudden rise of an enormous ice mountain that engulfs Li, while the surrounding area experiences chaotic shifts between the four seasons.

The mountain's peak undergoes rapid transformations, with spring, summer, autumn, and winter all manifesting at different levels. The mountain's appearance reflects the four seasons, with spring at the midpoint, peach blossoms, withered trees, and snow at the base. Meanwhile, an immense boundary of the four seasons emerges in the distance, revealing the Immortal Mountain of lord
Throne
.

Li Yunxiao successfully defends himself against an ambush by Zhang Shaotian and his fellow Soul Devouring Sect disciples. Utilizing his control over the rule of Autumn, he overpowers one of the disciples and eliminates him. Zhang Shaotian is taken aback by Li Yunxiao's ability to wield the power of rules and realizes the threat he poses.

Li Yunxiao proposes a cooperation to escape the barrier and seize Throne's Immortal Mountain. Zhang Shaotian is intrigued by the potential of obtaining the Immortal Mountain and agrees to the plan, with the condition that Li Yunxiao shares the secret method to condense the laws of heaven and earth, which could bolster his strength to contend with the Martial Sovereigns from Myriad Star Valley.

With Zhang Shaotian's brute force, they retrieve a powerful artifact, a long gray banner, from the body of a deceased junior disciple of the Soul Devouring Sect. The banner's main soul has been extracted, and its power diminished, but the artifact still holds a malevolent aura.

Four Seasons Immortal Mountain

Li Yunxiao
 and his group, including Zhang Shaotian and others, enter the Immortal Mountain and are awed by the profound changes in the surroundings. Li Yunxiao reveals that the Soul Devouring Sect members possess a secret technique for soul-searching, which they can use to locate living and even deceased souls. This technique sparks both intrigue and discomfort among the group. Zhang Shaotian employs his Soul Devouring Sect's soul-searching ability through a golden soul slave to find traces of other individuals within the vast mountain. That leaded to a fight against
Tang Jie
 and his Companions.

As Zhang Shaotian's Soul Devouring Gonfalon faces off against Tang Jie's Vermilion Bird Saber, the confrontation creates a stunning clash of power. Tang Jie's profound artifact is a ninth-grade weapon, and its overwhelming strength surprises Zhang Shaotian, making him realize the potential benefits of refining a ninth-grade profound artifact in conjunction with his Soul Devouring Gonfalon. This revelation adds to Zhang Shaotian's determination to capture Tang Jie and take advantage of his connection to the Vermilion Bird Saber.

As the battle unfolds, Tang Jie's fear reaches its peak as he witnesses the horrifying power of the golden soul slave when Zhang Shaotian extract the soul of the living
Dan Yangze
. However,
Shen Feng
 intervenes to save Tang Jie, suppressing the soul slave and briefly turning the tide of the battle. Zhang Shaotian retreats, and a standoff ensues between Shen Feng and Li Yunxiao's group.

Tang Jie seeks to persuade Shen Feng to eliminate their enemies, but Shen Feng hesitates due to the dangerous environment and the potential for wasting his strength. Li Yunxiao engages in a tense verbal exchange with Shen Feng, asserting that he is not afraid and even challenging Shen Feng's strength. Shen Feng eventually decides not to engage in a direct confrontation, opting to leave the situation for later resolution outside the barrier.

Shen Feng shares his findings about the Immortal Mountain's strange environment and the disappearance of Mister Yu and his group. They discover a peculiar cliff that absorbs divine sense and essence upon contact, revealing a hidden space resembling a giant chessboard.
Shang
 and the other Great Monsters, including
Yu
, also appear in this space. Tang Jie's eagerness for revenge against Li Yunxiao intensifies. Shang orders an attack against Li Yunxiao and his group, including Zhang Shaotian. However, the unique environment suppresses the use of Primordial Qi and Essence, rendering the attackers powerless. Li Yunxiao's true power becomes apparent as he effortlessly defeats Tang Jie despite the restrictions, leaving the group of Great Monsters stunned.
