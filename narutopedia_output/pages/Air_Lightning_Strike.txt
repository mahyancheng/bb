The user punches the opponent twice with their fist, then palms them upward to launch them high into the air. The user then jumps above them and punches them back down. Then, the user binds the opponent with large
shuriken
 from above, then lands several powerful blows while spinning like a drill, drilling the opponent into the ground. Upon the user hopping off of their target, the victim even ends up spinning along the ground afterwards due to the momentum of the prior spin.

Trivia

In the
Naruto: Clash of Ninja
 series, Kakashi can perform this technique by copying it with his
Sharingan
.

However, this only applies to the first two games; in
Gekitō Ninja Taisen 3
 and
4
 Kakashi can only copy the
Air Lightning Bullet
 instead due to Air Lightning Strike's re-allocated command.

The term "raigeki" is a term for either a lightning strike or a torpedo attack.

While Mizuki's version functions the same way, it instead has the name Kūsengeki (空旋撃, lit. Air Whirling Strike) instead.

There is a variation of this technique, where the user will stomp on the opponent's chest on the finishing blow instead of doing multiple hits.
