Black Lightning
 is a unique form of
Lightning Release
 utilised by the
Third Raikage
, who passed it on to
Darui
 alone.
 Not much is known about it, but as the name suggests, the lightning produced is black in colour.

Trivia

Both users have the stylised kanji for "lightning" (
雷
,
kaminari
) tattooed on their shoulders; Darui on his left and the Third on his right. This seems to be a distinctive tradition, as
Ginkaku
 and
Kinkaku
 recognised
Darui
's possession of this ability through his tattoo.

Sasuke Uchiha
 demonstrated the ability to use
something
 resembling this when he fought against
Naruto Uzumaki
 at the
Valley of the End
 in Part I,
 and when he
attacked

Madara Uchiha
 in the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 after receiving
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
's power.

Kakashi Hatake
's
lightning attack
 also became
black in colour
 after receiving the
Six Paths Power
 from
Obito Uchiha
 while battling against
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 in the Fourth Shinobi World War.

In the anime,
Tsukiyo
 has displayed Lightning Release similar in appearance to this, though his has a magenta glow.
