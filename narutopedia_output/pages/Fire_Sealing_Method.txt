The user first readies a scroll that they've previously inscribed with a special
sealing
 formula, which has a blank space left in its centre. They then activate this technique, quickly sucking any nearby
Fire Release
 into the blank space and sealing it there, signified by the appearance of the kanji for "seal" (
封
). Regardless of any special properties that the flames may have, such as those of
Amaterasu
, they will remain sealed until the user chooses to unseal them. Because this technique is designed for Fire Release, performing it requires expertise in not only using seals but
ninjutsu
 as well.
