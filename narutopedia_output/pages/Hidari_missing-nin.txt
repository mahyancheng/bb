Hidari
 (
ヒダリ
,
Hidari
) is a former
shinobi
 turned
mercenary
 alongside his partner
Ashimaru
.

Background

After the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 ended, Hidari and Ashimaru lost their jobs, leading to them taking
missions
 directly. Fifteen years later, the pair was hired by
Iori
, with the objective to retrieve the deed to the
Green Banks
 bridge. Providing Iori with
poison
, he used it to kill the
village head
 of Green Banks. For three months, the two assaulted the village in an attempt to force the new village head
Kiri
 into handing over the deed.

Personality

Hidari is a very sadistic individual. He enjoys killing bystanders and is very traitorous, turning against his employer to increase personal benefits. He is disgusted by the more peaceful era brought on by the winning of the Fourth Shinobi World War, so much that he went rogue. He also views the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
, who are the cornerstone of this new era, as having grown weak from this change in era. At the same time, he is very cowardly. Once seeing an opponent is stronger than him, he quickly loses his resolve to fight.

Appearance

Hidari is a fairly tall man of light complexion. He has long brown hair with short bangs over his ears. He wears beaded white earrings and black pants with a white robe. The robe only has a left sleeve while his right arm is wrapped in bandages. He also wears red makeup covering his eyes and forehead.

Abilities

Hidari is a fairly capable ninja. He excels in strategy and manipulation. In battle, he was able to hold his own for a period against
Konohamaru Sarutobi
. He has skill in
Earth Release
 and
Juinjutsu
, able to use both to
trap
 his foes. He can also use
Yin Release
 for
Genjutsu
, able to brainwash a large number of people into mindless attacking others.

Genin Mission Arc






Hidari and Ashimaru facing Konohamaru.



When Kiri requested
Konohagakure
 for aid against Hidari and Ashimaru, Hidari devised a plan to capture her and ransom her for the deed. After Iori captured Kiri, Hidari and Ashimaru killed Iori. They then turned their attention to the Konoha-nin, planning to kill them. While Hidari faced Konohamaru, he sent Ashimaru to get
the genin
. While initially managing to trap Konohamaru, the jōnin quickly escaped with his
Rasengan
. Once Konohamaru showed the power he wielded by obliterating the rock surface near him, Hidari fainted in horror.

Trivia

Hidari (
左
) means "left" or "left-hand".
