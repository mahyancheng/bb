Hina
 (
ヒナ
) is a
ninneko
 that lives with
Nekobaa
 at an
Uchiha

supply base
.

Personality

Hina has a very calm and almost pleasant disposition most of the time, even after being called talking tanuki by
Suigetsu Hōzuki
, she seemed unperturbed, unlike her partner
Denka
, who was seemingly outraged.

Appearance

Hina is predominantly a light-coloured brown with darker markings on her cheeks. Suigetsu, when he first met them, mistook the two for talking
tanuki
.
 She wears a simple red kimono with mesh armour underneath, held closed by a simple white sash.

Abilities

While nothing has been seen of their abilities,
Sasuke Uchiha
 did note that Suigetsu would end up a scratching post if he messed with her and Denka.

Part II

Itachi Pursuit Mission

When Sasuke and
Hebi
 made their way to the old Uchiha supply base, Hina and Denka greeted them at the entrance and were glad to see Sasuke. However, when Suigetsu began treating them like common cats, Denka, who was seemingly outraged at this, hissed at him, while Hina merely asked Sasuke whether or not he had brought them any treats. When Sasuke later warned Suigetsu about the two and then made the reason for his visit clear, she and Denka led them to where Nekobaa and
Tamaki
 were so they could get supplies.
