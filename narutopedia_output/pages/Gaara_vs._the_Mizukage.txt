 manga.

Summary

The
Second Mizukage
 comments on how he wasn't defeated despite divulging his weaknesses.
Gaara
 pants and notices how the Mizukage's
oily water
 seeps into his sand and makes it unusable. The Mizukage angrily resents Gaara for trying to defeat
Mū
 first. Gaara acknowledges the Mizukage's strength. Gaara
detects
 the
Giant Clam
's location,
showing

Ōnoki
 where to shoot his
Dust Release
, but since he has used up too much chakra against Mū, he can't use it. Instead, he decides to
punch
 it. The punch closes the Giant Clam but doesn't dispel the
genjutsu
. The Mizukage says that if the Tsuchikage that if he doesn't put more strength into it, straining his back, his attack won't do a thing to the clam, noticing him to have stopped using Dust Release due to his chakra use. Ōnoki
increases the weight
 of his fist on the Giant Clam and smashes it, throwing his back in the process. The genjutsu is broken. The Mizukage
strikes
 the Tsuchikage, but it turns out to be a
decoy
 placed by Gaara. Gaara immobilises the Mizukage with
great amounts of sand
 so the oily water can't seep through it all. The
Sealing Team
 starts to work, but the sand
explodes
 before they can finish, the Mizukage's visage appearing in the steam. Ōnoki tells Gaara this isn't genjutsu, but the ninjutsu not even Mū knew how to counter.
