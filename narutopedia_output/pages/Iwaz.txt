) is a

Personality

Appearance

He bears great resemblance to his eldest brother, in that they are both very muscular, albeit Iwazō is a lot more stocky, and they both have shaved heads and wear spiked, black, wristbands. He has dark markings around his eyes and wears the standard Iwagakure flack jacket, without a shirt underneath, but still wears the traditional pants and lapel, with sandals. He also wears bandages around his arms.

Abilities

He possesses skill with
Earth Release
 techniques, being capable of using the
