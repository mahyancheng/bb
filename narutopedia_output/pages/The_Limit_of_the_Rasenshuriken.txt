Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Naruto
 prepares a
Rasenshuriken
 with his
chakra arms
.
Temari
 notes it to be a Wind Release variation of the Rasengan. Naruto guides the Rasenshuriken towards the
Third Raikage
 with a chakra arm, but he dodges.
Dodai
 notes the attack won't work since the Raikage has the
Lightning Release Chakra Mode
 on. Naruto counted on him dodging it, and uses the chakra arm to throw the attack in a new direction. The Raikage dodges it again, so Naruto catches the Rasenshuriken with a chakra arm and rams it against him at point blank. The
Sealing Team
 tries to
seal
 the Raikage, but he recovers before they can complete it, much to everyone's shock. The Third prepares his
strongest ninjutsu
. Dodai urges all to get away from the Third and commands Earth Release users to
build a wall
, which Dodai himself
reinforces
. Dodai explains the Third's technique. Against Dodai's recommendation and Temari's protests, some shinobi try attacking the Third when he breaks through the wall, only to be defeated. Dodai recounts how the Third was resilient, and Naruto asks him how the Raikage got his scar if he was so resistant. Dodai says he got it fighting the Eight-Tails by himself and that he didn't like to talk about it. Naruto decides using the
Tailed Beast Ball
, and starts charging it.
