Isago rescued Boruto Uzumaki and brought him to her house. When he woke up, Isago asked her father to allow Boruto to stay a while longer. In the evening, while playing cards with Boruto, an alarm went off, warning them of a broken fence. The next morning, she tried to extend Boruto's stay, but he had to leave. Isago was taken hostage by people who want Gojō's land, but was rescued by Boruto.

A while later, Isago's home was attacked by
Urashiki Ōtsutsuki
. When Boruto and Shiki arrived hoping to use their transmitter, they helped Isago take her father out of the rubble, and confirmed their attacker. Isago tended to her father after Boruto and
Shinki
 left.
