Nurui
 (
ヌルイ
) is a
shinobi
 of
Kumogakure

Personality

Noting that he was a cautious individual, Nurui's actions come off more as those of a coward's. Not one to play hero, he planned an escape for his team, even laying obvious traps as they went so that it would appear as though they had put up a fight. However, he is loyal to his comrades and while not a coward, does not believe that persons should risk their lives unnecessarily.

Nurui is of tall stature and has shoulder-length brown hair and green eyes. He wears the standard attire of the Kumo-nin with the exception of sleeves along with the
forehead protector
 of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
.

Abilities

Though showing no physical abilities per se, Nurui has proven himself to be a skilful strategist, using
Wire Strings
 to create fake traps to give the enemy a wrong image and lure him to a trap he made alongside
Kayui
 and
Yurui
 using the pre-existing environment and
Earth Release
. He was also very durable, able to survive a
Lightning Release
 attack by
Ameyuri Ringo
.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

After
Yurui
's death, Nurui became the de-facto captain of one of the
Third Division
's units. He opted to escape from
Ameyuri Ringo
 and refused to confront her even as his comrades fell one by one. When
Omoi
 decided they could run no longer, he tried to persuade him from fighting Ameyuri. When Omoi discarded this Nurui and
