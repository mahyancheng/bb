This mode envelops the user in a flowing blue
chakra
 and allows them to constantly heal themselves in the middle of the battle while at the same time, boost their strength and speed. Over time, this mode consumes the user's chakra until it finally wears off by itself, though the user or, more specifically, Sakura and Ino, can cancel it whenever they wish. Shizune and Karin, however, cannot.
