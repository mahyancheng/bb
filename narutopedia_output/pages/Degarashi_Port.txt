Degarashi Port.



Degarashi Port
 is a port town located on the eastern coast of the
Land of Tea
. It appears to be a popular tourist destination.

For ages, the
Wasabi
 and
Wagarashi families
 controlled local operations and policed the town, leading to constant skirmishes between the two
clans
 over territorial rights. These conflicts would go as far as to include the town citizens, often causing casualties.

The town plays a role in the Todoroki Great Shrine Race, a festival held every four years originally established to dedicate Ryoku's Jewels. However, over the years, the purpose of the race was shifted to determine who holds power in Degarashi Port. Following the events of the
Land of Tea Escort Mission
, the Wasabi family now holds ownership of the town.
