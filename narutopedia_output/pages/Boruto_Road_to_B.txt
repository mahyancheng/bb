Summary

In the Kishimoto portion,
Mitsuki
 discusses the heritage of the members of
Team Konohamaru
.
Konohamaru Sarutobi
 is the grandson of the
Third Hokage
, nephew of a
member
 of the
Twelve Guardian Ninja
, and son of two members of the
Anbu
.
Boruto Uzumaki
 is the son of the
Seventh Hokage
 and the "
Byakugan Princess
".
Sarada Uchiha
 is the daughter of the
last survivor
 of the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
 and a
disciple
 of the
Fifth Hokage
. Before he can explore his own heritage, Mitsuki runs out of page space and encourages readers to watch the movie to learn more about him.

In the Taira portion, Konohamaru gives his team a
bell test
. Misunderstanding the objective, Mitsuki
stretches his arm
 and grabs Konohamaru's testicles, leading Boruto to wonder if Mitsuki's father is
Monkey D. Luffy
 only to stand corrected by Mitsuki. Konohamaru escapes and prepares to attack with the
Rasengan
. Boruto counters with a similar stance, which Konohamaru initially believes to mean Boruto has already learned to use the Rasengan as well. Instead, Boruto squeezes a lemon in Konohamaru's eyes. While Konohamaru is down, Boruto makes three
shadow clones
 and they defeat Konohamaru with the "Seductive Adult Four Technique". Mitsuki is impressed, but Sarada, embarrassed by everyone's behaviour, pummels Konohamaru and Boruto and takes both bells for herself.
