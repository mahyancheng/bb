 head towards the battlefield, the
Nine-Tails
 pulls Naruto into his subconscious and berates him for squandering its
chakra
 like that. Naruto and the fox have a conversation and the fox tells him to stop being naive as there was no way he could shoulder the hatred of an entire
war
 and
Sasuke
. After a flashback of Naruto and Sasuke while in the
Academy

torii
 to pin the fox down. Naruto then stares dead into the Nine-Tails' eye and brimming with confidence tells him that he will do something about the war and Sasuke.

Kiba
 has him go to the
medical unit

Nagato
 and
Itachi
 talk about
Akatsuki

jōnin
-level medical-nin are later found dead. The sensors say they have not detected the enemy, and suspicion arises that someone is being controlled.
Sakura
 argues that despite that, they must keep healing the shinobi. Neji opts to find the spy. Sakura receives a love letter from another shinobi but tells him she has feelings for someone else. Two medical-nin are later seen preparing to get back to work, but Neji then reveals himself as the killer. He attacks and presumably kills the two medical-nin.

Madara's Strategy!!

Madara no Sakusen!!

After a short talk with an
Iwa shinobi
,
Sakura
 is shown pondering her feelings for
Sasuke
. The Iwa-nin leaves the tent. "
Neji
" enters the tent and startles Sakura.
Itachi
 and
Nagato
 discuss
Tobi
's strategy while waiting near a shrine, and the real
Neji
 is seen still in the battlefield, complaining to
Kiba
 that he doesn't want to go to the medical compound. Kiba tells Neji that getting himself killed from overexertion won't impress anyone, and chides Neji when he can't even tell Kiba and
Akamaru
 apart when he starts directing his responses to Akamaru instead of him.
Hinata
 and
Shino
 keep on watch with the
Byakugan
 and
kikaichū
 respectively. Shino tells her not to overdo it, to which Hinata responds that they are fighting the war to protect
Naruto
. "
Neji
" asks Sakura where
Shizune
 is, and she tells him she's tending to
Tonton
's leg. "
Neji
", assuming Tonton is a human, says that at least a leg injury is better than a hand injury, which would prevent Tonton from forming seals, arousing Sakura's suspicion that something with Neji is amiss. He asks her to take a look at his arm, which he claims is still causing him pain, simultaneously reaching for a kunai with his free hand, when Sakura
slams
 him into the ground before he can stab her. The "
Neji
" reverts into a White Zetsu clone, and recalling
Yamato
's report, Sakura figures out how the clone was able to imitate Neji perfectly. She then informs the HQ of her findings. Meanwhile, the White Zetsu continue their assassinations under the cover of night. At the headquarters,
Inoichi
 and
Ao
 relay the reports they receive to
Shikaku
, and he tries to formulate a strategy.
A
 and

Chapter 541

"
The Raikage vs. Naruto?!
" (
雷影VSナルト!?
,
Raikage Bāsasu Naruto!?
)

The
Raikage
 declares that he won't let
Naruto
 and
B
 go any further, and Naruto attempts to reason with him, albeit unsuccesfully. He then pleads
Tsunade
 to act, but she reluctantly refuses, stating that she's unable to take individual action as the
Hokage
 to help him this time. Naruto, understanding this, tries to escape, but the Raikage intercepts him. Tsunade marvels that Naruto is able to keep up with the Raikage, who states that he is the fastest shinobi alive now that the
Fourth Hokage
 has passed away. He angrily berates Naruto that he is just like his father — a hot-headed idiot — and that if the Fourth Hokage, who
Jiraiya
 had called the
Saviour of this World
, had succeeded in dealing with the
Nine-Tailed Fox
 that they would never be in this situation. The Raikage states that if Naruto still refuses to stand down, then he will have no choice but to kill him in order to prevent
Tobi
's plan from coming to fruition, and moves to attack him, but is stopped by B. The Raikage angrily tells them that they are
jinchūriki
 and cannot act on their own. Tsunade is furious that the Raikage would attempt to act without the approval of the rest of the
Kage
, and that he immediately went for Naruto, to which the Raikage replies that he would kill his brother too, if and when the time came, but that presently B is the more useful jinchūriki. B refuses to move aside, telling his brother that he's not merely a weapon, but an individual with things he loves and would fight for. They bump fists, and the Raikage recalls the time B was chosen to be his brother and partner.

Chapter 542

"
The Secret Story of the Strongest Tag Team!!
" (
最強タッグ秘話!!
,
Saikyō Taggu Hiwa!!
)

A
's flashback continues. The two "brothers" go on several missions together, on one of which they are joined by
A's cousin
. A and his cousin discuss the possibility of
Killer B
 becoming the next
jinchūriki
 of the
Eight-Tails
. A wonders if B will have enough control to suppress the Eight-Tails. A's cousin reflects on what it means to be a jinchūriki, and despite outwardly appearing to have everything, what a jinchūriki really needs is something to fill the hole in their heart and give them strength. Later, A and B are shown attending A's cousin's funeral. A sets B the goal of matching his own strength, to which B replies that someday he will surpass his brother. The day arrives when the Eight-Tails will be sealed in B, and A tells B that from here on out, things will be different. They bump fists, and A says that no matter what happens, he'll be there for him. Sometime later, A clashes with
Minato
 for the first time. Minato commends B for his bravery, and tells A that he should find out his brother's values as a person — what B holds most important — before he became neither a human nor a jinchūriki.

Chapter 543

"
Words not Cast Aside
" (
捨てられねェ言葉
,
Suterarenee Kotoba
)

The
Fourth Raikage
 tells
Minato
 to save his nonsense, and runs in to attack. Minato
moves
 to stab
B
, but B too has a blade pointing at Minato. Minato states that he's taken a liking to B. In the present,
Naruto
 moves to attack the Raikage, but misses. B and A trade blows, and B attempts to use the
Lightning Release: Lariat
 against his brother, who claims that B's Lightning Release: Lariat is inferior to his own. The Raikage calls for
Tsunade
's aid, but instead, she moves to stand in front of Naruto and B, remembering Naruto's promise that he wouldn't die until he became the Hokage, arguing that were Naruto to die, the next
jinchūriki
 wouldn't be able to control the
Nine-Tails
 as well as Naruto can. The Raikage asks what guarantee they have that Naruto will succeed. B again tries his Lightning Release: Lariat against the Raikage. The brothers recall the time the
Third Raikage
 passed away, when A told B that he didn't need to use the Lightning Release: Lariat anymore, that he should focus solely on improving his
Tailed Beast Ball
 and that he was forbidden to leave the
village
. Again, A and B clash with their Lightning Release: Lariat, with B's proving the strongest, much to A's dismay. B proceeds to tell him that his and Naruto's power doesn't come from being jinchūriki, and that his brother's words long ago gave him the strength to surpass him.

Chapter 544

"
Two Suns!!
" (
二つの太陽!!
,
Futatsu no Taiyō!!
)

At the
Allied Shinobi Forces HQ
,
Shikaku
 continues to search for a strategy to counter the
White Zetsu
. Elsewhere,
A
 marvels that his words gave
B
 the strength he needed to surpass him. B states that while a
jinchūriki
 might fall into the trap of losing hope and becoming "hollow", as long as they have something to fight for, they can overcome the
tailed beast
 within and retain their sense of humanity — a light to follow. He refers to these lights as "suns", stating that A is his sun, and Naruto has two "suns" — his
mother
 and his
father
. Naruto explains to
Tsunade
 and the Raikage how he met his parents and how they believed that he could overcome the
Nine-Tails
. He also mentions the "masked man", whom A guesses is
Tobi
. Tsunade marvels at Minato's foresight in perceiving Tobi as that big a threat, and consequently sealing the Nine-Tails inside Naruto. The Raikage asks if Minato, the "Saviour of this World", left everything to Naruto. Naruto replies that he doubts his father thought of himself as a saviour, but that
Jiraiya
 did, and that although Minato may have passed away, he and Kushina instilled in Naruto their faith that he could finish their job and fulfil that role. Tsunade asks A to let Naruto pass — to believe in Naruto. Naruto dodges the Raikage's fastest attack, to both B and Tsunade's astonishment, vowing that he won't fail. The Raikage states that he wanted to test Naruto in his own way, and that he is only the second person in the world to dodge his top-speed punch, telling Naruto that the saviour is alive and well within him, and allowing him to continue on, towards the battlefield. Back at the Allied Shinobi Forces HQ, Shikaku decides on using Naruto's ability to sense evil thoughts and intentions while in Nine-Tails Mode to seek out the White Zetsu impersonating the shinobi. Meanwhile, as the sun begins to rise, Tobi stands with a newly created
Six Paths of Pain
, composed of the reincarnated jinchūriki — all bearing both the
Sharingan
 and the
Rinnegan
.

Author's Note

“

Main character Naruto finally returns to centre stage in this volume! I'm so glad to be able to draw the titular character again! I was told by someone that this was "a manga where the main character
isn't very involved
 is used quite stingily," but he'll be really active from here on out!! ...I think! ...Er... Hmm, I wonder... I don't really know about the future... Well...
