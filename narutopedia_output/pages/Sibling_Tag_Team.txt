"
Sibling Tag Team
" (
兄弟、共闘!!
,
Kyōdai, Taggu!!
) is episode 334 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Itachi
 and
Sasuke
 stand as a united front, confronting
Kabuto
. The two activate their
Susanoo
 respectively and attack Kabuto. Kabuto reveals that he had developed a
similar
 ability to the
Hōzuki clan
's
Hydrification Technique
 as well as replicated
Karin
's
healing
 abilities and
Jūgo
's ability to absorb
natural energy
. To Itachi's shock, Kabuto noted that he had discovered the
Ryūchi Cave
 and
trained
 under the
White Snake Sage
, where
his master
 had failed. Sasuke says that Kabuto is nothing different from Orochimaru, a "disgusting"
snake
. An amused Kabuto stopped him and stated that he had evolved into a
dragon
 as the latter entered
Sage Mode
.
 Back at the battlefield,
Madara
's clones begin to activate their Susanoo, to the five
Kage
's horror. While the other Kage say that it's five-on-one,
Ōnoki
 suggests that they fight together, making it twenty five against five. Elsewhere, Kabuto casts a
technique
 that disallowed the two brothers from seeing or hearing. Kabuto attempts to attack Sasuke, but he is protected by Itachi. Itachi asks Sasuke if he remembered the plan they used while on a mission hunting a wild boar. Sasuke remembers and puts the plan into action, launching an arrow at Kabuto. Kabuto attempts to free himself from the arrow and with Itachi rushing in, he grabbed the
sword
 and stabbed him. It is however revealed to be a
crow clone
. The real Itachi uses his
Sharingan
 and then cuts off one of Kabuto's horns. Itachi says that Sasuke right now would have been able to take down that boar. The young man noted to his elder brother that instead of a wild boar, they have to take down the snake standing before them.

Trivia

Itachi's eyes were depicted with white
sclerae
 instead of black at the scene when Kabuto told him about the Ryūchi Cave.
