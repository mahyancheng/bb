Background

Mount Katsuragi became the home of the loyalists to
En no Gyōja
 after he and the elders of the clan split over the fate of the Tsuchigumo clan's kinjutsu. The majority of the clan remained in the village with the elders, while the few loyalists left for Mount Katsuragi, where their numbers dwindled down over the years to Hotaru and Tonbee.
