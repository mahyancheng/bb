The inside of one of Minato's safe houses.



Minato Namikaze
 had at least two safe houses somewhere on the outskirts of
Konohagakure
 which he utilised in case of an emergency. Inside, he kept his equipment including cloaks, and
Flying Thunder God Kunai
 amongst other items so he could teleport to and from the village in case something happened.

The first safe house was destroyed by a combination of Obito planting explosive tags on Naruto and Minato jumping to it to get it away from
Kushina
, himself, and Naruto. The second was destroyed by the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 when Minato teleported the beast there to seal it in his newborn son
Naruto Uzumaki
.
