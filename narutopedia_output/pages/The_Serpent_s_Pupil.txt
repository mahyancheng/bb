"
The Serpent's Pupil
" (
大蛇の瞳孔
,
Daija no Dōkō
) is episode 113 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Orochimaru
's current host body,
Gen'yūmaru
, begins to reject him, leaving the
sannin
 to cough up blood and consider initiating his
Living Corpse Reincarnation
.
Kabuto
 pulls out his
Ninja Info Cards
 from the
Chūnin Exam
 days three years ago, and Orochimaru recalls back when he
first encountered

Sasuke
 in the
Forest of Death
, when he ingested Sasuke's scroll and forced Sasuke to stab himself in the leg with a
kunai
. He tells Kabuto that he knew that Sasuke was the perfect host body for him
when he witnessed
 Sasuke activate his
Sharingan
 and combine the
Manipulating Windmill Triple Blades
 along with his
Fire Release: Dragon Fire Technique
 to burn him when he was using
Shiore
's body; subsequently, he remembers how he had given Sasuke the
Cursed Seal of Heaven
 and had encountered
Anko
 shortly after that. Orochimaru goes on to reminisce about Sasuke had fared in
his match
 against
Yoroi Akadō
, and how Yoroi had begun using his
chakra absorption
 in an attempt to draw out Sasuke's cursed seal, only for Sasuke to
repress it with willpower
 and defeat Yoroi with his
Lion Combo
. Kabuto remarks that this is when Orochimaru had decided to stick around and witness the rest of the exams, which Orochimaru claimed was a good idea as Sasuke had improved considerably by his
second match
, in which he had used the
Chidori
 against
Gaara
. As Orochimaru continues to hack up blood, Kabuto excuses himself to fetch more medicine.

Kabuto muses how Orochimaru is the only person he'd always be loyal to and faithfully serve, recalling Orochimaru's
attack on Konoha
, how he
managed to kill
 the
Third Hokage
 and the
Fourth Kazekage
, and the fact that he was able
go up against both

Jiraiya
 and
Tsunade
. In
Konoha
, Tsunade is told by an
Anbu
 that the squad sent to the lake have disappeared and that the
Three-Tails
 is no longer there, prompting the
Hokage
 to dispatch another squad. Concurrently, Sasuke remembers observing
Itachi

perfectly hit all targets
 with his
shurikenjutsu
 and manages to obliterate all of his targets with his
Chidori Current
. Satisfied with his progress, he walks to Orochimaru's room, where he uses his
Chidori Sharp Spear
 to go through the door in an attempt to impale Orochimaru's heart. Orochimaru manages to block the attack with his forearms and marvels at the perfect use of both
shape
 and
nature transformation
 as Sasuke uses his
sword
 to slice through the door. He tells Orochimaru that the sannin has nothing left to teach him and reveals that he had all intentions of giving up his body but does not wish to do so now that he is stronger than Orochimaru. He notes that he was always aware that all Orochimaru wanted was the power of the
Uchiha Clan
 and the
Sharingan
 but was no match for Itachi, and thus chose to go after the "baby of the clan". He adds that he finds Orochimaru's need for experiments on humans and ingestion of strange medicines in order to disrupt nature disgusting and that his efforts to become all-powerful and reach the level of Uchiha as pathetic, and even states that in his eyes Orochimaru along with other geniuses could never hope to match the prowess and talents of the Uchiha clan and are merely average compared to the Uchiha. Enraged, Orochimaru reveals his true form to Sasuke and attempts to steal his body, only for Sasuke to slice away all the snakes that bind him. Activating his cursed seal to the second stage, he tells Orochimaru that the latter is like a snake who was confined to the ground and wished to fly, and thus nurtured a baby bird in his own nest, only for the baby bird to grow into a hawk that will hunt the snake; Orochimaru then lunges at Sasuke in a rage.
