Rikumaru stood beside
Shikamaru
's side when he swore to
Hidan
 that his clan would keep him buried there for all eternity. He later followed Shikamaru to the edge of the
Nara clan forest

Trivia

In the anime, Rikumaru stood by Shikamaru's side while he buried Hidan. In the manga, Rikumaru is not seen until Shikamaru meets
Sakura
,
Sai
, and
Pakkun
 at the edge of the Nara forest.

Antlers, like his, are a key ingredient in a variety of medicines.
