This technique causes the ground and everything on and around it to be sucked in towards the middle of a large pit, much like the method an
antlion
 uses to catch prey. Upon being dragged to the centre, the victim will then be sucked underground. There the victim, depending on how deep the user makes them sink, will be trapped and/or suffocated. The range of the pit is determined by how much chakra is put into the technique. The antlion theme fits in with Kagerō's appearance, emphasising her large jaw in this form.
