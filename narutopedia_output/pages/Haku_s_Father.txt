He was a simple farmer and the father of
Haku
.

Background






Haku's father about to kill his son, after killing his wife.



Haku's father was a simple farmer. He eventually married a seemingly normal
woman
, and the two had a son whom they named
Haku
. The family lived happily and peacefully for many years. However, this changed when Haku discovered he inherited
Ice Release

kekkei genkai
 and showed it to his mother. The father saw this from the shadows, realising that his wife was a member of the
Yuki clan
. The clan carried the kekkei genkai that the villagers of the
Land of Water
 feared and hated, as the
ninja
 who possessed it had caused great tragedies in their civil war. He assembled a mob and, with tears flowing from his eyes, killed his wife in the cottage they built together. He then attempted to kill his son. However, Haku retaliated in self-defence using his Ice nature, killing his father and the mob.

Personality






Haku's father crying when about to kill his son.



Originally, he was an upbeat man who took joy in his simple life with his family. However, once he discovered that his wife and child had kekkei genkai, he tearfully chose to kill off his family, showing incredible prejudice of one's birthright; it is unknown whether his tears were forcing himself to kill his beloved family, or being horrified of said family for bearing the kekkei genkai he feared so much.

Appearance

He was a very young man with smooth cheek length black hair and black eyes with no pupils.
