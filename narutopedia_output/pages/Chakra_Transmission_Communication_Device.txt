It is a device used by the
Intelligence Division
 of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 in order to pass information to each other, be it from the
headquarters
 to the field ninja or between battalions and vice versa.

Variants

The stationary device, which is much bigger, is attached to two
batteries
 and has a headset that covers the upper half of the user's face completely.

The portable version, however, is much smaller and only has a wire running from the device to the user's head, and can be carried on their back.

Trivia

The version at the shinobi headquarters is simply a larger version of the stationary field ones with more batteries attached to it, and has three people stationed at it.

In the anime, Mifune uses the device's battery cell to mimic the effects of
Lightning Release

chakra flow
 in order to nullify
Deidara
