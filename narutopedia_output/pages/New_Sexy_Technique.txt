During his two-and-a-half years of training with
Jiraiya
,
Naruto Uzumaki
 on one occasion uses the
Sexy Technique
 against Jiraiya; Naruto
transforms
 into a woman wearing a revealing devil outfit and short shorts. After seeing it, Jiraiya encourages Naruto to take a form that is wearing a
thong
, which he believes will give him
inspiration
. Confusing a thong for a
mawashi
, Naruto transforms into a
sumo wrestler
. Jiraiya is first startled, then disturbed, then angry to see it, having expected another scantily-clad woman. He complains bitterly until Naruto, irritated, uses the form to knock Jiraiya out.

Naruto brags about this "new" Sexy Technique when he returns to
Konohagakure
, claiming it's far superior to the original. He is attacked by
Sakura Haruno
 before he has a chance to demonstrate it.

Trivia

This technique debuts in "
The New Erotic Ninjutsu Completed!!
", an
omake
 included with
Kai no Sho
. The omake is later adapted for
Naruto: Shippūden
 episode 188
.
