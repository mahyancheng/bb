The
ninja
 from the
Land of the Sky
 use this device to conduct aerial bombardments, combat and reconnaissance.
Chōji Akimichi
 believed the action behind this was due to the use of a
Wind Release
 technique; however, it is actually a device that works by just flowing chakra through the wings, which propels the user through the air and allows for flight. With sufficient skill, the shinobi can display considerable manoeuvrability mid-air through the use of this contraption. One downside to this is with their chakra being used to fuel the machine's flight capabilities, prolonged use can eventually consume the user's chakra reserves. It is for this reason why the Sky shinobi had to soar back to their sea-faring vessels after their initial attack against
Konoha
. Another downside is that the shinobi cannot take off at their own power, but are dependent on the aid of a
take-off system
 on top of the sea-faring vessels.

The users can also equip themselves with a
Handheld Kunai Launcher
, which has an extremely rapid firing capacity, to conduct aerial attacks. They also equip themselves with explosives, dropping them on structures and in the middle of enemies.

Trivia

In
Naruto Mobile

Zero-Tails
, which attacks the enemy by quickly flying towards them.
