Ebisu
 (
エビス
) is a
tokubetsu jōnin
 from
Konohagakure
 who specialises in training elite ninja.
 He also served as the leader of
Team Ebisu
, which consisted of
Konohamaru Sarutobi
,
Udon
, and
Moegi
.

Background






Team Chōza competing in the Chūnin Exams.



When Ebisu became a genin, he was put on a
team
 consisting of
Might Guy
 and
Genma Shiranui
, under the leadership of
Chōza Akimichi
.
 During their
Chūnin Exams
, Ebisu and his team clashed with
Team Minato
 in the
Forest of Death
 where Guy quickly dispatched
Obito Uchiha
. When
Kakashi Hatake
 is promoted to jōnin some time later,
Rin Nohara
 gathers up the graduating class to plan a top-secret celebration which Ebisu took part in.
 At one point, he and his team were confronted by a generation of
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
 only to be saved by
Might Duy
.

Personality






Ebisu's perverted nature.



Ebisu is portrayed as a stern and "by-the-book" type of person.
 Initially, he expressed hatred for
Naruto Uzumaki
,
 and believed he was nothing but a worthless nuisance and mocked his dream of becoming Hokage as he believes that only people of high lineage could amount to anything. Upon seeing what Naruto had done for Konohamaru his perspective changed drastically,
 and later the village during
Pain's assault
 on it, he chose not to surrender Naruto's location and would rather be killed.
 He is also rather attached to his pupils, and has shown immense pride in them, such as when Konohamaru performed the Rasengan on Pain while rescuing Ebisu from the dangerous missing-nin.

While being rather uptight, he has shown a true dedication to his village and students.
 Also, although he tries to be very professional, he has displayed some perverted traits, as shown from how he reacted to Naruto's
pervert tactics
.
 He has also been described by Naruto as being a "closet pervert".
 Ebisu has a tendency to look into female bath houses.
 When perturbed, Ebisu often pushes his sunglasses up his nose.

Appearance

Ebisu has been portrayed as having dark hair and brown eyes and is never seen without his trademark sunglasses. Usually he is seen in the standard Konoha shinobi outfit, albeit without the
flak jacket
. He also wears his forehead protector like a bandanna. When deployed on missions, or if the situation calls for it he will don the flak jacket as part of his outfit.

During his time in the Academy, Ebisu wore his hair swept to the sides of his face and wore a dark suit along with his signature glasses with a thin, brown shawl of sorts around his shoulders with the two ends tied. When he achieved the rank of chūnin, he discarded the shawl, donned the bandanna-like
forehead protector
 as well as a flak jacket.

Abilities






Ebisu using Fire Release: Fire Dragon Bullet.



Ebisu is an elite trainer who has an extensive knowledge in basic to advanced forms of ninja skills. According to Kakashi, Ebisu is one of the most skilled trainers in Konoha,
 further emphasised by him being personally selected to train Konohamaru for the Academy, and was chosen by Kakashi to train Naruto for the Chūnin Exams.
 As someone chosen by the Hokage for such tasks, he has strong leadership ability.
 Ebisu is particularly skilled in the usage of hand seals.

In the anime, Ebisu is able to perform the
Shadow Clone Technique
 and
Fire Release: Fire Dragon Bullet
.
 He has also shown to be capable in
taijutsu
, as seen during his battle against the
Naraka Path
.

Part I

Prologue — Land of Waves

Main article:
Prologue — Land of Waves

He was first introduced as
Konohamaru
's tutor, and disliked the fact that Konohamaru idolised
Naruto Uzumaki
, as he only saw Naruto as the container of the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
. His opinion of Naruto didn't change even after Naruto "defeated" him with the
Harem Technique
.

Chūnin Exams

Later, after being recommended by
Kakashi Hatake
 as a great teacher and having realised Naruto's influence on Konohamaru has changed him for the better and seeing Naruto has the potential to be a great ninja and not just a host for the Nine-Tails, Ebisu began Naruto's one-month training for the main matches of the
Chūnin Exams
. Initially starting out by instructing the young man on his poor use of chakra, by being with Naruto and seeing the positive influence he had on Konohamaru, Ebisu realised that Naruto was not just the container of a demon, but was an outstanding Konoha ninja. However, Ebisu did not complete Naruto's training, as
Jiraiya
 took over by
summoning
 a
toad
 to
knock
 Ebisu unconscious after Ebisu tried to interrupt Jiraiya peeking in on the women's bath. Naruto then insisted that Jiraiya take Ebisu's place and complete his training. As Ebisu recognised Jiraiya before he was knocked out, once he woke up he had a brief conversation with him before leaving.

's location, but Ebisu, having come to think highly of Naruto, refused at the risk of his life and confronted the Path. Before he could be killed however, Konohamaru arrived to save him, using the
Rasengan
 to attack the Path, much to Ebisu's surprise. Ebisu, alongside the other villagers, though somewhat injured and supported by Konohamaru, celebrated Naruto's victory over
