"
The Uzumaki Household
" (
うずまき家
,
Uzumaki-ke
) is episode 194 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Hinata
 disposes of the broken vase, stressing to
Himawari
 that what's important is the thoughtfulness she put into it.
Boruto
 and
Kawaki
 discuss over who gets to use the bathroom first, but it's already occupied by
Naruto
, who yells at them to go outside if they really need to go. They pee outside, and begin fighting after trading insults. They activate their
Kāma
, but Naruto creates a
shadow clone
 from the bathroom to stop their fight. During a meal, Boruto comments how unusual it is for Naruto to be at home all day long, and reiterates he hasn't forgiven Kawaki for breaking Himawari's vase. When Hinata asks Kawaki what food he likes so she can make it for dinner, he doesn't know because no one has ever asked him.
 During training with
Team 7
, Boruto complains about Kawaki. Naruto,
Sai
, and
Shikamaru
 discuss the investigation on
Kara
. Kawaki walks around the village, followed by Naruto. At the end of the day, Kawaki returns and has dinner with the Uzumaki family. The following day, Kawaki asks Boruto how he got his Kāma. Boruto tells him about
Momoshiki
, and in turn asks Kawaki how he got his. Kawaki recounts his experience being experimented on by
Amado
 and
Jigen
, and how many children died from the same experiments. Naruto overhears them. Kawaki says that having gotten away from Kara, he wants to learn more about Kāma so he can get rid of it, and wants to collaborate with Boruto so he can get rid of his Kāma as well. Boruto agrees to it, but stresses he still hasn't forgiven him for Himawari's vase. Boruto leaves, and Kawaki considers replacing the vase so Boruto stops harping him about it. Naruto offers to show him around the
village
.
