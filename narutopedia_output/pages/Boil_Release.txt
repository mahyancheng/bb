Boil Release
 (
沸遁
,
Futton
,
Viz:
 Vapour Style) is a
nature transformation

kekkei genkai
, a combination of
fire
 and
water
. Whereas most kekkei genkai are largely identical between users, Boil Release has different forms depending on who's using it.

Forms

Corrosive vapour is created by
Mei Terumī
 of
Kirigakure
. Its exact acidity is controlled by Mei and, because it is gaseous, it can rapidly fill confined areas. It is dangerous to enemies and allies alike, dissolving most substances after even brief exposure. In
Sasuke Shinden
, this form of Boil Release is also used by
Futsu
.

Steam generated by heating
chakra
 to its boiling point is used by
Kokuō
 and its
jinchūriki
. The steam emanates from the user's body, either to melt their surroundings or propel them in a direction.
