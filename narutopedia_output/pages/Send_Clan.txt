The
Sendō Clan
 (
仙道一族
,
Sendō Ichizoku
) is a clan of the
Howling Wolf Village
 led by
Jiryū Sendō
. Jiryū formed the clan after the village declared its neutrality from all conflicts. He gathered together many of the village's former
shinobi
 - left unemployed by the neutrality - and created a criminal gang that primarily dealt in
saigenzai
, a popular hallucinogen.
 Because of their saigenzai's poor quality, Jiryū wants to learn how to make the special
Kotarō
 sold by the
Kodon Clan
. He and his clan periodically harass
Reishi
 and
Kina Kodon
 to try and force them to turn over the secret to Kotarō.
