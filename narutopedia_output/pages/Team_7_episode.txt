Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Hiruzen
 informs
Kakashi
 that he would be assigning him to another
genin
 team and though Kakashi is hesitant at first, his interest is piqued when the Third mentions that
Minato
's
son
 was to be assigned to his team. The two make unofficial visits to both Naruto, and the other two
team

members
' homes. While visiting Sakura's, they encounter her parents
Kizashi
 and
Mebuki
 who invite them inside.

Hiruzen would later explain his
rationale
 behind formulating the teams, Kakashi ultimately accepts his new assigned team. Back at the
Academy
,
Team 8
 and
Team 10
 are assigned to
Kurenai Yūhi
 and
Asuma Sarutobi
 respectively, leaving Team 7 alone at the Academy. Kakashi, who is at the
Memorial Stone
 speaks briefly with
Yamato
 who notes that his senpai was changing if even very little at a time. Upon his arrival, Kakashi notices the simple prank set up above the door but allows it to hit him as he assesses his new team, reaching the conclusion that they had no teamwork whatsoever. However, after
testing
 them, Kakashi happily noted that they passed the test and that they were now officially Team 7.
