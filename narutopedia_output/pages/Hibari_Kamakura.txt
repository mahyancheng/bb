Hibari and her daughter reconcile.



As Hibari's movie career continued to strain her relationship with her daughter, Osuka's bitterness reached its limit when Hibari threw out her favourite pudding. Later, Osuka was kidnapped along with
Himawari
. After the two were rescued by Neon and
Kawaki
, Hibari frantically arrived to hug her daughter. While Osuka was shocked by this reaction, Hibari insisted that a mother's first concern is always their child. She also revealed the reason she has been gone so much lately was because she was helping in designing a sensory system for the new drones, which is what Neon used to find Osuka and Himawari. Hibari also revealed that she threw out Osuka's pudding because it expired from her storing it for so long. As they reconciled, Hibari invited everyone out to enjoy some pudding together.

When the
Academy
 held a festival, Hibari filmed all her scheduled scenes for the day quickly so she could attend, wishing to be there for Osuka's debut as the lead character on a play about the
Sannin

Sōsha
