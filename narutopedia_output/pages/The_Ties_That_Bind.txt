"
The Ties That Bind
" (
繋がれるもの
,
Tsunagareru Mono
) is episode 364 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Just as the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 are about to strike the
two

Uchiha
 and the
Ten-Tails
, the pair use the beast's power to blast all the attackers away. Madara notes that their strategy to eliminate the brains of the enemy is a fundamental one, and uses the Ten-Tails to fire its
Tailed Beast Balls
 at seemingly random targets.
Shikaku
 attempts to convey to
Kakashi
 his next plan to stop the Ten-Tails.
 However
Ao
 detects a Tailed Beast Ball flying towards the
HQ
, leaving Shikaku and
Inoichi
 to communicate their last act to the whole force as well as saying their final goodbyes to
Shikamaru
 and
Ino
. With the Allied HQ destroyed, Madara states that the Ten-Tails is becoming difficult to control. Becoming a
jinchūriki
 will allow greater control over the beast but needs a living body to succeed, not a
reincarnated
 corpse. Only Obito can perform the technique to fully
revive
 Madara, and so the latter allows Obito to make the next move. Wanting to demoralise
Naruto
, Obito fires numerous
wooden spikes
 against the Allied Shinobi, inflicting many casualties.
Neji
,
Hinata
, and
Hiashi
 attempt to protect Naruto from the Ten-Tails' attacks but a focused attack on Naruto forces Neji to act as a human shield to protect both Naruto and Hinata. Neji succumbs to his wounds finally understanding why his father died to protect his comrades. Obito attempts to convince Naruto that Neji's death as well as the deaths of many Allied Forces that his words and ideals were meaningless which prompted Kakashi's worries even more, but Hinata slaps Naruto back to reality.
Kurama
 backs Hinata's speech, stating that Neji's sacrifice was exactly the same as
Minato
 and
Kushina
's sacrifice to protect Naruto just after his birth. Meanwhile, a fully recharged
B
 entered Tailed Beast Mode, charged towards the
Ten-Tails
, making it ingest its own Tailed Beast Ball. It successfully exploded and allowed the others to gain time. With levels recharged, Naruto enters back into his
cloak
 as well as giving Hinata some of the fox's chakra.
