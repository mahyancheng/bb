Summary

Shikamaru
 tries to sneak up on
Hidan
 and cut off his head, but Hidan dodges in time. Shikamaru tells him how
Kakashi
 had earlier managed to fill a capsule with some of
Kakuzu
's blood. When Hidan thought he had obtained some of Shikamaru's blood and formed a link with him, he had actually linked himself with Kakuzu. Shikamaru catches him with his shadow again. Meanwhile, Kakuzu has collapsed.
Chōji
 tries to destroy his masks before they can reach Kakuzu but is unsuccessful. Kakuzu takes one of the masks' hearts and merges with the remaining two so that they will always be nearby. The two masks attack with a combined
fire
 and
wind
 technique, which the newly arrived
Team 7
 neutralises with a combined
water
 and wind technique to protect
Team 10
