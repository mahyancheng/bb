 manga.

Summary

Kankurō
 attacks
Shino
 with
Karasu
, but Shino avoids the attack thanks to his
kikaichū
. Karasu follows up with a poisonous gas attack. Shino just barely evades it, but in doing so walks into another attack. Meanwhile,
Sarutobi
 continues to struggle to remove
Orochimaru
's soul. At the same time his likeness on the
Hokage Rock
 cracks, worrying the ninja who see it. Shino is able to swarm Karasu with kikaichū but Kankurō still manages to get off another attack. The attack falls short, Shino having finally managed to guide his kikaichū to Kankurō's location. The kikaichū consume Kankurō's
chakra
 and Shino passes out from the gas he earlier inhaled, trusting the rest of the battle to Sasuke.
