Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Team 7

returns
 to
Konoha
 following the completion of their mission in the
Land of Waves
,
Naruto
 lashes out against
Sasuke
 for thinking that he was better than everybody else. Sasuke smugly replies that he doesn't think that he is better than everybody, only that he is better than Naruto. Naruto becomes irked at Sasuke's comment, although Sasuke merely tells him to become stronger than him if he really wishes to settle their score.

Some time after, Team 7, along with the other ninja teams that passed the first round of the
Chūnin Exams
, are
brought
 to the
Forest of Death
 for the second stage. Their proctor,
Anko Mitarashi
, debriefs them on their task — each team would be given either a Heaven scroll or an Earth scroll, and must survive five days in the forest whilst trying to retrieve the other scroll. There are three rules — all three members must arrive at the tower before five days with both scrolls; if a member if injured or incapacitated, the team becomes eliminated; lastly, scrolls cannot be read by the teams, with immediate disqualification being given to those who do.

In the forest,
Sasuke
 and
Sakura
 are
attacked
 by
Shiore
, a
shinobi
 from
Kusagakure
. Sasuke is nearly killed by him, and decides to relinquish his scroll to save his life. However, Naruto returns to the fray, blocking Shiore's path with
shuriken
 and punching Sasuke. He tells Sasuke that he never knew him to be a coward who would freeze up in the middle of a battle. Shiore concurs, much to Sasuke's shock, and he
summons
 a giant
snake
, using
Wind Release: Great Breakthrough
 to blow Naruto away. Sasuke warns Naruto to run away, but Naruto, tapping into the
chakra
 of the
Nine-Tails
, is able to kill the snake, saving Sasuke's life and asking Sasuke if he was alright in a condescending tone, repeating the same words Sasuke had
uttered
 to him after their encounter with the
Demon Brothers
. Sasuke is amazed at Naruto's newfound strength and remarks how he cannot ever hope to defeat his
brother
 if he cannot deal with Shiore, and pulls out a
Fūma Shuriken
 along with shuriken and
wire strings
 in order to
fight back
.

After surviving their encounter with
Orochimaru
, who had been
impersonating

Shiore
, the trio join forces with
Kabuto
, a fellow shinobi from Konoha. The four are
ambushed
 by
Team Oboro
, who combine a
genjutsu
 known as the
Mist Servant Technique
 along with the
Haze Clone Technique
 and the
Earth Release: Underground Projection Fish Technique
 to assault them while avoiding any damage themselves. Using his
Sharingan
, Sasuke confirms that it is a mere genjutsu, although the four of them decide to fight until all the clones are defeated.

As the four tire out,
Oboro
 and his fellow
Ame
-nin present themselves, intent on finishing the weakened team. However, they are surprised when they discover that the four tired shinobi are none other than Naruto and three
shadow clones
, having used the
Transformation Technique
 to disguise his clones as Kabuto, Sasuke, and
Sakura
, while the three were in fact hiding in the trees, recovering while waiting for the enemies to show themselves. Sasuke tells Naruto to take a break, citing that he would take over. Not wanting to allow Sasuke credit for defeating the enemies, Naruto punches all three unconscious with a single blow, stunning Sasuke, who is amazed at Naruto's ability to still move despite having depleted most of his chakra and continuously fighting for five days.

Team 7
successfully complete
 the second round of the exams, with Sasuke fuming over Naruto's sudden improvement, remarking that they would not have passed without him. Sakura attempts to convince him to drop out due to the
Cursed Seal of Heaven
, but Sasuke reprimands her and notifies her that all he wishes is to be strong and therefore must fight other strong people, such as the people who passed the second round. Naruto is angered at Sasuke's reaction towards Sakura's concern, but is speechless when Sasuke quickly responds that Naruto is one of those strong people who he wishes to fight the most.

Some time after,
Kakashi
 is undergoing the
Cliff Climbing Practice
 when he is
confronted
 by Sasuke, who asks Kakashi to train him so that he can obtain the power necessary to surpass Naruto and achieve his goal. Kakashi states that members of the
Uchiha clan
 are known for their
Fire Release
 abilities, but believes that Sasuke is like him and may possess
Lightning Release
. Using litmus paper, Kakashi's suspicion is confirmed and he declares that he would finally be able to pass down his own
unique technique
 to someone.

The final rounds of the exams begin, with Sasuke and Kakashi
arriving
 just mere moments before Sasuke could be eliminated. Kakashi apologises for their tardiness while Naruto warns Sasuke not to lose. Sasuke inquires as to how Naruto's match went, and Naruto proudly declares that he
won
, and thus would like to fight Sasuke in the last round. Grinning, Sasuke reaffirms that he wishes to fight Naruto as well.
