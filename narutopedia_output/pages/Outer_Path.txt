The
Outer Path
 (
外道
,
Gedō
) is one of the seven abilities of the
Six Paths Technique
 granted to the wielder of the
Rinnegan
. It grants the user the power to control life and death. With this power, the user is able to
revive the dead
, transmit their
chakra
 into
black receivers
, and manifest
chakra chains
.

Overview

One who wields the Rinnegan is said to exist outside the realm of life and death. They are regarded as the seventh
Pain
, the Outer Path, and wield the power to control life and death itself. With this power, the user is able to revive the dead through the
Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
,
 though doing so comes at the cost of the user's life.

The Rinnegan allows for the creation of black receivers,
 and by transmitting their chakra into these receivers, the user can bind anyone they touch through the power of the Outer Path. The user can also manifest the
chakra chains
 of the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 to restrain those who touch the receivers with an even greater binding power.
 By implanting black receivers into corpses or
reincarnated
 individuals, the user can reanimate and remotely control the bodies as the
Six Paths of Pain
. These bodies, as well as the
King of Hell
 and the creatures
summoned
 through the
Animal Path
, all have reflections of the Rinnegan in their eyes and share visual information with the user through the Outer Path.






Souls summoned back from the Pure Land.



During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
,
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 demonstrated the ability to recall the souls of the previous
Kage
 from the
Pure Land
 to assist him in
summoning

Team 7
 and the
tailed beasts
 back from
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
's
core dimension
.
 When summoned in this manner, the deceased person does not have an actual body, but appears as a mass of flickering chakra in full possession of their personality and memories. Once the user ends the technique, the summoned souls dwindle and ultimately disappear completely. Hagoromo was also able to undo another person's use of the
Impure World Reincarnation
 technique, releasing the reincarnated souls from their vessels and sending them to the Pure Land.

Trivia

Gedō
 (
外道
,
literally meaning:
 Outer Path), derived from the Sanskrit
Tīrthika
, refers to any doctrine which "treads the outer path" to enlightenment. This is opposed to the teachings of orthodox Buddhism, the
Naidō
 (
内道
,
literally meaning:
 Inner Path), and is thus considered misguided and heretical.

The Demonic Statue of the Outer Path may have some relation to this technique, as it shares the same name.
Madara Uchiha
 is responsible for giving the statue its name.

Some abilities of the Outer Path may only be available to those who are truly alive themselves, as Madara in his reincarnated state required another living Rinnegan wielder to revive him.

Naruto Uzumaki
 referred to the control of the Six Paths of Pain as an
Outer Path Technique
 (
外道の術
,
Gedō no Jutsu
,
Viz:
 Gedo Jutsu).

Kabuto Yakushi
 noted that he could force
Nagato
 to remove a person's soul with the
Human Path
, then store both their body and soul inside the King of Hell with the
Naraka Path
 and revive them at a later time. However, it is unknown if this involves the Outer Path, as the process was interrupted.
