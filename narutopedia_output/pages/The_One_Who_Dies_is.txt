Summary

Kakashi
 contemplates fighting
Orochimaru
 by himself, but realises that it would only result in his death. Orochimaru leaves, promising to take
Sasuke
 at a later date. After having Sasuke taken care of, Kakashi returns to the preliminaries, assuring
Sakura
 that Sasuke will be fine.
Kankurō
 and
Misumi Tsurugi
 are paired for the next match. Misumi quickly restrains Kankurō and threatens to break his neck if he doesn't surrender. When Kankurō refuses, Misumi does as he warned, only to find that he has broken the neck of a
puppet
. Kankurō takes advantage of Misumi's close proximity to the puppet to capture him and crush him despite Misumi's attempts to give up, winning the match. Sakura and
Ino
 are selected for the fourth match.
