Land of That symbol from Kaguya's era.



The
Land of That
 (
彼の国
,
Ka no Kuni
) is an old country neighbouring the
Land of Fire
 and
Land of Rivers
. A millennium before the start of the series, the Land of That would regularly expand their own territories by falsifying and claiming to have discovered old documents where a region of interest would be shown as theirs. They would pressure other countries with the threat of war if they did not hand over the disputed territory. When they attempted to take the
Land of Ancestors
, the conflict was quelled by
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
's use of the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
.
 Centuries later, through the services of
Akatsuki
, the country took over the territory of the
Land of This
.
