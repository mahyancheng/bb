Rin meets Obito in purgatory.



The
Pure Land
 (
浄土
,
Jōdo
,
Viz:
 Afterworld) is the place where the
souls
 of earthly beings generally reside in death. Souls that have been sealed, such as by the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
, cannot enter the Pure Land until the seal has been released. Furthermore, only those souls that reside in the Pure Land can be reincarnated with the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
, although they will have no memory of their time in the Pure Land.

Purgatory





Sakumo meets Kakashi in purgatory.



To arrive at this "unknown world" (
知れぬ世界
,
Shirenu Sekai
),
 the deceased has to go through
a middle plane of existence
, where other people such as relatives or friends can be met. People residing in this plane are those who haven't been able to move on because of earthly regrets or because they decided to wait for someone. Unlike the Pure Land, if the people who have gone through a middle plane of existence are brought back to life, they presumably have knowledge of their time in the middle plane of existence.
Obito
 noted that
chakra
 is the power that connects this plane and the real world, and as such he was able to
teleport
 back to the world of the living to meet
Kakashi Hatake
 once more.

Trivia

Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 was able to momentarily call forth the spirits of all the previously deceased
Kage
 from the Pure Land, a feat referred to as godly by Kakashi, to help with the
summoning
 of
Team 7
, the
tailed beasts
, and
Madara Uchiha
 from
Kaguya's dimension
.
