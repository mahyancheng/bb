Sasori using his Third Kazekage human puppet.



A
human puppet
 (
人傀儡
,
Hitokugutsu
) is a
puppet
 created from human corpses, developed by
Sasori
 during his time in
Sunagakure
. To make one, he first removes a body's organs, then cleans and drains the body of blood, then adds an unknown preservative to make sure it won't decay, and finally adds weapons and defenses to it. They were a unique type of puppet as they retained the use of
chakra
 and any
kekkei genkai
 that their human host once had. According to
Chiyo
, Sasori was the only one who knew how to create human puppets.

In the anime, while a human puppet retains inherent abilities of an individual, their skills ultimately pale in comparison to when they were alive, as Sasori learned while using the
Third Kazekage
 against its
reincarnated

version
.

Trivia

Although Sasori converted his own body into a puppet, and
Sakura Haruno
 considering him to be a human puppet, he is not an actual human puppet, as his still-living core is his true body. Sasori himself admits he is not a true puppet, nor a full human, but somewhere in-between.

In
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower
,
Mukade
 converted his own body into a puppet, similar to Sasori, but without the seeming restriction of needing a "Core of Living Flesh". In exchange, however, Mukade seemed more vulnerable, as when Naruto
destroyed
 a portion of his head after stopping his
regenerative technique
, Mukade died.

In the
anime
 within Tsunade's
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 dream, Sasori turned
A
,
Mei Terumī
, and
Ōnoki
 into puppets.
