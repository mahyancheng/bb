 manga.

Summary

As
Naruto
 (in
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
) and
Killer B
 head towards the battlefield, the
Nine-Tails
 pulls Naruto into his subconscious and berates him for squandering its
chakra
 like that. Naruto and the fox have a conversation and the fox tells him to stop being naive as there was no way he could shoulder the hatred of an entire
war
 and
Sasuke
. After a flashback of Naruto and Sasuke while in the
Academy
, Naruto walks into the Nine-Tails' cage and brings down the
torii
 to pin the fox down. Naruto then stares dead into the Nine-Tails' eye and brimming with confidence tells him that he will do something about the war and Sasuke.
