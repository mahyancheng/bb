"
The Sage of Six Paths
" (
六道仙人
,
Rikudō Sennin
) is episode 421 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Hagoromo
 reveals to
Naruto
 that he is the
reincarnation
 of his younger son:
Asura
. He asks Naruto if he can guess who
Indra
's reincarnation is, and Naruto correctly concludes it is
Sasuke
. At the same time, Hagoromo has the same conversation with Sasuke, revealing his status as Indra's reincarnation, and having him realise Naruto is Asura's. Hagoromo goes on to explain that
Hashirama
 and
Madara
 are the previous reincarnations, and that by taking Hashirama's power, Madara recreated Hagoromo's
chakra
, awakening the
Rinnegan
, despite leaving Indra's descendants
instructions
 against it. Hagoromo explains that his mother
Kaguya
 used her
powerful

dōjutsu
 to
rule
 over humanity, and that Madara is on his way to acquiring that same power.
 Hagoromo asks Naruto to stop Madara, who accepts his request. The chakra of the
tailed beasts
 converge, and Hagoromo notes the
prophecy
 he heard long ago has come true. As entrusting only Asura had created so much conflict, Hagoromo asks Sasuke to cooperate as well, and entrusts both Naruto and Sasuke with
his

powers
. Having survived and being impressed by
Guy
's
Evening Elephant
, Madara asks Guy to keep on fighting him, deeming him the strongest taijutsu user he has ever faced. Guy prepares to use his last technique while Naruto and Sasuke awaken. As Guy prepares the
Night Guy
,
Kakashi
 recalls his
father's
 accurate prediction of Guy's potential when they were children. Guy's powerful kick lands on Madara, through the
Shinju
, almost killing him. Guy's body begins to disintegrate and an elated Madara, regenerating from the attack, attempts to finish him with a
Truth-Seeking Ball
 only for Naruto to kick it away, much to his surprise. Naruto
touches
 Guy, stopping his life force from fading. Madara notices a change in Naruto, wondering what
Obito
 did. Naruto declares he feels he can change the world with his
new
 powers.

Trivia

The manner in which Naruto kicked away Madara's Truth-Seeking Ball away was identical to when Naruto
kicked
 two of
Gatō
's thugs, as well as the
time
 when Naruto kicked
Gaara
 to prevent him from killing Sasuke.

When Sasuke awoke, his left eye was shown to be normal rather than his Rinnegan. This was not shown in the manga, suggesting this was either an animation error or done so that Sasuke's Rinnegan is not revealed until he faced Madara like in the manga.
