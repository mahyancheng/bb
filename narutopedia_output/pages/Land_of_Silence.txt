The Land of Silence.



The
Land of Silence
 (
黙の国
,
Shijima no Kuni
) is a small
samurai
-led country on a distant continent,
 that is beyond the reach of
shinobi
 authority.
 It is surrounded by mountains with a rural economy by the standards of the
Land of Fire
. Its capital city is
Curtain Village
. The Land of Silence was once led by a
daimyō
, but the daimyō was overthrown by
Gengo
 and his
Enlightened Ones
 sometime before the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. Years after Gengo was removed from power by the actions of the
Shinobi Union
, the country fell into lawlessness, where the world's fugitives gathered, harbouring resentment for the shinobi of the Five Great Shinobi Countries.
