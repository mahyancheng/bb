By sending
chakra
 into the ground, the roots of the plants are converted into raw materials. This technique allows for a building to be constructed, by forcing accelerated growth. Just like with the
Four-Pillar Prison Technique
, the size and shape of the building are taken from the user's imagination or memories. By placing tags around the house, the user creates a barrier, making it impossible for the enemy to detect it and allowing the user to "camp" in peace.

Trivia

Yamato calls the inn he creates the "Fallen Leaves Retreat" (
落葉庵
,
Rakuyōan
).
