The user enters the target's subconscious by placing a hand on the target's head and extracts any information needed, even if the target has forgotten it or has had it blocked. A special
device
 can be used to decrease the time it takes to read the target's mind and allows other ninja to assist. Memories that have
mental blocks
 on them will require longer periods of time to probe through and obtain however.

Depending on the skill of the user and their level of experience, they will be able to go through days worth of the target's memories in a matter of moments and sift through until they find what they want while others may have to go through each memory in its entirety.

Trivia
