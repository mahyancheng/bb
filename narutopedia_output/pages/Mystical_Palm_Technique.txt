The user applies their hand to a wounded part of the body and sends
chakra
 into it, accelerating the body's natural healing abilities. Although its most obvious use is as a way of treating external injuries, it can also be used for internal illnesses. Users must be careful to only use as much chakra as is needed for the specific injury. If too much chakra is sent into the body, this can disrupt the body's circulation, putting it into a comatose state.

Because of the level of chakra control required to safely use this technique, few
medical-nin
 can actually perform it;
 when
Sakura Haruno
 is learning how to use it, she's shown practising on a fish.
 When
Sarada Uchiha
 practised it on a fish, she sent too much chakra and caused it to eventually burn up.
 The anime states that the different
hidden villages
 have all developed their own applications for this technique that are unknown to other villages; in
Kirigakure
's case, its medics can use it as a remedy for seasickness.

Trivia

The "senjutsu" in this technique's name is unrelated to the
senjutsu
 used elsewhere in the series. In this technique's case, it is a reference to the secret of immortality the legendary real-life sages allegedly had.

This technique is possibly derived from the real-life spiritual practice of
Reiki
, commonly known as palm- or hands-on-healing.

Kabuto Yakushi
 has been shown using the Mystical Palm Technique from a short distance away, without directly touching the person he's healing.

Sakura is likewise shown healing an injury to herself, seemingly without using her hands at all.
