Orochimaru transfers his consciousness into a white snake and then slithers into his target's body, enabling him to gain control of their body as well as their mind. This technique is similar in concept to the
Yamanaka clan
's
Mind Body Switch Technique
, where the user's original body is left defenceless after taking control of someone else's. Orochimaru used this technique to control
Kajika
 and so test the extent of
Sasuke Uchiha
's power.
