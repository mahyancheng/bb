The Appearance of Strange Visitors






Mondai disguised as Might Guy.



Mondai and Potcha went to infiltrate Konoha and gather its secrets by disguising themselves as
Might Guy
 and
Rock Lee
 respectively, while the real Guy and Lee were out on a mission. They are oblivious to the fact that their disguises are fooling nobody, except for
Naruto
,
Tsunade
,
Sakura
, and
Tenten
 forced them along by giving them outrageous missions, preventing them from learning anything. They were defeated when the real Guy and Lee attacked them with their
Double Dynamic Entry
 technique.

Trivia

Mondai calls himself
Mondai Guy
 (
モンダイ・ガイ
,
Mondai Gai
) while disguised as Might Guy, which is a pun for "mondai nai" (
問題ない
) meaning "no problem".
