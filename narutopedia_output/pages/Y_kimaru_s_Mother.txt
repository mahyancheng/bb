She was
Yūkimaru
's mother.

Background

Yūkimaru lived with his mother in a village that was attacked by
Orochimaru
 during his childhood.
Guren
 was one of the ninja raiding the village, killing everyone she came across. When she collapsed, it was Yūkimaru's mother who tended her. When Guren woke up, she said she would close her eyes and let her escape as an act of gratefulness towards the kind woman. However, Guren still had to follow Orochimaru's orders, and when they met again Guren had to kill her to keep her master's approval. When Yūkimaru's mother fell, her blood fell out of her body and onto the camellias nearby. Their pure white colour was changed to red as the blood was absorbed by the camellia.

She seemed to be a very kind woman, treating to Guren's wounds even though she was the one who attacked the village where she lived. Yūkimaru described her as a loving and caring mother.

Appearance

She had caramel-coloured eyes and long, soft brown hair with bangs that swept on each side of her forehead. She wore a red blouse over a purple one with a green kimono. She also wore sandals.
