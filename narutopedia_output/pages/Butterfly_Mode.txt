The
Butterfly Mode
 is a heightened transformation of the
Akimichi clan
.

Overview

The user can enter this mode by converting the calories of their body into chakra. The chakra, when visible, is
shaped
 into two large butterfly wings that can be compressed into smaller wings. The technique uses an enormous amount of chakra. In this form, the user's combat ability is greatly enhanced; allowing the use of the clan's high-level techniques such as
Butterfly Bullet Bombing
, and the ability to use the chakra wings to create gusts of chakra.

There are two methods of entering this mode. The first is through use of the Akimichi's
Three Coloured Pills
, which aggressively convert all of the user's calories into chakra; if the pills are not regulated properly, the user may die from the rapid weight loss. Practised users are able to convert their calories into chakra on their own through a process known as
Calorie Control
 (
カロリーコントロール
,
Karorī Kontorōru
); because they are in complete control of how much of their body weight is turned into chakra, it poses less of a risk to the user.

In the anime, it is shown that using this form without proper control will in fact greatly diminish one's performance.
 It is also shown that even while in this slim state, the user can still perform various
expansion techniques
.
