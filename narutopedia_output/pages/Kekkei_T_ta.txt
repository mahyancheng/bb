Ōnoki
 using his kekkei tōta: Dust Release.



Kekkei tōta
 (
血継淘汰
,
literally meaning:
 Bloodline Selection) is an advanced branch of jutsu that is more advanced than the jutsu class of
kekkei genkai
.
 The only known example is
Dust Release
, a combination of three different
nature transformations
 —
earth
,
wind
, and
fire
.

Trivia

Despite having the word "bloodline" in its name, Mū and Onoki are not known to be blood-related.

In the anime, it is stated that kekkei tōta users have an affinity for all three of the natures they can combine.

In
Gaara Hiden: A Sandstorm Mirage
, it was stated that by combining two different
kekkei genkai
 — in this case
Lava
 and
Steel Release
 — in one attack, the resulting attack would be a "pseudo-kekkei tōta" (
擬似血継淘汰
,
Giji Kekkei Tōta
).
