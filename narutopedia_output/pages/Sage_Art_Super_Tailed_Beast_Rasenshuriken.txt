This is an "ultimate technique" created by
Naruto Uzumaki
 using the power given to him by the
Sage of Six Paths
. Naruto and eight of his
shadow clones
 each form a
Rasenshuriken
 that's been imbued with the unique
chakra
 of a different
tailed beast
; Naruto's reason for using such a varied attack is because he doesn't know which type of chakra
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 would be weak to.
 When the nine thrown Rasenshuriken strike Kaguya, multiple large explosions are created. Although Kaguya herself is not noticeably hurt by the attack, the tailed beasts' chakra contained within the Rasenshuriken resonates with the tailed beasts' chakra within Kaguya, preventing her from maintaining her humanoid form.

Jin no Sho
 describes this as, "the most marvellous ninjutsu of all time."

The exact composition of the nine Rasenshuriken is never made explicit, but all are reminiscent of abilities seen elsewhere in the series:

The Rasenshuriken for
Shukaku
 has a similar appearance to the
Sage Art: Magnet Release Rasengan
, which uses
magnetized

sand
.

The Rasenshuriken for
Matatabi
 appears to consist of the same blue
fire
 that Matatabi's body is composed of.

The Rasenshuriken for
Isobu
 is seemingly formed out of
water
.

The Rasenshuriken for
Son Gokū
 appears to be the
Sage Art: Lava Release Rasenshuriken
.

The Rasenshuriken for
Kokuō
 seems to be emitting
steam
, which
Kokuō's jinchūriki
 have been shown to be able to produce.

The Rasenshuriken for
Saiken
 resembles a bubbly gas. In the manga, the closest parallel is the corrosive gas used for
Wisdom Wolf Decay
. In the anime, it appears more analogous to the
Soap Bubble Ninjutsu
 used by
Saiken's jinchūriki
.

The Rasenshuriken for
Chōmei
 has no obvious source in either the manga or anime.
Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
 identifies it as being composed of
Scale Powder
.

The Rasenshuriken for
Gyūki
 is seemingly made of ink, which
Gyūki's jinchūriki
 have been shown to be able to produce.

The Rasenshuriken for
Kurama
 appears no different from a standard Rasenshuriken.

Trivia

In
Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
, Naruto can use this technique without
Six Paths Sage Mode
 to create a single Rasenshuriken: either Shukaku's, Son Gokū's, or Kurama's.

In
Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu
, both known variations of the
Lava Release
 are implied to be present separately within this technique.
