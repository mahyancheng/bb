The
Spiralling Serial Spheres
 is a double-handed version of the regular Rasengan.

Rasengan
, one in each of their hands. The user can then either attack two targets at once,
 or attack the same target with both Rasengan.

Senjutsu Influence





Sage Technique: Spiralling Serial Spheres.



When in
Sage Mode
, the user can use a
senjutsu
-enhanced version known as
Sage Technique: Spiralling Serial Spheres
 (
仙術・螺旋連丸
,
Senjutsu: Rasenrengan
,
English TV:

Trivia

Jiraiya
 performed this as a visual aid to teaching Naruto the Rasengan; in one hand he forms a regular Rasengan, and in the other he does within the balloon exercise.

When Naruto performs this technique in
Naruto the Movie: Legend of the Stone of Gelel
, he uses two different versions of the Rasengan: the
Gelel Rasengan
 and the
Demon Fox Rasengan
. In this movie, he calls it "Twin Rasengan" (
ツイン螺旋丸
,
Tsuin Rasengan
,
literally meaning:
 Twin Spiralling Spheres).

In
The Last: Naruto the Movie
, in his fight against
Toneri Ōtsutsuki
 on the moon, Naruto was shown holding dual Rasengan to block attacks, instead of thrusting them onto the opponent.
