The
Hokage-Style Sixty-Year-Old Technique — Kakuan Entering Society with Bliss-Bringing Hands
 technique utilises the power of the
Wood Release
 to forcibly suppress a
tailed beast
's
chakra
.

Usage

This technique can be used to suppress a jinchūriki’s chakra before or during transformation or used directly on a tailed beast. The user produces the "sit" (
座
,
za
) kanji in their palm, and by touching the tailed beast, or its
jinchūriki
 with their hand, the user can suppress the chakra inside an area which is usually lined with ten pillars.

When Yamato used this technique to suppress
Naruto Uzumaki
's
four-tailed form
, Naruto needed to be in possession of the
First Hokage's Necklace
 to aid in suppressing the
Nine-Tails
' chakra.

When
Hashirama
 used it on a tailed beast directly rather than a jinchūriki, he circumvented the use of the pillars and channelled the
tailed beast control
 through his
Wood Release: Wood Human Technique
, which could even overwrite the control of a tailed beast
controlled
 by the
Sharingan
.

Influence

"Jijun" (
耳順
) is a Japanese term used for people in their sixties. It comes from a saying by Confucius, liùshí ér ěrshùn (Mandarin Chinese) (
六十而耳順
), that is most commonly translated long the lines of "At sixty, my ear was obedient", meaning that at age sixty, one is able to hear all things without being unhappy about them.

The last part of this technique's name, "Kakuan Nitten Suishu" (
廓庵入鄽垂手
), comes from a famous series of short poems and accompanying images, called the "
Ten Bull Pictures
" (
十牛図（十牛圖）
,
Jūgyū-zu
, (Mandarin) Chinese:
Shíniútú
). The pictures and poems are intended to illustrate the stages of Zen discipline.

They were drawn by a twelfth-century Chinese Zen master called Kuòān (
廓庵
,
Japanese: Kakuan
). The tenth poem talks about how the fully-enlightened herdsman returns to the city to help others reach enlightenment. This poem is called Rùchán Chuíshǒu (Mandarin Chinese) (
入鄽垂手
,
Japanese: Nitten Suishu
), which can be translated as
"entering society with bliss-bringing hands"
 (i.e. hands that teach how to reach enlightenment).

Trivia

In
Shippūden
 episode 376
, when Yamato is performing this technique to suppress Kurama's chakra from leaking out of Naruto, he got motion sickness from riding the ever-shaking palanquin. As a gag, the kanji on Yamato's hand changed to "drunken" (
酔
,
yo
), as he was on the verge of vomiting.
