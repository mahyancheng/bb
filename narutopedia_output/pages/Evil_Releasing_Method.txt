The
Evil Releasing Method
 is  a direct counterpart to the Evil Sealing Method. It is used to release technique-induced seals on a person rather than sealing it. Compared to the Evil Sealing Method, the Evil Releasing Method requires far less preparation. Sasuke Uchiha used this technique to revive
Orochimaru
, mixing a piece of
Kabuto Yakushi
's modified flesh to create a physical body for the consciousness of Orochimaru that was left in
Anko Mitarashi
's
Cursed Seal of Heaven
.
