Purple Moon Island
 (
紫月島
,
Shigetsu-jima
) is one of the many small land masses that make up the
Land of Water
, mentioned in
Sasuke Shinden: The Teacher's Star Pupil
. In the autumn,
plankton
 breed in the water around the island, causing the water to turn red. When the
moon
 is reflected on these waters, the moon appears purple, giving the island its name. The island's first settlers, upon seeing this phenomenon, came to revere nature and established the
Purple Moon Religion
 in worship of it. The religion's strong isolationist policies have rendered the island little-known outside of the Land of Water.
