Suna to no Kyōdō Sakusen
) is episode 169 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Boruto
 continues practising his
Wind Release: Rasengan
, but
Kakashi
 thinks it's as far as he can push at the moment, disheartening Boruto.
Konohamaru
 and
Mugino
 observe patients going into a restricted treatment area, where they don't come out. Among the doctors, Konohamaru recognises the
doctor
 who helped with the
Iwagakure
 coup. The only area they have yet to search is the underground area accessed through the elevator.
Shikadai
 greets Boruto, and tells him not to overdo it with his training. Boruto shares Kakashi's conclusions with him.
Chōchō
 observes
Sarada
's training with
Sasuke
.
Team 10
 is assigned a mission by request of the
Land of Wind
, to recover the missing puppet
Urashiki
 used against them. The fact they haven't been able to recover it concerns them that someone else may have acquired it. They discuss Boruto's and Sarada's training.
Deepa
 eats a meal at the Land of Wind. Chōchō wants to eat at a place
her father
 told her about, and they reach it just as Deepa departs. They find the place trashed and everyone inside dead. The next day, they meet up with
Team Shinki
, and inform them of the restaurant incident. They arrive at the general area where Shikadai defeated the puppet, and they have
Araya
 quickly canvas the area with his
Sanshōuo
 puppet. Araya finds the puppet. Deepa arrives at the scene, and Shikadai warns Team Shinki that he was present in the restaurant incident.
 From Deepa's words, Shikadai deduces he's the one who defeated
Team 7
. Deepa attacks with
his cubes
, and
Shinki
 blocks with his
Iron Sand Wall
. Deepa manages to break through, hitting Araya and
Yodo
. Chōchō and
Inojin
 make separate attacks from two different directions, allowing Shikadai to pin Deepa with his shadow. Shinki attacks him, but his
Black Iron Fist
 has no effect. Deepa breaks through Shikadai's shadow, and shatters Shinki's Iron Sand Wall with a single cube. Deepa collects the puppet and turns to leave, noticing his hand steaming. Shinki makes a final effort to destroy the puppet rather than let Deepa have it, and passes out. Back at
Konoha
, Shikadai reports to
his father
 and
Naruto
. Boruto continues practising.
