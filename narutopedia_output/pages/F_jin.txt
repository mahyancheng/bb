Fūjin
 (
風神
) is a criminal
shinobi
 who makes up half of the
Legendary Stupid Brothers
, alongside his younger brother
Raijin
.

Background

The two brothers originated from an unknown village. They once killed their comrades over a meal, and calmed down immediately afterwards. After the incident, they were locked up in
Konoha Strict Correctional Facility
, though the ones who apprehended them struggled with their mighty strength.
 At some point in their past, they had an encounter with
Tsunade
. The details are unknown but what ever it was the brothers have been terrified of her ever since.

Personality

Fūjin and his brother's thoughts revolve completely around food, and the guards of the prison would use this to their advantage, by controlling the food supply to keep the brothers in check. When dispute over food comes up, the two can act with tremendous rage and violence, killing anyone who ruins their meals. Both live up to their monikers as being very unintelligent, and they were scared into submission by Tsunade. Although unintelligent, he seems to be slightly more proactive than his younger brother, as Raijin would usually rely on him for handling situations or answering his rather foolish questions (to which Fūjin would reply with equally foolish answers). The brothers also have a certain degree of
god complex
, as when they demand for food from others, they refer to it as "offering".

The two brothers have a deep sense of affection for each other, as each of them suspect something wrong when
Ino Yamanaka
 took over their minds to attack each other, and tried to snap the other one out of it. They also seemed to have developed an attachment for
Mizuki
, because he went out of his way to get food for them, and claiming an even better feast awaits them at
Orochimaru
's
place
. However, when Tsunade threatened them with no dinner if they do not return to the prison, they immediately forgot all about Mizuki as they rushed back.

Appearance

Fūjin has cheek length black hair that is very close to his face and it is held in a pony-tail with a tannish-coloured wrap. He has a thin uni-brow, black eyes and a short spiky beard. He is about a head shorter than Raijin.

Abilities

Both brothers have monstrous strength and stamina, only increasing to higher levels as they get angrier. Also, with their power, they are able to jump great lengths and run at high speeds. Their strength has been said to be greater than that of Tsunade's.
 However this is proven wrong when Tsunade effortlessly defeats them both by merely flicking them both in the head, sending them both flying back several feet. Consequently, the prison they reside in is incapable of containing them, as they can easily break down the cell door. When even
Shikamaru
,
Ino
, and
Chōji
 held them in their
Shadow Imitation Technique
,
Mind Body Disturbance Technique
, and
Partial Multi-Size Techniques
, they were able to break out with brute strength alone. However, for all their strength, they are unintelligent and can be easily duped.

In addition to their brute strength, both brothers have shown be to impressively resistant to damage. They were able to easily take blows from each other, and Tsunade, without any sustainable injury. They even have a strong sense of smell, being able to sniff out the scent of food from Mizuki's cell.

Part I

Mizuki Tracking Mission

While in prison, the brothers were befriended by
Mizuki
, who convinced them to help him escape by offering them food.
 Once they escaped, they fought
Naruto
 and the members of
Team Asuma
. They were unable to beat the brothers, and it was not until Tsunade arrived and threatened to not give them any more food that they returned to jail.

Trivia

Fūjin shares his name with the
Shintō

god of wind
.

Fūjin's prisoner number is 12.
