Mezu and his gang had plotted to assassinate a wealthy tourist that was visiting Konoha. In the outskirts of the village, Mezu was seemingly speaking to another individual, stating that the era of shinobi had ended. Mezu noticed he was spotted by a
genin
 and what he had assumed initially was a
ninneko
. Thinking she found him by mistake, Mezu had planned to spare her, until Mirai mentioned him by name. A fight broke out between the Mezu Gang and Mirai, the young genin cast a
genjutsu
 on the gang, but it had no effect. Before he could kill Mirai, Mezu was stopped by
Shikamaru Nara
