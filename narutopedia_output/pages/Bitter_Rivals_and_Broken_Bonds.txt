"
Bitter Rivals and Broken Bonds
" (
見えない亀裂
,
Mienai Kiretsu
) is episode 108 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 are about to clash,
Kakashi
 appears and redirects them into differing water towers. Admiring the damage his
Chidori
 has done to his water tower, Sasuke believes himself to be stronger than Naruto. After closer inspection, he finds Naruto's tower to be completely destroyed on one side, and only comes to envy Naruto's strength even more. Kakashi is amazed that Naruto has learned and mastered the
Rasengan
 and realises it must have been
Jiraiya
 who taught it to him. Kakashi berates Jiraiya for teaching Naruto the Rasengan, stating that the technique was too powerful for Naruto to handle and that it could have killed Sasuke; Jiraiya rebuffs by stating that Kakashi should not talk, as he had taught Sasuke the Chidori, and Sasuke's Chidori could have just as easily killed Naruto. Jiraiya also states that he should have not taught Sasuke such a technique, as Sasuke is hell bent on revenge. Kakashi likens the relationship between Naruto and Sasuke to that of Jiraiya and
Orochimaru
, adding that Naruto views Sasuke as his greatest rival while Sasuke cannot handle Naruto's growing strength and admirable progress.

Later, Kakashi ties Sasuke up to talk to him and lectures him about not attacking his comrades. Kakashi advises him to abandon his quest for vengeance, but Sasuke states that Kakashi would not understand until the day when he loses everyone important to him. Kakashi tells Sasuke that everyone closest to him has already been killed, and adds that the Chidori is not a tool used against a comrade. He tells Sasuke that despite their mutual losses, they are both lucky enough to find friends to fill the void. Kakashi then leaves Sasuke to make his own judgment on the matter. Sasuke contemplates whether to accept Naruto and
Sakura
 as his friends or to continue on with his goal of killing
Itachi
 when he is attacked by the
Sound Four
, sent by Orochimaru to retrieve Sasuke.

Meanwhile, Sakura asks Naruto out on a walk in order to tell him about the
cursed seal
 that Orochimaru
had placed
 on Sasuke during the
Chūnin Exams
, as Naruto had been unconscious and was unaware of it at the time. Sakura remembers that Kakashi had told her that he had
handled it
, but is worried nonetheless about the cursed seal affecting Sasuke.
