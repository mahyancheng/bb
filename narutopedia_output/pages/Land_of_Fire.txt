The Land of Fire.



The
Land of Fire
 (
火の国
,
Hi no Kuni
) is one of the largest and most powerful
countries
 seen, and is the home of the main characters of the series. Its government leader is the
Fire Daimyō
. The Land of Fire was the first country to adopt a ninja village,
Konohagakure
, a custom other countries would soon adopt. The Land of Fire is appropriately oriented towards the
element of fire
, typically having very bright and warm weather. While not the physically largest country, it has the largest hidden village.

The Land of Fire has been involved in wars with the
Land of Lightning
, the
Land of Earth
, and the
Land of Wind
. In the quiet years that followed, the Land of Fire slowly recovered, and became accustomed to peace. This was seen as a weakness by other countries, which had been working to increase their military power, and is one of the factors that brought about the
Konoha Crush
 by
Otogakure
 and
Sunagakure
.

On the border between the Land of Fire and the
Land of Sound
 sits the
Valley of the End
, a large rift formed shortly after the founding of Konohagakure by the
First

Hokage
 and
Madara Uchiha
.
