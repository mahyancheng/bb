One of Delta's unique
Shinobi-Ware

Scientific Ninja Tools
 are her modified eyes. With them, she is able to absorb, retain, and release
ninjutsu
. The eyes are also equipped with specially designed
beams
 that counteract regeneration abilities, and are connected to her
Spy Drone
, allowing her to receive information such as detection of invisible jutsu. Despite their versatility, there is a limit of how much chakra they can store, and they will short out if they're made to absorb too much chakra, which will also sever their connection with the drone.
