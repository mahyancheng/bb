"
For My Friend
" (
友のために
,
Tomo no Tame ni
) is episode 261 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Tobi
 prepares to unleash the
White Zetsu Army
 on the
Allied Shinobi Forces
,
Kabuto
 deploys his
resurrected
 army to fight.
Haku
 ponders why he is still alive yet unable to move his body as
Zabuza
 explains that they have been resurrected and that he has no respect for any individual who summons the dead to do their bidding.
Asuma
 is brought back to life as well, along with
Dan Katō
,
Tsunade
's former lover, to assist them with
Itachi
 and the
jinchūriki
 of the
tailed beasts
 tagging along as well.

Back at the
Mountains' Graveyard
 hideout, Kabuto places
Deidara
,
Sasori
,
Chūkichi
, and
Shin
 into a
Surprise Attack and Diversion Platoon
. Sasori is dismayed about the
Akatsuki
 having lost so many members and how
Zetsu
 and Tobi are the only ones left alive. Meanwhile,
Tokuma
 notices the White Zetsu Army mobilising and alerts
Anko
, who instructs the other members of the
Infiltration and Reconnaissance Party
 to report the intel back to the Allied Forces while she provides a distraction. However, she is easily subdued and poisoned by Kabuto, while Deidara goes after her teammates.

In
Kumogakure
, fights break out between the
shinobi
 as they find themselves unable to trust their newfound allies, with
Konoha
-nin blaming
Suna
 for their involvement in the
Konoha Crush
 that led to the
Third Hokage
's death while
Kiri
 holds
Iwa
 responsible for the
Tragedy of Yosuga Pass
. However,
Gaara
 breaks up their fight and reveals to them that he once held the same anger and contempt that they do, and that he wanted to kill everyone in the world because of it, although he was saved by a
certain someone
. Gaara remembers his
fight
 with Naruto and reveals to everyone that he was saved by the fellow jinchūriki, despite them being enemies, and that he made a friend. Gaara tells them that they must put aside their conflicts with the other villages as they share a common enemy now — the Akatsuki — who have attacked each one of their villages in some way, and that if any of them still harbour resentment towards Suna, then they may fight him after the war. He then asks them to provide him with strength to save the friend who once saved him, as the latter is the Akatsuki's target, and his speech boosts the troops' morale, causing them to apologise to one another and follow Gaara as the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 begins.

As the
Fifth Mizukage
 spearheads the
Daimyō Protection Squad
, Naruto and
Killer B
 continue their training on the
Island Turtle
, with Naruto managing to successfully balance wooden blocks using his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
. However, B tells him that his training is not over yet and that there is one more thing he must do.
