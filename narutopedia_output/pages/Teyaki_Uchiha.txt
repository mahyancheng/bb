Teyaki Uchiha
 (
うちはテヤキ
,
Uchiha Teyaki
) was a citizen of
Konohagakure
 and a member of the
Uchiha Clan
.

Background

Teyaki, along with his wife
Uruchi
 were the owners of the
Uchiha Senbei
 shop, a renowned shop within the Uchiha Compound. His shop had been in the family since the rise of
Konoha
. The recipe of the senbei that gave the shop its fame was a secret passed down through the generations and was closely guarded by Teyaki.

He encouraged
Sasuke
 to be a great shinobi on his own, instead of telling him to emulate his older brother
Itachi
. He and his wife were later killed during the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
.

Appearance

Teyaki had a short crop of grey hair and a kind face. He wore a beige-coloured long-sleeved kimono shirt, and a beige-coloured pair of pants.

Trivia

Teyaki means "home baked" (
手焼き
) in Japanese.

Sasuke refers to Teyaki and his wife as "uncle" and "aunt". Since it is possible that Sasuke used
uncle
 (
おじさん
,
Ojisan
) as a gesture of respect, it is uncertain whether Teyaki was really his uncle.
