Fugi
 (
フギ
) was a
shinobi
 from
Sunagakure
.

Background

Some time before the
Chūnin Exams
, Fugi had a meeting with
Hōichi
, discussing their plan to seal
Shukaku
 in a tea kettle, with Gaara being the necessary sacrifice for the cause. He was impressed after hearing that the boy had studied
Bunpuku
's power to mould currents.

Appearance

Fugi had long, dark hair tied in a lower ponytail and dark purple-coloured eyes, along with pointed ears. He also had four tear-troughs on his face. Fugi's attire consisted of a grey
tangzhuang
 with a buttoned-up collar and yellow markings at the hem and the sleeves, red pants, and black shoes.

Abilities

Using pre-existing
sand
, Fugi was capable of creating a
barrier
 that allowed him to overwrite other active barriers, like the
Sensing Barrier
, in the surrounding area, creating a sandstorm in the process, which surrounds opponents and limits their sense of vision. He was carrying a
tantō
, implying skills in
kenjutsu
.

After the completion of the first phase of the Chūnin Exams, Fugi was present alongside
Gaara
, who orders preparations to be made for the second phase set in the
Demon Desert
.
 In the Demon Desert, Fugi attempted to
overwrite
 the
Sensing Barrier
, creating a gigantic sandstorm in the process. He then recalled his meeting with
Hōichi
 before the Chūnin Exams and their plan to
seal
 Shukaku in a tea kettle, with the
Kazekage
's life being the necessary cost.

Later, while waiting for Hōichi to return, Gaara located Fugi and communicated with him via
sand clone
, making the older Suna-nin realise that Hōichi was defeated. While feigning continued loyalty to Gaara, the Kazekage told Fugi that after encountering his first
friend
, Gaara had been hoping to achieve redemption and to show his village he is a changed person. Gaara, well-aware of Fugi's part in the recent attempt on his life, told Fugi if he does not believe him, he was more than welcome to take the younger ninja's head. Realising that Gaara's words were sincere, Fugi, ashamed of his actions against the changed jinchūriki, committed
seppuku
 to atone.

Trivia

"Fugi" (
フギ
) literally means "unrighteousness".

When written as 不義, "Fugi" also means "murdering one's teacher or a government official", alluding to his attempts on Gaara's life.
