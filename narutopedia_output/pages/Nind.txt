Nindō
 (
忍道
,
literally meaning:
 Ninja Way) is a personal rule that each
shinobi
 lives by. It is their way of ninja life, their motto, belief, or "dream". A ninja's nindō can be anything, no matter how immoral their personal point of view is. Most often
Naruto Uzumaki
 proclaims his ninja way, to be: "I'm not gonna run away and I never go back on my word, that is my nindō! My ninja way!"
 There is nothing stopping other ninja from following another ninja's personal rule, such as
Hinata Hyūga
 and
Jiraiya
 adopting Naruto's nindō, or
Rock Lee
 following
Might Guy
's "My Rules" philosophy. There is also nothing wrong with a ninja following more than one nindō, such as the above Konoha ninja also following the
Will of Fire
 belief from their village in addition to their own personal rules.

According to
Tobi
, the nindō of the
Uchiha clan
 is to
exact revenge against their hated enemies
. Conversely, the
Senju
 created what is known as the Will of Fire in
Konohagakure
, which can be said to be the universal ninja way of all the shinobi of this village. In
Iwagakure
, there exists a similar philosophy known as the
Will of Stone
, which simply states that shinobi of the village must be strong-willed and proud without giving in to hate.

Kisame Hoshigaki
's philosophy as taught to him by
Fuguki Suikazan
 is that confidential information is more important than human lives, and he would go as far as to betray
comrades
,
 and even commit suicide to ensure that it remains secret.
