A snake.



Snakes
 (
蛇
,
Hebi
), also known as
kyodaija
 (
巨大蛇
,
literally meaning:
 Giant Snakes), are residents of the
Ryūchi Cave
 that are the signature summons of
Orochimaru
, his assistant,
Kabuto Yakushi
, and his students:
Sasuke Uchiha
 and
Anko Mitarashi
.

Overview

The snakes vary greatly in size, body mass and species, from small enough to hide in one's sleeves to larger than buildings, and thin enough to be used to tie someone's hands
 to strong enough to choke a colossal animal like the
Island Turtle
.
 Although common snakes cannot speak human language like
toads
, some of their summoners could communicate with them. They are able to detect live beings by their
heat and smell
 in order to track and lead their summoners to their prey.





Kabuto manifesting snakes.



Orochimaru frequently summons snakes in battle, either having them attack for him or instructing them to carry out other tasks. While most snakes are very obedient and do as they are instructed, the largest snake, Manda, demanded a sacrifice of a hundred humans in exchange for helping Orochimaru. Snakes have also mastered the use of
natural energy
 to enter a
Sage Mode
 of their own. The only known way to learn it is in the Ryūchi Cave with the
White Snake Sage
.

Summoners

Orochimaru

Orochimaru is heavily associated with snakes: his personality, appearance and even name are snake-like or orientated. After many experiments and
forbidden techniques
, Orochimaru's
true form
 indeed became that of a snake. Orochimaru was also able to use
senjutsu
, and with this knowledge, he developed the
cursed seals
.

Anko Mitarashi

The first of Orochimaru's students to sign a contract with snakes, as well as the first to gain the cursed seal and survived. Anko learned several forbidden and snake-related techniques with Orochimaru, such as the
Twin Snakes Mutual Death Technique
. In the anime, it was also stated that she had built up an immunity to venom.

Sasuke Uchiha

Sasuke mainly used the snakes he summoned as shields to defend himself. He would later summon them once again during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 when he summoned
Aoda
 to the battlefield.

Kabuto Yakushi

At first, Kabuto only aided Orochimaru in summoning snakes while his arms were
disabled
. He later began to summon snakes on his own after implanting Orochimaru's remains into himself. Kabuto continued Orochimaru's research and discovered the Ryūchi Cave, where he learned
senjutsu
 from the
White Snake Sage
. He gained access to a
Sage Mode
 which, according to him, allowed him to figuratively transcend from a snake into a "
dragon
".

Mitsuki

Mitsuki is able to summon snakes, which he uses as a means of communication or in tandem with various techniques.

Mamushi (Genin)

In the anime, Mamushi can use snakes in unison with
Hidden Shadow Snake Hands
.

Boruto Uzumaki

In the anime, Boruto made a temporarily summoning contract with
Garaga
.

Ichi

In
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
, Ichi could use snakes mutated by the
Chimera Technique
.

Trivia

In the anime, it was mentioned by
Hiruzen Sarutobi
 to his grandson
Konohamaru
 that the rainbow symbolises snakes, and is deemed an omen of the coming of evil. This was recalled during the
Konoha Crush
, which was led by the snake-themed
Orochimaru
.

Snakes have long since been associated with
dragons
: a testament to this, after entering
Sage Mode
, Kabuto stated that he had evolved from being a simple snake into a dragon.
 Orochimaru's
Eight Branches Technique
 is also described as ascending beyond snakes, becoming a dragon god.

In the anime, Aoda identifies himself as a
summoning snake
, suggesting all snakes that are associated with the
Summoning Technique
 are classified as such.

In
Naruto Shippūden the Movie
, the technique
Strengthening Prescription: Chakra Injection
 utilises dark snakes that inject medically altered chakra into the recipients to grant them a temporary boost in power and skills, and can be used for
paralysis
 and
killing
.
