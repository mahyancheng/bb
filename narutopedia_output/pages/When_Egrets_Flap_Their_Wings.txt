Sagi no Habataku Toki

 anime.

Synopsis

Hōki
 seemingly kills
Chishima
 and knocks
Naruto
 underwater. Naruto awakens when
Sagi
's ghost asks him to save
Toki
 from her desire for revenge and defeat Mōsō. Naruto rises from the water and punches Hōki, then tells Toki that he has seen Sagi. Naruto then fights against and defeats Hōki. Chishima turns out to have survived Hōki's attack. Toki apologises to her subjects for deceiving them, but asks them to allow her to remain ruler in order to restore the
Land of Birds
. After the group leaves,
Neji
 tells Naruto that the first
Cursed Warrior
 they encountered was actually a real ghost, much to his horror.
