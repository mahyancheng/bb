This article is about Sasori's puppet armour.  For other uses, see
Hiruko (disambiguation)
.

Hiruko
 (
ヒルコ
) was a
puppet
 used by the
Akatsuki
 shinobi,
Sasori
. Serving as a "puppet armour", it allowed Sasori to hide inside of it. Sasori also adorned Hiruko with the Akatsuki's robes and hid inside it so often that others came to recognise him only when he was wearing it. In the anime, Hiruko is a
human puppet
 made from the corpse of a
renowned shinobi
.
 According to
Chiyo
, Hiruko was Sasori's favourite puppet.

Abilities and Weapons





Sasori and his Hiruko puppet.



Hiruko is a versatile puppet that serves as armor in addition to being a weapon, protecting Sasori from the close-range attacks that often prove to be the bane of puppet users.

All weapons installed in Hiruko were coated in Sasori's special brand of
poison
, which would kill the victim after three days of painful paralysis.

Extendable iron tail providing offence by stabbing and defence by rotating around the body. The tail's sturdiness is potent enough to casually deflect a
Fūma Shuriken
 and
launched kunai
.

Heavy back shell for additional defence. A new addition since Chiyo last saw it twenty years ago.

Rapid launching
 of
senbon
 from the mouth.

Torpedo-shaped left arm
 that launches shrapnel of senbon in all directions. A new addition since Chiyo last saw it twenty years ago.

Granted Sasori a gruffer voice.

Trivia





Hiruko adorned with the Akatsuki robes.



"Hiruko" (
蛭子
) is an alternative name of a
Japanese Fisherman god
, commonly known as "
Ebisu
".

Hiruko's tail was seen in a flashback of Sasori's childhood as a part of an unfinished puppet. It had a split end.

Hiruko was erroneously called Sasori's eighteenth puppet in the anime.
 This was because "
favourite
" (
十八番
,
ohako
) literally translates to "number eighteen". Hiruko is actually Sasori's eleventh puppet.

Both the puppet Hiruko and the
Third Kazekage
 were stated to be Sasori's favourite.

When
Yamato
 went to the
Tenchi Bridge
 to meet up with
one of Sasori's spies
, he used a Hiruko-like puppet disguise to pass himself off as Sasori.

The Hiruko puppet is 107cm in height.
