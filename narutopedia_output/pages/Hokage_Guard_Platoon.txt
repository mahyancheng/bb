This
guard platoon
 (
護衛小隊
,
goei shōtai
) is a group of
Konohagakure
 shinobi dedicated towards the protection of the
Hokage
. The group has served as elite bodyguards for the
Fourth Hokage
, who in his reign, taught them how to use the
Flying Thunder Formation Technique
, a minor version of the
Flying Thunder God Technique
, but unlike that technique, required the cooperation of all three members of the team to perform it.

The group also served as elite bodyguards for the
Fifth Hokage
 as well, who they marked with a seal for the Flying Thunder Formation Technique, most likely to teleport to her aid at any given time.
