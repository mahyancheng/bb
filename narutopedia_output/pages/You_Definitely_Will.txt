Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Kakashi
 asks the crumbling
Obito
 why he would sacrifice himself when he was still necessary in battle, but the silent
Uchiha
 muses that Kakashi was the one needed to support the next generation, before telling his comrade to focus on the enemy.
Kaguya
 decides to return to her
first dimension
 while she replenishes her chakra, but when
Naruto
 tries to use his
abilities
 to save Obito,
Black Zetsu
 launches a tirade not only about Naruto's futile efforts, but what he believes to be Obito's wasted life; and though Obito agrees to this, Zetsu's words do nothing but infuriate the touring
Uzumaki
.
 Wasting no time when he realised that his
dōjutsu
's
ability
 was useable once more,
Sasuke
 launches an attack on Kaguya, forcing her to
shift dimensions
 once more to narrowly escape the attack. Noting that this time he would be the distraction, Sasuke engages Kaguya giving her no time to relent as he dons his
Complete Body — Susanoo
 and flies towards her. Obito uses this time to impart his final words to Kakashi and Naruto, thanking them for allowing him to remember who he used to be. After telling Naruto to become
Hokage
, Obito finally disintegrates into a pile of ash, leading Black Zetsu to comment that Obito was a cockroach for having last so long rather than a regular insect. Enraged at this point, Naruto declares that because he wanted to become Hokage at one point, Obito was an awesome person in his eyes, and proceeded to fly up to Kaguya at an extreme speed, severing her left arm with his own
chakra arm
. Meanwhile, in what appears to be the afterlife, Obito finds
Rin
 and the two reconcile.
