An "Imitation Human Ninja Art" (
擬人忍法
,
Gijin Ninpō
), this technique
transforms
 a
ninken
 into their
Inuzuka
 partner. By doing this, the Inuzuka gains a copy of themselves that serves the same practical purpose as a
shadow clone
 but without a shadow clone's steep
chakra
 requirement. Even though they look identical, the ninken - because it's an animal - is likely to give away which of the two is which from how it moves and acts. To counteract this, the Inuzuka typically uses an
Imitation Beast Ninja Art
, causing them to act more feral and thus make it harder to tell them apart.
 As with any transformation, the ninken will revert to their original form if they're knocked out.

When the Beast Human Clone is first used during the
Chūnin Exams arc
,
Akamaru
 is seemingly the one to use this technique after he's been fed a
soldier pill
.
 When it's used again during the
Sasuke Recovery Mission
, it is seemingly performed by Akamaru's partner,
Kiba Inuzuka
, instead.
 On both occasions, the Beast Human Clone's use typically precedes the
Fang Passing Fang
. By Part II, the Beast Human Clone no longer seems necessary for Kiba and Akamaru's manoeuvres, presumably because Akamaru's natural size is much closer to Kiba's than it was in Part I.
