Summary

The
genin
 question
Neji
's actions, to which his response is to send vibrations through the classroom walls to notify the other teammates what question to answer.
Sajin
, not wanting everyone to pass, hits the wall five times. Neji states it wouldn't matter how many times the walls are struck. Sajin tries instigating a fight but
Shikamaru
 intervenes, reminding everyone of the time limit. As the genin finish their written tests, Shikamaru informs them of a second part.
 For the second part, everyone must write on the back of their sheets who they would choose as a decoy if their team is surrounded, within a 3 minute time limit. Meanwhile,
Kankurō
 informs
Tsunade
 that they will look after their
Sunagakure
 genin during the second phase, leaving the
Hokage
 suspicious.
Homura
 and
Koharu
, who arrived before Kankurō, relay a warning from
Danzō
 to be wary of the
Amegakure
 genin. With the first phase of the
Chūnin Exams
 completed, those who pass are instructed to journey to Suna for the next phase. Sajin and his team are eliminated due to choosing
Mijin
 as the decoy. Neji reveals to Sajin that no comrade should be sacrificed, and that a written answer was not required. With
Temari
 as proctor she explains about the second phase in which the teams are allowed to fight, the teams that passed the first stage begin to race to Sunagakure which would take at least three days to reach.
