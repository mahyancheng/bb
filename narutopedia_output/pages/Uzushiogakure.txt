Uzushiogakure
 (
渦潮隠れの里
,
Uzushiogakure no Sato
,
English TV:
 Hidden Eddy Village,
literally meaning:
 Village Hidden by Whirling Tides) was the shinobi village of the
Land of Whirlpools
. The people of Uzushiogakure were noted to have notoriously long lives, so it gained the epithet "The Village of Longevity" (
長寿の里
,
Chōju no Sato
).

The ninja of Uzushiogakure were famed for their
fūinjutsu
; the
Four Symbols Seal
 is based on the village's techniques. In times of war, the power of the village's fūinjutsu earned fear from many, ultimately leading to it being targeted and subsequently destroyed by other villages
 at some point prior to
Kushina Uzumaki
's emigration from the destroyed village.
 Survivors of Uzushio's destruction scattered across the globe to seek refuge.

Uzushiogakure had close ties with
Konohagakure
, due to Uzushio's
Uzumaki clan
 and Konoha's
Senju clan
 being distant blood relatives. Because of this, all
flak jackets
 of Konohagakure bear the crest of Uzushiogakure, symbolising the strong friendship between both villages.
 In the manga,
Otogakure
's official attire also includes a symbol of Uzushiogakure.
