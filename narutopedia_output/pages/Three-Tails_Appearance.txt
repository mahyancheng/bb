.

Summary





Orochimaru offers Guren a chance to prove herself.



Orochimaru
 instructed
Kabuto Yakushi
 along with
Team Guren
 to take a young boy named
Yūkimaru
 to a lake. After they arrived, Kabuto forced Yūkimaru to release all of his chakra, which caused the Three-Tails to begin to surface from the lake. With
Guren
's help, the beast was completely revealed, and they attempted to capture it. Their attempts proved insufficient, however, and the beast created a large tidal wave to wash its attackers away.
Tsunade
 finds the location of Orochimaru's hideout and sends
Kakashi
 as temporary leader of
Team 8
 to locate it. They engage battle with Guren and Shino sends back one of his crystallised bugs. Then Tsunade sends
Yamato
,
Sai
, and
Sakura
 to help them along with
Naruto
 who meets them along the way. Team Kakashi and Kurenai follow Guren and discover that the thing they were after was the Three-Tails.
Shizune
,
Ino
,
Tenten
 and
Lee
 are assembled to help with the hunt for the Three-Tails. They all meet up and split into three groups to
seal the tailed beast in its own dimension
 and get
Yūkimaru
. The sealing group consists of
Shizune
, Hinata, Sakura, and Ino, the guarding group is Yamato, Tenten, Kiba, and Lee, while the fighting group is Naruto, Kakashi, Sai, and Shino.





The sealing of the Three-Tails.



Team Three tried to use Four-Corner Sealing Barrier to permanently trap the beast in its own dimension. Just as the sealing began to work, the Konoha ninja were interrupted by Guren, which prompted the beast to attack them all. Yūkimaru was able to calm the beast down temporarily, but, after he became tired, the Three-Tails turned its attention to him. Guren and Naruto came to his defence, but were swallowed in the process. With the help of their allies on the outside, they were able to escape, and the Konoha ninja tried once more to seal the beast.





Tobi and Deidara confront the beast.



Just when the sealing was almost complete, Yūkimaru, angered by the apparent death of Guren, empowered the beast to break free of its restraints. The Three-Tails went on a rampage, attacking everyone nearby and crushing
Nurari
,
Kigiri
, and
Kihō
. Its attempts to attack Yūkimaru, however, had no effect. It was only through the use of the
Wind Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet
 that the beast was driven away. The sealing attempt was left to Anbu members, and the remaining Konoha ninja returned home.
Deidara
 and
Tobi
 of Akatsuki soon found these Anbu members and disposed of them.

The beast's capture took place much earlier in the manga (at the start of the Akatsuki Suppression Mission), but played out in much the same way as in the anime. Tobi and Deidara confronted the beast, to which it responded by beginning to chase Tobi. With the Three-Tails distracted, Deidara moulded an explosive clay fish in an attempt to devour it. It was unclear if this marked the end of the battle, as the remainder of the battle went unseen. As the two towed the Three-Tails to the Akatsuki's lair after the battle, Tobi gloated at bringing the Three-Tails down with his special jutsu, but Deidara thought otherwise. It was later sealed in the sealing statue.
