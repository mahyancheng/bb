Guy pins the opponent down and does a hundred push-ups on top of them in five seconds. After this, he spins around so fast that his legs catch fire and then he kicks the opponent into the air.

Trivia

If this ultimate technique fails, Guy will only perform ninety-nine push-ups in five seconds, then run away crying.
