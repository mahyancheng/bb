Sagan
 (
サガン
) is a
shinobi
 from
Iwagakure
.

Personality

Sagan seems to be a calm shinobi
 and he was shocked while watching the five Kage fight Madara.
 After seeing how powerful Madara is, he stated that it was all over for him and his comrades.

Appearance

Sagan has long, brown hair which reaches into his back with a bang on the left side of his face. Attire-wise, he wears the standard attire of the Iwa-nin complete with a two-sleeved shirt, with mesh armour underneath it. He also wears his red
forehead protector
 in a bandanna style.

Abilities

Sagan is a
sensor-type
 shinobi of some skill, evident on the battlefield when he detected
Madara Uchiha
 and
Mū
's location and alerted the other shinobi present.

Though not a medic, he was also able to deduce the
Tsuchikage
's state from looking at him as well.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Sagan was assigned to the
Fourth Division
. He was one of the few shinobi of that division to survive Madara Uchiha's
assault
 on the battlefield. Making his way over to where
Ōnoki
 was, he informed the other that the Tsuchikage was still alive, though gravely injured. He later alerted those present when Madara and Mū had reconstructed, and watched on in despair as Madara
continued
 his assault on the depleted division. When the five
Kage
 assembled on the battlefield, Sagan looked on in amazement as the battle between the titans unfolded, noting that he felt severely out of place. Later, Sagan was seen pursuing
Mū
 alongside
Dodai
 and the
Hokage Guard Platoon
, and witnessed Mū's soul ascending when the Impure World Reincarnation was released.

Trivia

Sagan can be written in two different ways: as 左岸, it refers to the left side of a riverbank; as 砂岩, it means "sandstone".

Though a manga character, Sagan's name was only revealed in the anime credits.
