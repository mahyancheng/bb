Ashimaru
 (
葦丸
) was a former shinobi turned
mercenary
 alongside his partner
Hidari
.

Background

After the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 ended, Ashimaru and Hidari lost their jobs, leading to them taking
missions
 directly. Fifteen years later, the pair were hired by
Iori
, with the objective to retrieve the deed to the
Green Banks
 bridge. Providing Iori with
poison
, he used it to kill the
village head
 of Green Banks. For three months, the two assaulted the village in an attempt to force the new village head
Kiri
 into handing over the deed.

Personality

He appeared to be a coldblooded individual with a strong, battle-crazed mentality, evident from having no qualms trying to kill a child or stabbing a man who hired him. He was also overly confident in his abilities, recklessly attacking with no concern for defending.

Appearance

Ashimaru was a burly shinobi with a towering stature, easily being a head taller than
Konohamaru Sarutobi
. He had short dark spiked hair and no eyebrows. His forehead was dominated by a red triangle with a point ending between his eyes. Ashimaru's attire consisted of a black long shirt which included a halfmask that covers the lower part of his face. The shirt was held in place by a wide belt, leaving two lapels over blue pants. Ashimaru's arms were covered in bandages and he had two swords strapped to his back. His attire was finished off by normal shinobi sandals with some bandages around his right one.

Abilities

While little had been shown of his overall skills, the fact that Ashimaru carried two
swords
 implies that he was skilled in
kenjutsu
. He was shown to be very resilient, unfazed by the series of
explosive tag
 blasts set off on him.

Ashimaru and Hidari facing Konohamaru.



Ashimaru and Hidari's actions made Kiri request
Konohagakure
 for help. Worrying about the danger one of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 could cause, Hidari devised an alternate plan to kidnap Kiri and ransom her for the deed. Once their diversion let Iori capture Kiri, the two missing-nin betrayed and killed him. When facing the
Team 7
, Ashimaru went after the genin. While easily repelling
Boruto Uzumaki
 and
Mitsuki
,
Sarada Uchiha
 used the initial attack to analyse his moves. This let Sarada devise a team assault, leading her defeat the larger foe with one
powerful blow
.
