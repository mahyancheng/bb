The design of an old style of summoning.
The Sealing Room.
1/2

The
Sealing Room
 is the place where the ancestors of
Temujin
 sealed the
Stone of Gelel
 and swore that they would never again revive it.

In the centre of the room there is a design of an old style of summoning. It is bound by the blood of the main branch of Temujin's clan. This is used to summon a
Space–Time Hole
. Once the person has activated the technique, it was falsely believed that they will never come back alive.

The room, along with the vein of Gelel, were destroyed when Temujin summoned the Space-Time Hole, though he was rescued by
Naruto Uzumaki
 from being sucked in.
