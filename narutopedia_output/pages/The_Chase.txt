"
The Chase
" (
追跡
,
Tsuiseki
) is episode 211 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

At night,
Koji Kashin
 infiltrates a
Konoha
 archive facility and steals data. The next day,
Team 5
 and
Team 10
 discuss the event.
Denki
 and
Iwabee
 debate whether the theft was facilitated by the data being digital instead of on paper.
Inojin
 comments on how the
village's Barrier Team
 detected no foreign
chakra
 signatures, leading
Shikadai
 to consider an inside job.
Chōchō
 wants to catch the intruder, and convinces her team-mates to help her. They find the tower where Koji was staying, and a computer with blueprints of the archive facility. Inojin spots someone nearby, who turns out to be
Kakashi
. He claims to be just walking around, but Shikadai deduces he's looking for the intruder as well, by himself instead of as a part of a group so as not to draw attention. They show Kakashi their discovery, and he suggests they continue investigating together, giving them earpieces. The four watch the tower, and spot Koji, but he switches directions midway to it. Inojin follows him from the sky on one of his
drawings
, but loses him in a crowd.
 Kakashi says the intruder noticed he'd been made, so he abandoned the hideout, and will try to leave the village. He considers the intruder went into the sewers to make it appear he vanished in the crowd. Knowing the intruder is dangerous from his moves and from the
jōnin
 he took out in the archives, Kakashi goes after him alone, and instructs Team 10 to notify the jōnin on watch to seal the exists. Shikadai realises the intruder will leave the sewer not on the outskirts of the village, but on a
Thunder Rail
 station. Kakashi is too far to make it in time, and Team 10 arrives as a train is leaving. Chōchō
enlarges her arms
 and throws Shikadai and Inojin on the train. Shikadai
paralyses
 Koji, but as Inojin gets close to unmask him, the
shadow clone
 dissipates. Koji takes out guards and infiltrates another archive facility, but Kakashi arrived before him. After being contacted by Shikadai, he realised that Koji was trying to lure the extra security away by pretending to leave the village, so he could steal data archived on physical scrolls, yet to be digitised. Wanting to know how he slipped past the
Sensing Barrier
, Kakashi attacks him with
Lightning Release: Purple Electricity
, but it's a shadow clone again. Koji creates a
smokescreen
 and escapes. He thinks to himself the data had nothing to do with his goal and wonders if he's getting sentimental. He's confused by the lack of a counterattack by
Jigen
 to retrieve
Kawaki
, and realises his last fight took a lot of his chakra. Team 10 and Team 5 discuss the chase at
Senju Park
. Shikadai goes talk to Kakashi, and speculates that since the physical data was only from past shinobi, the intruder might be one of these past shinobi. Considering that, Kakashi adds that the intruder's chakra might be registered, explaining why the barrier detected no intrusions. Koji returns to
Kara's headquarters
 and meets
Amado
. He informs Koji of Jigen's condition, and that all other Inners are away. They mean for Koji to kill Jigen.
