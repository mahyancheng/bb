A
ninja registration number
 (
忍者登録番号
,
Ninja tōroku bangō
) is a unique identifier given to
ninja
 of certain
hidden villages
; different villages use different numbering schemes.

Overview

Registration numbers have only ever been provided within the supplementary
databooks
 of the
Naruto
 series, and even then only for characters that are given full biographies. Some such characters have their registration numbers listed as "?", implying that they have one but that it is not being disclosed for whatever reason;
Minato Namikaze
 is initially listed in this way before a proper number is provided in
Jin no Sho
. Still other characters have registration numbers listed as "—", implying they do not have one at all, either because their village does not use registration numbers (discussed below), because the character became a ninja before their respective village was founded (such as with
Hashirama Senju
 and
Ōnoki
), or for some other unknown reason (as with the
Ame Orphans
 and
Iwagakure
's
jinchūriki
).

Registration numbers are used by all of the villages of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 with the exception of
Kirigakure
, whose ninja have consistently been listed without one. Of the smaller villages, only
Amegakure
 is known to use registration numbers. Ninja of
Otogakure
 (as with
Team Dosu
 in
Rin no Sho
),
Yugakure
 (as with
Hidan
 in
Sha no Sho
), and
Takigakure
 (as with
Fū
 in
Jin no Sho
) are listed without registration numbers, suggesting those villages do not use them. Only two ninja from
Uzushiogakure
 have ever received full biographies in the databooks:
Mito Uzumaki
 is listed without a registration number, though this may be because of her age;
Kushina Uzumaki
 is listed with a registration number, though it conforms to the numbering scheme used by
Konohagakure
, where she received her ninja training. Thus, it's unclear whether or not Uzushio used registration numbers at any point. Ninja from
Kusagakure
 have never received full biographies, again making it unclear if the village uses them.

Beyond the existence of ninja registration numbers, the databooks never go into detail about them, rendering everything that can be said about them entirely observational. Individuals evidently receive their numbers when they complete their ninja training, most commonly by graduating from their village's
Academy
: twenty-seven students graduate from
Naruto Uzumaki
's Academy class,
 though only
nine
 of those students are ultimately accepted as
genin
.
 Those nine graduates have registration numbers ranging from
012601
 to
012625
, with the unaccounted for intervening numbers presumably belonging to the eighteen graduates who were denied as genin. Accordingly, members of genin teams generally have registration numbers within close proximity of each other, sometimes even consecutive numbers: the
Sannin
 are numbered
002300
,
002301
, and
002302
. With the exception of Amegakure, registration numbers are seemingly assigned sequentially, so that new ninja will receive higher numbers than their predecessors:
Konohamaru Sarutobi
 is numbered 012707, while his
grandfather
 is numbered 000261;
Gaara
 is numbered 56-001, while his
sister
 (three years his senior) is numbered 53-004.

Trivia

Because ninja registration numbers roughly correspond to a character's age, all characters with "?" listed as their registration number are likewise not listed with ages in the databooks. Examples include
Pakura
,
Gari
, and the
Third Raikage
.

Similarly, when
Iruka Umino
's age is reduced from 25 in
Rin no Sho
 to 23 in
Tō no Sho
, his registration number is changed as well, going from 011450 in the former to 011850 in the latter.

Several characters with "—" listed as their ninja registration numbers are similarly listed without
ninja ranks
, potentially explaining why they did not receive numbers. Examples include
Karura
,
Rōshi
, and
Nagato
.
