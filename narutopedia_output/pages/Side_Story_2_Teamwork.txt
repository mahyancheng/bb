Summary

His master
 tries to stop him from attacking, but
Kakashi
 reminds him that he is the team leader for this mission. Kakashi charges at the enemy with his
Chidori
, defeating wave after wave of
shadow clones
. When Kakashi finally reaches the real opponent, the speed of his Chidori leaves him unable to dodge a counterattack. His master saves him and quickly kills the ninja. He advises that Kakashi not use the technique again until he can overcome its drawback, and they rest for the night so that Kakashi can recover. Despite his injury, Kakashi continues to pick on
Obito
, drawing attention to each of his infractions of the
Shinobi Rules
. Though their master does not entirely approve, he explains how Kakashi's father,
Sakumo Hatake
, was disgraced when he didn't follow the rules and encourages Obito to be more understanding.
