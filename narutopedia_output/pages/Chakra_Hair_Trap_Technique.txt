After cutting her hair, Ino infuses the strands with her
chakra
 to trap anyone that comes into contact with them. Once immobilised, they are an easy target for her to cast her
Mind Body Switch Technique
.

Trivia

In
Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 2
, Ino uses a
variation
 of this technique, but uses flower petals instead of her hair.

This technique is a substitute for the
Shadow Imitation Technique
 in that they both trap the opponent and prevent them from moving.
