A versatile technique where the user can produce sharp wooden spikes from their body to either fashion short-range weapons akin to a makeshift sword,
 or use them as projectiles, where the branches' growth can be triggered remotely, skewering the enemy as a result.

Obito was able to channel this technique through the
Ten-Tails
' tails after he and
Madara Uchiha
 strengthened their control over the beast by connecting to it using
Hashirama Senju
's DNA.

Trivia

Cutting
, also called striking or cloning, is a method of plant propagation. It involves cutting off a piece of a plant, usually the stem or root, which is then put in an appropriate medium. If done properly, the cut piece will grow into a new plant, genetically identical to the plant it was cut from.

When this technique was first performed by Obito, various
black receivers
 were scattered throughout the growth of branches that extended from his right side. However, upon deactivating his
Mangekyō Sharingan
 and the Wood Release Technique, the rods vanished with them.
