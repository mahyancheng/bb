This was one of the
genin
 teams participating in the
Chūnin Exams
. They came from
Amegakure
, and all members wield
umbrellas
 and wear oxygen tanks. They had the unfortunate circumstance of meeting the
Three Sand Siblings
 in the second phase. They unwittingly confronted and provoked
Gaara
, who killed them all quickly and mercilessly.
