These scissor-like pincers were wielded by the
Fūma clan
's Kamikiri. The spring of the pincers is connected to his right arm and bicep by a black strip. Using a white cord tied to the base of each blade and held in the hand, it allows him to use the overly large pincers without much effort or using both hands. Kamikiri used these pincers as a regular part of his
fighting style
, using it to chop or slice targets. It's strong enough to break through solid rock, making it perfect for striking opponents with it too.
