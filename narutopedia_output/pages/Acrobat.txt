The
Acrobat
 is a kenjutsu used by
Killer B
 in tandem with his
swords
 and the standard technique of his unique
Disturbance Taijutsu
 fighting style.

Usage

When in battle, B holds his swords in a peculiar and unique manner. More often than employing his hands, B would wield his blades in and between various parts of his body. The first two are held in the hinge joint of his right and left arm, another between his shoulder blade and neck, one in his mouth, under his left armpit, another between the hip joint of his right, raised leg and the back leg of the same raised leg. As strange as it seems, Killer B is extremely skilled with these blades and this fighting style which he began adopting since a young age.
 The most dangerous aspect of this style is the unpredictability of his movements, easily catching his opponents by surprise. He can spin in a manner similar to a buzz-saw, or else employing a series of unrelenting attacks switching the locations as well as the blades with which he attacks, leaving no openings for even a skilled
Sharingan
 user like
Sasuke Uchiha
,
 and a highly trained
swordsman
 like
Suigetsu Hōzuki
, who remarked that the method of attack was completely unpredictable.
 Killer B was also able to throw these swords from their normally awkward positions, either to hit his opponents from range, or to impale his opponent at close range and cause damage that would normally be lethal.

The swords can be
charged
 with
lightning

chakra
 to greatly increase their cutting power through high-frequency vibrations.
 Because of the streamline shape of these swords, they serve as fairly good projectiles as well.
 In the anime Killer B was able to use the
Eight-Tails
' tentacle to extend his reach for a surprise attack.

Trivia

As with many techniques of
Kumogakure
 ninja, this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation.
