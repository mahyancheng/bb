Osoi
 (
オソイ
) was a
genin
 from
Kumogakure
. He was the father of
Musai
.

Background

Osoi fought alongside
Toroi
 in his last battle, which led to his own death. He was later mistakenly
reincarnated
 by
Orochimaru
 in an attempt to reincarnate Toroi. After explaining the mix-up to Orochimaru and
Kabuto
, they decided to keep him around for future use.

Personality

Seemingly a very proud ninja, Osoi told his son that he should lie about his father's ability. He wanted Musai to ensure that the
Raikage
 knew of his sacrifice. While he is a proud individual, he deeply respects Toroi and his former partner's superior abilities.

Abilities

Osoi displayed no unique combat ability and his son
Musai
 stated that he didn't even make it through the
Chūnin Exams
. Still, he fought alongside one of Kumogakure's most famous ninja.

Allied Shinobi Forces
, Osoi spotted his son Musai. After they talked for a while, Osoi was sealed.
