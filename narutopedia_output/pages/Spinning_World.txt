Lyrics

Rōmaji

Nando tatakitsukerarete mo

Akiramerareru wake nado wanaku genten kaiki

Genjitsu to wa baibai shite mukashi mitai ni waiwai shitai keredo

Sou mo ikanai nara kirihiraite mirya ii

Nokori wazuka no shouki torimodoshite

Me no mae no tobira kojiakete miseru

Itsudemo sou nanda

Wasuregachina koto ga

Nani yori mo taisetsuna koto datte

Nani ga machiukete iyou to kamawanai

Ame nimo makezu yami o terasu

Kono kyoujin na kokoro ga areba

Kono toki kono basho ni tsudoishi nakamatachi

Mawari tsudzukeru sekai nanbitotari tomo tomeru koto wa dekinai yo

Kanji

何度叩き付けられても

あきらめられるわけなどはなく原点回帰

現実とはバイバイして 昔みたいにワイワイしたいけれど

そうも行かない なら切り開いてみりやいい

殘りわずかの正気取り戻して

目の前の扉こじ開けてみせる

いつでも そうなんだ

忘れがちな事が

何よりも 大切な事だって

何が 待ち受けていようと かまわない

雨にも負けず 闇を照らす

この強靭な心があれば

この時 この場所に 集いし仲間達

廻り続ける世界 何人たりとも止める事はできないよ

English

No matter how many times I’m batted down,

There’s no chance that I’ll be giving up; I’m right back to the starting line!

I’d like to say bye-bye to reality, and just have a good time like I used to,

But that can’t happen... so I’ll just have to cut my way on through!

Gathering the last bit of sanity I have left,

I’ll pry open the door before my eyes!

It’s always the same story: the things we’re most prone to forgetting,

Are the most important by far!

I don’t care what’s awaiting me,

Shining through the darkness, not even the rain will set me back,

As long as I have this powerful heart!

All of our comrades gathering at this time, in this place,

Facing an endlessly spinning world;

there’s not a single thing that exists to stop us!

All of our comrades gathering at this time, in this place,

Face an endlessly spinning world;

And there’s not a single thing that exists to stop us!

Oh, you who changes along with time,

Can you hear my voice? My good friend,

Once you’ve left the place you were born,

And found your way to this land,

Let’s grasp victory tightly,

And head onward!

As this feeling grows in layers, it reaches tomorrow;

Picked up fragments of dreams…

Colliding light and shadow…

A fantasy that exists in the depths of our hearts,

Within an endlessly spinning world;

And there’s not a single thing that exists to stop us!

Hey!

Once you’ve taken aim,Boom Boom!

Find your hidden power and pull it on out!

Hey!

Once you’ve taken aim,Boom Boom!

Find your hidden power and pull it on out!

Hey! Oh!

There’s nothing to fear;

What the hell are limits anyway?

eyY! Oh!

Boom Boom!Boom Boom!

I don’t care what’s awaiting me;

Shining through the darkness, not even the rain will set me back…

As long as I have this powerful heart!

As this feeling grows in layers, it reaches tomorrow;

Picked up fragments of dreams…

Colliding light and shadow…

A fantasy that exists in the depths of our hearts,

Within an endlessly spinning world;

And there’s not a single thing that exists to stop us!
