" (

) is episode 315 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Discovering that there are four
Yotas
 in different battlefields, and recognising Yota's whistling as the one he had taught him,
Naruto
 informs the others that the Yota they're fighting are in fact, disguised
White Zetsu
, freeing them from the guilt of attacking Yota, which resulted in the Zetsu being defeated. Remembering the past, he recalled Yota being held by the
Anbu
 for questioning, the Anbu sensing something wrong with Yota. Naruto acts as a decoy for
Shikamaru
,
Kiba
,
Akamaru
,
Ino
,
Chōji
 and
Sakura
 to sneak in. Shikamaru manages to temporarily
paralyse
 the Anbu, but they soon get the upper hand. About to attack Naruto, Yota acts out and strikes the Anbu with his
lightning
.

Naruto and the others then try to get Yota across a river so he can get away, but they all get separated by the strong currents. Yota saves Naruto, but begins drowning. They try to talk to Yota, but he
erases
 their memories of him and their time together. During the
war
, Yota reveals that he was already dead when they first met, having been one of the earliest subjects of the
Impure World Reincarnation
 when
Orochimaru
 began testing it. Yota tells them about how his clan travelled around selling weather, which they could control, and how despite being particularly good at it, Yota's body was frail, leading to an early death. Afterwards, Yota covers himself in snow, and causes lightning to strike him, leaving Naruto and the others shocked.

Trivia

When Kiba was talking to Yota in Naruto's head, his face markings are gone.
