,
Viz:

Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Amused at the fact that though
Sasuke
 should hate
Itachi
, the two seemed to be getting along well,
Kabuto Yakushi
 states that he understands that something might have happened during the brothers' battle, could not understand what Sasuke could want from a dead person. After hearing Sasuke declare that he wanted to know the truth, Kabuto surmises that Sasuke was suspicious of his brother, having already heard the truth and as such never returned to
Konohagakure
 because of his intent to destroy it for making his brother suffer. Calling Itachi a liar and stating that he had gone as far as to eradicate his entire
clan
 in order to protect the village, he asks Sasuke whether or not what he was doing was more akin to his own goals of wanting to continue what
Orochimaru
 started and destroy Konoha. Attempting to inveigle him to his side once again, Sasuke has a flashback of a conversation he overheard with a group of Konoha-nin bad-mouthing Itachi after which he declares that he was nothing like Kabuto and that crushing Konoha was his own ambition. Recalling his life in Konoha, Kabuto begins to renounce the village and tells Sasuke that he would be his new brother. Telling his brother not to listen to Kabuto, Itachi commences his plan of action, telling his brother that he would use one of the clan's ultimate
dōjutsu
. Believing it to be
Izanagi
, Sasuke questions his brother on this. Itachi however corrects his brother as he clashes with Kabuto while wielding Sasuke's
sword
 telling him that this was a
technique
 that can decide destiny.
