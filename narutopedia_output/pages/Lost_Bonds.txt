"
Lost Bonds
" (
失われた絆
,
Ushinawareta Kizuna
) is episode 213 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 recalls his fight with
Sasuke
 at the
Valley of the End
, where Sasuke
told
 him that they were best friends and that he would fight to sever that bond with Naruto. Naruto wakes up, realising he was dreaming about the past. He notices
Yamato
 watching intently over him and decides to go back to sleep again, reminiscing on his past memories regarding Sasuke. He remembers when Sasuke had
beaten
 him in
shurikenjutsu
 and how he considered Sasuke his rival from that point on, and when he found out Sasuke's entire
clan
 had been
wiped out
. After Sasuke was placed on
Team 7
 with him, Naruto trained solely to catch up to Sasuke, remembering how the two
competed
 against one another to master the
Tree Climbing Practice
 in the
Land of Waves
.

However, he also thinks back to when Sasuke had told them that his goal was to restore his clan and destroy a certain someone, whom Naruto later learned was his brother
Itachi
, and remembers when the two
fought
. At the Valley of the End, Sasuke had told him that he would never understand the pain and suffering he was going through since he was all alone from the beginning and how he wanted to sever the bond between him and Naruto, and how he had finally managed to
reunite
 with Sasuke after three years, only for Sasuke to remain steadfast and tell
Sai
 that the only bond he had was the bond of hatred he had with Itachi. Recalling how
Pain
 told him that he would never comprehend pain to the extent needed to save Sasuke and how
Kabuto
 told him Sasuke was a changed man as well as when
Jiraiya

told
 him to give up on Sasuke, Naruto reflects on how Jiraiya was his family and how he felt after Jiraiya was killed, and realises for the first time how Sasuke truly felt when his family was murdered.

Since Yamato was under orders to bring Naruto back to
Konoha
 while
Kakashi
 found Sasuke and
Sakura
, Naruto hides himself under the covers and uses his kunai to create a secret hole, disappearing through it while leaving a
shadow clone
 behind to fool Yamato. Entering into his
Sage Mode
, Naruto locates Kakashi's
chakra
 signature and heads to the
Samurai Bridge
, reflecting on
Gaara
's advice about doing the right thing when it comes to Sasuke. Naruto muses that he would know the right thing to do once he encounters Sasuke.
