This
Mangekyō Sharingan
 technique allows the user to telekinetically control objects after marking them with a seal on their hand. Using this technique,
Shin Uchiha
 was able to freely manipulate his medical equipment to perform surgery, create makeshift prosthetic limbs and weaponry out of multiple scalpels, as well as manipulate his
clone's
 body to shield himself.

Trivia

In the anime, Shin is depicted using this technique without having his Mangekyō Sharingan active.
