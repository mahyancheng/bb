This technique was created by
Chino
 after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, who used information within minerals springs that came into contact with
White Zetsu
 as a
reference
 to structure the technique.

Overview

When a
Ketsuryūgan
-wielder makes physical contact with a target, they can infuse some of their
chakra
 into the target. The said chakra becomes poisonous to the target, making their bodies unstable. Should the target then begin to bleed, the chakra will be set off, causing the victim's body to become consumed in a pitch-black substance before inflating in a grotesque manner and finally exploding on a large and on a very destructive scale. Only by blocking the chakra flow of the target or rendering them unconscious will nullify mutation and following explosion. With proper medical aid, the
poisonous
 chakra can be extracted, saving the victim completely.
