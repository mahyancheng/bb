Orochimaru
's killing intent, experienced by
Sakura Haruno
 and
Sasuke Uchiha
.



Killing intent
 (
殺気
,
Sakki
,
English TV:
 Murderous Intent) is simply the user exuding pure killing intention, and having it affect their opponent, themselves, and others around them, up to the point of paralysing them with fear.
 When the killing intent is particularly strong, it can even give the victim visions of their own gruesome death.
 This can cause killing intent to be confused with a
genjutsu
, despite it not being a
jutsu
 at all.

Trivia

Sakki (
殺気
) can also be translated to "thirst for blood".

In
Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison
,
Satori
 is capable of reading killing intent and fear of its opponents, allowing it to instinctively dodge such attacks.

In
Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker
,
Zabuza Momochi
 utilises killing intent in his "Demon Hunter" (
鬼神切り
,
Kijingiri
,
literally meaning:
 Fierce God Cutter) technique.
