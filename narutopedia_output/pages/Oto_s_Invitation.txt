Sakura
 thinks about Sasuke and wonders if it was a good idea to tell
Naruto
 about the
cursed seal
 Sasuke received from
Orochimaru
, which he had previously instructed her not to. Naruto assured her that Sasuke would never give in to Orochimaru's temptations, putting a smile on her face. Sasuke, however, has been defeated by the Sound Four. They tell him he will never be able to defeat them if he remains in
Konoha
, as only Orochimaru can give one true power.
