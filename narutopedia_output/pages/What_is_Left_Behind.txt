Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Fukasaku
 explains that
Jiraiya
 gave him a coded message about
Pain
 before dying and shows it to those present.
Naruto
 instead focuses on
Tsunade
, blaming her for letting Jiraiya go on such a dangerous mission by himself. Tsunade makes no effort to refute his claim so he storms out despite
Sakura
's protests. Naruto continues the rest of the day wandering town and mourning Jiraiya. He runs into
Iruka
, who reveals that Naruto is finally gaining acknowledgement on a village-wide scale, and offers to take him to
Ramen Ichiraku
, but Naruto declines. In the evening, Naruto, holding a popsicle, goes to a park and starts crying, regretting how Jiraiya was not able to see him as Hokage. Iruka tracks him down and comforts him about Jiraiya's death, saying how proud Jiraiya had always been of Naruto and how, as Jiraiya's student, he lives on in Naruto. Meanwhile, Tsunade tasks
Shikamaru
 with deciphering Jiraiya's message alone. Although Shikamaru objects to doing the task himself, Sakura insists he does. It is revealed that shortly afterwards, Tsunade takes some time alone to cry for Jiraiya, remembering when the two met and regretting not having reciprocated Jiraiya's feelings earlier.

Trivia

In this chapter the name of the store Naruto bought the popsicles at is listed as a side note. It's named the "24-Hour Convenience Store".
