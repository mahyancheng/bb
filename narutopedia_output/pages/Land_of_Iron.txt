The Three Wolves mountains where the Land of Iron is located.



The
Land of Iron
 (
鉄の国
,
Tetsu no Kuni
) is an icy, snow-covered country located among three mountains called the
Three Wolves
 (
三狼
,
Sanrō
). Unlike other countries of the world whose militaries use
shinobi
, the Land of Iron's military is made up of
samurai
. Due to the differing ideologies between shinobi and samurai – as well as the fact that the Land of Iron's samurai are quite formidable – there is an agreement among shinobi not to interfere with the Land of Iron.
 Under
Mifune
's leadership, the Land of Iron joins the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 to oppose
Akatsuki
 during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

Because the Land of Iron has had little involvement with the shinobi world, shinobi have frequently used the country as a neutral meeting place for diplomatic discussions: the country has hosted at least one
Kage Summit
,
 the
Continental Summit
,
 and the
Shinobi Union
 is headquartered there.

As an effort to bridge the gap between samurai and shinobi, the
Seventh Hokage
 and Mifune committed to a student exchange programme, where Mifune's last disciple
Tsubaki Kurogane
 was sent to
Konohagakure
 as a member of
Team 15
.
