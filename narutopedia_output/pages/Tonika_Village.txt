The
Tonika Village
 (
トニカ村
,
Tonika-mura
) is a village located on the outskirts of the border of the
Land of Fire
. It is also where
The Hole
 is located. The village was destroyed during
Kabuto Yakushi
's invasion which was geared towards acquiring The Hole to conduct his experiments. During the invasion, the villagers fought bravely to defend their home, but Kabuto's reincarnated pawns were too powerful and overwhelming.
 During this time,
Dokku
 instructed
Miina
 and
Leo
 to flee to the
Hachō Village
, which is a friendly neighbouring town.
