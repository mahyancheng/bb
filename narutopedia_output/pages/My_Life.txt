 The Life I Wanted…!!) is chapter 119 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Shikamaru
 quickly realises that he does not have enough chakra to immobilise eight
Otogakure
 ninja. What's more, he realises that he has missed one of the group, and hypothesises that the ninth had been keeping his distance from the others in case of an ambush. He attacks the eight to confirm his suspicions, and the ninth protects them. Although he now knows the ninth's location, Shikamaru lacks the energy to capture him too. Accepting that he will die, Shikamaru waits until he can no longer contain the eight ninja. Once they are free, however,
Asuma
 appears with the ninth in tow and kills the remaining eight, thanking Shikamaru for lasting so long. Meanwhile,
Orochimaru
 robs the
First Hokage
 and the
Second Hokage
 of their free will so that their memories will not get in the way of fighting
Sarutobi
.
