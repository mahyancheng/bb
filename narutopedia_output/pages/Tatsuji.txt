Tatsuji
 (
達治
) was an
Anbu
 working in
Konohagakure
 until the day he was lost on a mission.

Background

At some point in the past, he was seen by
Yamato
 as an Anbu member. Later, he was sent on a mission in which he pretended to go missing, so he could infiltrate
Amegakure
 to gather information for
Danzō Shimura
 and the village elders.

Personality

Though working for Danzō, he was visibly afraid when
Tsunade
 gave
Ibiki Morino
 the orders to torture him for intel.

Appearance

Tatsuji has long chin length grey-coloured hair with bangs hanging over his forehead. He is seen wearing an Amegakure
flak jacket
 with a large black scarf around his neck that hangs down the front of his body. He also has small black eyes that have a small very thin black marking underneath them.

Abilities

Tatsuji is a powerful
shinobi
, whose skills allowed him to infiltrate Amegakure, a village known for being almost impossible to penetrate, due to
Pain
's tight control over the populace. He was also a trusted member of Konohagakure's Anbu.

Part II

Twelve Guardian Ninja

Tatsuji was seen outside the village meeting with Danzō where he was then captured by several Anbu members and brought back to Konoha for interrogation. Yamato informed the others of Tatsuji being a Konoha shinobi. Before the real interrogation began,
Koharu
 and
Homura
 revealed to Tsunade and the others that he was actually working for them. He was presumably released after this.

Trivia

Tatsuji may have been based on
Tatsuji Suga
 (
菅辰次
,
Suga Tatsuji
) who was a military officer that was kidnapped by his enemies.
