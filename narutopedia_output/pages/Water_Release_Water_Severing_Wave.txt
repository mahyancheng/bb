After kneading
chakra
 in the stomach and converting it into water, the user spews it out as a high pressure stream that is powerful enough to cut cleanly through the roots of the
God Tree
 with ease.

Trivia

In the anime, when Tobirama was first
reincarnated
, he used a technique similar in appearance to this one. By manipulating the water around him, he was able to fire high-pressure jets of water powerful enough to easily cut through rock.
