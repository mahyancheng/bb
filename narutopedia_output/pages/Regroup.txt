) is episode 102 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 is overjoyed to see
Lee
 once more, while
Sakura
 and
Ino
 resume their rivalry. Back at their hideout,
Kabuto
 asks
Yūkimaru
 if he would like to return to
Orochimaru
 with him, but Yūkimaru refuses to come unless
Guren
 accompanies him. Yūkimaru attempts to flee when Kabuto reminds him that he belongs to Orochimaru, prompting Kabuto to yank Yūkimaru around and slap him. Immediately after, Guren slashes at Kabuto with her crystals and warns Kabuto not to lay a finger on Yūkimaru again. As Kabuto leaves, Yūkimaru reminds Guren that he would like to be wherever she is, prompting her to run away into the mist.

Outside,
Gozu
 begins to question
Rinji
's loyalty towards Guren. Rinji reassures him that he would not betray Guren as he needs the money to help his ill-struck sister. However, Rinji turns out to be a spy working for Orochimaru, who was placed within the prison by Kabuto to spy on the other inmates and subsequently assigned to
Team Guren
 to spy on Guren herself. Rinji tells Kabuto that he believes Guren is being distracted by Yūkimaru's well being and asks Kabuto if he may report to Orochimaru himself, wanting to prove his diligence. Kabuto relents, and Rinji joins up with Guren, albeit running into Gozu first. He sneaks up on Guren, who is contemplating Naruto's words about Orochimaru using people as tools and discarding them and finding herself worrying about Yūkimaru's fate. As she attempts to brush off her thoughts and focus on her mission, she is startled by Rinji's presence; the two prepare to formulate a strategy as the mist lifts, unaware that they are being watched by Yūkimaru.

Concurrently, the
Konoha

shinobi
 take refuge in their own hideout, a
wooden house
 built by
Yamato
. After being debriefed by Yamato and
Kakashi
,
Shizune
 notifies them that
Tsunade
's plan is for them to use
fūinjutsu
 to seal the
Three-Tails
 into another dimension. She places
Hinata
, Ino and Sakura under her command, forming a sub-team, that will focus on sealing the
tailed beast
 and protecting Yūkimaru while the others deal with Guren and her team. Knowing that Shizune's team cannot protect the boy and seal the beast at the same time, Kakashi splits the other team into two as well, assigning
Kiba
,
Akamaru
, Lee and
Tenten
 on Yamato's team as their guardians while he takes command of Naruto,
Shino
 and
Sai
, who are to deal with Guren.
