Ebizō
 (
エビゾウ
), called
Honoured Grandfather Ebizō
 (
エビゾウジイ様
,
Ebizō-jiisama
) by the Suna villagers, is highly revered in
Sunagakure
. He and his older sister,
Chiyo
, are known as the
Honoured Siblings
 (
御姉弟
,
Gokyōdai
).

Personality

He is a very calm, reserved, and apathetic person, especially when compared to his sister, who often appeared at times impulsive in her actions. He also seems to be very analytical in his thinking. After
Gaara
 had been kidnapped by the
Akatsuki
, leaving all of Sunagakure worried and panicked, Ebizō urged
Temari
 and other Suna-nin to keep a level head and not allow their panicking thoughts cloud their judgement to prevent them from blindly rushing into enemy territory and getting themselves killed, showing a very keen-minded mindset regarding chaotic situations.

Like Chiyo, Ebizō believed that the village should be strong enough to look after itself without being so reliant on the previous generation or other villages, and showed disappointment when they were so helpless in saving
Kankurō
 from
poison
. He is also described as optimistic; when Chiyo's pessimistic views were proven wrong when Kankurō was healed by Sakura Haruno, a top-notch medical shinobi, he reminded Chiyo that times have changed from when he and his sister were young. Despite his usually apathetic demeanour, he still cares for those people who are close to him, as he was saddened by his sister's death.

Appearance

Ebizō is an elderly man that is characterised by his heavy-lidded eyes that give him the appearance of actually having no eyes at all. He also has very long eyebrows that frame each side of his face. Along with a turban wrapped around his head, he wears the traditional Sunagakure outfit which consists of a dark coloured, loose fitting outfit with a poncho-like top.

Abilities

Though little is known of his skills, it was stated that he has a strong and analytical mind that served him and Sunagakure well during the previous shinobi wars and even in his old age.

Part II

Kazekage Rescue Mission

Kazekage Rescue Mission






Ebizō telling the story behind the Third Kazekage's disappearance.



When
Baki
 came to the siblings for help for
Akatsuki
 abducting
Gaara
, they at first refused, seeing themselves no longer part of the outside world. However, when
Sasori
's membership in the organisation came up, they changed their minds. Upon seeing the poisoned
Kankurō
, Ebizō commented how much the village has weakened.

Ebizō later joined a team consisting of
Temari
, Kankurō,
Matsuri
,
Maki
, and other Suna-nin in order to support the
Kazekage Rescue Team
. Once the rest of the team, save for Temari and Kankurō, were exhausted, Ebizō shared the story behind the
Third Kazekage
's disappearance and how Sunagakure fell into chaos due to everyone searching blindly and panicking, leaving them open to be attacked, and urged the team to remain calm regarding Gaara's kidnapping and take their time to prevent total annihilation. Following Gaara's rescue and Chiyo's
self-sacrifice
, Ebizō mourned his sister's death, hoping it was another one of her jokes, but he couldn't help but smile at how peaceful she looked.

Gaara Hiden: A Sandstorm Mirage

Main article:
Gaara Hiden: A Sandstorm Mirage

During one of Gaara's routine meetings with the
Suna Council
, Ebizō reveals that he and the rest of the Council would like for Gaara to get married. Because Temari is about to marry into a
Konoha
 clan, any children she has will be Konoha ninja. This means a Konoha ninja would have a claim to the
Kazekage
 position if Gaara dies before producing a heir. Therefore, the Council would like Gaara to find a wife so that he can, in turn, have children. When Gaara resists this, the Council insists that their interest in seeing Gaara married is more of a recompense for turning him into a
jinchūriki
 years ago than it is a political matter. Unable to argue out of the situation, Gaara accepts the marriage meeting that the Council has arranged. In light of Ebizō's declining health, he eventually stepped down as the head of the Suna Council, a position that
Tōjūrō
 eyed for.

Trivia

Ebizō's name might come from
Ichikawa Ebizō
 (

,

), a stage name taken on by a series of
kabuki
 actors of the
Ichikawa
 family.
