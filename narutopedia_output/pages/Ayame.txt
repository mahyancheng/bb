Ayame
 (
アヤメ
) is a citizen of
Konohagakure
 and a waitress at her
father
's restaurant,
Ramen Ichiraku
.

Personality

Ayame is a kind and cheerful young woman. She and her father seem to be some of the few Konoha villagers that do not see Naruto in a hostile light and consider him their favourite regular customer. She is a hard-working woman, always doing her best to serve Naruto with ramen. Occasionally, she and her father would gladly serve Naruto with free ramen depending on a situation, such as allowing Naruto to eat for free before his fight at the
Chūnin Exams
 as a way to encourage him.

During the brief period in which the store began serving
tsukemen
 instead of ramen, Ayame was proud of her culinary training, refusing to serve anything less than a perfect cuisine, to the point of bickering with Naruto over not serving him ramen and the time it took to serve him altogether, but was subsequently forced to bitterly admit her pride in Naruto eating three bowls despite unhappy on the manner of which Naruto ate it.

In the anime, it was shown that Ayame was attracted to
Kakashi Hatake
, after seeing his face as he eats ramen.

Appearance

Ayame is a slender girl with long, dark brown hair and large black eyes, plus fair skin. She wears a white robe with the sleeves folded, a sort of dark blue apron with ribbon ties at the top and a bright white bandanna.

In the anime, she was kidnapped by
Hakkaku
, a
cooking-nin
 from the
Land of Lightning
. He would return her only if Teuchi gave him a special recipe to make people love their meals. The secret recipe was just to remove the bitter taste from the soup. When Ayame is rescued, she has grown fat due to being unable to resist the cooking ninja's food. To bring her to her regular self, she eats Teuchi's diet ramen that appears to be designed to make people lose weight from eating it.

In the manga, after Naruto returns from his nature manipulation training session, Ayame has been replaced by two less-than-competent male cooks:
Nishi
 and
Matsu
. Ayame had left for a trip sometime earlier, thus the new workers replaced her. The two are rather clumsy, seen when Matsu puts his finger in the ramen and then Nishi accidentally spills hot ramen on his co-worker.

In the anime, Ayame returns after training and seeing the cuisines of other countries and turns the
Ramen
 bar into a
Tsukemen
 bar. This angers Naruto when he comes to the bar, exhausted after a nature manipulation training session. Even though he is obviously tired, he bickers with Ayame for several minutes until he finally accepts the tsukemen, although he combines the two dishes to make ramen, much to her outrage. However, as Naruto ate several dishes in the same manner, meaning a larger bill, Ayame grudgingly accepted it.

 of Ankorodō - whose turn it was to award the prize - to give an especially lucrative offer to the competition's winner. Ankorodō's owner reluctantly agreed.
