 shinobi by healing them. Asked by
Orochimaru
, who thought his skills were impressive whether or not he had thought of being a
shinobi
, to which Kabuto declined.
Nonō
 was later approached by
Danzō Shimura
, Orochimaru and another unknown shinobi, who blackmailed her into undertaking an intelligence gathering mission based on the intel they received on
Iwagakure
's attack plans. Taking Kabuto along with them to replace a dead
Root
 member, the young man was sent on several spy missions in different hidden villages inclusive of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
. On a mission in Iwagakure, his cover was blown and as he attempted to escape he was confronted by an Iwa-nin. Kabuto attacked the ninja with his
chakra scalpel
 severely wounding the enemy. This person turned out to be Nonō much to Kabuto's shock as he tried to heal her. She however did not remember him, which devastated Kabuto who ran off and left her as
Kitsuchi
 and another Iwa-nin approached them. Devastated that she did not remember him and wondering who he was, Kabuto was once again approached by Orochimaru who stated that he had become quite the shinobi.
