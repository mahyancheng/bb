The Hole.



The Hole
 (
ホール
,
Hōru
) is a sacred area somewhere along the borders of the
Land of Fire
, resembling an ecological oasis in the middle of a barren wasteland. It has long been used for sacred purposes and also housed several sacred treasures and as such, was rigged with traps to protect against bandits. At its centre is
Tonika Village
, whose residents are tasked with safeguarding The Hole and its treasures.

The Hole is home to diverse and flourishing wildlife, seemingly due to the special properties of its spring waters, which
Kabuto Yakushi
 states are "overflowing with life" and "accelerate cell division". The spring waters flow into a large lake, and are also being pumped out of The Hole via a pipeline which runs across the bordering wasteland, presumably to the nearby
Hachō Village
.

Within The Hole is the legendary
Ama no Hoko
, known to give one great power if using the sounds of
Saezuri
.
