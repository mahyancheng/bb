 was a
genin
 team, assigned to escort a group of merchants from the
Land of Vegetables
.

History

The team was made-up of
Chōji
,
Hinata
 and
Naruto
. When one of the merchants,
Kikunojō
, was killed, the genin realise that their true objective was to protect
Haruna
 — the
daimyō
 successor of the Land of Vegetables, from the
Janin
, who took over the land with the aid of disloyal and greedy courtiers. In the end, the three
missing-nin
 were stopped, with two of them dying. After the mission, Naruto was offered the position of daimyō's advisor, but he declined it due to his desire to save
Sasuke
.
