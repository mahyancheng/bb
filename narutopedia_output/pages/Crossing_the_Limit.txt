Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Neji
 does not understand why
Hinata
 would continue to fight when she can no longer hope to win.
Naruto
 continues to encourage her, so Hinata continues to attack Neji. Glad to have Naruto's attention at long last, Hinata strikes Neji despite knowing her attacks are not doing anything. Neji inflicts increasingly worse internal injuries upon Hinata, prompting
Hayate Gekkō
 to try and end the match. Naruto stops him, giving Hinata a chance to speak. She tells Neji that, although he claims she suffers as the heiress of the
Hyūga clan
, he suffers more for only being a member of the clan's branch family. Neji tries to kill her but is stopped by the attending
jōnin
. When Hinata collapses, Naruto comes to her side, who catches a brief glimpse of him before losing consciousness. Neji then criticises Naruto for his pointless cheering and then states once someone becomes a failure, they will always be a failure.
