Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Naruto
 voices his concern that he has been
sensing
 the
Nine-Tails
'
chakra
 outside for a while now,
B
 tries to allay his suspicions telling him that this was impossible as they were in a
Chakra Isolation Chamber
, while conversing with the
Eight-Tails
 about the
Gold and Silver Brothers
 who had seemingly been
reincarnated
. Making an excuse that he needed to use the bathroom, Naruto leaves the chamber before B could realise what he was up to and stop him. He is however noticed by two guards who alert
headquarters
. Upon hearing the news, HQ tells them to deploy the guard detail and Naruto is confronted by
Shibi Aburame
 who tells him he cannot allow him to go any further. Out of the group,
Iruka
 emerges shocking Naruto and tells Shibi that he would speak to the young man.

Not believing their story, Naruto — who enters
Sage Mode
  — demands to be let outside and when confronted by the two
Akimichi
 guards, breaks through their defence and reaches outside. He is however halted by the
Nara
's
Shadow Imitation Technique
 but not before his sensory skills in Sage Mode activates giving him a full perception of what was happening on the battlefield. Shocked at what was happening, Iruka tells Naruto the truth but at the same time, erects a
barrier
 to stop Naruto from leaving. The young man however enters the
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 and easily breaks the barrier, the link to the shadow and Shibi's
kikaichū
 and heads for the battlefield while fixing his
forehead protector
 and finding the note Iruka had left him. After B and Iruka bump fist and have a brief conversation, B sets out after Naruto. With the
Kumo Barrier Team
 alerted and the
Self-Repairing Barrier
 prepared, the two
jinchūriki
 using the
Tailed Beast Ball
 are able to break through the barrier despite the team's best efforts.
