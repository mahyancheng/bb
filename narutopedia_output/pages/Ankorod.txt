Ankorodō
 (
あんころ堂
,
literally meaning:
 Sweet Bean Jam Temple) is a restaurant in
Konohagakure
, mentioned in
Naruto Shinden: Parent and Child Day
. True to its name, the shop is famous for its
sweet bean jam
.
Temari
 and
Ino Yamanaka
 so enjoy Ankorodō's food that, when Konoha's annual eating contest offers unlimited free
dumplings
 to the winner, both force their husband and son (
Shikamaru
 and
Shikadai
, and
Sai
 and
Inojin
, respectively) to participate. When Shikamaru fails to win the contest, Temari afterwards nearly kills him in a rage.

Ankorodō is run by an
old woman
 who was once a
kunoichi
. During a previous eating contest, Ankorodō also offered unlimited free
sweet sake
 to the winner, a prize won by
Chōji Akimichi
. Ankorodō nearly went bankrupt providing free sake to Chōji, making Ankorodō's owner determined to never again risk her restaurant's welfare with an "unlimited" offer. When her fellow restaurateurs pressure her to offer unlimited free dumplings for another eating contest, she attempts to sabotage the contest using her old
Earth Release
 skills. Chōji thwarts her efforts and ultimately wins again. Rather than jail her for her actions, Ankorodō's owner is forced to honour the unlimited free dumpling offer for Chōji
and
 his family; Sai deems this a punishment worse than jail.
