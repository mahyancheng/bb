Overview

Nuiba are humanoid creatures with muscular bodies and very large fists and arms bandaged up from the elbows to the wrists. Most Nuiba have bluish-grey skin and some have crimson. Their faces appear like masks and have two small horns pointing downward. All Nuiba have a scar running through their chests for unknown reasons. Though their intelligence is lacking, Nuiba make good use of their brute strength in combat and can use their large hands to chuck rocks out of the ground for long-distance attacks.
