Kenjutsu being used by
Hayate Gekkō
.



Kenjutsu
 (
剣術
,
literally meaning:
 Sword Technique) pertains to techniques that entail the use of
swords
, whether the users be
shinobi
, or
samurai
. Kenjutsu can be used in combination with
taijutsu
,
ninjutsu
,
fūinjutsu
,
chakra flow
 and even
genjutsu
 in order to achieve more devastating techniques. It is regarded as a branch of
bukijutsu
.

The entire military might of the lone samurai nation of the
Land of Iron
 have all been depicted as practitioners of kenjutsu. Some shinobi villages seem to promote the use of kenjutsu as well, such as
Kumogakure
,
 and due to the tradition of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
, every single
Kirigakure
 villager strives to master kenjutsu from their childhood onwards.
 During their time away from
Konohagakure
,
Sasuke
 taught
Boruto
 his
Uchiha Style Kenjutsu
, which consist of quickdraws that slice through multiple opponents at once, as well as using
Lightning Release
 to increase the blade's cutting power.
