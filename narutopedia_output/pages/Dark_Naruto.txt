. They are equally matched, so the fight does not go anywhere. Since this is an internal struggle, Naruto returns his attention to the real world and asks
Motoi
 how
Killer B
 overcame the evil in his heart but Motoi couldn't. Naruto then requests that Motoi ask B, however, Motoi, weighed down by the guilt of having once tried to kill B stated once again that he could not. He then offers to tell Naruto about B's background so that maybe Naruto could find the answer himself.
