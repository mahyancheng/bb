"
Battle in Paradise! Odd Beast vs. The Monster!
" (
珍獣VS怪人! 楽園の戦い!
,
Chinjū Bāsasu Kaijin! Rakuen no Tatakai!
) is episode 250 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Kushina
 fades away as she thanks
Naruto
, who reflects upon the last words she told him before she died. Awakening back in the
Tailed Beast Temple
, Naruto mentally communicates what transpired to
Killer B
 via a fist bump, which irritates
Yamato
, since he cannot understand. He shows his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 to the two, only to immediately
sense

Kisame
's presence within
Samehada
, shocking the latter since his
chakra
 signature and that of the swords are indistinguishable. Kisame realises that Naruto has the ability to sense his hatred and reveals to a shocked Killer B that the "Kisame" he and his
brother

decapitated
 was just a
Parasite Clone
. He attempts to flee with the intelligence he has gathered thus far. Naruto immediately runs and kicks Kisame, his speed stunning Yamato and Killer B, with the latter likening it to the
Yellow Flash
's. However, Naruto exerts too much power in the kick and sprains his ankle, giving Kisame an opportunity to escape. As Yamato tends to Naruto, Killer B rushes out to intercept Kisame.

Meanwhile,
Guy
 wishes to partake in the same training as Naruto and sits in front of the
Falls of Truth
 in order to encounter his inner self. While he initially meets his other side, one who criticised his desire to stay youthful, he is forced to return to reality when Kisame comes bursting through the waterfall. Believing it to be his true inner self, Guy uses his
Leaf Rock-Destroying Rise
 to kick Kisame into a rock wall, only to be told that it is an
Akatsuki
 member. Samehada leaves Kisame to be with Killer B, but Kisame grabs on to Samehada's handle and siphons nearly all of Killer B's chakra.
Aoba
 tries to paralyse him with his
Secret Technique Stone Needles
, although Kisame merely drains his chakra as well. Declaring that his chakra reserves have been completely filled, Kisame uses his
Water Release: Water Shark Bullet Technique
 to encase himself inside of a shark made of water and flies through the air, heading to the ocean. Guy activates his
Sixth Gate
 and is propelled into the air by Killer B, who used what little chakra he had left to transform one of his hands into the
Eight-Tails
'.

As he begins to descend prematurely, Guy uses the
Summoning Technique
 to call forth
Ningame
 in mid-air, in order to use the turtle as a stepping stone. Guy manages to catch up to Kisame just as the latter places a scroll containing intel inside of a shark he summoned. Kisame uses his
Water Release: A Thousand Feeding Sharks
 to hide the real shark amongst the other 999, although Guy merely uses his
Morning Peacock
 to dispel most of them. Realising that Kisame and the other sharks have gone underwater, Guy submerges as well, opening his Seventh Gate. Impressed at Guy's
taijutsu
, Kisame is confident that his next attack would finish his opponent off and employs his
Water Release: Great Shark Bullet Technique
, which Guy counters with his
Daytime Tiger
. Kisame remarks that his attack is invincible as it absorbs the enemy's chakra and grows stronger, only to be surprised as his technique is overwhelmed by Guy's.

Trivia

Most of the techniques introduced in this episode differ from how they appear in the manga.
