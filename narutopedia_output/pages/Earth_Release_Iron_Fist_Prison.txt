The user creates a circular arena surrounded by tall walls which emerge from the earth. The field is then completely changed, becoming a large trench with the soil exposed, not leaving any trace of the original vegetation. If the walls are damaged, they disappear in a puff of smoke, but the terrain remains altered.
