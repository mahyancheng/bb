When
Team 7
 bring
Hotaru
 back to the
Tsuchigumo village
, the people of the village aren't pleased to see her again. The chief approaches them seemingly happy to see Hotaru's return to the village. As Team 7 leaves, he takes Hotaru to a room to rest, only to lock her in there with the
Magaki Group
 who is after the
Tsuchigumo Clan kinjutsu
. After Hotaru escapes the ninja bandits and they follow her,
Naruto
 returns to the village and asks the chief what happened. He tells Naruto that the village has yet to begin their search for Hotaru, so Naruto and his team go search for her.

When Team 7 stop the ninja bandits and save Hotaru, he is seen watching Team 7 leave but before their departure he says the villagers will accept Hotaru with the kinjutsu gone.
