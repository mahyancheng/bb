This was a team formed after news of
Sasuke Uchiha
's victory over
Orochimaru
 reached
Konoha
. Upon realising that Sasuke still wouldn't be coming back to the village, Naruto asked the
Fifth Hokage
 to send a squad out to hunt down
Itachi Uchiha
, in hopes that finding him will mean they'd find Sasuke as he'd be targeting him.
Kakashi
 added that a small but elite squad of shinobi would be needed to take down a member of
Akatsuki
, and enlisted the members of
Team Kurenai
 for their tracking skills. With this,
Team Kakashi
 and Team Kurenai formed an eight man squad to hunt down the Uchiha.

The team has two known attack strategies for dealing with an enemy, which the anime extended upon:

Formation B
: While
Sakura
,
Kiba
 and
Akamaru
 distract the enemy,
Naruto
 finds an opening and uses the
Rasengan
 to attack them.

Formation A
:
Yamato
 uses
Wood Release
 to attack the enemy, while Kiba and Akamaru follow up with the
Fang Passing Fang
, and then Naruto finishes with a Rasengan.

Missions

Hunt for Itachi and Sasuke

Rank:
 Unknown

Status:
 Failed; Itachi died and Sasuke's trail was lost

Starting out as a mission to capture the missing-nin
Itachi Uchiha
, it called for the squad to split up and search the area for any sign of Itachi. However, upon seeing
Deidara
's suicide explosion, the team regrouped, with
Kiba
 finding Sasuke's scent. With Sasuke so close, the squad's primary mission of finding Itachi was replaced with finding Sasuke instead. While being stalled by Akatsuki member
Tobi
, the team learned that Itachi had died in battle with Sasuke. They tried to reach Sasuke before Tobi could, but failed as both Itachi's corpse and Sasuke were gone, and were unable to rediscover Sasuke's trail.
