Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

While still at sea, the ship is attacked by a
Giant Squid
 whom the
ship's captain
 had tried to warn them about. They are however saved by
Killer B
. As
Naruto
 and his
Konoha
 bodyguards disembark on the
Land of Lightning Island
, Naruto approaches B and asks for his help in learning to control a
tailed beast
, as he was the octopus that the
Great Toad Sage
 had foretold him about. B initially appears uninterested, so Naruto tries to sell him on the idea by acting like him. In doing so he accidentally insults B, so B refuses. Naruto asks
Motoi
, the island's caretaker, how he can convince B, claiming that B is too conceited. Motoi grows angry by Naruto's accusations, but lets it go. He tells Naruto that B probably had his reasons and directs him to the
Falls of Truth
. He tells Naruto that it is the place that B was trained to control the
Eight-Tails
. He then tells Naruto to enter the falls to face his inner self. A "dark Naruto" confronts him, calling him an impostor. B is shown fighting in a competition with several bears where he easily defeats
Kintoki
 telling him that he'd gotten soft. The Eight-Tails then asks B why didn't he help Naruto if he had time to play with bears, telling him that even though he didn't like the
Nine-Tails
, Naruto showed promise and that Naruto reminded him of himself and B.

Naruto tries to defeat his "inner darkness", the product of his lonely childhood and the lone obstacle in his efforts to tame the Nine-Tails. Dark Naruto asks why he didn't humour the earlier, "shallow" Konoha villagers with autographs. They begin fighting but are equally matched, so the fight does not go anywhere. Since this is an internal struggle, Naruto returns his attention to the real world and tells them what had happened, much to
Yamato
's shock. Motoi tells Naruto to defeat his inner self, otherwise he would not be able to continue on his quest to control the Nine-Tails.
