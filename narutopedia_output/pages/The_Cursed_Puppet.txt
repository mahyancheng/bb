The Cursed Puppet
" (
呪いの人形
,
Noroi no Ningyō
) is episode 408 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

As
Team Asuma
 were taking a different route to bring their set of scrolls to the centre building to avoid being ambushed,
Sakura
 suddenly collapses due to her constant flow of chakra for the
Strength of a Hundred Seal
. After remembering her training with
Tsunade
, she awakens just as her team are confronted by
Team Saya
.
Saya
 makes it clear that she wants
Ino
 and Sakura to herself, leaving her teammates,
Mamushi
 and
Sana
 to battle
Chōji
.
 Saya's
Puppet Imitation Technique
 proves to be a formidable skill which allowed her to invade Ino's mind and completely control her due to her puppet doll having her hair sample. Leaving Ino's body, Saya uses the same method on a
gigantic
 Chōji when he captures her teammates. With Saya using Chōji as her pawn, Ino uses her
Mind Body Switch Technique
 to enter Chōji's mind and try to kick the enemy kunoichi out as Sakura tries to figure out how to deal with currently controlled Chōji, seeing as she doesn't have enough chakra to both flow chakra for the seal and battle at the same time. Meanwhile, at
Orochimaru
's hideout,
Sasuke
, having an ulterior motive to test
Suigetsu
 and
Karin
's abilities, releases Suigetsu from his containment and joins Karin to bring him back. Ultimately, Suigetsu is put into a jelly-like state after being hit by Karin's
chakra chain
.
