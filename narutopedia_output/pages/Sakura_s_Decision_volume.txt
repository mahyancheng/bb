Soon after entering the

Naruto
 breaks away from the rest of
Team 7
 to go to the bathroom. When he returns he is immediately attacked by
Sasuke
.
Sakura
 is shocked, but Sasuke explains that this Naruto is missing the scratch on the cheek he received from
Anko
 and must be an impostor. The
ninja
 removes his disguise and tries to take their scroll by force, but he is injured by Sasuke and forced to retreat. Once finding the real Naruto, Sasuke decides that they should have a password only they will know in case they are separated again. Sasuke's suggested password is very long, leaving Naruto to request something simpler. Before they can modify the code, the three are attacked by
another ninja
 and separated. Sasuke finds Sakura, who confirms her identity by reciting the password. Naruto locates them soon afterwards and also repeats the password without error. Sasuke once again attacks him, pointing out that the real Naruto would never have remembered such a complex password.

Sono Mokuteki wa…!!
)

Fearful that
the ninja
 will kill them all,
Sasuke
 offers to give the ninja their scroll in exchange for their lives.
Naruto
 attacks Sasuke and takes the scroll from him, believing he is an impostor since the real Sasuke would never give up so easily. Even if he is the real Sasuke, Naruto points out that there's no guarantee the ninja would spare them. The ninja agrees,
summoning
 a
snake
 to attack Naruto. As Naruto is batted around Sasuke pleas for Naruto to give up. Naruto, using the strength of the

Anko
 travels through the
Forest of Death
 and locates
Orochimaru

Sakura
 tends to the still unconscious
Sasuke
 and
Naruto

Rock Lee
 finds the squirrel and save it from an
explosive tag
 that has been applied to its back. At the same time, Sakura is confronted by
three Sound ninja
 that express an interest in fighting Sasuke. Sakura asks why
Orochimaru
 gave Sasuke a
cursed seal

The Conditions for Using!!
" (

Shiyō no Jōken!!

Wishing for
Sakura
 to be his girlfriend,
Lee
 vows to defeat
her attackers
 or die trying. Knowing that he can end the battle by using the forbidden
Front Lotus
, Lee thinks upon his
master
's stipulations for using the technique: to never use it unless protecting someone precious. Confident that Sakura qualifies, Lee attacks
Dosu
 with the Front Lotus, but Dosu, with
Zaku
's assistance, survives the attack and strikes Lee.

Chapter 53

Sakura's Decision!!
" (
サクラの決意!!

Sakura no Ketsui!!

Dosu
's attacks disorient
Lee
, but he persists in trying to protect
Sakura
. When he is no longer able to stand he collapses, and Sakura tries to defend him along with
Sasuke
, and
Naruto
. Meanwhile,
Team 10
 watches the battle and contemplates intervening. They watch as Sakura is captured by
Kin Tsuchi
, who restrains her by grabbing her hair and taunts her for being more concerned with her appearance than her ninja skills. Knowing Kin is right and tired of always needing others' help, Sakura pulls out a
kunai
 and then cuts her hair off to free herself, surprising the observing Ino and Kin.

Chapter 54

"
Sakura and Ino
" (
サクラといの
,
Sakura to Ino
)

Sakura
, no longer concerned for her own safety, launches an attack against
Team Dosu
. Although she makes dexterous usage of several basic
ninjutsu
, she is ultimately forced to resort to biting and other physical attacks. Seeing Sakura's determination, the nearby
Ino
 thinks back to her childhood with Sakura; how the two used to be good friends. After Ino helped, Sakura gained some much-needed self-confidence, they parted ways so that their friendship would not interfere with their competition as rival ninja and love-interests for
Sasuke
. Seeing that Sakura is beating her in both aspects, Ino forces
her

teammates
 on
Team 10
 to come to Sakura's rescue.

Author's Note

“

Lately, all over the world, there has been an upswing in terrorist acts – attacks by armed groups and the taking of hostages – by the worst kind of criminals. In an effort to resolve the situation with as little bloodshed and fanfare as possible, nations all over the globe are increasingly turning towards special operation forces, armed with the latest technologies and finely honed skills, giving them superlative intelligence-gathering capabilities. Such operatives are truly the modern and analogue to the type of warriors who, in the past, were known as ninja!
