This article is about the collaboration technique. For the Hōzuki clan's hiden technique, see
Water Gun Technique
.

This technique is demonstrated as being both a technique on its own and as a two-way cooperation ninjutsu between Gamariki and Jiraiya. Using this technique, Gamariki can blast off a wave of
high speed water
 from his mouth with extreme precision and force. When combined with another person's
chakra
, this technique becomes a two-way collaboration water technique that can slice the target into multiple fine-carved pieces. After he learns this technique, Gamatatsu is able to combine it with
Naruto
's
wind
-natured chakra to create the
Wind Release: Toad Gun
 technique.
