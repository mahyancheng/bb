The
Garian Sword
 (
ガリアン刀
,
Gariantō
) is a three-pronged
sword
 with a metal wire passing through the blade. Its wire controls its movements as the blade can expand and be shot after the targeted enemy, similar to an
urumi
;
Kankurō
 compares this to the rudimentary control of
puppets
, controlling a toy bamboo snake with chakra threads. Also, each of the sword's blades has the ability to react to the carrier's
chakra
, amplifying it, changing its form to that of a dragon, and manipulating it freely, in a similar way to the use of the
Puppet Technique
. The sword is also used as part of the
Ninja Tools Barrier: Reverse Fish Scales Formation

cooperation ninjutsu
.

When Hōki summoned this weapon for himself (which later transferred to Seimei), it seemingly integrated to the back of the
Infinite Armour
, becoming three tentacle-like blades extending from its behind.
