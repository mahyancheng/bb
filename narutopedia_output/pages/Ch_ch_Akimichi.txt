Chōchō Akimichi
 (
秋道チョウチョウ
,
Akimichi Chōchō
) is a
kunoichi
 and a member of
Konohagakure
's
Akimichi clan
. Together with her teammates
Inojin Yamanaka
 and
Shikadai Nara
, she forms the seventeenth generation of the
Ino–Shika–Chō
 trio.

Background

Chōchō is the only child of
Karui
 and
Chōji Akimichi
. As her parents continued to stay close to their childhood friends over the years, Chōchō ultimately came to know the various parents' respective kids well.
 From a young age, Chōchō would often have sleepovers with Inojin and Shikadai, even having matching pyjamas. Their parents would also continue
Asuma Sarutobi
's tradition of taking the kids to
Yakiniku Q
 to celebrate accomplishments.
 In the anime, when she was younger, Chōchō had very high fever. Her parents worked earnestly to get a special medicine for her, which caused Chōji to
trim down
 so much that Chōchō didn't recognise him, making her have lingering doubts about her parentage.
 On the day of the
Seventh Hokage
's inauguration, Chōchō attended the ceremony with her parents, where she ran into
Sarada Uchiha
.

Personality

Like her
father
, Chōchō never turns down an invitation when it comes to food. This is evident when she skips her training with her fellow
Ino–Shika–Chō
 members in favour of going to eat with her sensei,
Anko Mitarashi
. Rather than feeling guilty for this, Chōchō displayed indifference to the consequences. In stark contrast to her father, who was always quick to rile when his weight was brought up, she was easily able to brush off being called fat. Her weight, in fact, doesn't seem to bother her at all, rather, Chōchō appears to be quite confident and self-assured — a trait she perhaps inherited from her mother.

A few years later, however, Chōchō started to become conscious about her appearance, and would actively try to lose a few pounds, only to fail upon seeing her father's excessive eating habits. This, coupled with her own mother having no problem with weight, has humorously caused Chōchō to believe she is adopted. She became impulsively convinced that any random adult she would find impressive is possibly her real parent. Ironically, upon approaching Chōji's slimmer form after using his
Calorie Control
, she approached him in the same manner. Having chosen to walk down her own path, Chōchō believes in doing everything at her own pace.
 She seems to be somewhat self-centred, as she thinks that many situations and events revolve around her. Chōchō also possesses a competitive nature, challenging her father to frequent eating contests.

She is also a romantic at heart, delighting in a good love story and hoping to find love herself. Despite her rather eccentric nature, Chōchō is also a very caring friend and kind girl who shows great concern and esteem for her best friend Sarada while taking time to assist others in ways she believes are helpful when they are in trouble. Like many others in her generation, she admires the
Seventh Hokage
.

Appearance






Chōchō's full appearance.



Chōchō is a dark-skinned girl with amber-coloured eyes and a noticeably heftier physique, similarly to most people of her clan. She inherited her father's brown hair (portrayed as orange (or blonde) in the
Boruto
 manga), which she styles in two spiky ponytails, kept back with a pink hair-band. The rest of her hair is left hanging down behind her back, with her bangs hanging over her left eye. She was first seen wearing a sleeveless red shirt, and white pants. Chōchō later upgraded her attire, donning a sleeveless white kimono with a net t-shirt under it, a yellow sash, tied with a dark-yellow ribbon, a pair of black arm warmers, and a pair of black long shinobi boots. As
customary of her clan
, both of her ears are pierced by grey stud earrings. However, unlike the rest of her clan, she lacks the Akimichi facial markings. In the
Boruto: Naruto Generations
 manga, Chōchō is seen wearing a small necklace and a single red bead bangle along with another bangle around her right wrist.

In her Academy days, Chōchō was seen wearing a sleeveless pink kimono, with a net t-shirt under it, a red sash with butterfly decorations tied around her waist, a pair of black arm warmers and regular shinobi sandals.

Three years later, Chōchō wears a black mid-riff tank top and black pants with a jacket with butterfly decorations, pink arm-warmers, and a pair of pink shinobi sandals. Her hair is longer which are tied in two high ponytails with butterfly clips and a forehead protector.

Abilities

Ninjutsu

Chōchō is a practitioner of
Lightning Release
, able to perform the Lightning Release: Thunderclap Fist (
雷遁・迅雷拳
,
Raiton: Jinraiken
) technique.
 In the anime, she is able to effectively perform
Cooperation Ninjutsu
 and
Fūinjutsu
, able to use both to
restrict
 a person's movements and
expand the might
 of this alongside fellow users.

Akimichi Clan Techniques






Chōchō's Butterfly Mode.



As a member of the Akimichi clan, Chōchō is able to
convert her calories
 into
chakra
 to use for various body-expanding
hiden
 techniques. Before graduating from the Academy, she was already able to use the
Partial Multi-Size Technique
. In the anime, by using her enlarged fists to deliver powerful punches to the ground, she can
smack the debris
 at her opponent to use as a ranged assault.
 By the time of her
Chūnin Exams
, Chōchō had mastered more advanced techniques of her clan, such as the
Multi-Size Technique
 and
Human Bullet Tank
.
 While her physical power is decreased, she is able to use
Butterfly Mode
 for extended periods of time without using the clan's
Three Coloured Pills
 at all.
 Originally, this reduced power came from Chōchō subconsciously not expending all her calories, keeping her transformation incomplete. However, later learning about how the technique is powered by drive, she learned to perfect it, properly increasing her power in this state.
 Her skill in fighting with enlarged body parts is enough to keep up with Sarada while she used her Sharingan.

Academy Entrance Arc






Chōchō thrown away by Nue.



In the anime, two weeks into the
Academy
, Chōchō was left amazed at how reckless
Boruto Uzumaki
 was compared to his father, and asked Sarada whether she knows him. Later, she joined the rest of the class to watch the fight between Boruto and
Iwabee Yuino
, after which Chōchō teased
Sumire
 when she expressed her happiness with how Boruto was able to get along with the classmates. During a class introducing students to
summoning
 techniques, Boruto and Sarada got into another argument, which sparked an argument between all the boys and girls. During lunch break, Chōchō bought nearly all the yakisoba buns, which sparked another fight between Sarada and Boruto over the last one. Shino appeared, insisting that they boys and girls settle things with a race challenge for a flag. The challenge quickly got heated, leading to a desperate Boruto using a summoning scroll and miraculously summoned a snake-like creature. The creature went on a rampage, attacking the students and launched Chōchō off the roof, to which Boruto managed to save her with the help of some other students. After the creature was subdued by the timely arrival of Konohamaru, the contest ended with the girls getting the flag. Despite their victory, the girls made peace with the boys.

Later, the class gained a new transfer student from
Otogakure
 named
Mitsuki
. Wanting the students to warm up to Mitsuki, Shino organised a welcoming party for the new student. Chōchō quickly began digging into the food. When Shino's efforts for the party backfired with his insects, the class began to freak out, with Denki begging someone to make the insects go away, which Mitsuki did with his
Wind Release: Breakthrough
, causing even more damage to the Academy. When one of the repairmen went berserk and started to destroy the Academy, while her classmates went into actions, Chōchō decided to stay behind and "guard" the potato chips.






Chōchō lecturing Magire.



Later, Sumire realises that she is being stalked. Eventually, Chōchō and her friends discover that it is
Magire Kakuremino
 a shy student from a different class. When Chōchō assumed that he was interested in her, Magire quickly denied it and accidentally admitted his feelings towards Sumire. Chōchō insisted that he be more forward with his feelings. When Magire meekly asks her out, Sumire turned him down, leaving him distraught and running away in shame. The following day, various creepy messages are left for Sumire. While Chōchō and the others decide to watch over her, they are systematically separated from Sumire. Eventually, the perpetrator is revealed to be a
possessed
 Magire, who kidnaps Sumire. Chōchō and the others soon find them, where Magire quickly attacked them with his concealment skills. Eventually, Chōchō was able to reach Magire, noting that such an indecisive nature will never win anyone over. Accepting his poor methods of trying to make Sumire like him, the spectre was rejected from Magire. As Magire began to apologise for his actions he fainted, resulting from severe chakra drain caused from his possession. The group then quickly take him to the hospital.

Later, the class was assigned by Shino to split into groups of three and each tail a different workplace for a few days to better understand non-shinobi life. Chōchō convinced Sarada to check out both the nail salon and the pastry factory. The following day, Chōchō angrily went to the post office, noting that her special order of a limited-edition potato chip was suppose to arrive the day before. It was soon deduced that Boruto's sloppy delivery of mail was behind this. Later, Chōchō checked on some of her friends after learning that they were hospitalised from a recent attack. Afterwards, she was recruited by Shikadai to go after the culprit. She and her friends the met up at the post office to discuss their plan. After splitting up to patrol the village, the culprit of the attacks unleashed their
Shadow Spectre
 on the post chief
Komame
. Chōchō's group however quickly appeared, having anticipated this move as all their recent efforts were clearly being spied on. While half the team stayed to save the possessed Komame, Chōchō's half pursued the masked culprit. While the post chief was saved, the spectre and the culprit ultimately got away.






Chōchō trying to capture the flag.



Several weeks later, Shino decided to change up the three-man teams for their next challenge to determine the optimum pairings for graduation. Chōchō decided to team up with Inojin and Shikadai. When Iwabee noted that they were essentially forming the Ino-Shika-Chō trio like their respective parents, the team admitted that their techniques were naturally compatible. Chōchō also noted that good teams don't need to be friends, only work well together. During their challenge to capture a flag, Shikadai took advantage of Lee's social-anxiety, noting how everyone was watching him. While Lee froze up, Chōchō quickly knocked him out. Shino was then called aside concerning Sumire. As the class began discussing rumours that Sumire was being transferred to a different school, they were relieved to see her return to their class.

Chōchō met Sarada while she was looking for a lost parcel in the train and helped her retrieve it, eventually find it in a river.

After their
sensei
 ended classes early due to the impending
Five Kage Summit
, Chōchō skipped her training with
Inojin
 and
Shikadai
 when Anko invited her to the
dango shop
 to eat some
anmitsu
, despite Inojin's protests. She casually dismissed him even after being called fat and left.

Sarada Uchiha Arc

Main article:
Naruto Gaiden: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring

Upon hearing that her class will be going through the graduation exam in a week, Chōchō was only interested in if it could help her lose some weight. Later, she met up with Chōji, who embarrassed Chōchō simply because of his choice of flavoured chips to walk around with. In a restaurant, Chōchō complained that her father's excessive eating is making it difficult for her to control her own eating habits when she's trying to lose weight, only to be further annoyed with her mother's "hands off" policy on the matter. Chōchō told Sarada that she believes she is adopted, due to how different she found herself to her parents, much to Sarada's humour as she was actually suffering from a possible discrepancy in her own parentage.
Mitsuki
 simply told her that drama of this type is typical of a girl her age, but Chōchō ignored him and invited Sarada on a road trip to "find her real parents". Later, when Sarada began to tail Naruto, Chōchō followed her, still believing they are embarking on a journey to discover her "real parents" and even assumed that her "real father" might be good-looking.






Chōchō facing Shin.



As she learned that Sarada was looking for her own father as well and was going to follow the Seventh Hokage to do so, Boruto soon appeared with a lunch prepared by his mother for Naruto. As Naruto had already left the village, Sarada decided to use this as an excuse to meet up with Naruto and asked Boruto to let her deliver it. After it was agreed that Chōchō and Sarada would bring the lunch, the two quickly took off. Soon afterwards, they were ambushed by
Shin
. While Chōchō and Sarada were quickly overwhelmed, the two were soon saved by Naruto's timely arrival. After a quick display of the Seventh Hokage's might, Shin
retreated
 and Chōchō was left in awe, hoping that maybe Naruto was her "real" father, much to Naruto's confusion. Deciding it would be safest to keep the two kunoichi with him, Naruto decided to let them join him on meeting with
Sasuke Uchiha
. Before setting out, Sarada gave him the lunch she promised to deliver, and then the three shared some bento.

Soon afterwards, Sarada went ahead under the guise of using the restroom while Naruto stayed to watch Chōchō catch her breath. Upon catching up with Sarada, they found her in the company of her estranged father, Sasuke, who Chōchō thought might be her real father simply because he was handsome. She then offered Sasuke her bag of chips to try and make up with his daughter. Later, Chōchō joined everyone in the search for Shin. When Sasuke activated his Rinnegan and prepared to take everyone with him in his Susanoo, Chōchō again admired Sasuke's abilities. In the new dimension, they ultimately found
Sakura Uchiha
 engaged in battle with Shin. As Sasuke subdued Shin with Susanoo and checked on his wife's condition, Chōchō complained about Sasuke being Sarada's father and not hers. Chōchō then overlooked the battle against thousands of Shin clones.






Chōchō amazed at Chōji's new look.



After the Shin clones were defeated, Chōchō approached Sarada, voicing her amazement at her friend's strength and noted with surprise that Sarada's eyes had become similar to her father's. On their way back to the village, Chōchō expressed her annoyance at being unable to find her real father but finding Sarada's instead. However as they approached the village gates, Chōchō approached a man whom she felt was familiar and might be her real father. She was shocked to find out that it was actually Chōji, who had just got back from a mission with
Ino Yamanaka
. She then began questioning her father on how he had suddenly lost so much weight and asked if it was some sort of secret technique passed down through their clan. Now in awe of her father's weight loss, Chōchō demanded that he will begin training her the next day.

Chōchō shares a meal with her family.



During the new Konohagakure holiday, Parent and Child Day, Karui was annoyed at both how lazy Chōji was being and that he ate all the sweets she specifically bought for the family to eat together, ultimately kicking him out of the house to think about his actions. As Chōchō's casual comments made Chōji begin fearing that he made Karui so mad that she would leave him, his daughter insisted that he must have some redeemable traits for Karui to have put up with him for so long. Convinced that it was his reputation as a competitive eating champion, he entered a food competition in the naive hope of impressing Karui. As he and Chōcho entered together, they were unknowingly being sabotaged by the promoters of the competition. As Boruto realised what was going on and helped even the playing field, one of the promoters used a technique to make the dumplings grow to immense sizes. As Chōji and Chōchō struggled to stop the growing dumplings, Karui joined her family in fighting them off to no avail. Ultimately, Chōji enlarged himself to eat all the dumplings and apologised for eating all the sweets before, realising that food should be shared with family. At the end of Parent and Child Day, Chōchō and her family enjoy sharing a meal together.

Chūnin Exams
 alongside Inojin and Shikadai. The first round is a true or false quiz which turned out to be a sham as both answers were incorrect and every team was dropped into an ink pit. Shikadai, however, was able to use his shadow to prevent him and his teammates from falling into it, passing the first round. In the second round, the genin had to capture an enemy team's flag.

Chōchō Arc






Team 10 being assigned alongside Team 7 a mission to protect the actors.



In the anime, as Chōji began teaching Chōchō more of their clan's advanced techniques, including the
maxed-out calorie control skill
 Chōchō showed more interest watching a popular TV drama, particularly its lead actors
Tomaru
 and
Ashina
. Determined to find love, Chōchō committed herself to maintaining her Butterfly Mode due to its slimmer appearance, despite the fact that her limited control of this state actually diminished strength. When the two lead actors of her favourite show received a death threat if they continued filming their show, Team 10 was assigned to protect the actors alongside Team 7. Chōchō and her team were assigned to watch Tomaru, much to her delight. Chōchō decided to put on a considerate but indifferent demeanour to get Tomaru to like her, which seemed to work. When the stage was attacked by a masked Ame-nin, the two Konoha teams defended the cast. While they initially pinned down the assailant, Chōchō moved into finish him with her
Partial Multi-Size Technique
, she at the last minute returned to her slim form, not wanting Tomaru to see her naturally plump form. This reduced performance let the assailant escape. Afterwards, one of the actors was injured. Tomaru suggested that Chōchō take the actress' place for the scene, much to Chōchō's bliss, seeing this as her chance for love.






Chōchō blames Mitsuki.



As Tomaru's kindness towards Chōchō continued to sway her, he ultimately had her try on a prop dress to rehearse a scene together. After Mitsuki interrupted a kiss scene, she began lashing out at him for ruining her "moment of love". Her relentless anger ultimately made her changed back to her normal plumper self, ruining the dress. When Tomaru appeared again, not recognising Chōchō, he revealed to be a very vain and shameless man, only interested in the beauty of Chōchō's Butterfly Mode. Even more, he mocked Chōchō's plumpness. Despite this crushing Chōchō's feelings, she chose not to reveal the truth who she was, instead focus on finishing the mission.






Chōchō protects Tomaru from the falling rocks.



Later, masked attacker managed to capture Tomaru while Chōchō went to get water for Ashina. A ransom was left that demanded 20 million ryō and for Ashina to be the one to deliver it. As Chōchō's friends continued telling her to stop focusing on how she looks as her continued usage of Butterfly Mode was weakening, Chōchō ignored their request. Ultimately, Mitsuki talked to her through her love of potato chips, noting that what matters is not the outside appearance, but the quality. During the exchange, as Konohamaru already captured the attacker and disguised himself as the Ame-nin, Ashina was revealed to be the mastermind behind the assaults as she desperately wanted to rekindle her fame as an actress. In a last blind effort to keep her fame by burying the truth, she attempted to blow up the area. While Konohomaru stopped her from using them, the explosive tags went off, causing a landslide. As Tomaru was in danger of be crushed, Chōchō dropped her Butterfly Mode and saved him. Afterwards, amazed by Chōchō's heroic display, he came to appreciate Chōchō for her, regardless of how she looked. While he offered to let her stay on as a regular for the show, she politely declined, wanting to live a life as the real her.

Mitsuki's Disappearance Arc

Main article:
Mitsuki's Disappearance Arc

In the anime, after Mitsuki's apparent betrayal of Konohagakure, the village was put on lockdown. Despite this, Boruto and Sarada decided to sneak out to find Mitsuki. Team 10 was assigned to find and bring back the two genin. The following day, they managed to intercept them. As the two refused to come back peacefully, they created a distraction and then attempted a decoy with Boruto's shadow clones. This succeeded in splitting up Team Moegi between the jōnin and her students. Sarada and Boruto were soon intercepted by their friends, who through Shikadai's strategy easily anticipated Sarada and Boruto's tactics to quickly subdue them. While ready to take them back, Shikadai noticed the snake. Once learning that a message was left on it from Mitsuki, Shikadai realised that the situation had to many inconsistencies to brand Mitsuki a traitor. Wanting to find answers, Shikadai convinced his team-mates to help Boruto and Sarada.






Team 10, Sarada and Boruto meet Tagorihime in Ryūchi Cave.



Eventually, they found themselves in a foggy canyon. As they began wondering about aimlessly, they found a large palace, assuming that it must be the Ryūchi Cave. Inside, they found to their surprise a very lavished setting and were greeted by a beautiful young woman. Saying the White Snake Sage was expecting them, the woman invited them to a large feast. As the others began to enjoy themselves, the woman insisted that after they eat, they could ask the sage about Mitsuki. Boruto realised the woman was deceiving them as he never mentioned Mitsuki by name. The woman revealed herself to be a snake creature and the palace and food were but illusions to test the guests. Applauding Boruto's fortitude, she explained that to see the sage, one must past a series of tests, if they fail, the snake servants may eat the guests. As only Boruto wished to speak with the sage, Chōchō and the others were separated from him and knocked out. Ultimately, proving his resolve, Boruto passed the other tests.

Once Chōchō and the others were reunited with Boruto they met with the White Snake Sage, surprised to see that she was a small and frail-looking reptilian woman. While surprised that someone would risk meeting with her for something other than learning senjutsu, the sage insisted that she couldn't help give answers beyond mastery of senjutsu. Boruto refused to give up, begging the sage to reconsider. Giving in to Boruto's stubbornness, the sage agreed to help analyse Mitsuki's snake only if they first brought to her the Reverse Scale of the giant snake Garaga, who was located in the most dangerous part of the cave. Boruto and the group accepted.






Chōchō is turned into stone by Garaga.



In their journey through the cave, they found several massive stone snake statue before ultimately being attacked by
Garaga
. The genin attempted to hold their ground but were quickly overpowered by the massive foe. As the rampaging snake attacked Sarada, another massive snake appeared to stop him. After the genin retreated to safety, the other snake appeared again, revealing himself as
Aoda
, Sasuke's personal summoning. As Aoda made his peaceful intentions known the group explained their goal of acquiring Garaga's Reverse Scale on the request of the
White Snake Sage
 to get her help in finding
Mitsuki
. Aoda was reluctant as Garaga's savage nature made all other inhabitants of Ryūchi Cave stay clear of him, but nonetheless agreed to help Sarada. Following Shikadai's plan, they were initially able to pin down Garaga through Chōchō's
Super Multi-Size Technique
 and Aoda's constricting, until the rampaging foe used his spit to petrify Chōchō.

As Chōchō's friends continued their pursuit for the Reverse Scale, Boruto convinced the giant snake to enter a summoning contract with him on the grounds that if Boruto failed to make Mitsuki come back, Garaga could eat him. Garaga returned Chōchō to normal. After presented the Reverse Scale, still attached to Garaga, to the White Snake Sage, the sage revealed the secret thoughts inside Mitsuki's snake, revealing that Mitsuki feigned killing a guard to save his life. Still unclear why Mitsuki joined the attackers but knowing where he went headed off to the Land of Earth.

As the group began to approach the Land of Earth's border, Shikadai had Inojin and Chōchō to return to the village to report their findings. Along the way, the two found a group of jōnin paralysed on the field. They decided to investigate. Following this, Inojin and Chōchō turned back to help their friends. They arrived in time as they struggled against
Kokuyō
. The Ino-Shika-Chō trio decided to hold off the artificial man while Boruto and Sarada went on ahead. Despite their perfect team formations, the enemy was able to repel all of them. Ultimately, the trio was forced to retreat. The trio soon after caught up to their friends, where they learned of Mitsuki's betrayal upon attacking Boruto and leaving with the enemies.






Boruto's group pursuing Mitsuki.



After Boruto awoke, the group discussed whether to return to Konohagakure with their findings, or push forward to find the truth about these new enemies that posed a threat to the peaceful times. Ultimately, it was agreed to go venture on to Iwagakure and retrieve Mitsuki. Boruto suggested that go seek the help of
Ōnoki
. Upon arriving outside the village, it was decided that Inojin stay outside with the Akuta as to not draw any attention. Inside, they were soon spotted by
Akatsuchi
. He decided to help the genin as it may be related Kurotsuchi's sudden disappearance. They confronting Ōnoki, who once learning of their goal to find Mitsuki, turned dark and turned them away. The group was then surrounded by a bunch of Akuta, that were being controlled by
Kū
, the leader of the conspiracy in Iwagakure as well as Ōnoki's son and working alongside the retired Tsuchikage, much to everyone's horror.

As Ōnoki began explaining the nature of his plans and his genuine desire to protect people, realising that with his secret out in the open, he would have to accelerate his plans before the other Great Shinobi Countries learned. While Ōnoki told his son to gently takes the prisoners away, Boruto and the others chose to resist, and a fight ensured. As the battle escalated a massive column was knocked over towards Ōnoki. He was narrowly saved by Boruto, who then retreated while carrying the elderly man. While Shikadai was captured by the Akuta, Chōchō and the others scattered to escape. She soon after regrouped at the cave with Inojin and Sarada, surprised to learn that Boruto hadn't returned yet. They decided to wait and see how things played out.






Chōchō restrains Kakō.



Deciding that they waited long enough, the group decided to look for their friends. They instead found an injured Akatsuchi. They then noticed an explosion. Realising that it could be their friends, Inojin was chosen to take Akatsuchi back to the cave while Sarada and Chōchō went to investigate. The two kunoichi found Boruto battling
Kakō
, whose immense physical prowess and
Dust Release
 was overwhelming Boruto. Chōchō and Sarada helped in the battle, desperate to avoid his Dust Release. Ultimately, Sarada found a time limit in the foes attacks and used it to counter. Kakō pushed his body past his limit to continue attacking, which ultimately overtaxed his body and died. Ōnoki, who was watching, was shocked to see how the artificial soldier attacked so recklessly and against his previous orders of not hurting the genin. Boruto insisted that despite the elderly man's belief, the
Fabrications
 did indeed have free-will. Inojin arrived and subdued Boruto, as he was under
Kirara
's genjutsu. She then appeared with the Akuta and surrounded the Konoha-nin.

The genin were brought back with Akatsuchi to the village. Once arriving, they learned that all of Iwagakure was taken over by Kū as an extra measure to keep the outside world from learning of their plans. When contorting the second-in-command, he voiced his desire to transplant human hearts into the fabrications as it would sustain them. Ōnoki however refused on the grounds that it went against the purpose of his goal for saving lives. Deciding that Ōnoki was too sentimental to see the bigger picture, Kū usurped the Third Tsuchikage. Before Kū could move forward with his plan, Shikadai appeared, using a diversion to help his friends escape.






Chōchō attacks Kokuyō.



They were soon intercepted by Kokuyō. Chōchō and her team-mates decided to face the foe while Boruto and Sarada moved on. Kokuyō's advanced physical prowess quickly adapted to the Ino-Shika-Chō's previously shown attack patterns and forced them back. Using a plan of Shikadai, they were able to lead Kokuyō into a trap. While nearly working, the foe proved to strong and moved in to finish Inojin. Instead, Inojin was saved by the efforts of the tiny Akuta he had befriended and named Akkun. The creature's efforts let Chōchō land the final blow to finish their foe, but not before Akkun was struck down.

Ultimately, the
Fabrications
 were defeated, thanks to the personal sacrifice of the Third Tsuchikage. While wanting to stay for the funeral, Naruto sent Chōchō and her friends back to Konohagakure, which Chōchō was dreading the confrontation with Moegi.

Icha Icha
 books by Jiraiya in hopes understand his influence on Naruto. Concerned about such young kids reading such an adult book, Chōji simply said that the books were romance novels, which enticed Chōchō to join her friends in searching for them.

Later, Chōcho joined the other genin in testing out new surveillance equipment designed to follow their location. During the field test,

Deepa
, who casually ignored them. Once inside the restaurant, they were horrified to see that everyone in it was slaughtered, wondering if Deepa was the one responsible. After reporting their finds to Sunagakure, Chōchō's team meet up with Shinki's team.

While Shikadai was the highest ranking ninja of the group as a chūnin, they decided to let Shinki lead the way as he knew the area better. Upon discovering the puppet, they were encountered by
Deepa
, who demanded to be given the puppet. When they refused, he
pelted
 them with a barrage of carbon cubes that even Shinki's Iron Sand Wall couldn't completely block. Shikadai developed a strategy detain Deepa long enough for Shinki to strike. While seemingly working, Shinki's Black Iron Fist was completely ineffective against Deepa's super durable body, who swiftly defeated them. Shinki used the last of his strength to destroy the puppet rather than let Deepa have it, and he let them live.






Team 10 oversees Boruto's training.



After returning to the village and reporting what happened, Chōchō and Inojin were convinced by Shikadai to help Boruto in his training to defeat Deepa's durable body. Shikadai decided that the key was focusing Boruto's Rasengan's power on a key point. Despite their long hours of effort, they had little success.

In the anime, as Chōchō was picking taiyaki with Sarada for her and Chōji to have, she met
Kawaki
, mysterious boy connected to Kara that was under the care and watch of the Seventh Hokage. While noting that Kawaki was handsome, she found his attitude very sour. To lighten the mood, Naruto offered to treat everyone personally to the snacks of their choosing, with Naruto quickly regretting the offer as Chōchō ordered a massive amount.

Over time, as Kawaki began to warm up to Boruto and his friends, Chōchō developed a crush on Kawaki. She continued to watch from afar as the Hokage began teaching him ninjutsu, swooning over how quickly he mastered the basics of chakra manipulation. Later, after the village was infiltrated and attacked by
Jigen
, using Kawaki's Kāma as a portal to get in, the village was put on high alert. In the anime, Team 10 heard that a village archive was attacked and data was stolen. While talking with her friends about the event, Chōchō remained sure that the culprit had not left the village yet, and convinced her team-mates to investigate with her. They discovered the target's hideout, and also came across Kakashi, who was conducting his own investigation. Impressed by the genin's work, he decided to collaborate with them. They found the culprit,
Koji Kashin
, escaping into the sewer. Kakashi went alone while telling the genin to report to the officials. Shikadai realised that the sewers also connected to the Thunder Rail. Chōchō was able to narrowly launch her team-mates on the train on time, only for Koji to be a shadow clone. However, their report allowed Kakashi to see through Koji's deception and thwart his efforts, causing him to retreat.

Later, while the Ino-Shika-Chō trio were training, they were approached
Kara
's chief scientist,
Amado Sanzu
. Finding him shady, the genin attempted to restrain him. Amado used his tech to easily repel Shikadai's technique and knocked him out with a drug. He strapped a bomb on Shikadai, which was set to go off in 48 hours. Sai and other Konoha-nin the appeared after alerted by Inojin. Amado asked to talk with Shikamaru, who was given communication via the
Mind Body Transmission Technique
. Amado stated firmly that he wished to defect to Konoha, offering his full intel on Kara and its resources, their

, and even on the
Ōtsutsuki
. Deciding to hear him out, Naruto ordered the man be brought in for questioning. In the anime, Inojin and Chōchō were assigned to watch over Shikadai in the meantime.

Chūnin Re-Examination Arc

Main article:
Chūnin Re-Examination Arc

In the anime, following
Isshiki
's attack, Naruto decided to host another Chūnin Exam to boost morale and promote more chūnin. Chōchō passed the first, written exam with Inojin's help, who passed her answers with his art. While she wasn't as invested in becoming a chūnin, since being on Shikadai's team meant she could already participate in higher rank missions, Shikadai reminded her that as chūnin she would receive higher pay during her missions, which she could spend on more food. During the second exam, she had to rescue an injured ally from the
Forest of Death
 within an allotted time limit. Chōchō was able to do it, and was one of 10 genin to pass the exam, and would have to fight one of the other 9 in an one-on-one battle for the final exam.

The following day, Chōchō spent most of her day enjoying food and talking with her team-mates as Yakiniku Q. After realising how secretly important her and Inojin becoming chūnin was to Chōchō, she decided to train earnestly. Sarada further encouraged her. The day of the finals, when Inojin was set to fight
Hōki Taketori
, one of Sai's genin, Chōchō suggested asking him intel, but Inojin refused. She watched the match from the stands, and despite Inojin's loss, she was glad to see he was in good spirits following the match. During the second match, which pitted
Wasabi Izuno
 against
Iwabee Yuino
, Chōchō was surprised to see
Shinki
 and his team-mates, who had all already become chūnin. For the third match, Chōchō was shocked to learn she would be going up against Sarada.






Chōchō clashes with Sarada.



While initially put off by having to fight her best friend, Inojin reminded her of their promise to become chūnin and stand as equals to Shikadai. Reinvigorated, Chōchō was determined to give her all. During the match, when Sarada became concerned for her after one of her attacks landed hard, Chōchō felt insulted that Sarada wasn't fully committed, and called her out on it. Sarada apologised for her lack of commitment, and fought seriously. Chōchō used her Butterfly Mode against Sarada's Chidori. Sarada was victorious, and the two thanked each other for the match. Leaving with her team-mates, she cried for failing to keep her promise, but Inojin and Shikadai comforted her. By the end of the exams, Chōchō cheered her promoted friends. Later, she joined her team at Yakiniku Q to celebrate their efforts.

Chōchō and Shikadai were assigned to a C-Rank escort mission. Much to Chōchō's delight, Kawaki was assigned as Inojin's stand-in for the mission. During the mission, the group was attacked by assassins after the medicine Mozuku had with him.
Kurobane
 left with it, while
Jujumaru
 stayed behind to finish them off. Shikadai and Chōchō were able to overpower his
trap barrier
, but she was injured protecting Mozuku. After defeating and restraining Jujumaru, Mozuku explained his true circumstances. Shikadai wanted to return to Konoha to treat Chōchō, but Kawaki ignored him and went ahead with Mozuku. As she struggled to walk even with Shikadai's support, Boruto and Sarada joined them, having followed suspicious shinobi while on their own mission. She and Shikadai explained how their mission had developed, so Sarada stayed with Chōchō while the others went to join Kawaki. At the end of the mission, Sarada visited Chōchō in the hospital.

Later, after she and Inojin apprehended
Jingo Kumano
 due to out of date information, they helped him develop a new ramen recipe for his restaurant, and rescued him after he was kidnapped over a mix-up with data thieves who were the target of Shikadai's mission.

 flashed everywhere, making everyone believe Boruto and Kawaki had the other's history. When Kawaki claimed that Boruto killed the Seventh Hokage, Team 10 was furious and went after Boruto. As they managed to pin down Boruto, Sasuke suddenly appeared and took Boruto away, leaving Team 10 confused.

Boruto's Return Arc

Boruto's Return Arc






Chōchō attacks a Claw Grime.



Three years later, after a sparring session with Himawari, Chōchō praised her progress. She, alongside Shikadai and Inojin, were shocked to hear Himawari say she was getting stronger for Boruto's sake and still defended him as a good person. When
Code
 attacked the village, looking for Boruto, he unleashed his
Claw Grimes
. Chōchō joined her team and Himawari to defend the village, striking the grimes Shikadai had immobilised. When one targeted her from her blindspot, Inojin caught it with his ink bird. After Kawaki arrived and killed it, the grimes' numbers continued to increase. After they were defeated, Team 10 and Himawari joined Kawaki. When Code escaped through a newly emerged Claw Grime, Team 10 went to look for him, unsure if he had actually fled the village.

Upon learning that Moegi became a tree after being consumed by a Claw Grime, Team 10 vowed to free her. When
Jura
 and
Hidari
 invaded Konoha, they met with Team 10, who was with Himawari, having mistaken her for Naruto over the presence of tailed beast chakra in her.

Jura quickly recognised who Shikadai was from previous research. The sentient God Tree revealed that he was here for Naruto, yet was instead drawn to Himawari because she somehow had
Kurama
's chakra. Deciding to follow through initial direction, Jura ensnared Himawari with his Wood Release. Team 10 used their formation to save her. When Jura suddenly unleashed a powerful Tailed Beast Ball, Chōchō was able to tackle the foe in time to make him launch the deadly attack safely away. It was then decided to leave the village with Himawari, knowing that the enemies wouldn't launch such attacks near Himawari as they desired her now.

Ultimately, Jura caught up and grounded them. Their plummet was cushioned by Chōchō's expansion technique. As Himawari was captured, Inojin was struck down by Jura. The sight of this caused Himawari to unleash a new power and break free, revealing herself as the new Jinchūriki of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox. Himawari quickly used her newfound powers to heal Inojin. She then told her friends to retreat so she could fight the God Tree alone. Chōchō refused to let the younger girl fight alone, but was ultimately convinced on the promise to enjoy pancakes together later.
