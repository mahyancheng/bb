The
Human Path
 (
人間道
,
Ningendō
) grants a Rinnegan user the ability to read the mind of any target by placing their hand on the target's head or chest, thus obtaining even the most well-guarded secrets.
 This process kills the target,
 with their
souls
 being physically removed from their body once users pull their hand away.
 This makes the ability quite deadly in close combat, as in most cases, there is little that targets can do to stop the removal of their soul short of attacking the user, which the other
Six Paths Techniques
 make very difficult. Though it can be somewhat physically resisted temporarily if the target has
enough power
 to do so.

As part of his
Six Paths of Pain
,
Nagato
 channelled the powers of the Human Path through the corpse of a
Takigakure

shinobi

Trivia

In Buddhism, the Human realm (also known as the "Manuṣya realm") is based on passion, desire, doubt, and pride. It is widely believed that the Human realm is the form of rebirth most likely to attain enlightenment, due to both the availability of information and teachers, and the ability to reason without falling victim to the obsessive aggression or carnal delights inherited by the higher planes.

Although the use of this technique usually resulted in the victim's death, the person's soul could also be stored within the
King of Hell
.
