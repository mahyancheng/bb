Naruto: Ninja Council
, known as
Naruto: Saikyō Ninja Daikesshū
 in the Japanese version, is the first instalment in the
Ninja Council
 series.

Gameplay

There are
scrolls
 that the playable character can obtain to perform abilities at the cost of chakra, which can be used to break down walls or create whirlwinds. The story mode very loosely follows the
Prologue — Land of Waves
 arc to the
Chūnin Exams
 arc. Players also get to have an opportunity to fight
Orochimaru
. The playable characters are Naruto and Sasuke, with the possibility to unlock Kakashi. There is also an unlockable hard mode, that takes place at night, and replaces the Orochimaru, Zabuza and Haku fights with Gaara, Temari and Kankuro fights.

Trivia

When Rock Lee uses
Reverse Lotus
, his signature skin colour that changes when he enters
Gate of Life
 doesn't appear.

The voice clips were reused from
Naruto: Clash of Ninja
.

This game is the first instance where Sasuke performs his
Lion Combo
 solely in midair as opposed to performing the finisher whilst falling to the ground.

Some characters can trigger special cutscenes when using a special move on the right opponent:

Using Naruto's Sexy Technique on Ebisu will knock him out, similar to how it did in Chapter 2 and the second episode.

Also, using it on Iruka when finding him, and Hiruzen after beating Orochimaru, will also cause them to have unique dialogue.

Failing to use Naruto's Shadow Clone Technique on Kiba will cause Naruto to fart, similar to how he did in the Chūnin Exams. The fart stuns Kiba, then Naruto uses the Uzumaki Combo, knocking Kiba out.

Using Kakashi's Summoning Technique on Zabuza will trigger a special cutscene. Kakashi will then use the Lightning Cutter, which knocks Zabuza out.
