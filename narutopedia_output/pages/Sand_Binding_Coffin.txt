Using the
sand
 he keeps stored in his
Sand Gourd
,
Gaara
 immobilises his targets and captures them. Because the sand is naturally malleable, most of the target's usual methods for defence or escape become ineffective once they've been encased by it. They can only wait until Gaara releases or kills them.
 When killing his targets, Gaara tends to either let them suffocate or use
Sand Waterfall Funeral
.

In the anime,
Shinki
 performs this technique using
Iron Sand
.

Trivia

"Sand binding" (
砂縛
,
sabaku
) is pronounced the same as the Japanese word for "desert" (
砂漠
), a pun commonly used for Gaara and his jutsu.

In the anime,
Nagare
 modelled his
Assimilation: Sand Binding Coffin
 after this technique.
