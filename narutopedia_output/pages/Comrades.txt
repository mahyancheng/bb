Summary

Jirōbō
 dies and
Chōji
 starts walking in the direction that the rest of the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 went in. Seeing that they have marked their path for him, he collapses, glad to know he has friends that believe in him. Meanwhile, the rest of the team notices that the
Sound Four
 has not set traps for them, meaning they expected Jirōbō to win. Taking advantage of this,
Shikamaru
 transforms into Jirōbō and joins up with the three other Otogakure ninja. However, because he doesn't reprimand
Tayuya
 for her insults like Jirōbō would, his identity is exposed and most of the team is caught in
Kidōmaru
's webbing.
Neji
 takes advantage of this preoccupation and attacks him from behind.
