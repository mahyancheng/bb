"
Naruto's Rival
" (
ナルトのライバル
,
Naruto no Raibaru
) is episode 423 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Tsunade
 is frustrated that
Orochimaru
 has escaped her grasp again.
Shizune
 informs her that
Konohamaru
 has been learning the
Rasengan
 from
Naruto
, to which she makes a bet whether he will master it or not. Meanwhile, Konohamaru uses his
Sexy Technique
 to pop the rubber ball, given to him by Naruto. The boy then decides to visit Naruto and show his accomplishment, learning that he has been practising
Wind Release
. Konohamaru then shows him that now he can burst the rubber ball, with
Yamato
 and
Kakashi
 flustered by how he does it — using Sexy Technique. Proud of Konohamaru, Naruto creates a
shadow clone
 and tells him to do this next, only for the boy to reply that he can't. Konohamaru then issues a challenge to Naruto, saying that he will learn the Shadow Clone Technique before Naruto can complete his current step in Wind Release training.
 After a few failed attempts at the technique, Konohamaru collapses, with
Moegi
 and
Udon
 going to
Sakura
 for some food pills, which she has been giving to Naruto for training. After a few days, Naruto completes his training and Konohamaru loses the challenge. Later,
Kotetsu
 and
Izumo
 inform Konohamaru and Naruto about the death of
Asuma Sarutobi
 and, soon after that, the jōnin's funeral is held. While Naruto fought
Kakuzu
, Konohamaru managed to learn the Shadow Clone Technique. Konohamaru then begins the final step of the training, with both him and Naruto forming the Rasengan with Tsunade and Shizune observing them. After leaving for
Mount Myōboku
 to learn
Senjutsu
, Naruto asks Konohamaru to take care of his treasure - his old orange jacket. During
Pain's Assault
, Konohamaru manages to use the
Rasengan
, and with it, defeat
Naraka Path
. When Naruto returns, Konohamaru reveals that, despite the village's explosion, he managed to save Naruto's old jacket, by storing it in the village's valuables storage in the evacuation shelter.

Trivia





Kushina's scarf in the episode.



Before Konoha's destruction by
Pain
, Konohamaru stored Naruto's old orange jacket in the village valuables storage. The box containing it is also the same one that held the scarf knitted by
Kushina
 in
The Last: Naruto the Movie
.

The scarf itself can be seen next to Naruto's old jacket.

In the manga, Naruto shows the Rasengan and its three steps to Konohamaru at the end of Part I.
