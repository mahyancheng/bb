"
The Underworld Transfer Jutsu
" (
黄泉転身の術
,
Yomi Tenshin no Jutsu
) is episode 304 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Neji
,
Shikamaru
,
Chōji
,
Kiba
, and
Akamaru
 regroup to assess their situation, on the other side their friends frantically try to figure out what is wrong with them. Realising that they were all still alive but left in a form of suspended animation with weak pulses and lethargic chakra flow,
Shino
 and
Ino
 do what they can to keep their comrades' chakra flowing, while requesting a word be sent to
HQ
 about the situation. Meanwhile within the
barrier
 erected by the
Sound Four
, the
Konoha
-nin battle it out once again for their lives. News soon reached Ino and Shino from
Inoichi
 that their comrades were in something that he likened to a
genjutsu
-like state and that the only way to save them was if they were able to locate and recall their souls somehow as not even the
sensory barrier
 at HQ was able to locate their souls.

Elsewhere as
Naruto
 rushes towards his friends' location, he encounters a group of
shinobi
, and takes out a
transformed

White Zetsu Army
 clone. After affirming that there were no more enemies in the group, Naruto moves on as there were no shinobi from the
Communications Team
 there. Despite the fact, however, that the Konoha-nin seem to have the upper hand in their battle against the Sound Four, their enemies regroup and tell them that their efforts were futile against immortals and then informs them that even if somehow they were defeated, there was no escaping from the barrier; leaving the Konoha-nin with two options: die by their hands or have their bodies in the real world eventually give out, and die.

Trivia

In this episode, the colour of Ino's eyes are changed to green that matches the manga depiction.
