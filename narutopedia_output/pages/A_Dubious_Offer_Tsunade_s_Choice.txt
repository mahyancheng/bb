"
A Dubious Offer! Tsunade's Choice!
" (
YESか NOか! ツナデの回答
,
Iessu ka Nō ka! Tsunade no Kaitō
) is episode 92 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

As the week went by,
Naruto
 continued his training, although he was unable to properly combine both the spinning and power aspects together, and had varying results.
Tsunade
 watched Naruto's progress from afar, noting how similar he was to both her dead brother and lover. Once a week had gone by, Naruto appeared to have been unsuccessful, and laid unconscious with fatigue. Tsunade met
Jiraiya
 for drinks, where he told her that he was aware that
Orochimaru
 had offered her something. After Jiraiya had made it clear that he would kill her if she helped Orochimaru, Tsunade drugged his drink, promptly putting him to sleep. The next morning, Tsunade met with Orochimaru as promised, and prepared to heal his arms. Before she could do so, however, she was stopped by Orochimaru's assistant,
Kabuto Yakushi
.
