Naruto creates a
shadow clone
 which he grabs and transforms into a
fūma shuriken
 that he throws at his enemy. After it hits the enemy the shuriken turns back to a shadow clone and punches the enemy in the face. This can also be done to escape attacks.

Trivia

In
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm
 and
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations
, before Naruto throws the shuriken, he
combines
 with the shuriken. When the Fūma Shuriken makes contact, it slashes the opponent several times, then turns back to Naruto and the shadow clone. Both of them deliver a combo attack that sends the opponent flying off into the distance.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations
 and
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
, this technique is only usable in story mode, before Naruto learned
Rasengan
.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
, it appears as one of Part I Naruto's selectable Ninjutsu along with the
Rasengan
.
