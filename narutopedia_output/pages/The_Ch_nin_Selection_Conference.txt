"
The Chūnin Selection Conference
" (
中忍昇格首脳会議
,
Chūnin Shōkaku Shunō Kaigi
) is episode 112 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Shikamaru
 visits
Naruto
 in his office, asking him about his decision on who to promote to
chūnin
, as the exams had been derailed by the
Ōtsutsuki
 attack. Naruto finds it difficult to choose, as he can only promote one
genin
. Shikamaru stresses that chūnin are team leaders, and should be chosen based on their ability to discern battle situations and make decisions. Naruto and Shikamaru review the sections of the exams and those who passed them, discarding them as they analyse how they fought and strategised their battles. They eventually narrow it down to
Sarada
,
Sumire
, and
Denki
, and Naruto decides to promote Sarada, as while she's on par with Denki and Sumire in terms of strategy, he finds her to have the better fighting skills among them.

Sasuke
 arrives, feeling the need to report in. He says he hasn't been able to find
Urashiki
, but has discovered evidence that Urashiki had been around in several locations before
Momoshiki
 and
Kinshiki
 arrived, and Shikamaru speculates he was gathering intel. Seeing Sarada's photo, he deduces Naruto wants to promote her, but having learned from Sarada's desertion after the exams from
Sakura
, voices his concerns over who should be promoted. Sasuke leaves, and Naruto reconsiders
Shikadai
, pointing out his contribution in the resolution of the
Iwagakure
 incident. Shikadai is promoted to chūnin.
