"
Bushy Brow's Pledge: Undying Love and Protection!
" (
激まゆプラトニック!僕は死ぬまでアナタを守る!!
,
Gekimayu Puratonikku! Boku wa Shinu Made Anata o Mamoru!!
) is episode 31 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

While hiding under a tree,
Sakura
 tends to
Sasuke
 and
Naruto
's wounds, even though severely sleep-deprived. Alerted from a daze by a squirrel, Sakura quickly wards it off with a
kunai
, ignorant to the fact that
Team Dosu
 had sent the squirrel there with an
explosive tag
 on its back. While en route to find a second scroll,
Rock Lee
 stops on a branch, and sets himself the task of catching all the leaves that had fallen, believing that if he did, Sakura would fall in love with him. After catching 19 of the 20 leaves, he spots a squirrel with an explosive tag on its back, and saves it before destroying the explosive tag. Dosu and his squad challenge Sasuke, but Sakura, prepared to defend her comrades, sets off several traps at the enemy shinobi. Unfortunately, Dosu manages to destroy the trap with ease, and shortly after that makes a remark about how Sakura has no right to be a ninja. Just before they could land their attack, however, Rock Lee shows up and knocks the three of them away. Declaring as he made his entrance that he would protect Sakura until he dies, Lee uses his brute strength to pull up an underground root to block an incoming attack by
Dosu
. As the battle ensued, Lee prepared to use the
Front Lotus
 after deeming that it met the criteria that his teacher,
Might Guy
, told him had to be met in order to use it (to protect the people most precious to him). Lee is then able to catch Dosu and use the technique, but the force of impact is cushioned by
Zaku
, and Dosu is saved. Unable to move as his body is recuperating from the strain of using the Front Lotus, Dosu incapacitates Lee with his own technique, which he claims is faster than Lee's taijutsu since it works at the speed of sound.

Trivia

The task Lee sets for himself is very similar to the game often played to discern whether or not the object of one's affections
returned the same feelings
.

When
Shikamaru
,
Ino
 and
Chōji
 appear after
Neji
 has spotted them, Shikamaru is to the left and Chōji to the right of Ino but after Neji starts to walk off, they change places.
