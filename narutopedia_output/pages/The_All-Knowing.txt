 anime.

Summary

The reincarnated
Hokage
 take in their surroundings.
Hashirama
 wonders who
Minato
 is, and is elated to discover he's the Fourth Hokage, and then apprehensive when
Orochimaru
 tells him
Tsunade
 is the Fifth Hokage. Orochimaru elucidates he did not bring them back to destroy
Konohagakure
, but to answer
Sasuke
's questions.
Hiruzen
 confirms what Sasuke was told about
Itachi
 and the village, and Orochimaru questions
Tobirama
's policies regarding the
Uchiha
 during his time, which Tobirama defends, and explains how the Uchiha fall prey to strong feelings.
 Sasuke asks Hashirama what is the village and the purpose of shinobi, making it clear his answer would determine Sasuke's actions. Tobirama is outraged, and flares his chakra, only for Hashirama to also flare his, almost making the
Naka Shrine
 crumble. Hashirama praises Itachi, and explains that a proper answer would take time. Orochimaru reveals to them the war
Madara
 is waging, to which Minato and Tobirama sense
Naruto
 and Madara in the distance. Tobirama tries to leave, but is restrained by Orochimaru. Hashirama figures that ignoring Sasuke's request would only create another Madara, which would make winning the war pointless. Hashirama then begins to tell Sasuke about his final battle with Madara.

Trivia

The order of the
Rashōmon
 changes between when Hashirama summoned and when they're destroyed. It changes from red, yellow, blue, green, and orange, to red, green, blue, yellow, and then orange.

Up until Madara equipped Susanoo onto Kurama, Kurama's eyes were normal as if it wasn't being controlled by Madara. After Madara equipped Susanoo onto Kurama, its eyes had the appearance of the Sharingan.
