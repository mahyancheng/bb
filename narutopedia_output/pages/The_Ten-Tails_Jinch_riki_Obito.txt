"
The Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki: Obito
" (
十尾の人柱力・オビト
,
Jūbi no Jinchūriki: Obito
) is chapter 638 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

The
shinobi
 watch on in confusion as the
Ten-Tails
 vanishes from the battlefield. As the shinobi sought answers,
Hiashi
 watched on with his
Byakugan
, and
Sakura
 asked
Hinata
, what she had seen. It is revealed that
Obito
, had in fact initiated a
sealing technique
, which allowed him to absorb the Ten-Tails into himself, making him the beast's new
jinchūriki
. Emerging in his new form,
Naruto
 goes on to confirm that Obito was able to resist
Madara
's control and had instead been using a different technique than the
one to revive
 him. Meanwhile,
Killer B
 confirms with
Gyūki
 that the Ten-Tails had not reached its final form but had instead been sealed within Obito.
Hashirama
 then attempts to
restrain
 Obito, but Obito's new power proves too much for the technique which had been restraining the beast itself prior. In response, Obito generates four
chakra arms
, and then proceeds to rip apart the
barrier
 erected by the four
Hokage
. Upon seeing this, Hashirama warns the other shinobi of Obito's power while
Minato
 pleads for Obito to stop which is responded to by Obito sounding out his own name with some confusion. As the three other Hokage relocate to where Obito is, Hashirama openly declares that Obito is stronger than he, which both
Hiruzen
 and
Tobirama
 affirm. As Madara prepares his own "trump card" hoping that Obito did not notice him before then. While the Hokage discussed the situation, Obito takes the First and Second by surprise, ripping through their
bodies
.
