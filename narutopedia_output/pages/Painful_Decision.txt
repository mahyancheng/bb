"
Painful Decision
" (
苦渋の決断
,
Kujū no Ketsudan
) is episode 201 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

After hearing that
Danzō
 has been chosen as the leader of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
,
Sasuke
 and his
team
 head out, slipping by the
samurai
 guards. The
Fourth Raikage
 demands to know why Danzō was chosen and not him, since
Kumogakure
 has yet to produce any
shinobi
 that are members of the
Akatsuki
.
Mifune
, the general of the
Land of Iron
, explains that the
Raikage
 is unsuitable for leadership due to giving in to his emotions often.
Gaara
 is too young to assume leadership of five allied nations despite the title of
Kazekage
; adversely, the
Third Tsuchikage
 is too old, and he is also not an ideal candidate due to the fact that he has employed the services of the Akatsuki numerous times in the past. Since the Akatsuki is rumoured to have been conceived in
Kirigakure
, the
Fifth Mizukage
 is not qualified to lead without possible suspicions arising, thus leaving Danzō, the Sixth
Hokage
, to be the favorable choice.

Meanwhile,
Ino
 begins to cry after hearing about the execution order placed on Sasuke.
Shikamaru
, assuming command of the remaining members of the
Konoha 11
, goes to
Sakura
's tent to talk to her when he hears the conversation occurring inside.
Sai
 approaches Sakura and asks her how she and Naruto can fight for Sasuke so much when he does nothing but cause them pain, and that despite his lack of understanding over emotions, he feels anger over their pain. He asks Sakura what promise Naruto made to her, prompting Sakura to gasp and remember the
promise Naruto made
 to her about bringing Sasuke back no matter what, even when he had
failed
. Sai reveals that Naruto is in love with her, and Sakura realises that she has been causing Naruto the same pain that Sasuke had been causing her. Shikamaru enters the tent and explains that he and the others would be heading out to eliminate Sasuke and would like
Team 7
's approval, citing that failing to do so would start a war between
Kumogakure
 and
Konohagakure
. After he warns Sakura that he would need to complete this mission with or without her blessing, Shikamaru is aghast to discover that Naruto has already gone to the Land of Iron to meet the Raikage. To his surprise, Sakura agrees to it and find Naruto, explaining that she would like to take the opportunity to break the news to Naruto to atone for the suffering she caused him.

Back at the summit,
Ao
 uses his
Byakugan
 and discovers that Mifune is being manipulated by
Shisui Uchiha
's
genjutsu
, which is being cast by Danzō. He interrupts the summit, asking Danzō to reveal his right eye. When questioned, he explains his suspicions and how he was able to deduce the
genjutsu
 with his Byakugan, which he took as a trophy of war from a fallen
Hyūga
. He tells the other
kage
 that Danzō is in possession of Shisui's eye and is casting Shisui's
genjutsu
 to obtain leadership of the Allied Forces, and that the genjutsu is so powerful that the victim is not even aware that they are being influenced. However, the summit is then crashed by
White Zetsu
, who notifies them that Sasuke is somewhere in the building.

Elsewhere, Naruto prepares to go to sleep, musing about how Sasuke has been consumed by vengeance and wonders why Sasuke won't return home now that he has killed
Itachi
 and succeeded in his quest for revenge. His thoughts are then interrupted by the arrival of
Tobi
, who tells Naruto that it is time for the two to converse.
