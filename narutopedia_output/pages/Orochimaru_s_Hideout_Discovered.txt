"
Orochimaru's Hideout Discovered
" (
発見 大蛇丸のアジト
,
Hakken - Orochimaru no Ajito
) is episode 91 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Team 8
, with
Kakashi
 as their temporary leader, head off towards
Orochimaru
's hideout,
Kiba
 recalls his past experience with
Sakon and Ukon
, an encounter which left
Akamaru
 seriously injured.
Hinata
 is able to tell that something is on Kiba's mind and Kiba relays his thoughts to them, although he quickly remarks that if
Shikamaru
 and
Naruto
 were able to take out
two

members
 of the
Akatsuki
, then he should be able to prove himself against one of Orochimaru's underlings.
Shino
 also voices his desire to prove himself on a mission, and Kiba chalks it up to Shino's irritation of not being a member of the
Sasuke Recovery Team
. Shino explains that his disappointment is not just because he was not available to participate in the
Sasuke Recovery Mission
, but also because Naruto did not recognise him when he returned to
Konoha
. Privately, Hinata remarks on how she too wishes to prove herself so that Naruto may finally acknowledge her, while Kakashi reflects on how far the team has matured.

Back at the hideout,
Guren
 tells the survivors of the massacre to stop their slaughter and to follow her if they wish to live. At a spa,
Jiraiya
 is shocked to find out that the bath is not a co-ed one and is stuck there with Naruto. Naruto sees the scar on Jiraiya's chest and recalls when he had wounded the
sannin
 in his
four-tailed form
. Naruto expresses his frustration of how he does not want to use the
Nine-Tails
' power since it hurts those around him and how he wishes to find another way to gain strength. Jiraiya remarks that Naruto sounds like a veteran
shinobi
, and reminds him that he must heal his broken arm first.

The
Orochimaru Search Team
 manage to track an enemy's scent to Orochimaru's hideout, where they find a man asking for help, riddled with Orochimaru's
cursed seal
, before he succumbs to his injuries and dies. After activating her
Byakugan
, Hinata notices chakra signatures of enemies up ahead of them. When they reach them, they are shocked to see various dead or nearly dead prisoners. Before they can get answers, a
timed trap
 is sprung. Though the team manages to evade it, all traces of Orochimaru's hideout, including the bodies, are eliminated.

In their hotel room, Jiraiya attempts to goad Naruto by calling him weak, but is surprised when Naruto simply smiles and takes it in stride. Remembering Naruto's desire to save
Sasuke
 three years ago and how Naruto felt the same way he did when he was unable to prevent Orochimaru's desertion, Jiraiya asks whether Naruto still feels the same way. After realising that Naruto is still adamant on rescuing Sasuke, Jiraiya decides that Naruto should learn a new technique.

After escaping the trap, Shino and Kiba manage to pick up the scent of whomever set the trap. Meanwhile, Guren, along with her twenty-one followers, set off towards Orochimaru, only for sixteen of them to revolt and try to kill her. She easily defeats all sixteen of them with her
Crystal Release: Crystal Pentagonal Prison
 technique. The other five then pledge their loyalty to Guren, and now with her
newfound team
, she sets off. Team 8 manages to track Guren's scent all the way to a meadow, where they are shocked to find people encased in crystal, which then disintegrates, killing the people trapped within. Shino's bugs are encased as well, and Kakashi is stunned to realise that it is none other than
Crystal Release
.

In a clearing, Jiraiya asks Naruto whether he remembers their last training session, which involved toads. Naruto remembers and claims that he does not want to do that again, but Jiraiya claims he is now ready for it. He explains that Naruto would be learning a
Cooperation Ninjutsu
, citing his
Fire Release: Flame Bullet
 and
Gamabunta
's
Toad Oil Bullet
 as an example, as both their moves combined creates the more powerful
Fire Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet
 technique. Naruto tells Jiraiya that he had done something similar to
Yamato
, when the captain had combined his
Water Release: Tearing Torrent
 and Naruto's
Wind Release: Rasengan
 to create the
Typhoon Water Vortex Technique
. Upon realising that Naruto has aided in a cooperation technique before, he claims that Naruto should be able to do the same with a toad, and proceeds to
summon

Gamariki
, a flamboyant toad who dislikes Naruto. Naruto asks Jiraiya why he can't create a cooperation technique with him, and Jiraiya reminds him that he may not always be there, but that he can always summon toads. Jiraiya then demonstrates to Naruto of using a collaboration technique by sending his chakra into Gamariki to power up his
Water Release: Water Gun
. Naruto, impressed by this, is told by Jiraiya that his
Wind Release
 should cause him to create an even more powerful version of that technique. However, he is stumped as both Naruto and Gamariki find themselves unable to work or get along with one another.

Meanwhile, Orochimaru summons Sasuke to his chambers where he announces his desire to test Sasuke's strength, and remarks that he does not detect a flicker of fear from Sasuke. Sasuke confidently tells Orochimaru that he is ready to take him on.
