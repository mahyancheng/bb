The
Six Paths Yang Power
 is a power wielded by
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 and later given to
Naruto Uzumaki
. It is represented by a light-coloured, sun-like palm seal (
掌の印
,
shō no in
)
 on the user's right hand.

Background

Besides being comprised of the
Yang Release

nature transformation
 and having the ability to give life to or heal things, the actual applications of this power aren't clearly understood. It is possible that it augments the user's other abilities.

As noted by
Black Zetsu
, there is a special resonance between the Six Paths Yin and Yang powers, allowing the wielders to
sense
 each other's presence.
 When the
Yin
 and Yang powers are used together, they can
seal
 and transform their target into the core of the
Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei
 technique. When Naruto did so in conjunction with
Sasuke Uchiha
's
Six Paths Yin Power
, the palm seal on his right hand vanished, returning to Hagoromo's own right hand.

Trivia

When
Six Paths Sage Mode
 debuted in the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 manga, Naruto's right palm seamlessly had the Six Paths Yang Power mark. This was removed in the tankōbon version.
