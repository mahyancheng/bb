Lightning Blade Kunai Cutter is a technique developed by Kakashi Hatake. Kakashi
channels
 his lightning chakra into a
kunai
, increasing its piercing power. Then he strikes his opponent several times.

This technique consumes less chakra than
Lightning Cutter
 and can be performed without the aid of
Sharingan
, but is also less effective.
