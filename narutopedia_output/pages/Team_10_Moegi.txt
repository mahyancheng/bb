 Success

With the continued thefts performed by the

Protecting actors (Anime only)

 Success

A joint mission with
Team 7
, the two teams were assigned to protect two Konoha Film Studio actors,
Tomaru
 and
Ashina
, from a death threat. Team 10 was designated to protecting Tomaru, in which they seemingly failed when Tomaru was abducted by the blackmailer. When a ransom for Tomaru's safety — to be delivered by Ashina — was demanded,
Konohamaru
 managed to capture the kidnapper and disguised as him in order to expose Ashina as the mastermind of the fraudulent ploy to revitalise her fame. With Tomaru's safety and Ashina's arrest, the mission was a success.

Retrieve Boruto and Sarada (Anime only)

Rank:
 Unknown

Status:
 Success

When Boruto and Sarada left the village in lockdown to pursuit their escaped team-mate Mitsuki, Team 10 was assigned to bring the two back. Shikamaru decided Team 10 should be the one to do it on account of Konohamaru not being objective after learning of Mitsuki's parentage, and Shikadai knowing Boruto well enough to anticipate his actions.

 Partial Success

A joint mission with
Team Shinki

 Partial Success

Shikadai and Chōchō were assigned to escort

 back to his home country, the

. As a final test to become genin,
Kawaki
 was assigned to work with Team 10 to complete a C-rank mission, after failing to cooperate with other teams to complete D-rank missions. He had also filled in for Inojin, who was working with the
Konoha Barrier Team
 at the time.

The team was ambushed twice by
Jujumaru
 and
Kurobane
,
Anbu
 from the Land of Calm Seas, who were hired by the country's daimyō to prevent
Aosa
's students from delivering medicine. Mozuku sacrificed his life to protect Kawaki and had requested him with his dying breath to ensure his sensei receives the medicine. Shikadai and the assistance of Boruto held back pursuing shinobi while Kawaki delivered the medicine to Aosa.
