"
Eye to Eye: Sharingan vs. Sharingan!
" (
写輪眼VS写輪眼!!
,
Sharingan tai Sharingan!!
) is episode 82 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Kakashi
 and
Itachi
 exchange blows, each being very proficient with the
Sharingan
. Itachi, however, is more so, having access to the
Mangekyō Sharingan
, and quickly attacks Kakashi with his
Tsukuyomi
. With his genjutsu, Itachi tortures Kakashi for what he perceives as seventy-two hours in seconds. As Kakashi struggles to remain standing, he asks Itachi why he has returned to
Konoha
. Itachi replies that they're after
Naruto
. Kakashi remembers a conversation with
Jiraiya
, where Jiraiya tells him that he has been monitoring
Orochimaru
's activities ever since he left the village, and adds that at one point, Orochimaru joined a rogue organisation known as the
Akatsuki
, an organisation Itachi is a part of. Jiraiya also tells Kakashi that due to Naruto possessing the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 inside him, he will have to live the rest of his life watching his back, and therefore he will be taking over Naruto's training. Kakashi elaborates Itachi's words as meaning they want the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox for the Akatsuki. Angered that Kakashi knows of their organisation, Itachi instructs
Kisame
 to kill
Asuma
 and
Kurenai
, but to bring Kakashi with them. Before Kisame can do so,
Might Guy
 arrives, forcing the two with no choice but to flee.

Meanwhile,
Sasuke
 returns to the
Uchiha Clan
's basement and is angered as he remembers
his clan's massacre
. Jiraiya attempts to bring Naruto with him on his search for
Tsunade
; Naruto initially refuses, as he wishes to stay in Konoha so Kakashi can teach him the
Chidori
. Jiraiya tells Naruto that he's prepared to teach Naruto a
jutsu that is stronger than Chidori
, and this convinces Naruto to tag along with Jiraiya.

Trivia

Kakashi did not have his scar at the instant after Might Guy saved him.

When Itachi uses his Mangekyō Sharingan on Kakashi, his eyes do not change; instead, they remain as his three-tomoe regular Sharingan. This is because at the time the original episode aired,
Masashi Kishimoto
 had not yet designed the Mangekyō Sharingan.

In the
Team 7
 photo, Naruto and Sasuke are smiling instead of frowning. Also, Sakura has short hair instead of long hair. This has been correctly changed on
episode 109
.
