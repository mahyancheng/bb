Synopsis

Kakō
 informs
Ōnoki
 their plan is at a standstill, requesting him to return immediately, and asking if he can take
Boruto
 into custody. Ōnoki agrees, not wanting Boruto to alert
Konohagakure
 of his plans. Kakō tries capturing Boruto, but Ōnoki stresses he must not be injured. Boruto attacks with shuriken and a shadow clone. Kakō is delighted to witness human fighting instinct.
Inojin
,
Sarada
, and
Chōchō
 are concerned by Boruto and
Shikadai
's continued absence, and leave to look for them. They find an injured
Akatsuchi
 and inform him of their situation. Boruto continues to fight Kakō, using clones to attack him with wired and electrified kunai, and taijutsu. Kakō destroys his clones with
Dust Release
. Keeping his distance, Boruto throws and explosive tag kunai, its explosion attracting the attention of the Konoha genin. Inojin takes Akatsuchi back to the cave, while Sarada and Chōchō go to the explosion site. Boruto creates more clones to fight Kakō, who finds the feeling exhilarating. Boruto manages to stab Kakō, but it turns out to be a rock clone. Sarada and Chōchō arrive just in time to prevent Kakō from using Dust Release. Kakō is excited to have more opponents.

Kū
 commands the
Akuta
 looking for Shikadai. Shikadai destroys an Akuta when approaching the Tsuchikage's office, but is spotted by another, and manages to make a call to the Hokage's office, where
Shikamaru
 picks up the phone. The two talk, and Shikadai manages to escape before Kū arrives with Akuta. Boruto, Sarada, and Chōchō struggle against Kakō, having to keep their distance to avoid his Dust Release. Boruto notices he had an opportunity to attack them with it and didn't, and wonders about why.
Kirara
 finds
Akkun
 by the cave where the genin are staying, and uses her genjutsu against Inojin when he attempts to seal her. Shikamaru informs
Naruto
,
Kakashi
, and
Tsunade
 of what Shikadai told him. Naruto and Shikamaru want Kakashi and Tsunade, as former
Hokage
, to explain the situation to other villages, while Naruto deals with the
daimyō
, in getting permission to interfere with Iwagakure's affairs. Sarada analysis Kakō while Boruto and Chōchō attack him. She determines that after using Dust Release, there's a window of 20 seconds where Kakō can't use ninjutsu, and uses the opportunity to attack him with
Fire Release
. Kakō tries forcing more Dust Release attacks during the window, and the strain causes his body to begin to break down. Ōnoki watches from afar. Kakō manages to corner Boruto, but the strain of a big Dust Release attack is too much for his body to handle, and he dies. Boruto thanks Sarada and Chōchō for their help. Ōnoki asks why Kakō didn't obey him, and Boruto reiterates that the Fabrications have a will of their own. Inojin arrives and holds Boruto hostage, being under Kirara's genjutsu. She wants to take everyone to Kū.
