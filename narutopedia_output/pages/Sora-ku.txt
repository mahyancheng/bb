Sora-ku.



Sora-ku
 (
空区
,
literally meaning:
 Sky District) is a seemingly abandoned city. The
Uchiha clan
 stored munitions within the city and left
Nekobaa
 in charge. She now lives there with the
ninneko
,
Denka
 and
Hina
.
Sasuke Uchiha
 visits her shortly after he forms
Hebi
 in order to stock up on supplies for their mission to find
Itachi
.

In
Konoha Hiden
, Sora-ku is said to be inhabited by a group of black marketeers who sell any weapons that have been banned everywhere else. Like any community of sufficient size, other services are offered within the city in order to provide basic needs to these black marketeers, though even those businesses tend to deal in their own sorts of rare goods.
