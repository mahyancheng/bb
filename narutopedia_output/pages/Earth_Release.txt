An Earth Release technique.



Earth Release
 (
土遁
,
Doton
,
English TV:
 Earth Style) is one of the five basic
nature transformations
. Earth Release is commonly affiliated with the Snake
hand seal
.

Overview

Earth Release encompasses any earthen material, from dirt to stone to clay, and in fact often entails changing one to another.
 For most Earth Release
jutsu
, users place their hands on the ground and use their
chakra
 to alter its form.
 Less commonly, users create earth within their bodies, which they eject from their mouth.
 Simpler applications of Earth Release involve
changing the terrain
 around the user. Offensively, Earth Release can be
clumped together
 for use as a projectile or
broken up
 to create hazards for enemies. Targets can be trapped by creating a
rock dome
 around them or a
muddy pit
 that they sink into. Defensively, earth can be raised around the user as a fortification against attack,
Earth-Style Wall
 being one of the more common options. Alternatively, Earth Release users can
burrow underground
 in order to escape harm and, indeed, combat.

Earth Release is common among ninja of
Iwagakure
, who make varied applications of it:
Deidara
's
Explosive Clay
 is partly-earth based, meaning it can be countered in the same way as Earth Release;
Ōnoki
, by touching targets, can make them
too heavy
 to move or
so light
 that they can fly;
Akatsuchi
 creates
Rock Golems
 to fight alongside himself and his allies;
Kitsuchi
 uses a mountain's worth of earth to
crush targets
. During the
Third Shinobi World War
,
Obito Uchiha
 was believed to be killed because of an
Iwa-nin
's
cave-in
, a favourite tactic of the village's ninja.

Earth Release is naturally strong against
Water Release
 and weak against
Lightning Release
;
 in
Kakashi Retsuden
, this weakness is explained to be because impurities in the earth naturally conduct electricity. In the same novel, this weakness can be negated if the Earth Release is
changed
 to
glass
, but this is so difficult to do as to be thought impossible. When Earth Release is combined with other natures, certain
kekkei genkai
 are produced: earth and water make
Wood Release
; earth and
fire
 make
Lava Release
; earth and
wind
 are suggested to make
Magnet Release
; earth and lightning are suggested to make
Explosion Release
; earth is suggested to have some role in
Crystal Release
; in
Akatsuki Hiden
, earth and water also make
Mud Release
. The combination of earth, wind, and fire produces the
kekkei tōta
,
Dust Release
.

Trivia

"
Doton-no-jutsu
" is a real-life ninja art, examples of which include curling into a ball and remaining motionless in order to appear like a stone.

According to
Sasuke Retsuden
, Earth Release can be used to make precious gems for use in jewellery. Gems created in this way are typically of poor quality, for which reason this is rarely actually done.
