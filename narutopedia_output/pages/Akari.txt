Years earlier, Akari's village suffered a
plague
 which she and her brother
Kagari
 had survived. They were soon approached by

She guided
Konohamaru Sarutobi
 and
Sai
 to Boro's base when they first arrived. As she was being questioned about Kagari's whereabouts, she began to worry. In the auditorium, Konohamaru held the data file containing her brother's status, leaving her in shock after realising her brother died. She became emotionally scarred prior to acknowledging her brother's demise after the whole area got disintegrated by
