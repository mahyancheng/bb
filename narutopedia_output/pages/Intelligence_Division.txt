The
Intelligence Division
 (
情報部隊
,
Jōhō Butai
,
Viz:
 Intel Unit) of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 was a group of shinobi grouped together because of their skill at information gathering to aid in the war against
Akatsuki
.

History

Almost immediately after this respective division's formation, during a short introduction to one another,
Inoichi Yamanaka
 discusses the difficulties faced by
Aoba Yamashiro
 just prior to his inclusion within this detachment, while an animated
Tenga
 attempts to gain his captain's attention.
 Receiving the necessary confirmation concerning their predetermined routes, a significant contingent of the Intelligence Division mobilises alongside the majority of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, as Inoichi remains behind in order to complete the construction of a substantial
detection barrier
 assisted by
Ao
 of the
Sensor Division
.

Establishing multiple secure lines of communication to those on the field, through the utilisation of various
Chakra Transmission Communication Devices
, Inoichi notifies the
Second Division
 of the approaching threat of the
White Zetsu Army
, thanks to details retrieved from
Muta Aburame
's final report.
 Informed of
Shikaku Nara
's revised strategy that better reflects the confrontations current developments, after the emergence of two distinct groups of fierce opposition, Inoichi relays the revised battle strategy to the other divisions.
 This imperative tactical communication is received by the field ninja.

By the time of the revival of the
Ten-Tails
, the Alliance's HQ was attacked by a
Tailed Beast Ball
 in an attempt to destroy the "head" of the Alliance. With the attack, the central communication device is presumably destroyed as well.
