Naruto
 manga.

Summary

The
Fourth Raikage
 tells
Minato
 to save his nonsense, and runs in to attack. Minato
moves
 to stab
B
, but B too has a blade pointing at Minato. Minato states that he's taken a liking to B. In the present,
Naruto
 moves to attack the Raikage, but misses. B and A trade blows, and B attempts to use the
Lightning Release: Lariat
 against his brother, who claims that B's Lightning Release: Lariat is inferior to his own. The Raikage calls for
Tsunade
's aid, but instead, she moves to stand in front of Naruto and B, remembering Naruto's promise that he wouldn't die until he became the Hokage, arguing that were Naruto to die, the next
jinchūriki
 wouldn't be able to control the
Nine-Tails
 as well as Naruto can. The Raikage asks what guarantee they have that Naruto will succeed. B again tries his Lightning Release: Lariat against the Raikage. The brothers recall the time the
Third Raikage
 passed away, when A told B that he didn't need to use the Lightning Release: Lariat anymore, that he should focus solely on improving his
Tailed Beast Ball
 and that he was forbidden to leave the
village
. Again, A and B clash with their Lightning Release: Lariat, with B's proving the strongest, much to A's dismay. B proceeds to tell him that his and Naruto's power doesn't come from being jinchūriki, and that his brother's words long ago gave him the strength to surpass him.

Trivia

In the first panel, B is drawn with
Samehada
 instead of his
typical sword
.
