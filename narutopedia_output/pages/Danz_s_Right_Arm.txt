"
Danzō's Right Arm
" (
ダンゾウの右腕
,
Danzō no Migiude
) is episode 209 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Kakashi
 asks
Sai
's
ink clone
 to direct him to where
Sakura
 is in order to prevent her from trying to kill
Sasuke
, since she is not strong enough to fight him.
Naruto
, overwhelmed with everything he had just heard, hyperventilates and passes out.

On the
Samurai Bridge
,
Danzō
 removes the bandages on his right arm to reveal ten
Sharingan
 eyes embedded on it. Sasuke demands to know how he obtained those, but remarks that whatever response Danzō gives would simply infuriate him further and that it does not matter since he would kill Danzō regardless. Danzō rushes forward in a burst of speed to attack Sasuke, but the attack is blocked by the latter's
Susanoo
. Trapped within the Susanoo's grip, Sasuke asks whether Danzō had really ordered
Itachi
 to
slaughter
 his own
clan
. When Danzō remarks that he never pegged Itachi as the type to divulge secrets before dying, Sasuke accepts it as acknowledgement and
crushes
 Danzō, seemingly killing him.

However, Danzō
reappears
 right behind Sasuke, and attempts to stab him with a
kunai
, only for the Susanoo to shield him once more. As Danzō jumps high into the air, Sasuke ascends into the Susanoo's head and incinerates Danzō with his
Amaterasu
. Despite being burned to ashes, Danzō appears unscathed in front of Sasuke, although
Karin
 notices that every time Danzō survives what seems like a fatal injury, a Sharingan eye on his arm seals itself shut.

Danzō uses his
Wind Release: Vacuum Sphere
 to fire wind bullets at Sasuke. Sasuke's flesh is slightly pierced as he moves to evade being mortally wounded by the attack, although he ends up falling off the bridge. Using the blood from his wound, Sasuke
summons

Garuda
, a giant
hawk
, to prevent his fall. Danzō infuses his
Wind Release
 with his
shuriken
 to create lethan
fan blades
, and fires the projectiles towards Sasuke. Using his
Mangekyō Sharingan
, Sasuke is able to evade the smaller shuriken while using his
sword
 to catch one of the
Fūma Shuriken
 and repel the second one into the sky, where it is caught by Garuda. Sasuke then lunges towards Danzō, but Danzō manages to clutch his throat. At that moment, Garuda swoops in and uses the spinning shuriken to slice off Danzō's Sharingan-embedded arm, allowing Sasuke to stab him.

While the battle seems momentarily won, Danzō and his severed arm fade out of existence and rematerialise on top of a pillar. Sasuke then glares at him as he induces a
genjutsu
, splitting his body into a mob of crows that reemerges next to Danzō, taking on the form of Itachi.
