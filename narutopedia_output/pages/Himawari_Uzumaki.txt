Himawari Uzumaki
 (
うずまきヒマワリ
,
Uzumaki Himawari
) is a citizen of
Konohagakure
, a member of the
Uzumaki clan
, as well as a direct descendant of the
Hyūga clan
. Sometime after its
demise
,
Kurama
 was reborn inside Himawari, making her the fourth and most recent
jinchūriki
 of the demon fox.

Background






Himawari as a toddler.



Himawari is the second and youngest child of
Naruto
 and
Hinata Uzumaki
, born two years after her brother,
Boruto
. On the day that Naruto was to be inaugurated as the Seventh
Hokage
, Himawari wanted to bring her panda toy to the ceremony, but Boruto, fearing that he would end up carrying it, tried to take it away from her. When the toy's head was ripped off in the ensuing tug-of-war, Himawari awoke her
Byakugan
 and attacked Boruto in her anger, despite his vehement apologies. Naruto, sensing her
killing intent
, arrived and shielded Boruto, though he was knocked out in the process. Fearful of what an attack that could defeat his father would do to him, Boruto tried to run from Himawari, but she quickly located her brother hiding in a closet. From then on, he vowed to never anger her again.

Personality

Himawari is a cheerful and considerate girl. This also extends to strangers, such as when she gave up her much-desired
Kurama
 toy to a boy, believing that he needed it more than her. Likewise, she shows a strong affinity towards animals, able to approach most wild beasts calmly and with acceptance from them. She is also considerate about the future. While many expect her to become a shinobi due to her lineage, she has decided to experience various career paths to determine her own goals.

Himawari has also picked up her father's trait of referring to others with nicknames, such as when she referred to
Orochimaru
 as "Oro-chan".
 She is also a rather educated girl; despite not being in the Academy yet, Himawari has strong understanding of chakra manipulation and its applications to advanced techniques like the
Shadow Clone Technique
.
 She is also likewise very astute to other people's nature, able to notice changes in their attitude.

Himawari is very mature and responsible for her age, often helping her mother with chores. At the same time, Himawari has a temper; she can become very violent when provoked. When her favourite plush was accidentally damaged by Boruto, she assaulted him. She usually has no memory of these outbursts. This display of aggression made her elder brother run away and hide from her and vow never to anger her again.
 The same event also caused her father and
Kurama
 to be terrified of her.
 As mentioned by
Iruka Umino
, Himawari possesses the same stubbornness that her father and brother possess, while also being somewhat boisterous and hyperactive, mainly when she's determined in achieving a certain goal. Himawari also shows signs of her father's
nindō
 of never giving up at the face of difficulty, urging
Ehō Norimaki
 to continue their Academy trial session despite them being trapped in a well. However, contrary to Boruto she is also shown to display the same traits of patience and humbleness of her
grandfather
 by continually being understanding of Naruto's circumstances for not being present for events such as her birthday. Himawari is very brave and loyal to her friends, able to remain calm under dangerous situations and push herself to help others. She is also very forgiving, able to acknowledge peoples' change when they make the effort to do the right thing.

She is shown to adore her family, hoping to make her late cousin
Neji
 happy by bringing flowers to his grave. When her mother was injured during
Momoshiki
's attack, Himawari stayed by her bedside as she was healed by Sakura. She is mostly understanding of her often-absent father and his Hokage duties, but yearns for him to be home at times.
 Quite possibly, her closest relationship is to her older brother, always hoping to play with him whenever possible.

Himawari is also quite intrusive, as when
Kawaki
 enrolled at the
Academy
 in a secret mission to protect
Kae Yukiwari
, Himawari continually questioned Kawaki attempting to grow closer to her, pouting whenever Kawaki blew her off to keep his mission a secret. When Kawaki and Naruto discussed the mission at home, Himawari eavesdropped on them, and subsequently offered to help Kawaki appear more friendly in an attempt to befriend Kae, teaching about proper etiquette and mannerisms of "friendship", all of which made Kawaki uncomfortable due to his personality clashing with Himawari's advice.

Three years after Boruto left Konoha, Himawari showed a noticeable new maturity to her nature. While having essentially become an orphan, Himawari resolved to grow stronger to help those she cared for, training regularly with her friends. Likewise, her loyalty to them remains unshaken, willing to sacrifice herself for their wellbeing. She is also shown able to quickly adjust to surreal changes as they occur, including the sudden emergence of Kurama in her life.

1/5

Himawari bears a striking resemblance to her mother, having her dark-blue hair that she wears with straight bangs and a himecut. Like her brother, her hair flares out on the sides and back, and she has an
ahoge
 (
アホ毛
,
literally meaning:
 foolish hair) on the top of her head, which resembles the stem of a leaf. She has inherited her father's blue eyes, whisker markings on each cheek, unruly hair, and facial features.
 She is considered very cute.

As a toddler, Himawari wore a pink sweater, a three-layered white flutter skirt, black pants, and a pair of flat pink sandals, with a light green twin bead hairband on her
Ahoge
. While visiting
Neji Hyūga
's grave, she wore a collared, long-sleeved yellow shirt with an orange cross-hatch pattern that resembled a sunflower, red pumpkin shorts, and yellow shinobi sandals. In
Boruto: Naruto the Movie
, she wears a light yellow long-sleeved hooded-sweater with a blue shirt underneath that has a petal-like pattern, and a two-layered pink flutter skirt. She also wears long, black open-toed stockings and fuchsia shinobi sandals. Later, when joining the Academy, Himawari wears a black long-sleeved, turtleneck shirt with a yellow jacket and grey shorts with black leggings.

Three years after Boruto's departure from Konoha, Himawari grew noticeably taller, almost reaching her brother's classmates' height. Her hair grew to mid-back, with bangs framing the sides of her face and reaching slightly past her shoulders. She wore a dark short shirt under a yellow cap-sleeved crop top with a sunflower design on the lower left side, exposing her midriff. Himawari also wore blue baggy pants with a long, pink belt that the end hangs loosely at her knee, two bracelets of blue and purple on both wrists, grey shinobi sandals with white soles, and a black choker around her neck with a yellow sunflower design hanging to the left side.

Abilities

Well before training as a ninja, similar to her big brother, Himawari showed to have inherited her
paternal grandfather's
 considerable potential and prodigious talent. Even more, her untrained might could terrify her brother and knock out her
father
 with a
single blow
 as a very young child. Since entering the Academy, she quickly became a standout among her fellow students for her performance. Following her new status as a
jinchūriki
, her potential might excited
Daemon
, whose might exceeds the full-powered
Code
. While accessing her new power, she briefly overwhelmed
Jura
, the leader and strongest of the Human God Trees, forcing him to use actual effort for the first time in his life to defeat her.

Byakugan






Himawari's Byakugan.



At a very young age, from her Hyūga heritage, Himawari awakened the
Byakugan
 in anger when her favourite toy was torn.
 Hiashi noted how impressive it was, especially with no prior training.
 When activated, her normally blue eyes take on the white and featureless appearance of the Byakugan with the veins on her temples bulging. With it, she possesses a near 360° field of x-ray vision (except for a small blind spot at the upper thoracic vertebrae). She can also see through solid surfaces, across great distances, and clearly perceive the
chakra pathway system
 and locate the
tenketsu
. Without prior training, she could quickly make effective use of it. At the same time, she has originally had no conscious control over her Byakugan's activation, only activating involuntarily from moments of extreme emotional build-up. By age 10, she learned to access it at will,
 though struggles to maintain it for long periods.

Ninjutsu

She has considerable
shurikenjutsu
 skill, having practised regularly with her brother, able to easily hit the bullseye. Since entering the Academy, she has become proficient in various basic skills like the
Rope Escape Technique
.
 Later, Himawari learned to
manipulate
 her hair as tendrils to grab and attack with.

Physical and Chakra Prowess






Himawari knocks out her father.



As a descendant of the Uzumaki, Himawari inherited a powerful life-force and chakra. Also descending from the Hyūga Clan, she has very advanced chakra control. With no prior training, she could perform
Tree Climbing Practice
 on her first try and only failed from losing focus.
 Himawari has deceptive raw might, able to launch large amounts of scrap metal with a single strike and jump a considerable distance into the air. She likewise could move too fast for Boruto to follow.
 Naturally, Himawari has remarkable agility and athleticism, easily completing an Academy training course and beating other children who already had trained rigorously. From a young age, she’s shown an innate talent for the
Gentle Fist
, able to knock out a grown man in a single blow for an entire day, while also shutting down all of their tenketsu. She has since underwent extensive training in. Since joining the Academy, her skills in both conventional
taijutsu
 and the Gentle Fist have also enabled her to compete against much bigger and more experienced opponents, even overpower them at points.

Jinchūriki Transformations

Main article:
Jinchūriki Forms






Himawari's initial jinchūriki form.



Sometime after
Kurama
's
demise
, the tailed beast resurrected in Himawari, making the girl a
jinchūriki
 herself. This was first noticed by
Daemon
, feeling an intensity coming from her as a result of the synergy created from her two
strong

bloodlines
 with Kurama’s chakra.
 Three years after Boruto's departure from Konohagakure, Kurama's resurrection matured enough to talk with Himawari within her subconscious at will.
 It is surmised that the lingering kernels of Kurama's chakra were drawn to Himawari due to her mixed heritage, or having already inherited some of Kurama's chakra at birth as its previous jinchūriki's child.
 While gaining access to the same powers and immense chakra reserves Naruto had before her,
 Himawari's compatibility with the tailed beast greatly exceeds any of her predecessors, allowing her to draw on even greater power.
 While originally only able to access it in moments of greater anger, Himawari quickly adjusted and learned to tap into Kurama's
power
. Likewise, she quickly learned how to communicate at will with Kurama within her mental realm.






Himawari using a Tailed Beast Ball.



When accessing this power, her irises turn red with vertical slitted pupils, gains dark rings around her eyes, plus her nails and canine teeth grow longer and sharp. Her hair grows longer and thicker, flowing in nine locks akin to tails, and her whisker-like marks thicken. While new to it, she shows remarkable efficiency, Jura noting that her potency is more like a true Tailed Beast rather than a jinchūriki, able to perfectly unleash a
Tailed Beast Ball
 powerful enough to match a Tailed Beast Ball created from
Jura
.
 Her physical parameters grow tremendously, able to effortlessly break from a
Wood Release
 binding and strike with great force, launching targets with great distances. She likewise has strong regeneration, able to heal from the most maiming of injuries with no lingering signs in seconds.
 Due to her unique compatibility with Kurama, she can also
heal
 others just as seamlessly. At the same time, too many repeated healings on herself apparently quickly depletes her stamina, able to pass out from it.
 With Kurama's genuine partnership to Himawari, she can access the power with no ill effects to her health or mentality. This can also grant her immunity to
genjutsu
.

New Era: Part I

Academy Entrance Arc

Main article:
Academy Entrance Arc

In the anime, on the day before the entrance ceremony for Boruto to attend the
Academy
, Hinata tells her children again about how her time in the Academy with Naruto was, which Himawari enjoyed. Later, when Boruto returned home, Himawari asked him to play with her. As he politely declined as he had homework, remembering Himawari's Byakugan, Boruto asked Hinata about the
dōjutsu
, hoping to figure out more about what has been happening with him. Soon afterwards, Naruto returned home, too tired from work to join his family for dinner, much to Himawari's disappointment.






Himawari meeting her aunt and grandfather.



Later, as Boruto began acting weird, portraying himself like a flashy movie hero, Himawari grew concerned for her brother. Once her family confronted him about this, he said he finally awakened his Byakugan, shocking everyone. As Naruto remembered how Himawari was able to manifest her Byakugan with no prior training, he considered it possible, deciding to take both his kids to
Hiashi Hyūga
 for better answers. Upon arriving at their grandfather's home, the aging Hyūga head quickly began doting over his grandkids, which Himawari quickly returned the similar feelings. Himawari then began to play with her aunt
Hanabi
 while Hiashi talked with Boruto. After discussing Boruto's allegation of manifesting his Byakugan, it was decided to test the theory with a duel against Hanabi. Himawari watched in dismay at Boruto was soundly defeated by their aunt, which left everyone to conclude that Boruto did not gain the Byakugan. Afterwards, it was decided for Himawari and her family to spend the night over in the Hyūga house. The following day, after Boruto came to terms with not having the Byakugan, he reverted to his normal personality, shocking Himawari again.

Later, Himawari helped her mother make a big feast to welcome Boruto's friend and classmate
Mitsuki
. Much to her joy, Naruto was also joining them for dinner as he finished work early. Himawari runs towards her father and embraces him as she blissfully talks about how she helped Hinata make dinner and then sits with her family at the dining table. However, as dinner was about to begin, learning from one of his dispersed clones, Naruto left to investigate a strange release of chakra spreading throughout the village, leaving both Boruto and Himawari disappointed. Despite this, Himawari seemed to understand along with her mother while Boruto showed great displeasure with Naruto.

When he returned however, having been caught up in stopping a would-be coup d'état, he forgot his promise completely, leaving Himawari sad. As Himawari became very withdrawn, Hinata finally broke her silence and reminded Boruto of his promise. Ashamed of this, Boruto insisted that he had to get the present from one of his friends, much to her joy. He later returned with a Kiri box of sweets, but having got in contact with his friend
Kagura Karatachi
, who apologised for his own actions, encouraged Boruto to come clean. He then gave Himawari both the box and an apology, admitting to his mistakes, which Himawari happily accepted.

 doll released for the day and a sleep-deprived Naruto agreed once learning about the limited edition nature of the toy. The two headed out and find a giant crowd waiting outside the toy store before its opening who were all also looking to buy the doll. Naruto and Himawari met
Kiba Inuzuka
 and his two dogs,
Akamaru
 and
Akemaru
, who was also looking for the doll to buy for his girlfriend
Tamaki

Shukaku
 doll by mistake).

Naruto gave chase to the culprit only to learn he was a father who wanted to gift the doll to his son, who he doesn't get to see very often. Himawari chose to give the toy to the young boy, instead appreciating both the other gifts her father had got for her as well as the time they shared together.

Later on, they met up with Boruto and his teammates in the village and Himawari excitedly told him that they had to hurry home for her birthday. On the night, Naruto was unable to make it home to celebrate and sent a shadow clone instead, which ended up disappearing and dropping her birthday cake. This angered Boruto, who had already warned Naruto to not miss the event, although Himawari was less upset than her brother.

When Boruto came home, after successfully passing the second round of the
Chūnin Exams
, Himawari excitedly congratulated him. She later attended the last round of the Chūnin Exams with her mother to watch Boruto's fight with
Shikadai
. She cheered for him when Boruto won the fight, but he ended up being disqualified for cheating.

In the anime, Himawari was excited about going on a camping trip with her family. Later however, she was upset to hear that Boruto was going on a training mission with Team 7 (unaware that Boruto was really going to find Sasuke to train with him).

Later, when Boruto returned with
Shukaku
 sealed in a tea kettle, Himawari immediately took a liking the miniaturised
tailed beast
, treating him as a talking Shukaku toy and kept it close to her when it was decided that Naruto would watch over the tanuki. While Shukaku found her attachment annoying, it was intrigued to learn that she once knocked out Kurama. Hoping to learn how she did as a chance to have some mocking rights on the fox, Shukaku decided to play nice with Himawari. Ultimately however, when learning that Himawari had no knowledge of the incident, Shukaku quickly turned cold again and told her to leave it alone, much to her sadness.






Himawari saving Shukaku from being crushed.



When later returning to look for it, she and Boruto were horrified to discover that it was mistaken for trash and sent to the scrapyard. When they grew desperate to save the tanuki before it get crushed by the machinery, Himawari's despair activated her Byakugan again and quickly saved Shukaku.

Himawari breezing through her ninja trial class.



In the anime, Himawari was offered a one-day trial session at the Ninja Academy. There, she met
Yuina Itomaki
 and
Ehō Norimaki
 as her practice team-mates. While amazing her fellow trainees with her natural talent for ninja skills, they were shocked to learn that the Hokage's daughter wasn't sure about becoming a shinobi. Ehō was especially annoyed at this, feeling that she was treating shinobi life as a game. This put a strain on the practice team when they were given a mission to retrieve a missing pet cat. When Ehō scolded Himawari for thinking of giving up so easily as things got difficult, she was left behind to pout.

She was approached by Principal
Iruka Umino
. As she admitted to feeling guilty for not taking the trial seriously like her team-mates, Iruka insisted that there is no rush to find a career path at her age, but rather this trial was merely meant to give children motivation on looking towards the future. Himawari resolved herself to complete the mission, earning praise from Iruka for her gutsiness akin to her father.






Himawari settling her decision to experience many jobs in order to find her career path.



She found her team-mates had fallen into a well with the cat. While Ehō considered quitting rather than accepting Himawari's help, she scolded him, insisting to never give up. Working in unison with each other, the three were able to climb out with the cat to complete the mission. Later that night, Himawari voiced her new desire to experience all the various jobs in the village to find her path, and teasingly asked her brother for assistance. Himawari, Yuina and Ehō kept up their friendship and their training of shinobi skills.

Naruto soon arrived, equally concerned about his son. Upon seeing that he was stabilised, Naruto assured his daughter that Boruto was going to fine, much to her relief.

After Boruto was released from the hospital and began training under
Kakashi Hatake
 to grow stronger, Himawari was still concerned for her brother. Hinata however insisted that Boruto was a true ninja and desired to be of true aid to others. At her mother's suggestion, Himawari helped cheer Boruto on by helping her mother make a bento for him and deliver it to him, leaving a note to remind him that he was not alone.

Kawaki Arc






Himawari crying over the broken vase.



When
Boruto's team
 returned from their mission with a mysterious boy of unique
abilities
, rather than lock him up, Naruto, sympathising as a former man-made potential weapon, decided to treat the boy as guest to the village and let him live at his home. During which the rebellious boy's unfriendly attitude made Himawari keep her distance. As the boy kept seeing everyone as his enemy, he soon made his move to escape, only to be stopped by Naruto's brief show of
power
. When Boruto returned, Himawari greeted her brother, only to see to her sorrow that the guest's actions destroyed her personal vase, which she made as a gift to Hinata. As Himawari began cleaning up the broken pieces, the boy gruffly apologised for his unintentional action, introducing himself as
Kawaki
. The next day, Hinata helped her dispose of the broken vase, assuring her the care she put into making it for Hinata is what mattered most. During a meal, she teased her brother over his noticing of their father staying home with them all day long.






Himawari explains the unison sign to Kawaki.



Later, Naruto offered to do some sparing with Boruto. Boruto claimed to only do so because his father wanted, but Himawari teased him about being excited. She watched the match alongside Kawaki, who was fascinated by the shadow clones. After Himawari explained their nature, Kawaki insisted that Boruto try using his Kāma, as understanding its power would be the first step to removing it. Knowing that Boruto still couldn't activate it at will, Kawaki activated his own so Boruto's would respond in kind. Naruto approved of his son using it and quickly showed a considerable improvement in performance. Afterwards, despite Boruto still losing, Naruto applauded his son on his recent growth. Kawaki was curious at how the father and son showed their respect with the
Seal of Reconciliation
, which Himawari also explained.






Himawari grabbed by Delta.



Later, as Kawaki struggled to repair Himawari's vase, she happily said buying a new one was enough. Boruto then came and accepted Kawaki's offer of learning what he knows about their Kāma. As Himawari watched alongside her father the two boy's sparring match, while Boruto quickly activated his mark, he failed to make actual usage of it as his attempt to absorb Kawaki's blast burnt his hand. After Naruto cancelled the match he was alerted of an intruder. Naruto told Boruto to take Himawari away while he stayed with Kawaki, certain that the intruder was after Kawaki. His assumption proved correct as they were quickly met by
Delta
, who demanded Kawaki be handed over to her. Before engaging her in battle, Naruto instructed Boruto to protect Himawari, and the two watched as the battle escalated. When Delta later used her as bait to get Naruto hit by her laser eyes, her father and Kawaki later intervened and saved her. Himawari watched the fight until her father defeated Delta after overcoming her ability to absorb chakra, and celebrated his victory.






Himawari and Kawaki caring for Jaggy.



Later, Himawari left with Hinata to shop for dinner just before
Jigen
, leader of
Kara
, arrived at their home. He was able to critically injure Naruto and Sasuke in an attempt to reclaim Kawaki. After the failed attempt, Himawari and her family were relieved when Naruto made a quick recovery. In the anime, following Kawaki's release from the hospital, she found a lone and injured white wolf she named "
Jaggy
". She spent the next week trying to care for it by bringing it food. Her secret was eventually discovered by Kawaki, who agreed to keep quiet. Ultimately however, Jaggy was killed by a bear. Saddened, she insisted that if the wolf was aided by its former pack, Jaggy would have lived. Kawaki aided her burying the wolf. Unaware of it, Himawari's words aided Kawaki in reconsidering his decision to leave the village.

Isshiki
's attack, Naruto hosted a new Chūnin Exam. Himawari noticed that Boruto was happy with himself for passing the first written exam, judging from him buying Kawaki some taiyaki. She told Kawaki that her mother disapproves of them snacking before dinner.

The day of the finals, while practising, Ehō noticed a group of suspicious men, and tracked them along Yuina to the train station, while Himawari went to get Boruto and Mitsuki for help. They witnessed the men kidnapping
Amado

In the anime, while still unsure of her career path, Himawari decided to enrol in the Ninja Academy to figure out more about herself and meet new people. There, she was delighted to end up in the same class as Ehō and Yuina. She quickly became popular in her class, both from who her parents are and showing her talent during training. She was surprised to see Kawaki in her class, and noticed a change in his behaviour, including an apparent interest in
Kae Yukiwari
, a princess who was an exchange student. She offered him advice on how to befriend her, and later, while spying on her father and Kawaki, discovered that his presence in the Academy was for a secret mission to protect Kae.

The next day, Himawari revealed to Kawaki her knowledge of his mission, and promised not to tell anyone. She offered to help him, but he refused. When Kawaki had to attend Kae's tea party for his mission, Himawari insisted on teaching him proper party etiquette. During the party, Himawari occasionally covered up Kawaki's social awkwardness, and bonded with Kae over having leaders for fathers. When Kae's cake was served, Kawaki caused a commotion to stop her from eating it, knocking over the tables. After excusing himself, Himawari followed him, and discovered his actions were due to the mission. Realising what Kawaki smelled in the cake was just mustard instead of poison, they deduced
Osuka Kamakura
 was behind it, but Himawari wanted proof before confronting her about it. They questioned
Batora
 about where the cake was stored, and noticing a narrow open window, Kawaki asked Himawari to get to Kae before he returned. Himawari revealed that someone had put mustard in the cake, and Kawaki arrived, having heard a full confession from
Neon Asakusa
, which implicated Osuka. Kae scolded her for abusing Neon, and everyone was pleased by her genuine self. The party resumed, everyone eating the taiyaki Kawaki brought. After the party, Himawari got Kawaki to admit she helped his mission, and he agreed to continue letting her assist him despite his reservations due to not wanting to put Himawari in danger.






Academy students are afraid of a scary picture.



When Team 7 taught her class as special instructors, an exercise of theirs caused a dispute that divided the class, which she warned Boruto about. After their homeroom teacher sorted it out, the class attended her cherry blossom viewing party and picnic. Days later, Himawari was part of a group of students who wanted to investigate the Academy at night to learn about the Seven Mysteries associated with it. Himawari plotted their route, and was one of the few students not to abandon it until the end. While she believed the mysteries were real at first, at one point she activated her Byakugan and discovered that Kawaki and Batora were behind them, though she kept quiet about it, glad for Kae's enjoyment of it. Kawaki later deduced her knowledge of his involvement. During a practical lesson, she was placed in a team with Kae and Sōsha, both she and Sōsha picking Kae for leader. Himawari looked after Kae during the lesson for Kawaki, and only lost track of her when
Konashi
 asked to meet Kae away from everyone to ask for her advice. Himawari found her, but the two were attacked by a flame bear. Hana distracted the bear, allowing them to escape, and Himawari informed Kawaki of the development. Himawari's team ended up having the best performance at the end of the day. She was sad that she couldn't help Kawaki, but he pointed out she did protect Kae.






Himawari fighting a kidnapper.



While making an effort to befriend Osuka, both of them were kidnapped by
Oppo
 and
Teru
 under
Aniki
's orders. While they only wanted to ransom Osuka to her celebrity parents, Aniki thought they could make a nice profit selling Himawari to enemies of the Seventh Hokage. Himawari remained calm throughout it all, and later listed as Osuka thought her mother wouldn't pay her ransom. She listed to Oppo and Teru's circumstances, and assured them that they wouldn't face capital punishment if they apologised. After they fell asleep, Himawari convinced Osuka to attempt an escape. Osuka tied their legs, while Himawari tried to fight off Aniki. He began choking her, but Kawaki arrived in time to save her, and defeated Aniki. After their arrest, Himawari checked in on Oppo and Teru, stressing that their concern for her was a positive change in their nature, and they promised her to have a fresh start after their sentence. She witnessed Hibari and Osuka's reconciliation, after which Osuka apologised for her attitude and Hibari invited everyone for pudding.






Himawari potraying as Minato at the play.



When her class had to put on a play about the
Sannin
, Himawari was cast as her grandfather, the
Fourth Hokage
. To better sell their performance, Osuka told everyone to bring a prop forehead protector. When Himawari forgot hers, Kawaki offered her his real one, only for her to warn him that it could expose him as a real shinobi. They were spotted by Eiki. Later, Sōsha asked her and Kawaki about the rumour he was a shinobi, but they dodged the question and went to check on the stage. During a rehearsal, Eiki's struggle to get Kawaki's forehead protector as proof ended up damaging the set. Himawari convinced Kawaki to reach out to Eiki, and everyone worked together to repair it. Later, Himawari stayed behind to help Kawaki find his missing protector, only for Osuka to return it. After she left, Eiki approached them to apologise again, and showed them the anonymous note he received telling him Kawaki was a shinobi. They wonder who could have left the note, and realised someone wanted Kawaki away from Kae. The day of the festival, Himawari asked Kawaki about him checking on Kae, but he claimed he was mistaken. When everyone had to stay put to deal with a terrorist threat, Kawaki asked Himawari to keep an eye on Kae while he went to help Eiki disarm an explosive tag circuit. Several smoke bombs went off, but Himawari activated her Byakugan, managing to push the
assassin
 away from Kae. She took her outside, but the assassin followed them. Kawaki arrived in time to save them.






Batora divulges his investigation.



Following the terrorist attack, Himawari visited Hana, who was injured, in the hospital. She was interviews by the police, and later convinced Kawaki to keep protecting Kae despite being dismissed from his mission. Asking Eiki for help, they determined where the assassin might have been during the festival, and checked on Sōsha's photos to look for anyone suspicious. She pointed out Batora to Kawaki, who claimed wouldn't be able to attend. Rushing to Kae's mansion, they arrived in time to protect Kae from the assassin, who had injured Batora. She stayed with Kae and Batora while Kawaki fought the assassin, who ended up
committing suicide
. Batora explained that he was investigating the
mastermind
 behind the assassination plot. The following day, Himawari apologised to Eiki for leaving him behind. Later, with the mission to protect Kae officially over, Himawari expected Kawaki to no longer be going to the Academy with her. To her joy, Kawaki still decided to attend. During which, Himawari joined her class in welcoming back Hana to teach. Later, Himawari noticed how concerned Kawaki still was. He noted that the assassin gave up too easily, even prepared early for it. They decided to investigate more, asking Kae to hang out at her mansion to look for clues.






Himawari and Kawaki facing Hana.



Hana arranged for her class to undergo survival training on an uninhabited island. However, upon arriving, their food supplies went missing, and Kikuchiyo was injured by a trap, lending credence to rumours of killer missing-nin on the island. Himawari joined Osuka and Neon in looking for food. When they heard something rustling in the trees, they had Neon check it with her drone, but it got damaged. They informed everyone about it, so everyone searched to recover the drone. At night, Kawaki shared his suspicious of Kae still being targeted, and asked Himawari about the damage to the drone. Himawari thought the drone was too damaged for the height from which it fell, and its blades seemed to be cleanly cut. She suggested checking the recorded footage, so they asked Neon about it. Having watched it, Kawaki pulled her aside, and pointed out the flower petals on the corner of the screen, which implicated Hana. They rushed to her and Kae, who were looking for a flower arrangement Kae made, which Himawari found discarded and destroyed. Exposed, Hana ran off with Kae, Himawari certain it must be an impostor. Hana taunted them that the students' only value to her was as a cover for her mission. Taking Kae to a bridge, Hana seemingly stabbed her, shocking Himawari and Kawaki.






Himawari using her Byakugan to try and locate Hana.



Hana burned the bridge, separating them. When the rest of the class arrived, Kawaki informing them of Hana's actions. Himawari questioned why bother killing Kae in front of witnesses, and realised she might be alive as a hostage. She attempted to locate them with her Byakugan, but was too exhausted from the fight. The class was able to cooperate and get close enough to where Hana might have hidden Kae. Kawaki revealed himself a shinobi, telling everyone to stay back, but Himawari reminded him she was his partner. She and Kawaki arrived just in time to protect Kae from an attack by Hana. Hana explained the nature of her dual personality, and attacked them with her
Fire Release
. Himawari was concerned that properly fighting back would hurt Hana, but Kawaki stressed they couldn't hold back in saving themselves and Kae. Kawaki feigned behind hit with Himawari used a shadow clone, and landed a hit on Hana, setting her up for a Gentle Fist attack by Himawari, though Hana dodged it. Hana created a
paper barrier
 to obscure herself and her attacks, but Kawaki reminded her that she could see through it with her Byakugan, encouraging her. Kawaki protected her from Hana's attacks as she locked into her position, and opening a hole in the barrier though which Kawaki could attack, defeating Hana. While Hana was confident she stalled enough for her allies to arrive, Sai arrived with the class instead, informing her of their arrest by Anbu. Himawari joined the class in calling for Teacher Hana to overpower the exhausted Assassin Hana, succeeding. With Kae needing to return home, the class performed the Sannin play, and later saw Kae off at the train station. Later Himawari's parents noted how engrossed she was in the Academy, despite her still not being sure if she wanted to be a shinobi.

Himawari and her family welcome Kawaki with a feast.



Himawari celebrated a proper welcome dinner party for Kawaki with her family. Upon noticing that her fixed vase still stood in the middle of the dining table, Kawaki suggested that she use the new one bought for her. Instead, Himawari noted that she chose to keep the vase as it has become more precious to her. After Kawaki tried out the
forehead protector
 that Boruto loaned him, Himawari said that it looked good on Kawaki and if he did not feel convinced, he could also place it around his neck.

When she learned that Boruto and Kawaki had ventured outside the village and were fighting an enemy, Himawari was concerned about them, and was assured by her father he'd get them home. Hinata attempted to join them, but Naruto stressed that if something happened, she needed to be there to take care of Himawari.

Omnipotence Arc

When Boruto was called in for his first mission in a long time, Himawari watched their mother concerned about him not coming back this time, despite him trying to assuage her fears. After he left, Himawari said she could help Boruto if she became a shinobi, and asked if it would make her worry more instead.

After buying bread and tea for her mother, Himawari was approached by
Daemon
, who felt an intensity coming from her, sparking an interest to fight her. When Boruto caught up to them and pulled him off of her, he explained Himawari wasn't a shinobi and didn't know how to fight, confusing him a bit. Boruto disapproved when he thought Daemon's interest in her was a crush. Himawari later arrived home, only to find it being investigated. Noticing the broken picture frame, she became worried over her parents' sudden disappearance. Later, like most of the world, Himawari's memories of Boruto and Kawaki were
swapped
.

New Era: Part II

In the following years, with Naruto and Hinata believed to have been
killed
 by Boruto, he became a missing-nin. At the same time, as Himawari continued to believe Kawaki was her natural brother, she would try to remain close to him as her "only" family. While the boy would look after Himawari, he refused to let her refer to him as her brother. Despite the lies and swapped memories, Himawari, still having a subconscious love for Boruto, she refused to believe that Boruto could have actually killed her parents, and that they were still alive. To which, Himawari committed herself to grow strong, believing that Boruto would need her help.

While Naruto and Hinata were believed to have been
killed
 by Boruto, Himawari, at her own request, stays alone at the Uzumaki residence doing all the household chores. She feels that her parents will return someday, so she tries to protect their home.

Boruto's Return Arc

Boruto's Return Arc

Three years later, while having a sparring session with
Team 10
,
Code
 attacked the village, looking for Boruto. He unleashed his
Claw Grimes
. Himawari joined Team 10 to defend the village. When one of the grimes attacked Himawari, Kawaki arrived to strike it down. Himawari thanked him, but he complained about her calling him "big brother" despite his previous requests not to.

After the grimes were defeated, Himawari joined Team 10 in facing Boruto and Code, who was already being confronted by Kawaki. After Boruto was able to do
subdue
 Code, he manifested another grime. While Kawaki quickly struck it down, Code used it to teleport away. Shikadai noted that Code could still be in the village. As Team 10 left to search, Himawari stayed back in concern for Kawaki. He told her to leave while he dealt with Boruto, which she reluctantly agreed.

When
Jura
 and
Hidari
 invaded Konoha, Himawari and Team 10 mobilised. The invaders found them, Jura confused by the presence of tailed beast chakra in her, believing he had been tracking Naruto. Deciding that Himawari was who they needed to move forward, the sentient God Trees engaged the genin. After Jura instantly unleashed a powerful Tailed Beast Ball, Team 10 decided to retreat with Himawari, deciding that the enemies wouldn't launch such powerful attacks within Himawari's presence. While flying away on Inojin's
Super Beast Imitating Drawing
, she offered to go solo so her friends wouldn't get hurt. Suddenly, Himawari found herself within her mental plane, approached by a miniature cub version of
Kurama
. While Himawari was confused by this, she instantly recognised who the fox was.

As Kurama introduced itself and explained the situation, Himawari merely welcomed the fox, impressing Kurama. It also revealed to Himawari's compatibility to the fox's power is even greater than her father's was. As Himawari regained consciousness, Jura caught up to Himawari and forced them to the ground. Trying to access Kurama's power, Himawari attacked Jura, only to be easily blocked and captured. Inojin tried to save Himawari, but was impaled by Jura's Wood Release. The sight of her maimed friend enraged Himawari enough to access her newfound power and break free.






Himawari fighting Jura.



She turns her attention to Inojin, freeing him from his impalement and quickly heals him. She tells her friends to take Inojin to safety, determined to face Jura alone so not to endanger them. After they leave, Himawari quickly surprises Jura, overwhelming him with sheer might, even matching the God Tree's Tailed Beast Ball with her own. However, Jura takes the battle more seriously and quickly begins wearing Himawari down. As the repeated healing against Jura's assault ultimately exhausts her into unconsciousness, Boruto appears and teleports with her to also help Sarada.

As Boruto turned his attention to Hidari, he asked Konohamaru to look after Himawari, who ultimately handed the task to
Nishi
 so he could help against Hidari. After Hidari was defeated, Boruto was shot down by Jura, using the opening to retrieve Hidari's Thorn Soul Bulb. As Himawari awoke, she quickly used her healing powers to mend Sarada's injuries. She then went to aid Boruto, but was held off by Kawaki, first allowing Konohamaru to restrain Boruto as a wanted criminal.

As Inojin was taken to the hospital, Himawari joined him. She was relieved to hear from Sakura that Inojin would be fine.

Himawari training with Kurama.



After
Team 7
 successfully retrieved the Thornsoul Bulb of
Matsuri
, Himawari joined her friends as the bulb was inserted into Moegi's tree prison, it instantly shattered to safely free Moegi. Soon after, it was learned that Moegi would make a full recovery. Later, Himawari began training with Kurama within her mental realm. The fox told Himawari how she must learn to apply proper control in her chakra for her fighting style, noting that her unique compatibility with Kurama actually makes her more akin to an actual tailed beast.

Himawari was visited at her home by Inojin as he delivered her favorite rare honey that he found for her. As he departed, she eagerly thanked him for the gift, noting that it was usually sold out whenever she tried to find it.

Trivia

The name "Himawari" (
向日葵
) means "
sunflower
". When reversed, the first two kanji spell "Hyūga" (
日向
), which can also be read "Hinata," making her name a reference to both her mother and the Hyūga clan.

"Mawari" is also a reference to the spiral theme in Naruto's name, as "mawari" is the Japanese word for "rotation" (回り).

Himawari and Boruto were the only known descendants of the Hyūga clan who initially did not possess the
Byakugan
. However, according to
Masashi Kishimoto
, he intended to give them the Byakugan, but forgot to before releasing chapter 700.
 This was essentially corrected in the
Zai no Sho
 one-shot where Himawari awakened her Byakugan. This resulted in her being only one of two characters to have a Byakugan that isn't made immediately apparent by the white, pupilless eye(s) while inactive. The other is
Mukai Kohinata
, a Konoha Anbu introduced in
Itachi Shinden: Book of Bright Light
.

While born into the
Uzumaki clan
, Himawari and her brother are also recognised as legitimate members of the Hyūga clan due to their direct bloodline from their
mother
.

When accessing her initial jinchūriki form, Himawari's hair waves about in nine locks akin to tails, much like her late grandmother and a former Nine-Tails jinchūriki,
Kushina Uzumaki
, when she is angry.

She is the only known jinchūriki whose tailed beast is sealed into her without the use of a sealing formula.
