Synopsis

Hayate
 announces that an unusually large number of
genin
 passed the second stage of the exam, and as such, before they can proceed to the final stage, a series of one-on-one preliminary matches will have to take place so that only the winners of each match can proceed.
Kabuto
 drops out immediately upon the notice, attributing his withdrawal on an injury sustained from an earlier part of the test; however, he worries to himself that if he participated, the "
old Kabuto might come out
".
Sasuke
 is still experiencing pain from the
cursed seal
, so
Sakura
 tries to convince Sasuke to drop out. Sasuke refuses, and says that although he doesn't actually care about becoming a
chūnin
, he must see how he does against some of the best new ninjas so he can avenge his family. The preliminary matches are to begin with Sasuke versus
Yoroi Akadō
. As everyone else leaves the arena,
Kakashi
 walks up to Sasuke and warns him about using his
Sharingan
, revealing that he knows about the cursed seal. He tells Sasuke that if the cursed seal begins to overtake Sasuke, Kakashi will stop the match.
