"
The Boy with the Sharingan…!!

Viz:
 The Sharingan Boy) is chapter 700+2 of the
Naruto Gaiden
 mini-series.

Summary

After encountering a mysterious
boy
 possessing the
Sharingan
 and wearing the crest of the
Uchiha clan
,
Sasuke
 sends a
hawk
 back to
Konohagakure
 to contact
Naruto
 about the matter. Meanwhile,
Sarada
's identity crisis continues as she reveals to
Shizune
 that she knows that there is no record of her birth in Konoha; heavily raising her suspicions on her parentage — which Shizune's evasive demeanour on the topic does not help. In a restaurant,
Chōchō
 complains about her
father
's excessive eating habits, which her
mother
, simply ignores.
 Annoyed that she is being ignored while trying to lose weight, she simply sighs as Sarada appears. Humorously, Chōchō explains to her that she doubts her parents are her real parents. This is challenged by an eavesdropping
Mitsuki
, who simply states that it was normal for girls at their age to start questioning their identity, angering Chōchō. Sarada eventually decides to simply find her father herself or ask the
Seventh Hokage
, about her dilemma. In his office, Naruto sees Sasuke's hawk and realises the situation Sasuke is in and consults
Kakashi
. Together, they doubt that the boy is an
Uchiha Clan Downfall
 survivor, but more likely another one of
Orochimaru
's experiments. Naruto leaves a
shadow clone
 to run the village with
Shikamaru
 as he heads out to meet Sasuke and
Yamato
. Sarada, however, secretly hears this and decides to tail him until she realises Chōchō has invited herself along, thinking Sarada is helping her find her "real" parents. Elsewhere, the mysterious boy meets a
person
 cloaked in an
Akatsuki
 mantle, informing him of his brief fight with Sasuke. They both declare they cannot forgive Sasuke for killing his older brother,
Itachi
, and promise to make him pay.

Trivia

In one panel, Kakashi's scar is missing.
