After implanting
Orochimaru
's DNA, Kabuto used some of his cells to develop a large amount of tiny
snakes
 that multiply at a rapid rate and can merge into either
a clone of another living being using a genetic sample
 or
a larger serpent
 for combat. They also have incredible regenerative abilities. Kabuto not only created a clone of
Hidan
 using this technique, he also created one of
Naruto with Kurama's chakra
 as well. However, for Hidan, the clone snakes have a short lifespan, with what they form into eventually suffering a cellular breakdown within 48 hours of existence.
