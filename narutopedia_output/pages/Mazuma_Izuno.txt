Upon her daughter's advancement to the final round of the
Chūnin Exams
, Mazuma and her family celebrated her promotion despite the exams still not being over. The day of the finals, they checked on Wasabi before her match, voicing their confidence in her ability. During the match, she heard Wasabi express to
Iwabee Yuino
 the weight of her family's expectations, and that she didn't have the goal of becoming
Hokage
, like her parents always wished for her. She covered
Amagi
's ears so she couldn't hear it. They were proud of her when she used their clan's
jutsu
 to protect Iwabee.
