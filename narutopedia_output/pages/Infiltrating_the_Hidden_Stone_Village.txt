"
Infiltrating the Hidden Stone Village
" (
潜入!!　岩隠れの里
,
Sen'nyū!! Iwagakure no Sato
) is episode 82 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

The genin decide
Inojin
 should stay behind because taking the
Akuta
 with them would attract too much attention. If anything happens to the others, Inojin is to return to
Konohagakure
 with the Akuta as evidence. They hope
Ōnoki
 can help him find out more about the ones
Mitsuki
 left with.
Naruto
,
Sai
, and
Shikamaru
 discuss sending men to
Iwagakure
, since they can no longer contact
Kurotsuchi
, despite the risk of igniting a conflict.
Konohamaru
 arrives and requests to be assigned to the mission, even after Naruto stresses the diplomatic implications. Konohamaru disguises himself as an
Anbu
 and departs.
Boruto
,
Sarada
,
Shikadai
, and
Chōchō
 notice no extra security on the main entrance, but decide to follow the water mains on the sides. In the cave where they were left, Inojin makes a grave for a dead animal the Akuta finds. From the normal appearance of things in Iwagakure, Shikadai surmises that
Kokuyō
 was no ordinary shinobi, and is likely affiliated with a clandestine group with no formal ties to Iwagakure.
 While discussing their next step, Chōchō's stomach growls loudly, drawing attention from the crowd, including
Akatsuchi
. They draw attention of a diner owner, and get in to eat so Chōchō will stop drawing attention. Their knowledge of Ōnoki impresses the diner owner, and they get him to tell them where Ōnoki lives. Akatsuchi follows them from a distance. Inojin has the Akuta pick a new name for itself, and it picks
Akkun
. The genin arrive at Ōnoki's residence, and are met by Akatsuchi, who informs them the
Hokage
 told them they might show up, and that Kurotsuchi has disappeared, while a cover story was released. He tells them Ōnoki is probably in the old part of Iwagakure, and that he'll be happy to see someone he invited. Akatsuchi takes them to see Ōnoki, who is happy to see them, but denies being able to help them. After he leaves, the genin and Akatsuchi are attacked by a group of Akuta.
Kū
 arrives and addresses Ōnoki as his father and superior, telling him that the test subject is ready, shocking everyone.
