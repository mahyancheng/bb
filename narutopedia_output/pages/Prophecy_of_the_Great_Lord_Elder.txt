"
Prophecy of the Great Lord Elder
" (
大ガマ仙人の予言
,
Ōgama Sennin no Yogen
) is episode 220 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

At
Mount Myōboku
,
Gerotora
 tells the
Great Toad Sage
 that
Jiraiya
 had
asked him
 to pass the key to the
Eight Trigrams Seal
 to
Naruto
, believing that
Minato
 entrusted Naruto to have full control over the
Nine-Tails
. The toad sage decided to summon Naruto first in order to speak to him, claiming that the answer to Gerotora's dilemma hinges on its outcome.

Meanwhile,
Tsunade
, who has awakened from her long coma, attempts to eat all the food she can in order to regain her
chakra
 and maintain her youthful appearance.
Kakashi
 enters and expresses his relief, as he did not find himself to be a suitable candidate for
Hokage
. Tsunade voices her shock that the
Fourth Raikage
 and
Third Tsuchikage
 agreed to join the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, but Kakashi explains that the dire situation caused by
Madara
 called for desperate measures.

Simultaneously,
Karin
 is being interrogated by the
Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force
. She tells them how
Orochimaru
 and
Sasuke
 treated her; while
Ibiki
 does not care, the others begin to cry and sympathise with her. She agrees to tell them all they want if they give her food. As the others argue over where to get the food, Karin notices that the villagers in Konoha are joyful and are always laughing, and that it reminds her of
Naruto
.

Elsewhere
,
Madara
 tells Sasuke to take it easy, as he must adjust to the transplant. Sasuke claims that he can already feel
Itachi
's visual prowess as well as the strength that surges through him. Meanwhile, Naruto walks through the streets of
Konoha
, being congratulated and doted on by the villagers.
Team Ebisu
 believes his ego is being swelled and blame it on themselves for having written a newspaper article about him. The three chase him through the village;
Konohamaru
 attempts to stall him with his
Sexy Technique
, but Naruto uses his
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 to divert their path. To his surprise, Konohamaru is able to use the same technique as well, through the
Harem Technique
. Naruto eventually manages to evade them and heads to
Ramen Ichiraku
's new location.
Shikamaru
, who witnesses Naruto's run through out Konoha, recalls
Hinata
 telling him how the Nine-Tails' spirit surged when he thought
Pain
 had killed her and how she could not sense even a glimmer of Naruto when he
transformed
. Shikamaru sighs as he resigns himself to the fact that the
Konoha 11
 must also protect Naruto from the
Akatsuki
 as well as the
tailed beast
 within him. He then makes his way to the war council meeting, greeted by his father,
Shikaku
, where Tsunade and the
Konoha Council
 begin preparing for the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

As Naruto waits for a bowl of ramen,
Sakura
 arrives to tell him that Tsunade has awoken from her coma and resumed her position as Hokage.
Teuchi
 decides to treat Naruto on the house, but before Naruto can dig into his bowl of ramen, he is
reverse summoned
 to Mount Myōboku. He is brought before the Great Toad Sage, who bestows upon Naruto a prophecy — that Naruto would meet an
octopus
 and would face off against someone who has great power stemming from his
eyes
. Knowing that he is referring to Sasuke as well as the outcome of their future battle, Naruto tells him that he is unwavering in his resolve to continue down that path. Satisfied with his answer, the sage commands Gerotora to pass down the key to the fox's seal to Naruto, who hesitates to accept it.
