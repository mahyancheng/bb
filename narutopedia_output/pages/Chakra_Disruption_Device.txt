An experimental tool of
Yukigakure
 designed to be the ultimate technique for absorbing
chakra
, this device
absorbs
 the chakra of a captured target when it is applied. The device also creates a force field surrounding it, which prevents it from being either removed or destroyed. These abilities prevent the subject from performing
ninjutsu
 in a matter of moments after being applied as well as making the subject lose consciousness momentarily.

The subject is, however, not incapable of overcoming the device's effects; for example, a large burst of
tailed beast
 chakra has been shown to destroy the device.

Trivia

This tool is unnamed in the movie, but
Dotō Kazahana
 simply refers to it as the "device".
