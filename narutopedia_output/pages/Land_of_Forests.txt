The river running through the country.



The
Land of Forests
 (
森の国
,
Mori no Kuni
) is a country full of forests, so much so that the only way to access the capital city is by river. The criminal group
Shinobazu
 was acting around in this country, and used the
Forest of Bewilderment
 as a hideout.

Gantetsu
, who was a member of Shinobazu was captured in Ogi Pass and was supposed to be brought to the country's capital for trial. He never made it however, as the ship was attacked by the Shinobazu. He "escaped" and, along with
Naruto Uzumaki
 and another they managed to defeat the Shinobazu. In the end, Gantetsu was allowed to go free.

The country does not seem to possess ninja of their own, but they do possess a police force with a high level of sword training.
