 anime.

Synopsis

Code
 introduces himself to
Boruto
, and states his goal of feeding him to the
Ten-Tails
. He intends to test Boruto's quality as a sacrifice.
Kawaki
 wants Boruto to run away, but Boruto thinks Code will neither listen to him, nor allow him to run away.
Ino
 updates
Naruto
 that despite extending their search, they're unable to find Kawaki. Naruto recalls that Boruto could sense him, but he has left,
Nishi
 confirming he's nowhere near. Code and Boruto begin fighting, Code using his
Claw Marks
 to dodge and counterattack. He deflects Boruto's
shuriken
, actually a transformed
shadow clone
, who attacks him with
Lightning Release: Thunderclap Arrow
. He escapes through a Claw Mark again, and finds Boruto's ninja tactics fun. However, he finds him inept at using the
Kāma
, activating his own White Kāma. Code begins to pressure Boruto, and explains that the Kāma doesn't just make them stronger, it also grants them the accumulated battle experience of the
Ōtsutsuki
, if one knows how to draw from it. Boruto dodges a stomp, and starts drawing more power from the Kāma, pleasing Code. Kawaki is concerned about
Momoshiki
's emergence.

Ada

watches
, and Code wonders how Momoshiki can manifest himself to this degree in a vessel yet to be revived. Boruto remains in control and charges at Code with shadow clones, who notes the increased strength. He marks a clone to retreat and attack, but Boruto pulls him through the mark. Code avoids another
Rasengan
 through the marks. Kawaki wonders how Boruto stayed in control. Code consults Ada, who speculates
Amado
's drugs are responsible and counsels him not to underestimate Boruto. Naruto wants Ino to search for Boruto, who he believes went after Kawaki.
Shikamaru
 arrives, and because Naruto no longer has
Kurama
, he'll join him.
Hinata
 wants to join them, but Naruto wants her to take care of
Himawari
. As he enters
Sage Mode
, he reassures Himawari he'll bring Boruto and Kawaki back. Boruto fails to absorb Code's marks with his Kāma, Kawaki explaining that while made with chakra, they have enough iron from Code's blood to act as physical matter. Boruto and Kawaki both are unsure about Boruto's state, Kawaki distrusting Amado's meds. Code thinks that even with meds, Momoshiki isn't gone, and Boruto is still an Ōtsutsuki, viable for sacrifice. They're surprised about his awareness of the meds. He vows to return for Boruto, and tries taking Kawaki with him. Kawaki retaliates with a shadow clone, forcing Code to slip away to avoid him and Boruto. Code asks about Kawaki's change of heart, and he says everything he does is for Naruto. Naruto in Sage Mode finds Boruto, along with a chakra signature he doesn't recognise. He and Shikamaru notify Ino, and depart. Boruto and Kawaki fight Code.
Sai
 notifies Amado that Kawaki is fighting Code, who finds it strange as Code has no sensory abilities to find him that fast.
Sumire
 suggests a new Outer ally, though Amado knows of no Outer so skilled. Amado is deep in thought about what Kawaki might do. Boruto suddenly collapses in pain, Code using the opportunity to attack a distracted Kawaki. Boruto experiences another frozen time interaction with Momoshiki, who mocks the attempt to halt the Kāma's extraction with medicine. He decides to kill Code, and takes over Boruto, attacking with a giant Rasengan.
