A smaller version of the
Tailed Beast Ball
 that has been infused with
lightning
 chakra which
Killer B
 or the
Eight-Tails
 can use to bring down a target's defences and inflict major damage.

The attack also does not require time to be formed like the regular Tailed Beast Ball.

Trivia

As with many of the techniques of
Kumogakure

shinobi
, this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation.
