The Ultimate Art!!
 (
究極芸術!!
,
Kyūkyoku Geijutsu!!
,
Viz:
 The Ultimate Art) is volume 40 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 360

"
C4 Garuda
" (
C4カルラ
,
Shī Fō Karura
)

Tobi
 runs while
Deidara
 creates his
C4
 explosive: a giant replica of himself. When it explodes it releases a cloud of microscopic bombs that cause whatever inhales them to disintegrate. After
Sasuke
 appears to succumb to this fate, Deidara starts to celebrate. He is attacked from behind by Sasuke, who saw the miniature explosives with his
Sharingan
 and evaded them, using a
genjutsu
 to make it look as though he had died. Sasuke finds that the Deidara he attacked was a
clay clone
, Deidara having known it was a genjutsu thanks to years of training to specifically defeat Sharingan illusions.

Chapter 361

"
Weakness…!!
" (
弱点…!!
,
Jakuten…!!
)

With
Sasuke
 immobilised in clay,
Deidara
 traps him in a sphere of
C4
 bombs. Sasuke manages to escape but quickly starts to disintegrate. This is, once again, a
genjutsu
, and the real Sasuke attacks Deidara. Sasuke explains that he earlier discovered that
lightning
 neutralises Deidara's explosives. By using
Chidori
 on himself, he removed the threat the microscopic bombs he inhaled posed. Sasuke owes his survival to the Sharingan.

Chapter 362

"
The Ultimate Art!!
" (
究極芸術!!
,
Kyūkyoku Geijutsu!!
)

With
Deidara
 defeated,
Sasuke
 asks him where to find
Itachi
. Deidara refuses to give in and claims to still have some
explosive clay
 left, but Sasuke does not believe him. Angry that an
Uchiha
 is once again looking down on him, Deidara promises to prove his "art" superior to the
Sharingan
. Sasuke deactivates his Sharingan, no longer needing them, pushing Deidara over the edge. Apologising to
Tobi
, Deidara uses his
C0
, intending to blow himself up to take Sasuke and everything else in a ten kilometre radius with him.

Chapter 363

"
Sasuke's Death…!!
" (

Deidara
's
C0
 destroys the area. The members of

Team 7
, and
Team 8
 see the resulting explosion.
Zetsu
, having watched the battle, reports the deaths of Deidara,
Tobi
, and
Sasuke
 to the rest of
Akatsuki
. Meanwhile,
Suigetsu
 summons
Manda
 to confirm his suspicions; Sasuke summoned Manda at the last second to act as a shield from Deidara's attack. It worked, though Manda dies from his injuries. They regroup with the rest of Hebi. Elsewhere, the Akatsuki leader,
Pain
, is instructed to capture the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
.

Chapter 364

The Target is…!!
" (

)

After the
Akatsuki
 meeting,
Kisame
 asks if
Itachi
 is sad that, with
Sasuke
's death, he is the last
Uchiha
. Itachi says Sasuke is not dead, and even if he were that wouldn't matter. Sasuke rests from his battle with
Deidara
 with the rest of
Hebi
.
Team 7
 and
Team 8
 locate the site of their battle and pick up on Sasuke's scent. They begin tracking him. Elsewhere, a shadowy figure warns
Pain
 about
Naruto
's abilities for when he goes after the
Nine-Tails
. Before leaving, the figure promises their goals will soon be fulfilled, including the restoration of his,
Madara Uchiha
's (previously "
Tobi
"),
Sharingan
.

Chapter 365

"
Pursue Itachi
" (
イタチを追え
,
Itachi o oe
)

While
Sasuke
 is resting,
Karin
 senses
Team 7
 and
Team 8
 approaching their location. Knowing they have been found,
Hebi
 starts moving. To get the
Konoha
 ninja off of their tail,
Jūgo
 tears up one of Sasuke's shirts and gives it to a flock of birds to make following Sasuke by scent useless. When the Konoha ninja notice this,
Naruto
 creates a group of
shadow clones
 to follow all of the Sasuke trails. One stumbles across
Itachi
, who asks to speak with him.

Chapter 366

"
Brothers
" (
兄弟
,
Kyōdai
)

Naruto
 tries to attack
Itachi
, but he is easily stopped. Itachi asks why Naruto is so interested in his brother,
Sasuke
. Naruto responds that he is more of a brother to Sasuke than Itachi has ever been. Naruto attacks again but is caught in Itachi's
genjutsu
, who repeats his desire to only talk. In
Konoha
,
Jiraiya
 tells
Tsunade
 over drinks at 'Bar Sake' that he has tracked the
Akatsuki
 leader to
Amegakure
. Amegakure is in the middle of a civil war, which the leader of a criminal organisation is using to hide his movements. Tsunade laments that, as
Hokage
, she cannot come with him during his investigation, as well the passage of time, their childhood friend
Orochimaru
 now dead. Elsewhere, Itachi leaves Naruto after they finish their business and confronts Sasuke.

Chapter 367

"
Itachi and Sasuke
" (
イタチとサスケ
,
Itachi to Sasuke
)

Itachi
 tries to make casual conversation with
Sasuke
, who instead attacks him. Impressed by how much stronger he has become, Itachi makes arrangements for them to meet in person before his clone disperses. In
Konoha
,
Jiraiya
 sets out for
Amegakure
 to investigate
Akatsuki
.
Tsunade
 warns him to be careful and asks to request her help if things get difficult. Jiraiya points out that, as
Hokage
, Konoha needs her, but she responds that
Naruto
 will inevitably replace her in the position. They discuss Naruto's similarities to his parents,
Kushina Uzumaki
 and
Minato Namikaze
. Having taught Minato, Jiraiya says that he feels like Naruto is his grandson. He warns Tsunade about
Danzō
 before leaving. He arrives in Amegakure but is immediately detected by
Pain
.

Chapter 368

"
Intelligence Gathering
" (
情報収集
,
Jōhō Shūshū
)

Sasuke
 and
Hebi
 head for the meeting place where
Itachi
 is waiting. On a Sunday in
Amegakure
,
Pain
 instructs
Konan
 to look for the intruder in West Three — the third part of the town's western area — while he prepares to deal with whomever it is.
Jiraiya
 — the intruder — overhears two Amegakure ninja discussing Pain. He proceeds to capture them so that he can interrogate them.

Chapter 369

"
Regarding Pain
" (
ペインについて
,
Pein ni Tsuite
)

The first of his prisoners is uncooperative, so
Jiraiya
 demonstrates how "ruthless" he can be to those who do not help him; he turns the
Amegakure
 ninja into a
toad
. His companion is suddenly very forthcoming with information. He tells Jiraiya that little about
Pain
 is known by Amegakure citizens. He corrects Jiraiya's belief that the civil war is ongoing, Pain's side having already won. Jiraiya is horrified that anyone could defeat the former leader of Amegakure,
Hanzō
, who not even he and the other
Sannin
 could defeat. The ninja goes on to detail how Pain came to be regarded as a god amongst Amegakure's villagers by killing everyone even remotely affiliated to Hanzō in order to remove any possibility of dissent. Meanwhile, Pain sets out to face Jiraiya.

Author's Note

“

Nostalgic radio-controlled plastic model vehicles have recently made a comeback, just a bit smaller and easier to operate! So cool, I can't stand it!! The most popular models are, as before, buggy types like the Hornet and Mighty Frog. Please bring back my favourite, Pajero, too, Mr. Tamiya!
