Orochimaru's true form.



The
Power of the White Snake
 (
白蛇の力
,
Shirohebi no Chikara
)
 is a general term for
Orochimaru
's ability to heal any injuries and to turn into a giant white snake. This enables him to utilise
Living Corpse Reincarnation
 on a victim when the time is right. Aside from increased regeneration, Orochimaru can also
reconnect his body
 with
snakes
 should it be bisected,
 or if the injuries are too severe to heal, he can shed his skin to
regurgitate a new body
, free from all damage.

When he absorbed Orochimaru,
Sasuke Uchiha
 temporarily acquired much of the White Snake's ability to heal faster than normal,
 as well as shedding his skin to escape the
Amaterasu
, though the latter feat took a toll on Sasuke's
chakra
 reserves.

Kabuto
 also obtained the ability by transfusing his master's genetic material into himself prior to Orochimaru's revival.
 Kabuto later travelled to
Ryūchi Cave
 and studied under the
White Snake Sage
 to attain
Sage Mode
, which Orochimaru had been unable to do.

Trivia

The
Sages
 of the Ryūchi Cave all seem to possess a snake form similar to that of Orochimaru's Power of the White Snake.
