Kawaki & Himawari Academy Arc

Kikuchiyo accompanied Mimi to the
Academy
 when she began attending it. During a practice pitting the class-mates against each other, Mimi decided to not partake in it. When
Ehō Norimaki
 scolded her for it, calling her lazy, and snatching away her candy bar, Kikuchiyo bit him in retaliation.

Later, when her class was taken to an abandoned island for an exercise, their teacher
Hana Kaka
, who was an assassin targeting
Kae Yukiwari
, baited Kikuchiyo with his food to injure him with a trap, diminishing the group's ability to search the island. When Hana was exposed as an assassin, some in the class realised her earlier targeting of Kikuchiyo.

After Hana was stopped and her assassin personality suppressed, Kikuchiyo joined Mimi to see Kae off as she had to return early to the
Land of Bamboo
 for her father's sake.
