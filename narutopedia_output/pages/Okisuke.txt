Okisuke
 (
オキスケ
) is a
samurai
 from the
Land of Iron
 and one of
Mifune
's right-hand-men alongside
Urakaku
.

Personality

Okisuke is a very solemn, and dutiful individual who will carry out his assigned tasks to the letter without hesitation. In the anime, he voiced distaste in teaming up with shinobi, believing that they were using the samurai as mere tools for the safety of the whole world. It was not until Mifune explained everything to him, telling them that they would be working alongside each other as equals, that this concern abated.

Appearance

He is a bald man with violet-coloured, pupiless eyes and a cross-shaped scar that extends across his forehead and descends downwards past his right eye, while a dragon tattoo is inscribed above his left. Due to the injury that he has sustained over his right eye, it remains permanently closed. His attire during the
Kage Summit
 consisted of a simple purple
kimono
-like outfit, with a red scarf encircling his neck that obscures the lower half of his face and conceals a communicator as well.

In the anime when he was deployed with the Fifth Division, he wore the standard samurai attire and helmet with horns, to signify his rank.

Abilities






Okisuke cuts down a disguised White Zetsu.


As a samurai, Okisuke is skilled in
kenjutsu
, as seen in the anime when he was able to kill a
White Zetsu Army
 clone with a single strike, even when the latter was wearing a samurai armour.
 He also has great reflexes, seen when he already reached the grip of his sword before Zetsu even finished emerging out of the ground, while the present shinobi did not react at all.
 In the anime, he was also shown to be able to
channel

chakra
 through his sword.
 He is also Mifune's right-hand man, which further exemplifies his strength.

Part II

Five Kage Summit

When the
Fourth Raikage
 requested that the
Kage

convene
, the
Land of Iron
 was selected as the site of the Summit, with
Mifune
 chosen to act as the meeting's moderator. Assigned to the general's personal protection detail, Okisuke alongside
Urakaku
, watched over Mifune as he greeted the
Kazekage
 and his delegation upon his arrival.

As the assembly commenced their discussions, Okisuke assumed his position to the rear of his leader, where he remained for the entirety of the meeting despite the Raikage's various violent outbursts. However, when the meeting abruptly concluded due to
White Zetsu
's intrusion, Okisuke was ordered to inform the other
samurai
 to locate the invading
Sasuke Uchiha
 and make preparations for battle.
 after he attempted to ascertain whether or not the intruder were truly dead, after White Zetsu's neck is broken by the Raikage, he performed a brief examination of the body.
 It is from this position that he observed Sasuke's succeeding confrontation with the Kage, before becoming ensnared by one of Zetsu's clones, when Black Zetsu activated his
Spore Technique
. Later freed from these confines through
Kankurō
's intervention, Okisuke listened to
Tobi
's
scheme
 and only upon the
Allied Shinobi Forces
' formation, departed.

Encountering a small platoon during his attempts to track down and secure the remaining members of
Taka
, Okisuke recognised that two of the samurai were actually
Suigetsu Hōzuki
 and
Jūgo
 in disguise and, drawing both his swords, forced them to reveal their helmets.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown

Okisuke attended the second meeting called by the Fourth Raikage, alongside his leader Mifune.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

In the anime, it was shown in Mifune's flashback, that he had a brief conversation with Okisuke before leaving for the battlefield. Later, it was revealed that Okisuke had also been deployed with the rest of the
Fifth Division
 and came to
Surprise Attack Division
's aid before Mifune began to fight
Hanzō
 and later confronted the reinforced
Surprise Attack and Diversion Platoon
. When
Kankurō
 warned him about the
poison mist
, Okisuke told him that they were all right because their masks were specially designed to protect them against the poison. When
Kimimaro
 approached the samurai, Okisuke tells them to get ready as the reincarnated shinobi clashed with them and used his chakra flow technique to try and cut through Kimimaro's dense bones.

Creation and Conception

Kishimoto
 noted that with the scars and tattoo, he had created a fairly scary-looking character. He drew him keeping in mind that he was Mifune's faithful servant, giving the readers the impression that he would tacitly carry out orders along with Urakaku.

Trivia

Both Okisuke and his partner Urakaku have a scar on the right side of their face.

In
Naruto: Shippūden
 episode
280
, Okisuke noted that the correct countersign to his statement "mountain" was "river". This may be an allusion to either the show: "'
The Burning Mountain River
" which famous samurai and Mifune's namesake
Toshiro Mifune
 appeared, or to the Japanese saying which roughly translates to, "
the country is in ruins, and there are still mountains and rivers
".
