Trivia

The first time Hana uses this jutsu, her Tiger seals are incorrectly drawn, having crossed thumbs, and folded middle fingers instead of extended along the index fingers. The seals momentarily corrected when she launches the fireballs again after the opening sequence before being shown incorrectly again.
