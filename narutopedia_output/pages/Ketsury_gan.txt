The
Ketsuryūgan
 (
血龍眼
,
literally meaning:
 Blood Dragon Eye), is a
dōjutsu
, which appears in certain individuals of the
Chinoike clan
. The Ketsuryūgan is recognised by its reddish colour, giving a special appearance for the users of this dōjutsu, characterised as holders of "eyes as red as blood". Its power earned it comparison to the
Three

Dōjutsu

Upon activating, the Ketsuryūgan makes the user's eyes glow bright red sclera, dark red irises, and white pupils shaped as horizontal rectangles. This dōjutsu confers genjutsu casting abilities, either by making physical skin contact with the target or meeting each other's gaze. Upon which, they can hypnotise the victim in a variety of ways, or even delve deep into their minds to extract information. The Ketsuryūgan also gave the users the ability to manipulate iron, or more accurately, anything with a high iron concentration. As such, fitting with its moniker, the Ketsuryūgan can manipulate the blood within a living target, whether it be themselves or another being. In order to manipulate someone else's blood, they must infuse their chakra into the individual. As shown with Chino cutting Sasuke's wrist in order to use her technique on him.

Trivia

When written as 血流, ketsuryū means "blood flow".

The Ketsuryūgan's description in both appearance and genjutsu might is similar to the
Kekkei Genkai
 of
Ranmaru
 from the
Kurosuki Family Removal Mission
 filler arc. It is unknown whether the two dōjutsu are one and the same. However, the anime's depiction of both dōjutsu gave a clear difference in design between them.
