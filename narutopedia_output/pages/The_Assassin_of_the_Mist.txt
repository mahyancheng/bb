"
The Assassin of the Mist!
" (
霧の暗殺者!
,
Kiri no Ansatsusha!
) is episode 7 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Team 7
 is on a motorboat, owned by
Kaji
, headed towards the
Land of Waves
. Kakashi threatens to abandon the mission if Tazuna does not provide an adequate explanation for lying about the mission's difficulty level. He tells them that an extremely wealthy businessman called
Gatō
 was responsible for his country's struggles, and could not afford any high ranked
missions
. Later as they are walking, Kakashi suddenly tells everyone to duck just before a
giant sword
 spins over them, and a
ninja
 appears on the handle of it. The ninja identifies himself to be
Zabuza Momochi
, a
missing-nin
 from
Kirigakure
. He demands to have Tazuna, to which Kakashi refuses.

Kakashi’s forced to use his
Sharingan
, and Sasuke immediately recognises it, explaining along with Zabuza, that Sharingan is a
dōjutsu
 that can immediately see and anticipate all
ninjutsu
 and
genjutsu
. Sasuke’s confused though, as only members of
his clan
 wielded it. Zabuza then summons a
thick veil of mist
, and Kakashi informs his team to protect Tazuna. The tension between the two jōnin causes Sasuke to have a panic attack, but Kakashi is able to calm him down. Zabuza prepares to strike the group with his sword, but Kakashi races toward them just in time. He stabs Zabuza with his
kunai
, but it’s revealed he merely used a
water clone
. In turn, Zabuza slices Kakashi in half, who also turns out to be a clone. Appearing behind him, Kakashi catches Zabuza off guard, holding a kunai to his throat.
