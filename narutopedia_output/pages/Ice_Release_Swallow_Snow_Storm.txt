This technique creates a cluster of ice needles in the shape of miniature swallows out of preexisting ice, which the user then launches at the opponent. These needles can change direction in midair and will maim the opponent with their sharp wings. This technique can be countered by
Fire Release
 techniques, which in turn melts the ice.

Trivia

In
Naruto Mobile
, this technique is presented as simple shuriken imbued with Ice Release chakra.
