The
Kazekage Rescue Team
 (
風影奪還チーム
,
Kazekage Dakkan Chīmu
,
literally meaning:
 Wind Shadow Rescue Team)
 is the primary response team assigned to rescue the
Fifth Kazekage
 from
Akatsuki
.

History

Konoha
 sends the members of
Team Kakashi
 to
Sunagakure
 to lend assistance in rescuing the
Kazekage
, but they needed help navigating through the
Land of Wind
 and beyond.
Temari
 and
Baki
 originally offered to guide them, but
Chiyo
 volunteered instead because one of the Kazekage's kidnappers is her grandson,
Sasori
. After being delayed by Akatsuki member
Itachi Uchiha
, they and Konoha's
Team Guy
 tracked the Kazekage to an Akatsuki lair in the
Land of Rivers
. Sasori died in combat with Chiyo and Sakura and Sasori's partner,
Deidara
, is forced to forfeit the Kazekage to
Naruto
 and
Kakashi
 so that he can escape. The Kazekage, however, has died as a result of Akatsuki removing
Shukaku
 from his body. Chiyo
resuscitates him
, exchanging his life for her own. Chiyo is buried in Suna and the members of Team Kakashi return home after the funeral.
