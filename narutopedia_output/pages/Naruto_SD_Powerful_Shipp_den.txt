Naruto SD Powerful Shippūden

Naruto
 spin-off series,
Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles
.

Gameplay





Japanese cover.



The game features many boss battles to the point where it goes all the way to the
Five Kage Summit Arc
. The game will also include forehead protector cases that can hold three Nintendo 3DS games. The game allows the player to go into story mode as either Naruto or Lee and go on missions taken directly from their animated story lines. Naruto's plot follows the Kazekage Rescue Mission up until Naruto's training with Bee, however, the story has been altered to make it more humorous and lighthearted. Lee's story is original to the game.

Trivia

On the spine of the North American box, the game is misspelled as "Nartuo." The error was fixed on later releases.

There is a bug in the game where going into Eight Gates mode near the end of a mission will freeze the game. The only known way to solve this is by letting the 3DS run out of power.
