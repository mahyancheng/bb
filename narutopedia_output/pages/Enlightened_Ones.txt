The
Enlightened Ones
 (
革者
,
Kakusha
,
English TV:
 Revolutionaries) are a faction of
former

shinobi
 who left their
hidden village
 in order to join the revolutionary
Gengo
 following the aftermath of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. They were primarily made up of young, single men but they were willing to accept women into their group. Like the
Akatsuki
, they are dissatisfied with the current system of shinobi; they seek to replace the current ruling class of
normal people
 and put shinobi in control of the world.

To that end, they offer
missions
 at significantly lower prices than the competing
Shinobi Union
. They had even infiltrated each of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 to cause an incident among their population and destabilise the Union itself; all at Gengo's command.

Enlightened Ones are characterised by the long black cloaks they wear and their vehement loyalty to Gengo; many whom were placed under his
voice-induced genjutsu
 into becoming his obedient subjects. They have based their operations at the
Land of Silence
, where Gengo reigned after deposing of the previous
daimyō
.

The Enlightened Ones were ultimately disbanded after their leader was apprehended by a coalition of
Konohagakure
 and
Sunagakure
 shinobi lead by
Shikamaru Nara
 and their brainwashed members were freed from Gengo's control.
