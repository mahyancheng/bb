Katsuyu
 releases an acidic paste from the mouth that, because of Katsuyu's size and height, is spread over a wide area. The acid's concentration and density is great enough to melt stone. Katsuyu requires no preparation to perform this technique, allowing it to be used instantly, which in turn means that targets have no opportunity to dodge.
