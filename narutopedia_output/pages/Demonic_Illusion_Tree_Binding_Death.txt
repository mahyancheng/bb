The target experiences the
illusion
 of a tree coiling around them, preventing them from moving. Because targets are immobile yet still conscious, this technique is a useful way to perform interrogations. Alternatively, users can simply kill the immobilised targets;
 when
Kurenai Yūhi
 attempts to do this, she emerges from the tree above the target to cut their throat.
 This technique has been passed down through the generations among
Konohagakure
's villagers.
 It was originally created during the time of
Hashirama Senju
, intended to make victims believe they were fighting Hashirama himself and his
Wood Release
.
