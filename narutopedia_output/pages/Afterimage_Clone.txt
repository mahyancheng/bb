Shisui uses the Body Flicker Technique, and moves around creating several afterimages. With his speed, he can move between his afterimages, and deliver attacks from each of them, each of them having mass behind them. If attacked, he moves out of the way, letting his opponent's attack go through one of his afterimages. He is able to move so fast between the afterimages that not only is each one indistinguishable via
