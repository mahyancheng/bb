The
Demon Brothers
,
Gōzu
 and
Meizu
, are two
chūnin
 from
Kirigakure
 that assisted
Zabuza Momochi
 in
defecting
 from the village. They subsequently worked with Zabuza in assassinations to earn enough funds for a second attempt at the
Mizukage
's life.

The brothers are a paragon of
coordinated attacking
. Their large
metal gauntlets
 (Gōzu wears his gauntlet on his right hand while Meizu wears his on his left) house a retractable
shuriken
-styled chain running between the two of them, which they can use to bind an enemy and then slice them to pieces. In the event that the shuriken chain is neutralised, they also have a release mechanism, to free them up for individual attacks. They use the sharp, poisoned claws on their gauntlets to shred their opponents.
