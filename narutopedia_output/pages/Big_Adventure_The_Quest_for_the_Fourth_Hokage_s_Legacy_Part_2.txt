"
Big Adventure! The Quest for the Fourth Hokage's Legacy Part 2
" (
大冒険! 四代目の遺産を探せ・後編
,
Daigōken! Yondaime no Isan wo Sagase Kōhen
) is episode 171 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
,
Sakura
, and
Team 10
 take on the oncoming challenges in order to find the secret technique and break the previous record set by the
Fourth Hokage
, but Naruto's impulsive action leads the group into various troubles. While Naruto and his friends search for the former Hokage's legacy in the temple, the fifteen shinobi of
Amegakure
 come up from behind and use
Grudge Rain
 in an attempt to take them out, flooding them inside. In order to practise using
Chidori
 on moving targets,
Kakashi
 sends Sasuke to the temple, where he proceeds to use it on the Ame-nin.

Naruto and the others find the scroll, only for it to read "there are no shortcuts to becoming to a ninja". The others realise that
Guy
 set the whole thing up to hone their skills and reflect how they began the day with individual goals whilst ending it with the hope that at least a
Konoha

shinobi
 passes the exams; Naruto, however, decides that the scroll's true meaning is to partake in the entire obstacle course once more, but to take the longer route.

Trivia

There are plot holes in this episode:

Chōji
 is seen participating in the hunt for the
Fourth Hokage
's legacy, which takes place
the day before
 the final rounds. However, at that time he was hospitalised due to indigestion, and was not discharged until right before
Shikamaru's match
. Additionally,
Naruto
,
Shikamaru
,
Ino
 and
Guy
 are involved in the quest as well, even though the day before the final rounds, Ino was at the
hospital
 with Chōji while Shikamaru and Naruto encountered
Gaara
 trying to kill
Lee
, who was saved by the arrival of Guy.

Kakashi
 tells
Sasuke
 not to use
Chidori
 in the next day's
match
; however, during
Sasuke's match
 against Gaara, Kakashi reveals that the entire strategy was to use
taijutsu
 to inflict damage on Gaara while building up his speed required to use the Chidori.
