The
Jidanda
 is a weapon that was created by
Iō
 using data that he collected from his previous creations,
Dakō
 and
Tsurukame
. It is a giant, spiked, iron ball that contains
explosive tags
 inside of it. Its handle, like the Dako, is able to stretch and can even be used to attack the enemy. The spikes on the ball can also open to reveal the explosive tags for surprise attacks. Because it is so large, explosive tags can be used to manoeuvre the ball into the air, using the recoil from the explosion. While in the air the wielder can extend the handle and swing the ball at the enemy like a giant
flail
.

After seeing
Tenten
 use it in battle, Iō took Jidanda back from her to make adjustments.

Trivia

Ultimate Ninja Storm 2
 and its sequels, Tenten performs the
