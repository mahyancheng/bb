 manga.

Summary

Kimimaro
's manipulation of his skeletal structure allows him to block or neutralise all of
Lee
's attacks. This, combined with Lee's sobering up, again leaves him unable to damage Kimimaro. Lee persists despite his recent surgery, knowing he must buy time for
Naruto
. Elsewhere,
Sakon
 searches for the hiding
Kiba
. Kiba believes he has escaped detection when Sakon begins to move away, only to be greeted by Ukon, who could approach unnoticed by wearing Kiba's coat, masking his scent with Kiba's own.
Shikamaru
 meanwhile can no longer restrain
Tayuya
 and she moves to finish him off. Before either he, Kiba, or Lee can be killed, one of the
Three Sand Siblings
 appears and rescues each.
