Granny Chiyo and Sakura
 (
チヨバアとサクラ
,
Chiyo-Baa to Sakura
,
Viz:
 Puppet Masters) is volume 30 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 263

"
Getting Angry with a Loud Voice…!!
" (
大声で怒れ…!!
,
Ōgoe de Ikare…!!
)

Sasori
 and
Deidara
 are instructed to deal with
Team 7
 and
Team Guy
 and to capture
Naruto
, the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
's
jinchūriki
. Before they can break into the
Akatsuki
 lair, Team 7 and Team Guy must bring down the
barrier
 blocking their entrance. The five tags that create the barrier need to be removed simultaneously, so Team Guy splits up, locates the tags, and does so. They are immediately attacked by
exact copies
 of themselves. Meanwhile, Team 7 breaks into the base and finds Sasori and Deidara with
Gaara
's body.

Chapter 264

"
Sasori's Art…!!
" (
サソリの芸術…!!
,
Sasori no Geijutsu…!!
)

Deidara
 tells
Team 7
 that they are too late;
Gaara
 is dead.
Naruto
, enraged, attacks them, but Deidara merely flies off with Gaara's body. Naruto pursues him to get back Gaara's body and
Kakashi
 goes with him, instructing
Chiyo
 and
Sakura
 to keep
Sasori
 busy until
Team Guy
 returns. Team Guy, however, is preoccupied with fighting their own duplicates. Sakura is concerned about fighting Sasori by themselves, but Chiyo tells her not to worry. Sasori removes his
Akatsuki
 cloak, revealing a
scorpion-like body
, and states his intentions to kill them both.

Chapter 265

"
Granny Chiyo and Sakura
" (
チヨバアとサクラ
,
Chiyo-Baa to Sakura
)

Chiyo
 informs
Sakura
 that
Sasori
 is hiding within
Hiruko
, a
puppet
 used as his armour. Sakura believes that Chiyo, as Sasori's grandmother, will have useful knowledge of Sasori's puppets, but they have been apart for too long for this to be the case. They must also be wary of the fact that Sasori's entire arsenal is likely coated with poison. Chiyo is nevertheless confident in their success. Meanwhile,
Deidara
 informs
Naruto
 and
Kakashi
 that Sasori is stronger than he is and suggests they go back to help. Sasori attacks, but Sakura dodges his attacks with unusual
dexterity
 and
destroys
 Hiruko.

Chapter 266

"
Sasori, Revealed…!!
" (
サソリ、現る…!!
,
Sasori, Arawaru…!!
)

In
Sunagakure
, the Suna council discusses
Gaara
's kidnapping. Some councillors suggest that this has been a blessing, an opportunity to finally get rid of the village's
jinchūriki
. Others at least agree that it would not be worth looking for Gaara, remembering the complications that arose years earlier when Sunagakure went searching for the
Third Kazekage
. Elsewhere,
Naruto
 attacks
Deidara
 who, after dodging the attack, points out how peculiar it is for anyone to want Gaara back, jinchūriki typically being despised. Meanwhile,
Sasori
 observes that
Chiyo
 has been controlling
Sakura
 like a puppet to help her dodge attacks. He emerges from the rubble of
Hiruko
 and Chiyo is amazed to find that he still looks like a boy, due to having made himself a puppet. Determined to show his grandmother that he won't be so easy to defeat, he reveals another puppet: the Third Kazekage.

Chapter 267

"
Intense Determination…!!
" (
激しき決意…!!
,
Hageshiki Ketsui…!!
)

Chiyo
 realises that
Sasori
 was responsible for the
Third Kazekage
's disappearance years earlier, adding the deaths of three
Kazekage
 to his resumé. Having since
turned
 the Third into a
puppet
, Sasori attacks Chiyo and
Sakura
 with it. Although Chiyo controls Sakura like a puppet to help her avoid the Third's poisonous strikes, they are overwhelmed by the puppet's attacks. Chiyo opts to bring out the
Mother and Father
, the first puppets Sasori created, to block the Third.

Chapter 268

"
Puppet Master vs. Puppet Master!!
" (
傀儡師VS傀儡師!!
,
Kugutsushi Bāsasu Kugutsushi!!
)

The
Mother and Father

puppets
 were created by
Sasori
 to look like and serve the function of his own parents, they having died when he was young. Since they were only puppets, they could not give him love and he lost interest in them, leaving them in
Chiyo
's possession. Chiyo fights the
Third Kazekage
 puppet with them and they are able to overpower it in a normal fight. The Third, having once been human, retains all of the abilities he had in life, including the
Iron Sand
. Sasori neutralises the puppets with the Iron Sand and attacks Chiyo and
Sakura
 with it.

Chapter 269

"
What I Can Do…!!
" (
出来ること…!!
,
Dekiru Koto…!!
)

Chiyo
 protects herself and
Sakura
 from the
Third Kazekage
's
puppet
's
Iron Sand
 with a
shield
 installed in her arm. The Iron Sand nullifies the arm afterwards. Although Chiyo is now handicapped,
Sakura
 realises that
Sasori
, a puppeteer, can only be defeated by Chiyo, another puppeteer. Since normal puppets can easily be defeated by the Iron Sand, Sakura offers herself as Chiyo's puppet. This increased agility, combined with Sakura's
superhuman strength
, allows them to counter the Third's attacks.

Chapter 270

"
Miscalculation…!!
" (
誤算…!!
,
Gosan…!!
)

Temari
 and
Kankurō
 depart from
Sunagakure
, intending to finally join the effort to rescue
Gaara
.
Naruto
 and
Kakashi
 meanwhile are still struggling to get Gaara's body back from
Deidara
. Elsewhere,
Sasori
 grows tired of
Sakura
's continued success with dodging the
Third Kazekage
's attacks, so covers the area in
Iron Sand
. She is injured and collapses, the Iron Sand having been soaked in Sasori's
poison
. The Third moves in to finish her off but Sakura gets up at the last minute and destroys the
puppet
. Sakura reveals to
Chiyo
 that she gave herself the antidote she created earlier, and is now immune to the poison for the next three minutes. She gives the last vial of antidote to Chiyo and encourages her to end the battle before they need to use it too.

Chapter 271

"
Unknown Power…!!
" (
未知の能力…!!
,
Michi no Chikara…!!
)

Kakashi
 tries to get
Naruto
 to calm down so that they can team-up against
Deidara
, suggesting a plan that will utilise both of their strengths. Meanwhile,
Sasori
 cannot understand how
Sakura
 is able to move after being
poisoned
. When he sees her healing her injuries he realises that she is a
medical-nin
 and that she has perhaps created an antidote. Since this would mean she is no ordinary opponent, Sasori gives up on other
puppets
 and removes his robe, revealing that
his body
 is a puppet too. He attacks Sakura and separates her from
Chiyo
, and then turns his attention to the defenceless Chiyo.

Author's Note

“

The movies and games coming out these days look so incredible it stuns me. I'm starting to suspect my readers are so used to rich imagery that manga must feel rather underwhelming by comparison. After all, it's still published in black and white... Remember, though, that manga's strength is in its rapid production. So please overlook its weaknesses.
