These are items used by the
Genjutsu Tree Village
 villagers to repel the
genjutsu
 caused by the surrounding forest. Because the area is surrounded by trees that naturally cause genjutsu the villagers created these bombs in order to aid them in breaking the technique. It is also capable of breaking genjutsu cast by people.
