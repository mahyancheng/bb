A
toad
, using its naturally strong hips and legs, leaps precisely at a target. Toads can cover a great distance by doing this, shifting from a remote location to close range suddenly in order to catch targets off guard. The toad then just as quickly swings with their sword, before the target can react, shifting the power of their leap into the strike. When used by
Gamabunta
, the slash is powerful enough to sever the arm of
Shukaku
's
Tailed Beast Mode
.

Trivia

,
Gamakichi
 uses
chakra flow
 to further increase this technique's strength and effectiveness.
