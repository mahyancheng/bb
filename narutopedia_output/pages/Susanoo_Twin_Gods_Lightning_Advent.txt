Sasuke
 and
Itachi
 activate their
Complete Body — Susanoo
. Itachi launches his
Yasaka Magatama
 at the opponent while Sasuke slashes at them with his
Blaze Release: Susanoo Kagutsuchi
, with the resulting flames creating lightning clouds. The two then fly high up in the sky, fusing their Susanoo's sword together, which Sasuke engulfs in lightning and Itachi engulfs in black flames. They finish by flying down at the opponent sword first, the impact in which is so great, it dispels the lightning clouds, clearing up the sky.
