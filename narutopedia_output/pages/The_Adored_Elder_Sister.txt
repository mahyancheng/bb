The Adored Elder Sister
" (
憧れの姉さま
,
Akogare no Nē-sama
) is episode 389 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

After
Hinata
 returns from the
Academy
, she is passionately welcomed by
Hanabi
, who immediately invites her to play together. Much to the younger
Hyūga
's dismay, Hinata has to train with
her father
, therefore disallowing her to spend time with her sister. The next morning, Hanabi and
Natsu
 walk through the village when they witness
Naruto
 being scolded. As she asks her caretaker why Naruto is treated as an outcast, Hanabi is told to stay away from him. Returning home, Hanabi rushes to finish her work.
 Afterwards, she peeks on Hinata's training session with
Neji
 and witnesses him trying to harm her, only to be stopped by Hiashi who then activates his
curse seal
. The
Hyūga Elder
, noticing that Hanabi was peeking earlier, approaches his granddaughter and explains what had happened as well as the destiny of the Branch Family to protect the
Byakugan
. Following this event, Hiashi becomes Hinata's sparring partner instead. The Elder voices his concerns and notes Hinata is not fit to be the clan's heiress. Hanabi later trains hard on her own, causing the Hyūga Elder to notice and inform her father. Fearing Hinata is not strong enough to become the head of the clan, Hiashi arranges a fight between the two sisters to determine which one of them is worthy of inheriting the title. This duel ultimately ends in Hinata's defeat, causing Hanabi to be declared as the clan's new heiress.
