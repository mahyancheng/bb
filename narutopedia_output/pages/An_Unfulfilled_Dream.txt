 manga.

Summary

Despite having been struck by a
poisonous
 blade,
Sakura
 manages to hold on to the
sword
 to prevent
Sasori
 from escaping. She tells
Chiyo
 to take the last antidote, Chiyo having been struck earlier, but Chiyo ignores her and injects her with the antidote. Chiyo collapses and Sasori, disconnecting from the sword, moves to finish her. Chiyo uses the
Mother and Father

puppets
 to stab him through his core, the only part of his humanity he kept when turning himself into a puppet so that he could still use
chakra
. Chiyo begins healing Sakura but Sasori observes that the wound is too severe. Chiyo responds that she is not healing Sakura but transferring her life to Sakura with a
technique
 she created to give life to Sasori's Mother and Father puppets, something he will no longer need.
