Synopsis

In the weeks following the end of the Ghost incidents,
Boruto
 wonders why his eye has stopped activating.
Naruto
,
Sai
, and
Shikamaru
 stroll through the village, glad to see everything is back to normal. Sai informs them of the role the Academy students had in stopping
Sumire
. Shikamaru posits letting Sumire stay in the
Academy
 might lead to problems.
Shino
 informs his students they'll be assembled in new three person teams to see how well they fit after graduation.
Sarada
 questions Sumire's prolonged absence.
Mitsuki
 insists on partnering with Boruto again, but they lack a third member, as
Iwabee
 and
Denki
 are already partners, as are
Shikadai
,
Chōchō
, and
Inojin
.
 Iwabee already asked Sarada to be on his team, Boruto considers asking Lee, and Mitsuki wishes Sumire could be on theirs. Boruto shushes him, as others don't know about Sumire's involvement in the incidents. Shino asks
Iruka
 what will happen with Sumire, and insists he will watch over her if she returns. Boruto is surprised to see Naruto home early. They discuss Sumire. Shino visits Sumire, and offers to set up a place outside the village where she can figure herself out. Inojin tells Shikadai and Denki his father got files on other villages' academies, and figures Sumire is being transferred. Shino has the students catch a flag again. He steps out when he receives words about Sumire. With Mitsuki's help, Boruto is able to get to the flag. Sumire returns, and is moved by everyone's reaction. Naruto sends a shadow clone to meet up with
Sasuke
, and hands him a scroll about the
Gozu Tennō
, which Sasuke attributes to
Kaguya
, and believes will make it easier to reach her dimension. When Naruto asks him to come to the village for a while, Sasuke asks Naruto to tell
Sakura
 he's sorry, and leaves.
Toneri
 divines about the coming of gods.
Kinshiki
 informs
Momoshiki
 about abnormalities in Kaguya's world, and Momoshiki decides to prepare for departure.
