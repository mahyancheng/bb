Academy Entrance Arc






Komame meets Team 7.



When the Ninja Academy had a group of its students spend a few days interning at various regular jobs throughout the village,
Boruto Uzumaki
,
Shikadai Nara
, and
Mitsuki
 chose to go to the postal office. There they met Komame, who explained how the postal service works. He then assigned the students to join
Tayori Kuroyagi
 on his rounds. Later the following day, Komame was bombarded with complaints from people not getting their mail. Learning that this was due to Boruto's slopping efforts, the infuriated Komame reassigned the students to simple inventory.
 Later next day, at the request of Tayori, Komame agreed to give the students a second chance delivering mail. Later, at the desire of helping the village catch the culprit behind the various attacks on the village, the postal workers decided to aid the students and patrolling the village. Komame was left dumbfounded by this turn of events. As he began fixing the students' sloppy sorting, a masked ninja snuck in and unleashed a
shadow spectre
, possessing Komame. The possessed Komame's frustrations at people not taking his work seriously went on a rampage throwing mail around and shouting in anger. This, however, drew out the students, who revealed they anticipated these actions, knowing the culprit would only attack in unsuspecting areas. While half the students chased the masked man, the other half stayed to save Komame. Komame's mail manipulation technique held the students back from approaching him. Ultimately, it was Tayori reminding Komame of how much meticulous efforts of the postal service was essential for the village that calmed Komame down enough for Boruto and
Iwabee
 to knock him out, purging the spectre from him. As Komame awoke and was taken to the hospital for treatment, showing his still ever loyal nature to his job, he told Tayori to straighten his hat.
