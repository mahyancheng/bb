The Falls of Truth.



The
Falls of Truth
 (
真実の滝
,
Shinjitsu no Taki
,
Viz:
 Waterfalls of Truth), is a waterfall located on the
Island Turtle
. There,
Killer B
 trained to control the
Eight-Tails
. The waterfall itself is peculiar in that by sitting on the platform at its base and concentrating, the person is transported into their mind. Once there, the waterfall becomes a mirror which reflects one's true self. This is the first step in the training regime to control the tailed beast.
 Behind the waterfall itself, there exists a
temple
 where
jinchūriki
 can then take the next step in controlling their beast.

Trivia

At least two known jinchūriki have undergone and successfully completed this part of the training: Killer B and
Naruto Uzumaki
.
