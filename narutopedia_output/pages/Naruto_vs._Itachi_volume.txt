)

Two allied
shinobi
,
Musai
 and
Nonota

reincarnated

Toroi
.

 hits Toroi with a
Rasengan
, allowing Suna-nin to
seal
 him. Naruto and
B
 continue to the battlefield.
Gaara
 and
Ōnoki
 stop retreating with their forces and attack the reincarnated
Kage
. As the reincarnated Kage lament on the fact that they were being made to fight their own shinobi, Gaara sends a huge wave of sand towards the enemy,
his father
 uses his
Gold Dust
 to counteract it. Using the opportunity, Ōnoki attacks using a cone-shaped
Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique
 but is countered by
Mū
 who sensed him and uses a cylindrical form of the same technique which results in a colossal crater on the battlefield. As Gaara comes into sight, his father, who had thought that
Shukaku
 had been
released
, is shocked to see Gaara before him and asks him where the One-Tail was. Gaara responds to him telling him that he was no longer the
jinchūriki
 he had created.

Chapter 547

"
Things that Have Value!!
" (
価値あるもの!!
,
Kachi Aru Mono!!
)

Unable to comprehend the circumstances surrounding his son's revival after the extraction of the
One-Tailed Shukaku
 in spite of
Gaara
's explanation, especially in regards to how he obtained friends, the
Fourth Kazekage
's surprise continues to mount after being informed that Gaara does not hate him due in part to his role as Kazekage providing perspective into his father's previous motives and actions. Recollecting the past, including both his son's birth and eventual descent into failure as a
jinchūriki
, the Fourth Kazekage supposes that there is some worth in his reincarnation as it allows him to determine the actual value of his child. Questioning whether Gaara is truly capable of surpassing him, the battle between father and son commences with the collision of their respective gold and sand, resulting in a mixture of the two. However, by attempting to
protect
 two of the other Kage from an
aerial barrage
, Gaara's sand is able to restrain all three in an inescapable embrace. Admitting the growth of his son as his counters continue to fail in the face of Gaara's
Shield of Sand
, the Fourth Kazekage comes to the realisation that all a parent need do is trust in their children, contradicting his prior concepts about value. Declaring that Gaara's strength comes not from the Shukaku but instead from his mother, he tells his son that
Karura
 truly loved him, which shocked the latter.

 and the
Second Mizukage
 escape from Gaara's sand and are confronted by the
Fourth Division
 to whom they divulge their abilities.

 talks to

 about how his expression has changed since their last meeting. Naruto says he was able to conquer his hatred because of his parents,
B
, and Nagato's teachings of pain.
Itachi
 tells Naruto that he wants to ask him a question, and Naruto says the same. Meanwhile,

 is glad that he has found the
Eight-Tails
 and
Nine-Tails
 first and wonders what
Tobi
's reaction will be. Kabuto commands them to attack. Itachi attacks with a
fireball

Samehada
. Itachi begins to fight with Naruto and B. As they fight, Itachi asks Naruto about Sasuke. Naruto tells him about Sasuke's desire to destroy

Uchiha
 name to keep its reputation. Nagato
pulls
 Naruto and a rock from the nearby lake in a head-on collision, but Naruto dodges it. Nagato

 flies out of

Itachi
 attempts to use
Amaterasu
 on Naruto but the crow locks the eyes with Itachi causing him to stop. Itachi then uses Amaterasu on
Nagato
's
dog summon
 and then turns to use it on Nagato himself and the
bird summon
. Itachi explains to Naruto why the crow has a
Mangekyō Sharingan
 and how he got it.
Shisui Uchiha
 had given his Sharingan to Itachi and wanted him to use it to protect
Konoha
. Kabuto overhears the conversation and states that his luck keeps getting better. Nagato uses
Shinra Tensei
 to free himself from Itachi's flames, and Kabuto seemingly removes his personality. Nagato sneaks behind Naruto with his
chameleon summon
 and uses Shinra Tensei once again to attack
Killer B
 and Naruto. Nagato appears behind B and tries to attack him, but B goes into his
Version 2
 transformation and counters Nagato's attack with a
Tailed Beast Lariat

Preta Path's ability
 to absorb B's chakra, which leads Nagato to regain a youthful appearance. Nagato then grabs hold of Naruto and uses the
Human Path technique
.

 but he
absorbs
 it. B moves to help Naruto but Nagato
sees
 the attack coming and
captures

B
. Just as Nagato is about to
remove Naruto's soul
 and
kill
 B,
Itachi
 saves them with his incomplete
Susanoo

Chibaku Tensei
 on all three of them. Naruto remembers the technique and tells B and Itachi about it. Itachi figures out its weakness and tells the others to use their
strongest

long-range

attacks
. As the sphere is destroyed Itachi stabs Nagato with the
Sword of Totsuka
, causing Nagato to regain consciousness. As he is sealed, Itachi tells him that if he had anything left to say he should say it now. Nagato tells Naruto that he is the last part of the three part legacy following
Jiraiya
 — whose story was perfect, himself — which he deemed a failure. He then tells Naruto to make his story perfect so that everyone forgot his own horrible story.

 expresses frustration on Nagato's sealing, believing that his amplified field of vision would compensate his impaired mobility, though Itachi managed to exploit its blind-spots. Kabuto considers using his trump card. Itachi says he has a plan and will handle
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
, but
Naruto
 insists on fighting on his own and attempts to make more
shadow clones
, but begins feeling the effects of extended use of the
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode

destroys
 the
crow
 and Shisui's Sharingan, as it'll take another decade before its power can be used again, and then leaves. The Allied Forces shinobi fighting the

Naruto
's initial attack on
Mū
 fails, as Mū
senses
 Naruto's attack and dodges. Naruto and
Gaara
 work together enabling Naruto to land a hit on Mū with his
Planetary Rasengan
.
Ōnoki
 increases the weight of Mū's body stopping him from moving which allows Gaara to seal him before Mū could finish his statement. Gaara wants an explanation as to why Naruto is on the battlefield.
Shikaku Nara
 informs them of the situation. Naruto, before leaving, tells Gaara that he has no intention of dying before becoming Hokage, he knows what's he's doing, and that being Kazekage does not give him the right to patronise him.

 explains the Third's abilities and past.

Chapter 554

"
The Limit of the Rasenshuriken…!!
" (
螺旋手裏剣の限界…!!
,
Rasen Shuriken no Genkai…!!
)

Naruto
 prepares a
Rasenshuriken
 with his
chakra arms
.
Temari
 notes it to be a Wind Release variation of the Rasengan. Naruto guides the Rasenshuriken towards the
Third Raikage
 with a chakra arm, but he dodges.
Dodai
 notes the attack won't work since the Raikage has the
Lightning Release Chakra Mode
 on. Naruto counted on him dodging it, and uses the chakra arm to throw the attack in a new direction. The Raikage dodges it again, so Naruto catches the Rasenshuriken with a chakra arm and rams it against him at point blank. The
Sealing Team
 tries to
seal
 the Raikage, but he recovers before they can complete it, much to everyone's shock. The Third prepares his
strongest ninjutsu
. Dodai urges all to get away from the Third and commands Earth Release users to
build a wall
, which Dodai himself
reinforces
. Dodai explains the Third's technique. Against Dodai's recommendation and Temari's protests, some shinobi try attacking the Third when he breaks through the wall, only to be defeated. Dodai recounts how the Third was resilient, and Naruto asks him how the Raikage got his scar if he was so resistant. Dodai says he got it fighting the Eight-Tails by himself and that he didn't like to talk about it. Naruto decides using the
Tailed Beast Ball
, and starts charging it.

Chapter 555

"
Contradiction
" (
矛盾
,
Mujun
)

Naruto
's attempt at forming a
Tailed Beast Ball
 fails, and is forced out of
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
. Naruto tells
Dodai
 that he needs to contact
B
 and the
Eight-Tails
. As the Raikage suddenly attacks them, Dodai forms a
rubber ball
 as a decoy to buy Naruto some time. Dodai contacts
Inoichi Yamanaka
, who allows Naruto to talk to B. Naruto tells B that he wants to talk to the Eight-Tails. The Eight-Tails tells Naruto that when it and the Raikage fought they collapsed with both of their techniques in hand. The Raikage cuts the rubber ball in half and sees that Naruto isn't in it. He heads towards Naruto's location. Naruto goes in to
Sage Mode
 and plans to use
Frog Kata
 to sense the Raikage's attack faster. The Raikage attacks with a one-finger nukite, but Naruto dodges and hits the Raikage's arm with a Rasengan, knocking his attack into his own chest. The sealing team immediately seals the Raikage. Elsewhere, the
Second Mizukage
 stands before an exhausted Gaara and asks him if that was all he is capable of.
