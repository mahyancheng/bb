Trivia

As with many of the techniques of
Kumogakure

shinobi
, this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation.

Though A referred to this as just his "fastest punch" in the manga, this technique is given an explicit name in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
.

The only two shinobi to have ever dodged it are
Minato Namikaze
 with his
Flying Thunder God Technique
,
 and
Naruto Uzumaki
 while in
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
.
