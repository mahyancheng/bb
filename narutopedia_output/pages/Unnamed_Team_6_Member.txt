They are thin with black and blue hair pinned up on the top of their head and black eyes, bearing a resemblance to some
Uchiha

flak jacket
 and black

 on their head. Their arms are protected by special armour, and the collar on their turtleneck is quite high, reaching to their chin.

As a child, they had the same hairstyle, but their forehead was framed by a red cloth and they wore a blue jacket with yellow trim on the sleeves and a green collar.
