Kobanza
 (
コバンザ
) was a pirate from the
Funato clan
.

Personality

Kobanza was a patient and careful individual, willing to bide his time to reach a goal, but only up to a point. His spreading of
Taiki
's murder and the inconsistencies in his false testimony while impersonating a
Dotō Island
 refugee were enough to expose his plan upon close scrutiny. He preferred to deal with enemies in a stealthy manner, turning them against each other. He was fiercely loyal to the Funato Clan, preferring to kill himself in an attack against their enemies rather than risking a harsh interrogation that could reveal intel about them.

Appearance

Kobanza was a tall, burly man, with a fish-like appearance. He was bald, and had Funato clan marks on the left side of his head. He had pointy teeth. Kobanza wore body armour without a shirt, gloves, and bandages around his arms.

Great Sea Battle of Kirigakure Arc

Kobanza infiltrated a stolen Funato ship by hiding inside a Dotō Islander refugee and controlling him. At night, he stole Kabutowari and used it to kill Taiki, returning it to
Kyohō
 to frame him for it. He spread word of it among the other refugees to incite suspicion and conflict. Still posing as a refugee, he claimed to have seen Kyohō going to Taiki's quarters at night while going to bathroom. Kobanza later learned that Kyohō had been killed, and went to claim his body and sword for himself, only to discover he was still alive, a ruse devised by
Kawaki
 to expose him. He turned himself to water, but
Boruto
 and
Mitsuki
 attacked him with
Lightning Release

kunai
. He escaped through cracks on the walls and made his way to the engine room. He was momentarily immobilised by
Hebiichigo
 with
Nuibari
, but the prospect of being interrogated by
Buntan
 made him force his way through it, killing himself in an attempt to take out their engine and avoid revealing intel on the Funato.

Trivia
