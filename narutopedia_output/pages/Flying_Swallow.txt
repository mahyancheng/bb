This is an "addition-line
ninjutsu
" that augments the cutting power of a bladed weapon by
flowing

chakra
 into it. A dense blade of chakra is formed around the physical blade, extending its reach. Because users can adjust the length of this chakra blade at will, opponents can never fully anticipate the user's attacks.

Asuma
 performs the Flying Swallow with his unique
Chakra Blades
. He furthermore prefers using
wind
 chakra so that his blades become sharp enough to cut through stone or metal.

Trivia

The Flying Swallow is a piece used in
taikyoku shōgi
, a variant of the standard shōgi with over 400 pieces.

In the anime, Naruto was taught the basics of this technique to aid him in developing the
Wind Release: Rasengan
.

Although
Tō no Sho
 classifies Flying Swallow as taijutsu, its actual entry describes it as ninjutsu.

In the
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja
 series
,
Kakashi
's midair taijutsu attacks are named "Flying Swallow", "Rising Swallow", and "Falling Swallow". When Asuma became playable in
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3
, the Japanese version of the game used "Flying Swallow" in both Kakashi's and Asuma's movesets. However, across both Kakashi and Asuma in the English translations of the games, their respective moves often go back and forth between called "Flying Sparrow" to avoid confusion.

Even in later games such as the first
Storm
 game, Kakashi still keeps his swallow-naming-motif for some of his normal combos.
