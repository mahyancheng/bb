The
Konoha Cryptanalysis Team
 (
木ノ葉暗号解読班
,
Konoha Angō Kaidoku Han
) also known as the
Konoha Cryptology Team
 (
木ノ葉暗号班
,
Konoha Angō Han
) is an organisation specialising in deciphering secret codes and messages, taking their orders directly from the
Hokage
. Their base of operation is located in a library-structured office. This facility possesses a desktop computer and numerous vertical files, presumably holding almost all of the secret codes Konohagakure uses in missions and message delivery. They work closely with the shinobi who oversee the
Konoha Aviary
.

After
Takamaru
 arrived at the aviary, noting the fact that the village had sent their fastest hawk and the seal on the
scroll
,
Natori
 immediately calls
Yurika
 — a member of the Cryptology Team — who rushes to
Tsunade
 to inform her that the
Fifth Kazekage
 had been captured by
Akatsuki
.

The Cryptanalysis Team was later requested to assist in deciphering the code
Jiraiya
 had left behind. After finding out the key to the code (with help from
Naruto
 and
Kakashi
),
Shiho
 uncovers that the message stated: "
the real one is not amongst them
", referring to who the real
Pain
 is. After the
assault
 on the village where their office was destroyed, they operated in a tent for the time being.
