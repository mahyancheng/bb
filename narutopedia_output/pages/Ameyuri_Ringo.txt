Ameyuri Ringo
 (
林檎雨由利
,
Ringo Ameyuri
) was a
kunoichi
 from
Kirigakure
 and one of the members of the previous generation of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
.

Background

In the anime, Ameyuri was stated to have died of an incurable disease at a young age.

Personality

In the anime, Ameyuri has shown a playful attitude, toying with her opponents and showing joy in it like her swordsmen teammates. She is stated to never miss her prey. She will exterminate all of her opponents and will pursue any who has survived. She seems to develop a liking for those that can stand their ground against her and prove a challenge, which she refers to as meals. Despite her vicious nature in battle, she would show respect towards those whose fighting skills and courage meet her liking. Ameyuri took a particular liking to
Omoi
, who chose to fight against her while his comrades decided to flee and proved to almost match her in battle which she stated was her type of person. After their battle, Ameyuri gifted Omoi her swords and hoped for him to meet her again in the afterlife.

Appearance






Ameyuri's full appearance.



Ameyuri was relatively short in comparison with the other members of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist. She had long, red hair,
 black eyes, and together with a Kiri
forehead protector
, she also wore a simple cloth around her head, distinctively tied at both sides so as the ends of the material protrude upwards, while the remainder of hair is allowed to flow downwards. She wore a loose, pin-striped long-sleeved shirt with a dark
obi
 around the waist, black pants which got much looser near the ends, resembling
hakama
, and striped leg-warmers. Like all the other members of her generation of swordsmen, she wore bandages loosely tied around the neck and had jagged teeth.

Abilities






Ameyuri using Lightning Release: Lightning Fang.



As one of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, and likewise its strongest generation in history, Ameyuri was one of the most powerful shinobi produced within Kirigakure. She was also capable of using
Silent Killing
, as seen when fighting the
Third Division
 of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 while under the effect of
Zabuza Momochi
's
Hiding in Mist Technique
. She is very well-versed in the use of
Lightning Release
 techniques, and was apparently a skilled tracker, as Kayui stated "she never lost her prey". According to
Might Guy
, she was so strong that not even one hundred
chūnin
 could beat her.

Kenjutsu






Ameyuri wielding the Kiba.



Ameyuri was a very powerful swordswoman, able to fend off and gradually overwhelm another skilled swordsman,
Omoi
, with her own might. During her time as one of the Seven Mist Swordsman, she wielded the
Kiba
, twin swords imbued with lightning, proving herself ambidextrous. With these blades claimed to be the sharpest swords ever made, having the ability to cut through anything, and functioning in a similar manner to
Lightning Release
-based
chakra flow
, Ameyuri was very dangerous in battle. In the anime, it was shown that Ameyuri uses the Kiba in combination with agile spinning movements, sweeping through her targets while rotating around herself, hitting all enemies around her.
 She could use many techniques using the swords, such as a technique that
surrounds her enemies with lightning
 and also herself in order to
perform a close range attack
. She could shoot
individual lightning bolts
 with great precision and could also use a technique that can
devastate a whole landscape
.

The previous generation of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist reincarnated.



Amidst the battle with the
Third Division
 the
reincarnated
 previous generation of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
 are
summoned
 by
Pakura
 and
Gari
, under
Kabuto Yakushi
's instruction, with the intention of overwhelming the opposition. Amongst their number was Ameyuri, who after being futilely bombarded by various techniques and weapons, retrieved
Kiba
 from within a
scroll
 in
Mangetsu Hōzuki
's possession. Entering the fray whilst concealed by a
thick mist
, Ameyuri began a
silent
 massacre, masterfully dispatching several shinobi as
electricity
 crackled around the blades. With
Zabuza Momochi
's defeat, the mist cleared exposing Ameyuri to the enemy. By the time
Kakashi Hatake
 and
Might Guy
 departed for
Naruto Uzumaki
's location the following day, she had been sealed by the Third Division.

In the anime, at dawn of the war's second day, Ameyuri reappeared on the battlefield. Ameyuri slaughtered countless shinobi that had crossed her path and noticed that there were survivors who had escaped. Tired of fleeing and wanting to avenge
Yurui
's death, Omoi stays behind to fight the kunoichi. Impressed with Omoi's skills, Ameyuri spares him until she disposes of his comrades. After attacking
Nurui
 and
Kayui
, Ameyuri pursues the persistent Omoi, who leads her into a bottomless marsh, trapping them both when the
Kumo
 shinobi baits her in using her strongest technique. Kakashi and Might Guy came to back up Omoi and have
Sai
 pull him out while Ameyuri sinks into the marsh. Before she sunk into the marsh completely, Omoi gives her one of his lollipops as a farewell gift, and in turn she gives him her swords in return, as a thank-you gift.

Trivia

Ameyuri (
雨由利
) roughly means "beneficial rain", and Ringo (
林檎
) means "apple"; like all members of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen (excluding Raiga), the surname is derived from a type of
produce
.

In the anime, there is no colour distinction between the cloth in her hair, and her actual hair colour.

Ameyuri is the only known official female member of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen.
