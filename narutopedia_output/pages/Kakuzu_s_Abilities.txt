"
Kakuzu's Abilities
" (
角都の能力
,
Kakuzu no Nōryoku
) is episode 84 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Yamato
 is impressed by the destructive power of
Naruto
's
Wind Release: Rasengan
, although he tells Naruto that his new technique would not match up against
Sasuke
's
Fire Release
 abilities. He explains the five
chakra elements
 and how they each have a superior and inferior chakra type that matches against them. He tells Naruto that his wind is inferior to fire, meaning his
Wind Release
 technique will merely be deflected by Sasuke's fire, but that his wind is superior to Sasuke's
Lightning Release
, such as his
Chidori
. Naruto, however, muses he must be the perfect type to fight with Sasuke, as he possesses the rare wind that strengthens Sasuke's fire.
Sakura
 and
Sai
, who had been observing, enter the canyon Naruto had created and ask him whether he has finished mastering his jutsu. Although Naruto is confident that he is at the final stage, Yamato tells them that Naruto still needs some more time.

Elsewhere,
Kakuzu
 uses his
Earth Release: Earth Spear
 to harden his body to survive
Chōji
's
Spiked Human Bullet Tank
. As
Shikamaru
 is reaching his limits with the
Shadow Imitation Technique
 he is using to trap
Hidan
, Kakuzu prepares to finish off the trio when
Kakashi
 manages to sneak up from behind and strike Kakuzu's heart with his
Lightning Cutter
. However, Kakuzu survives the attack. Kicking Kakashi away, he takes off his
Akatsuki
 robe to reveal his
true body, held together by strings
 and four masks on his back, one of them punctured by Kakashi's Lightning Cutter. Kakuzu unleashes all four masks, but the damaged one succumbs and dies, alerting Kakashi to their weak spot.

Hidan, freed from Shikamaru's jutsu, goes toe-to-toe with Kakashi as Kakuzu, taking advantage of Hidan's immortality, strikes the two with his
Wind Release: Pressure Damage
. Kakuzu then turns his attention on the other three, with
Ino
 having entered the fray, and launches his
Lightning Release: False Darkness
 technique at them. Kakashi arrives in the nick of time and manages to absorb and block the attack, although it strains his arms. Hidan praises Kakashi to be the first to survive both of the techniques, and Kakuzu launches his
Fire Release: Intelligent Hard Work
 at all four
shinobi
.
