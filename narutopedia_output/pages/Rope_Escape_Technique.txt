A tenet of
shinobi
 is that they must escape any situation, no matter how difficult things may seem. Accordingly, this is the first
jutsu
 taught in
Konohagakure
's
Ninja Academy
. When the user is bound, they do what they can to escape, such as by finding a way to untie the knot or dislocating their joints in order to get free of the bindings. Although this is the most basic of the escape-based jutsu, it is still fairly complicated to perform.
