 manga.

Summary

As
Team 7
 stand together,
Naruto
 examines
Sasuke
's
Fire Release
 and
dōjutsu
 while Sasuke examines Naruto's
new form
. Wildly impressed by his son,
Minato
 notes that his son was even able to
change the shape and the nature of his Rasengan
.
Kiba
 exclaims that
Team 8
 will be going too, declaring they won't lose to Team 7. He then reveals he can create
shadow clones
 like Naruto, who isn't impressed since he only produced one clone. Kiba, stating he still has three times the power, uses the
Human Beast Mixture Transformation — Three-Headed Wolf
 technique with it, and
decimates
 several of the
Ten-Tails
'
clone minions
. Evading an attack and moving into close-range
Shino
 punches one, activating the
Parasitic Giant Insect — Bug Bite
 technique using his special
kidaichū
.
Hinata
, encouraged by thoughts of
Neji
 and Naruto, finishes the
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
 on a mini-clone, noting that Naruto has always been working hard and she's always been by his side; activating her
Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists
 she declares that she'd use the two attacks together this time.

Team Asuma
, not to be outshone by the other
Rookie Nine
, use
Ino–Shika–Chō
 "Formation E":
Human Bullet Yo-Yo
, wiping out several clones.
Sai
, who notes that he's also part of Team 7, makes an attempt at the main body via an aerial strike while flying on his
ink bird
. When one of its clones starts attacking him, Naruto uses his
chakra arms
 to save him. The
Allied Shinobi Forces
 note that the fight is pointless for the clones continue to multiply and grow. Sai asks Naruto if he can
give chakra to the alliance
, but he explains he cannot since he has not saved up enough of
Kurama
's
chakra
. Sai suggests that it would be best to defeat the largest of the clones, and slip close enough to beat the Ten-Tails itself, but it would be too far to jump at one go. He explains, however, that if they were to suffer severe wounds, the medical group would not be able to make it up front. Naruto,
Sakura
 and Sasuke simultaneously use the
Summoning Technique
, saying that they fortunately have a solution to the problem. Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke summon
Gamakichi
,
Katsuyu
,
Aoda
, each the solution to one problem.
