This article is about the fire technique. For the wind and fire technique, see
Wind Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet
.

This is a
cooperation ninjutsu
 performed by a
toad
 and a
fire
 user who have achieved mental and physical harmony with each other. The toad (specifically a large toad such as
Gamabunta
) uses its large lung capacity to spray
toad oil
 from its mouth at a target. The fire user then ignites the oil, increasing the attack's range and power;
Jiraiya
 uses
Fire Release: Flame Bullet
 for this purpose.
 In the anime,
Naruto Uzumaki
 instead sets flame to the oil with an
exploding tag
.
 The resulting cloud of fire is great enough that it forces
Manda
 to shed its skin to escape.
