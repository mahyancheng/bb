The user shapes their
sand
 into a wall to protect against attacks or to block an enemy's path. While initially appearing more curved, Gaara's usage eventually was shaped to appear more structured like a stonewall.

Shinki's utilises
Iron Sand
 to perform this technique, which has proven to be capable of withstanding the
Sickle Weasel Technique
 and
Urashiki Ōtsutsuki
's fishing hook with ease.

Trivia

Although Gaara first used this technique against
Kimimaro
, the technique was not revealed in the
second databook
 (as many other techniques of that time were), but instead in the
fourth
 (long after its introduction).
