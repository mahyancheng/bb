Scientific ninja tools.



Scientific Ninja Tools
 (
科学忍具
,
Kagaku Ningu
) are a class of advanced ninja tools produced in the decades following the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 as a result of unprecedented cooperation and networking between the
hidden villages
, as well as the declassifying of military technologies for civilian research.

Konohagakure
's
Scientific Ninja Weapons Team
, helmed by
Katasuke Tōno
, are considered leaders in this field of study.
 The secret society
Kara
 is also responsible for the advancement and proliferation of scientific ninja tools, with their leader,
Jigen
, and resident scientist,
Amado Sanzu
, amassing and further refining the technology well beyond the capabilities of even Konohagakure.

Types of Scientific Ninja Tools

Scientific ninja tools can generally be organised into one of four categories depending on their function and method of operation:





A Condenser Type tool.



Condenser Type
 (
コンデンサ型
,
Kondensa-gata
) scientific ninja tools utilise a Chakra Condenser (
チャクラ・コンデンサ
,
Chakura Kondensa
) to accumulate the
chakra
 necessary to launch a
jutsu
 using a special system that reads Scroll Cartridges. In addition to allowing
shinobi
 to perform jutsu without expending their own chakra, individuals with no ninja training are able to use ninjutsu so long as they know how to operate the device. Condenser Type scientific ninja tools are subject to some limitations, namely the capacity of Chakra Condensers and which types of jutsu can be reproduced.

Bionic Type
 (
バイオニック型
,
Baionikku-gata
) scientific ninja tools are prosthetic limbs and artificial organs based on the engineering of traditional
puppets
 and research into the unique properties of
Hashirama Senju
's cells, which utilise artificial
chakra pathways
 to integrate and interface with the recipient's body as if they were a natural part of it. The large numbers of combat injuries sustained by shinobi created widespread demand for these procedures, and in the years following the Fourth Shinobi World War, civilians were also able to take advantage of them.

Amplification Type
 (
増輻型
,
Zōfuku-gata
) scientific ninja tools are powered by the user's chakra or triggered by activating a jutsu, enhancing and amplifying their natural abilities or activating unique effects. Because the effects produced by these devices are purely physical phenomena, they typically cannot be nullified or absorbed by other jutsu.

Advanced Technology Type
 (
先進技術型
,
Saishin Gijutsu-gata
) scientific ninja tools are traditional ninja tools that have been improved using state of the art advancements in science and technology. These include nonmetal kunai constructed from super-hard ceramics, heat-insulated and puncture-resistant combat uniforms, reinforced monomolecular wires, miniaturised telecommunication devices, remote-controlled drone weapons, and a variety of other weapons and tools. In a broad sense this category also includes other modern
technologies
 such as the
Thunder Trains
 and computers. It is expected that a new generation of shinobi will excel in using these advanced technologies, taking on a specialised role similar to
Medical-nin
 and
Sensor Types
.

Shinobi-Ware

Main article:
Shinobi-Ware

Integrated Mechanical Ninja Tools
 (
内蔵機械忍具
,
Naizō Kikai Ningu
), known simply as
Shinobi-Ware
 (
シノビ・ウェアー
,
Shinobi Ueā
), are bionic type
scientific ninja tools
 that have been developed to be used as prosthetics or implants for both civilian and combat use.

As bionic type scientific ninja tools, they incorporate the engineering of traditional
puppets
 and research into the unique properties of
Hashirama Senju
's cells, and utilise artificial
chakra pathways
 to interface with the recipient's body.

Originally invented and developed by
Katasuke Tōno
, members of
Kara
 also possess advanced Shinobi-Ware after Katasuke's research was stolen and the designs were expanded upon by Kara Inner
Amado Sanzu
.

Scientific Ninja Weapons Team

This list refers to tools designed and distributed by Konohagakure's Scientific Ninja Weapons Team, lead by Katasuke Tōno.

Foam Spray

The
Foam Spray
 (
泡スプレー
,
Awa Supurē
) is an advanced technology type scientific ninja tool invented by the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team which forms a film on an injured person's skin, sealing cuts and boosting their innate healing powers to heal wounds more quickly.

Scroll Cartridge

A
Scroll Cartridge
 (
巻物カートリッジ
,
Makimono Kātorijji
) is a special type of scroll used as ammunition for certain scientific ninja tools. At first appearing as a normal sealing scroll, upon absorbing a technique it shrinks down to the size of a bullet and can then be loaded into a tool to be activated later. When a
nature transformation
 technique is activated from a Scroll Cartridge, its elemental release is typically suffixed with "Bullet" (
弾
,
Dan
).

Shinobi Gauntlet

The
Shinobi Gauntlet
 is a gauntlet developed by Katasuke that allows the user to quickly and easily activate techniques sealed in Scroll Cartridges.

Smoke-Flash Bomb

Smoke-Flash Bomb
 is an advanced technology type scientific ninja tool invented by the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team that has the ability to numb a person's senses with intense sound and light when their hearing and sight are exposed.

Shijima

Shijima
 (
シジマ
,
literally meaning:
 Stillness) is a large device invented by the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team that negates sound by colliding specific phases of sound waves, the opposite principle of resonance. As it is large and currently negates all sound, its practical applications are limited.

Climbing mitts and boots

These climbing mitts and boots, which were invented by the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team, are amplification type scientific ninja tools that utilise
Van der Waals forces
 in order to allow the wearer to climb and walk on walls without relying on continuous chakra use after being initially activated.

Kite Transport

This kite-like device, which was invented by the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team, is an invention that allows the user to fly, even though it's difficult to control.

Chakra Blade

The
Chakra Blade
 (
チャクラ刀
,
Chakuratō
), an amplification type scientific ninja tool, is a bladeless katana invented by the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team that uses the wielder's
chakra
 to emit a
Chakra Blade
. As a prototype, its high chakra consumption rate renders it too impractical to use.

Powered Suit

The
Powered Suit
 (
パワースーツ
,
Pawā Sūtsu
) was designed for nursing and rehabilitation care, but was modified by Katasuke for combat purposes, allowing its
gauntlets
 to create
orbs which absorb ninjutsu
. The right gauntlet was stolen by
Ao
, while at the same time
Boruto
 began wearing the left one.

Nue Sync Headset

In the anime, this device was designed for the purpose of
Sumire Kakei
 keeping
Nue
 under control. Sumire wears a headset that enables her to sync her eyesight with Nue's.

Lightning Release Suit

In the anime,
Denki
 was able to create a prototype
combat suit
 powered by
Lightning Release
 to enhance his speed and physical might. It features a motion sensor system that constantly analyses and anticipates enemy attacks, which has been compared to the
Sharingan
.

Fūinjutsu Cuffs

During his time with the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team, Amado developed
fūinjutsu
 handcuffs, which when placed on a captive, prevent them from using any ninjutsu.

Kara

This list refers to tools created by Kara's Amado, which were then distributed or implanted into both Outer and Inners of the organisation.

Microscopic Scientific Ninja Tools

These
tools
 are integrated in the members which allow them to transform their appendages for various uses, ranging from weapons to jet propulsion.

Autonomous Puppets

Autonomous
puppets
, or automatons, are condenser type scientific ninja tools that act independently without a puppeteer. They can be outfitted with Scroll Cartridges to use techniques
Fire Release Bullet: "Blaze"
. These are also used by
Kirigakure
.

According to character trivia from
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
:

The puppets' attributes are: 100 in strength, 10 in negotiation, 0※ in chakra, 30 in intelligence, 80 in perception, and 100 in dexterity. (※The Puppet Weapon's chakra is stored in and used from a condenser.)

They were also given a skill rating in these particular areas:

.

Mirror Drones

Remotely chakra-controlled
drones
 that can be used to attack from high up in the sky.

Trivia

According to Katasuke,
Kawaki
's body was modified with inorganic technologies to the point he can be considered a living scientific ninja tool.

According to Kawaki, the requirement to control all the technologies implanted into the body requires a core, at least the size of a heart. Should this core be destroyed, all the implants will go out of control.

In the anime, the prototype chakra blade's colour differs depending on the wielder. When used by
Boruto Uzumaki
, the blade is blue. When used by Ao, the blade is red.

After
Momoshiki
's and
Kinshiki
's assault on Konoha,
Kurotsuchi
 called out on Konoha's secret research of Scientific Ninja Tools that led to the development of advanced weaponry such as the Shinobi Gauntlet, accusing them of stockpiling on military power to gain advantage over the other villages. As a result, she demanded them to declassify all Scientific Ninja Tools research to the rest of the
Shinobi Union
 or she would withdraw
Iwagakure
 from the Union.
