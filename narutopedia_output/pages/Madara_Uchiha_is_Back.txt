"
Madara Uchiha is Back
" (
うちはマダラ、参る
,
Uchiha Madara, Mairu
,
Viz:
 Uchiha Madara Returns) is chapter 657 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Giving their opponent no time to relent,
Sasuke
 engulfs
Madara
 in the flames of
Amaterasu
. Madara removes his armour, as
Naruto
 insists that is was pointless to simply attack Madara, while
Hashirama
 is puzzled as to why their opponent had closed his eyes. Emerging unscathed from the flames, Madara turns his attention to Hashirama, whom he reminds of the last conversation they had at the
Naka Shrine
, revealing that he believed that only the power of the
Uchiha
 and
Senju
 could bring true bliss. Launching his counterattack, Madara knocks both Naruto and
Sai
 aside and uses the
black receivers
 he had embedded in Hashirama earlier to immobilise his target. Using this opportunity, Madara absorbs Hashirama's
senjutsu
 chakra, which reflects on the face of Hashirama jutting out of his chest.
 Lamenting of the level of power which he was easily able to control, Madara is once again forced on the defensive, as he is attacked by Sasuke once more. Lauding the younger Uchiha for his
Mangekyō Sharingan
, Madara decides that Sasuke's
dōjutsu
 would make a perfect substitute until his
Rinnegan
 came back. Elsewhere,
Black Zetsu
 notes that
Obito
 would die soon after reviving Madara, and declares that he would now retrieve Madara's eye. Set upon by both
Kakashi
 and
Minato
, Zetsu merges with Obito, and explains that he was the only thing keeping Obito alive at this point in time. Explaining how he had escaped from the
Hokage Guard Platoon
 and bided his time, Zetsu exclaims that he was Madara's will and would go as far as to use Obito's body to defeat them.
Staving
 off another attack from his opponents, Madara soon sets his unseeing gaze upon the
tailed beasts
, determined to hunt them down.

Trivia
