Rōshi
 (
老紫
) was a shinobi of
Iwagakure
 and the
jinchūriki
 of the Four-Tails,
Son Gokū
.

Background






Rōshi with Han facing Team 6.



Rōshi became the jinchūriki of Son Gokū over forty years before the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 at a young age.
 During the
Third Shinobi World War
, Rōshi was paired with fellow Iwa jinchūriki,
Han
, and confronted
Team 6
. As the two jinchūriki fired their
Tailed Beast Balls
,
Minato Namikaze

teleported
 his team to safety.
 Rōshi eventually left his home town of Iwagakure at some point to better understand and control the power of the beast within him.

Personality

Son Gokū mentioned that Rōshi was just as hard-headed as
Ōnoki
, the Third
Tsuchikage
. Despite this, upon observing
Naruto Uzumaki
's battle against
Tobi
 and his
Six Paths of Pain
, as well as his knowledge of the tailed beasts final meeting with the
Sage of the Six Paths
, he came to regrettably believe that all the jinchūriki could have walked down the right path if they were more like the young man. Also despite being Son's jinchūriki for over forty years,
 he never referred to the beast by its true name, stating that he had not become soft-hearted enough to do such a thing. Before Son was resealed into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, he revealed to the beast that he never forgot its name, making peace with the giant monkey.

Appearance

Rōshi had red hair, moustache and beard which tapered off to a point. He was shown wearing a large headpiece consisting of a three pointed crown-like ridge, bearing both his Iwagakure
forehead protector
, a ring, and a prominent black piece of armour running across his cheeks and the bridge of his nose. He wore a long-sleeved magenta kimono shirt and pants, with mesh-armour shirt and fitted black suit underneath, along with calf-length sandals. Around his waist he wore a brown sash that held a brown armour-like breast plate with a pouch in the front, a brown back plate on the back that is connected to the front with mesh armour, and armoured lapels falling to the sides. Interestingly, his headpiece, hair and beard seemed to model his tailed beast's. After leaving his village, Rōshi discarded his forehead protector
 and his armour plating battle attire. Instead, he only wore his kimono with a mesh shirt beneath it.

During the
Third Shinobi World War
, Rōshi's facial hair was small stubble on his upper lip.

Abilities






Rōshi manifesting his Lava Release Chakra Mode.



Rōshi had been noted to be a powerful shinobi, forcing
Kisame Hoshigaki
 not to play around with capturing him as he was a tough opponent,
 and leaving
Samehada
 with bad vibes from their encounter.
 He was also seen using a curved
kunai
 with which it can be assumed that he had proficiency wielding.
 After his reincarnation and serving as one of Tobi's Six Paths of Pain, Rōshi was equipped with both the
Sharingan
 and
Rinnegan
. Combining the perceptual and predictive abilities of the former with the shared field of vision ability of the latter, allowed Rōshi to use his attacks in a more precise and coordinated fashion as well as react to enemy attacks more efficiently, both individually and in conjunction and with the other jinchūriki.

Ninjutsu

Nature Transformation






Rōshi using his Lava Release: Scorching Stream Rock Technique.



Like his tailed beast, by combining
Fire
 and
Earth Release
, Rōshi was able to use
Lava Release
. With the
kekkei genkai
, he could spew multiple
molten rocks
 from his mouth, firing them in different directions to make it difficult for an enemy to evade. He is able to create an
armour of lava
 that will burn anyone or anything that comes into contact with him. The armour also increases the damage of his
taijutsu

attacks
 to the point that it could burn Naruto in his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 despite not making physical contact with him.

Jinchūriki Transformations

Jinchūriki Forms






Rōshi transformed into Son Gokū.



As Son Gokū's jinchūriki, Rōshi was granted a significant amount of its chakra and stamina. The full extent of his
control
 is unknown, but he could
fully manifest
 the beast to cast a
Tailed Beast Ball
.
 After being
reincarnated
, when he was immobilised by B's
clone
, he transformed into his
Version 2
 form, and he was able to create an enormous
torrent of lava
, scorching Gyūki. When Rōshi attacked Naruto and Killer B, Tobi forced him to transform into his
Tailed Beast Mode
. In this form, he displayed tremendous strength, being able to toss Killer B in his Tailed Beast Mode a considerable distance away.

Part II

Itachi Pursuit Mission

After being found by the
Akatsuki
 members Kisame and
Itachi Uchiha
, the former chose to confront Rōshi alone, leading to the pair fighting. Exploiting Rōshi's weakness to
Water Release
, Kisame managed to capture the jinchūriki after a difficult battle. Afterwards, his unconscious body was taken by Kisame, who took him to one of his organisation's hideouts, where the Four-Tails was
extracted
 from his body, resulting in his death.

Rōshi reincarnated, alongside the other jinchūriki.



In preparation for the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Rōshi was
reincarnated
 by
Kabuto Yakushi
 to fight against the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, before being mobilised alongside the other deceased jinchūriki. As dawn broke on the second day of war, it was revealed that
Tobi
 had turned the reincarnated jinchūriki into his own customised Six Paths of Pain, with each having a Rinnegan and Sharingan in place of their left and right eyes respectively. Each jinchūriki also had their particular tailed beast resealed within them and a
chakra receiver
 embedded into their bodies.

Rōshi attacks Naruto.



Rōshi later travelled together with Tobi, in pursuit of Naruto and
Killer B
. Encountering their targets, the reincarnated jinchūriki were sent into battle with Rōshi leading the offensive, using his
Lava Release: Scorching Stream Rock Technique
 to pressure the enemy. When this initial assault failed, he, like the others, unleashed the power of their respective
tailed beast
 by materialising the first of its tails. Whilst Naruto and B conversed, Rōshi exploited this opportunity to attack the former directly, after covering his body in
lava
. Despite evading the strike, Naruto's face was still scorched by the heat, but when Rōshi attacked again, Naruto endured the blow in an attempt to destroy the chakra receiver embedded in Rōshi's chest. However, this was thwarted by
Han
.






Rōshi fights Naruto in his Version 2 form.



Incapacitated in the wake of the
Eight-Tails
'
devastating attack
, after B's recent transformation, Rōshi was then restrained by the latter's
sealing technique
. However, before the technique's completion, he managed to escape by adopting his
Version 2
 form, where he then proceeded to
burn
 the Eight-Tails. Regrouping with the other reincarnated jinchūriki, after
Kakashi Hatake
 and
Might Guy
's intervention, Rōshi charged past the pair towards Naruto and B.






Rōshi transformed as Son Gokū battling Killer B transformed as Gyūki.



When he clashes with the former, Tobi forcefully transformed him into his full Four-Tails form, where he then proceeded to assault the Eight-Tails. Grabbing one of the beast's tails, Rōshi hurled the two jinchūriki upwards and, after dislodging Naruto in the process, prepared to swallow him. However, despite Naruto's efforts to lodge himself between the beast's jaws, and B's attempts to restrain the ape, the former is ultimately swallowed whole. While Naruto conversed subconsciously with Son Gokū, Rōshi resisted B's efforts to free his captive comrade, only to be forced to eject Naruto when the young man
multiplied
. He then tried to impede Naruto from removing the chakra receiver embedded in the beast's chest, but failed to do so thanks to a coordinated
strike
, leaving Rōshi's incapacitated body behind as Son Gokū was resealed into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
.






Rōshi and Son part ways on good terms.



When a
transformed
 Naruto's
Tailed Beast Ball
 later clashed with the collaborative one formed by the other tailed beasts, Rōshi's unconscious body was protected by the Eight-Tails from the resulting blast. Afterwards, Naruto subconsciously met with the other beasts and their jinchūriki, where it was revealed that shortly before Son was resealed, Rōshi questioned his beast as to whether it thought they too had taken the wrong path during life. He then stated that despite not being considerate enough to have spoken it, he had not forgotten the beast's real name. As the two fade away, a smiling Rōshi asked the beast if calling it "
Son
" would be all right. After Son was resealed into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, Rōshi and the other jinchūriki's corpses were collected by B and held in Gyūki's tentacles. With the release of the Impure World Reincarnation, Rōshi and the others are enveloped in a light of sorts before their bodies start to deconstruct and Rōshi's soul returned to the afterlife.

Trivia

The name "Rōshi" is made up of the kanji for "old/elderly" (
老
) and "purple" (
紫
). It can also mean "old teacher/master" (
老師
).

In order to prevent the jinchūriki from turning traitor, it is tradition for the host to be selected from the family of the village's own Kage. It might be that Rōshi somehow was connected with one of the Tsuchikage. Due to Son mentioning Onoki with some familiarity, its possible that Rōshi had some relation with him.

In the manga, Rōshi's headpiece is depicted as having a golden ring on the left side. The golden ring on Rōshi's headpiece was not present in the anime. This was later added as of
episode 256
.
