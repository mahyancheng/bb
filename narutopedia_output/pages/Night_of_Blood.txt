Naruto
 manga.

Summary

The
Nine-Tails
 recalls Naruto's growth.
Naruto
 says he'll do something about the Nine-Tails' hatred as well, one day. In turn, the Nine-Tails reproaches him for thinking he can do it. In the battlefield,
Neji
 collapses from overuse of the
Byakugan
; so,
Kiba
 has him go to the
medical unit
.
Nagato
 and
Itachi
 talk about
Akatsuki
, their
dōjutsu
 and what their
summoner
 has in mind for them. Itachi states that the combination of his Mangekyō Sharingan, coupled with Nagato's Rinnegan could be almost unstoppable. At the Logistical Support and Medical Division, medical-nin heal the wounded. Three
jōnin
-level medical-nin are later found dead. The sensors say they have not detected the enemy, and suspicion arises that someone is being controlled.
Sakura
 argues that despite that, they must keep healing the shinobi. Neji opts to find the spy. Sakura receives a love letter from another shinobi but tells him she has feelings for someone else. Two medical-nin are later seen preparing to get back to work, but Neji then reveals himself as the killer. He attacks and presumably kills the two medical-nin.
