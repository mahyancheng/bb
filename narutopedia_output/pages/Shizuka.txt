Shizuka
 (
シズカ
) is a
kunoichi
 and the current leader of the
Nadeshiko Village
. She was destined to marry a student of
Jiraiya
 that can defeat her, because of a law from her village.

Background

While still training under her
mentor
, Shizuka developed a relationship with a merchant named
Sagiri
, despite the law of her village. While they hoped to one day change that law, Sagiri was one day killed, prompting Shizuka to live solely for her training and duties to the village, resigned to never love again. In the end, she said that she was going to become stronger one day.

At some point, she had become the target of
Kokuyō
, who wanted to defeat her for her hand in marriage in order to rule the Nadeshiko Village, and came after her numerous times despite a seemingly crushing defeat at every encounter. Prior to encountering with Naruto, Shizuka had defeated Kokuyō ninety-eight times, each time easily destroying his
puppet
 and sending him flying.

Personality

After Sagiri's death, Shizuka became heartbroken and stopped loving so she would never lose someone dear to her again and so that she could become stronger.
Tokiwa
 believes that she is only punishing herself. During her time with Sagiri, she also voiced her objection towards her village's law, hoping to change it. After hearing Naruto's resolve to make Sakura happier, she decides to become much more powerful, and someday, find someone to love without having to force them.

Appearance

Shizuka is a fair-skinned girl of average height with an athletic yet curvaceous build. She has green eyes and waist-length black hair in a hime-style cut tied in a high ponytail with short bangs and chin-length strands framing her face. Normally, she wears a light-green kimono or a beige hooded robe when not battling. While on missions, she has a black forehead protector and wears her village's form-fitting kunoichi uniform; it is grey-coloured with a right shoulder-guard, grey gloves, and opening in her shirt which reveals some of her sizeable cleavage.
