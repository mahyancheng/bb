A trap technique that is activated when one comes into contact with the user's
chakra
. Upon doing so, pre-existing mud will form into wolves and attack. Despite being damaged, the wolves will simply reform, keeping the enemy occupied while the user makes a getaway. The only drawback about this technique is that setting it up is time-consuming and could allow the opponent to catch up.
