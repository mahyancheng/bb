Due to his mysterious connection to the
Three-Tails
, Yūkimaru is able to at least partially control the Three-Tails. At first, Yūkimaru can only make an apparition of the beast appear, after taking some of
Kabuto
's pills. Later, after taking a larger dosage of the pills (combined with
Guren
's
Crystal Release

technique
) he is able to make the beast fully appear, but couldn't control it. Later, when Guren is in danger of being harmed by the Three-Tailed Beast, he is able to halt it completely without Kabuto's pills. When Guren seemingly sacrificed her life to save him, Yūkimaru lost control of himself and used his powers to the fullest which enhanced the Three-Tails strength and rampage enabling it to break through the
Four-Corner Sealing Barrier
. This could mean that, like
Naruto
's
jinchūriki forms
, this ability is tied to his emotions.

Shizune
 concluded that due to the extensive toll this ability took on Yūkimaru's body, his lifespan was shortened, and he lost the ability altogether.

Trivia

Yamato
 referred to this skill as "the ability to synchronise with a tailed beast".
