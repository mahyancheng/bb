Katsuyu: Immense Network Healing
 is a cooperation ninjutsu used by Katsuyu and its summoner using the link shared via the
Strength of a Hundred Seal
.

Usage

Firstly, Katsuyu
divides
 its body into several smaller clones, and then each attaches itself to a person. The slug's summoner then channels their
medical chakra
 through Katsuyu, who in turn
transfers
 it to the wounded person, healing their wounds, restoring their stamina and chakra reserves.

This technique allows the user to heal a great number of people simultaneously regardless of distance. While using this technique, the user is linked with Katsuyu, allowing them to communicate with the slug and sense what it encountered on the battlefield.
