"
The Last Mission
" (
最後の任務
,
Saigo no Ninmu
) is episode 498 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Shino
 has his
kikaichū
 report to him about others buying
Naruto
 and
Hinata
's wedding gifts. He shows the insects to
Academy
 students, one of them wanting to become
Hokage
, much like Naruto.
Iruka
 watches them from afar. Shino encourages them to follow their dreams. Shino meets up with
Kiba
, who complains he's late. Shino tells him all their friends have already gotten a gift. Kiba is taking buying the wedding gift as a very serious mission, as it's the last mission they'll have as
Team 8
. The two ask
Kurenai
 for advice. Kurenai tells them about a rare honey wine that the
Senju clan
 would gift in certain occasions.
 The two leave for
Sora-ku
, where a
beekeeper
 who supposedly makes the wine lives. They come across a
ninneko
,
Momo
, who refuses to share information with them, antagonising them over Akamaru and their dog and insect scents. They try baiting him with catnip and pursue it, but
Tamaki
 protects him, and apologises for his behaviour. Kiba flirts with Tamaki. Tamaki gives them directions to find the beekeeper. When looking for him, Shino ends up being lost in thought and loses track of Kiba. Shino is attacked by the beekeeper, but manages to deceive him. The beekeeper assumes Shino wants to kill him, but just gives him the honey wine when asked for it. Shino asks for directions to leave, but is told there is something like a barrier, keeping those who come in wandering around. The fog has a component that stirs doubt on those in it. Kiba manages to leave the area with no problem, while Shino recalls his earlier conversations with Academy students, Kiba, and Kurenai, which lead him to question how to live as a shinobi after Team 8. The beekeeper tries to keep Shino enslaved to his doubt, but his resolve to find a new path allows him to leave. Shino meets up with Kiba, and the two leave with the honey wine. Shino speaks with the Academy students again, further motivating them. Iruka suggests Shino should be a teacher.
