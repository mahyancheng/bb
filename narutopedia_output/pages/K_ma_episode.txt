 anime.

Synopsis

The abandoned building collapses under the toad's weight.
Ao
 uses
Water Release
 to push
Boruto
 out of the debris' way, and is crushed by the
toad
.
Koji
 wonders what motivated Ao to use ninjutsu at the very end, and introduces himself after releasing his summon. He congratulates them for the battle, having quite enjoyed it, and aggravates Boruto by belittling Ao's emotions.
Konohamaru
 probes him for more information on
Kara
, but Koji reveals nothing. Koji
seals their movements
, and readies himself to
incinerate
 them. Konohamaru breaks free of the seal with
one of his own
. The two begin to fight, Koji countering and avoiding Konohamaru's taijutsu and
Fire Release
. Koji counters Konohamaru's
Rasengan
 with one of his own, to everyone's surprise.
 He detonates a toad he planted on Konohamaru, who catches on fire. The seal on Boruto's hand activates and spreads, absorbing the seal and the flames on Konohamaru, who collapses. Koji recognises it as
Kāma
, surprised that Boruto was the one chosen by
Momoshiki
. Boruto sees the seal spread over his arm before passing out. Koji retreats as thanks for showing him something interesting.
Sarada
 wants to force answers out of him, but
Mitsuki
 holds her back, not wanting to risk their team-mates lives. Koji approves of his judgement, aware his parent is
Orochimaru
. Later, after having recovered, the group makes a grave for Ao, and wonder about Kara.
Amado
 reviews his files on
Code
, and recalls that Koji and
Boro
 have not yet been cleared as traitors. He leaves his station for a moment, and
Delta
 sneaks in to check on the files on Code. Considering him and Boro clean, she considers Koji to be the traitor. Elsewhere in the hideout, Code is frustrated with another member. Konohamaru wants to return to the
village
 because they have a lot to report. Boruto asks about
Chamaru
, but
Katasuke
 assures him that if anything happens, he'll return to the lab on his own. They find the remains of a battle with more autonomous puppets and investigate. They're far more damaged than the ones
Team 7
 defeated. Chamaru draws their attention to a
passed out boy
, who they believe to be the one who defeated the puppets. Despite Konohamaru's warning, Boruto approaches him, and notices he has the same mark as him.
