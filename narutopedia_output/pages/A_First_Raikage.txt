A
 (
エー
,
Ē
,
Viz:
 Ei,
English TV:
 Ay) was the
First
Raikage
 (
初代雷影
,
Shodai Raikage
,
literally meaning:
 First or Founding Lightning Shadow) who founded
Kumogakure
 in the
Land of Lightning
.

Background

During his leadership in the early days of Kumogakure after the
Warring States Period
, A presumably sent the
Gold and Silver Brothers
 to capture the
Nine-Tails
, a task at which they ultimately failed.
 He also gave land in the
Valley of Clouds and Lightning
 to the
Yotsuki Clan
 in return for their loyalty.






The first ever summit of the five Kage is convened.



At the first
meeting of the five Kage
, he was accompanied by the future
Second Raikage
; his long-time bodyguard.
 He sat alongside the other Kage and told Hashirama that bowing to other Kage was not a sign of a lasting leader. After asking the
First Kazekage
 to give voice to his alternative request, since
Sunagakure
 already had a
tailed beast
, he expressed outrage when the Kazekage made a demand of receiving 30% of whatever they would pay for a tailed beast from
Konoha
. As infighting broke out and
Hashirama Senju
 made his plea to them to preserve the future of their children and unite, he looked on intently.

Before his death during the war, A would leave a strong moral mark related to his desire to protect Kumogakure in his bodyguard, whose long service and dedication earned him the nomination as his successor.

Personality

While not much was seen of his personality, A did seemingly have a verbal tic, ending his sentences with "yo" (
よ
).
 He also seemed to have a habit of folding his arms. He was a prideful man and held the idea that shinobi shouldn't lower their heads so easily. A had a strong will to protect Kumogakure, something he passed down to his successor.

Appearance






A wearing the Raikage headpiece.



A was a dark-skinned man, with prominent creases under his eyes and a mop of shaggy black hair, which partially obscured his
forehead protector
. In terms of attire, he wore a high-collared dark kimono-shirt, dark pants bound by a sash and a light-coloured scarf around his neck. He also wore small stud-earrings. In the anime, his attire consists of a cream-coloured coat with a high collar, a white forehead protector, zōri and a purple scarf around his neck.

Abilities

As the First Raikage and the founder of Kumo, A was undoubtedly a powerful shinobi.

Pure Land
 by
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki

tailed beasts
 and
