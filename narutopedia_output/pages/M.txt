Mū
 (
無
) was the
Second
Tsuchikage
 (
二代目土影
,
Nidaime Tsuchikage
,
literally meaning:
 Second Earth Shadow) of
Iwagakure
.
 During his lifetime, Mū was renowned as the "
Non-Person
" (
無人
,
Mujin
,
Viz:
 Null-Man) due to
his ability
 which left him with neither a physical form nor detectable
chakra
 signature.

Background






Mū and Ōnoki confront Madara.



Some time before the
First Shinobi World War
, Mū and
Ōnoki
 met with
Madara Uchiha
, after an alliance had been formed between their respective villages. Despite their standing, Madara boldly declared that
Konohagakure
 would remain the dominant power and as such, they should obey any orders given. This culminated in both parties engaging in battle where Mū and Ōnoki were defeated.
 Mū accompanied the
First Tsuchikage
 to the first ever Five
Kage Summit
. There he stood behind the First watching diligently as the proceedings unfolded.
 During his lifetime, Mū taught Ōnoki how to use
Dust Release
.

It was during Mū's era as Second Tsuchikage that Iwagakure began to actively try to acquire other tailed beasts, having the
Four-Tails
 and the
Five-Tails
 already in its possession.
 He also had a great enmity with
Gengetsu Hōzuki
 and the two
kage
 eventually killed each other in what would be their final confrontation.

Personality

Mū was an extremely calm and collected individual, showing no signs of perturbation to his sudden
reincarnation
. He's also unfailingly polite, taking his time to recount the previous events to the other
Kage
 upon their forced
summoning
, and referring to the
one
 whom he killed and in turn was killed by with an honourific title, apparently bearing no ill-will towards him. In the anime, Mū was angrier at the Second Mizukage, even grabbing him by the collar of his coat and threatened to kill him.

Despite the seeming civility displayed towards his fellow Kage, Mū has demonstrated that he, first and foremost, prioritises the prosperity of his own village regardless of the manner in which this affluence is achieved, even reminding his disciple to take full advantage of any post-war situation to assure the dominance of Iwagakure by quickly seizing control of the resultant spoils.
 Even seconds before his sealing he attempted to warn Ōnoki to take precaution.
 This devious and somewhat merciless trait appears to be just one of the many reasons as to why the Second Mizukage despises him to such an extent. This under-handed tactic would later be taught to his student, which would become the reason for Iwa's bad reputation among the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
. However, in the anime, just before his soul returned to the afterlife, Mū had a change of heart and acknowledged that Ōnoki must secure the future of the Allied Shinobi Forces.

Despite Mū's views on alliances, he still attempted to help the Allied Shinobi Forces any way he could, even while being controlled. Right as one of his halves was sealed, he attempted to warn Ōnoki that he had
split
, but his message failed to reach his successor.

Appearance






Mū before becoming Tsuchikage.








Mū's full appearance.



Mū's entire body was covered by intricately wrapped (dark grey in manga, seaweed green in the anime) bandages, with only his violet-coloured eyes and nose being visible, giving him an overall mummy-like appearance. Along with this Mū wears a black headband (dark blue in the anime) with no distinguishing markings and a pair of black pants. He also doesn't wear shoes as his feet are also bandaged heavily. Due to the effects of the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 technique, he has black
sclerae
 and white irides after Kabuto Yakushi eradicates his personality.

When he was still alive, Mū was shown to have donned what appeared to be a standard
Iwagakure
's
flak jacket
 and
forehead protector
, with the village distinctive single sleeve outfit over his left arm. He also carried two
swords
 strapped to his back which had slender handles which were also bandaged. At the time of the first Kage Summit, where he accompanied the First Tsuchikage, Mū seemed to have worn a casual kimono.

Abilities






Mū turning invisible.



As the Second Tsuchikage, Mū was an immensely powerful
shinobi
, such that he was able to kill the Second Mizukage — albeit at the cost of his own life.
 Prior to becoming Tsuchikage, he was chosen to be the bodyguard of his
predecessor
.

Sensory Perception

Mū was a skilled
sensor-type
 shinobi, having displayed the ability to sense
chakra
 over a distance of several kilometres. He could also discern the similarity between chakra signatures belonging to close relatives, and distinguish chakra from
different populations
. Furthermore, when these detection capabilities were employed in conjunction with his quick reflexes, he could avoid techniques that even other Kage found difficult to evade, even from his blind-side.

Ninjutsu






Mū splitting in two during battle.



Mū was able to
split
 himself into two duplicates to help escape a lethal blow, but at the cost of reducing his power by half. He was also physically strong enough to lift massive rocks off of his body, even after taking heavy damage.
 While alive, Mū was seen carrying a pair of
swords
, implying that he was also skilled in
kenjutsu
.

Nature Transformation






Mū using Dust Release.



Mū was one of the few shinobi in history who could wield all five elemental
nature transformations
.
 He is also one of the few capable of utilising a
kekkei tōta
, an advanced and extremely powerful form of
kekkei genkai
. In particular, he possesses the
Dust Release
, which allows him to combine
fire
,
earth
, and
wind
 natures to reduce his opponents to nothing more than mere dust, destroying them down to even a molecular level. His capability with the Dust Release even compelled the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 leaders to summon Ōnoki on the battlefield as the only way to stop him. Mū himself declared that sheer numbers alone do not matter because of the nature of his techniques, despite confronting nearly the entire
Fourth Division
 at the time. While Mū was in his
split state
, he was not able to use Dust Release techniques due to his power being halved.

With Earth Release, Mū could
make his body light enough
 for flight. Through the use of
Water Release
 he was capable of completely
hiding his presence
, making it impossible to detect him by normal means.
. His camouflaging ability was so great, he became renowned as the "
Non-Person
" (
無人
,
Mujin
,
Viz:
 Null-Man), a title which he gained for having neither a physical form nor detectable chakra while the technique was active.
 Mū could also use
Yang Release
.

Intelligence

Mū appeared to be both extremely knowledgeable and analytical, being able to discern the exact method used to locate his position almost immediately after detection, seemingly without any prior information concerning the technique in question. He also apparently deciphered the mechanisms behind his
rival
's
Steaming Danger Tyranny
 and passed on the information to his student, as was later speculated by the Second Mizukage himself.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Main article:
Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Mū summons the other Kage.



In preparation for the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Mū was
reincarnated
 by
Kabuto Yakushi
 alongside three other deceased Kage to fight against the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. When they were mobilised, Mū was sent in the direction of the Fourth Division but despite being
invisible
 as he approached their location, he was
detected
 by
Gaara
 — a feat which he commended as he was forced to summon the
Third Raikage
, the
Second Mizukage
 and the
Fourth Kazekage
. After a brief argument with the Mizukage over the manner of their deaths, Mū noted the means of their reincarnation, and
searched
 for
Tobirama Senju
, believing him to responsible for their return before informing his fellow Kage that he could only pick up the presence of
someone
 whose chakra signature was similar to that of the Fourth Kazekage's and that, that person was backed by a large army. The Kazekage then explained that Tobirama had been dead for many years during his lifetime and that he knows
another
 who can use the deceased Hokage's technique as well. Mū and the other Kage pursued the division throughout the night, forcing their opisition into a slow retreat until cornering them.






The results of Ōnoki and Mū's battle.



He then detected two individuals approaching, who are preceded by a
colossal wave of sand
 that bore down on the Kage, but the Fourth Kazekage swiftly
counteracted
 this with his
Gold Dust
. At this point, Gaara appeared
suspended
 above them and sculpted hands of sand to ensnare the Kage, with only Mū able to escape captivity while sensing Ōnoki's presence above them. Greeting his old pupil he noted that Ōnoki had lived a long life thanks in part to him passing down his
teachings
 to him. Utilising the
same technique
 to repel that of his former disciple, the converging attacks resulted in a huge crater in the middle of the battlefield, leading Ōnoki to assert that his predecessor's strength hadn't waned. Suspecting a shinobi alliance had been formed due to the accumulation of
chakra
 types from different villages, Mū was even more surprised that such a merger has occurred when it was confirmed and even more so that Ōnoki had joined it. Informing his former disciple that only he could stop him, Mū reminded Ōnoki that by taking full advantage of the post-war situation, the dominance of
Iwagakure
 could be assured. Offending the Mizukage, the Raikage and most shockingly Ōnoki with such devious tactics, Mū immediately isolated himself when the battle resumed, pursued only by his student.






Mū is struck by Naruto's Planetary Rasengan.



As the chase concluded after the pair had seemingly clashed several times, Mū declared to an exhausted Ōnoki, that his age had caught up to him and as he
disappeared
 from view, and told him to call Gaara before he died as well. However, telling Mū not to underestimate him just yet, Ōnoki creates several
rock clones
. As their battle ensues, Mū took Ōnoki by surprise from behind in mid-air, but with Gaara's timely arrival and warning, Ōnoki managed to avoid the blow but threw his back out in the process. As Mū prepared to attack them with his Dust Release,
Naruto Uzumaki
 attempted an surprise attack with his
Planetary Rasengan
 technique, but, sensing the attack, Mū easily evaded it. Believing his technique to be the faster of the two, only the combined efforts of both Gaara and Naruto ensure that the latter lands a hit on a shocked Mū, which sent him hurtling through a nearby rocky outcrop. Colliding with the ground below, Ōnoki swiftly moved in and
weighed Mū's body down
, which prevented him from moving.






Mū's other half emerges from the rubble.



As Mū was being sealed within Gaara's
sand
, he told Ōnoki that for someone who detested other villages, he worked well with them, to which Ōnoki replied that he had lived long enough to experience such a change. Just as the
seal
 neared its completion, Mū attempted to warn them but was sealed in full before he could finish his sentence. The warning was revealed when Mū emerged from the rubble left in the wake of Naruto's devastating attack. Chastising his former disciple's naivety as his wounds heal, Mū reveals that he
split his body into two
 while it was obscured by the prior attack. Unable to remove the seal so he could reunite with his other half, Mū was made to begin summoning "
that
" reincarnation. Due to his weakened state, it took longer for Mū to complete the summoning. In the anime, it took so much time, Kabuto was required to summon various additional reincarnations to stall.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax






Mū summons Madara.



Eventually, Mū completed the
Summoning Technique
. Narrowly avoiding the summoned coffin's lid after it was violently blown off, Mū was shocked at the figure who emerged, remarking that the individual behind their reincarnation must have a good understanding of war to summon such a person. Together the pair walked towards Gaara and the Fourth Division, where it was revealed that the one Mū summoned was Madara Uchiha. When Madara noted that all of the shinobi were wearing similarly marked ("
shinobi
" (
忍
))
forehead protectors
, Mū informed him that an alliance had been formed in response to the on-going war. As Mū was unable to answer Madara's question about who was controlling them, Kabuto overrode Mū's consciousness and used him to talk directly with Madara. As the battle restarted, Mū narrowly avoided Gaara's attack, and attempted to form a Dust Release technique, but it soon dispersed due to his power in his split state. Observing the ensuing conflict, Kabuto continued to speak through Mū's where he remarked upon Madara's demonstration of the
Rinnegan
 and its power, even after the impact of two enormous
meteorites
.






Mū's soul begins departing.



Reforming in the wake of the collision, Kabuto had Mū approach the few remaining survivors of the Alliance, whilst providing Madara with a detailed overview of current affairs. However, when the two resumed their attack, they are repelled by
Tsunade
 and
A
 who had just been
transported
 to the battlefield. Recovering from A's punch, As
Mei
 created a thick
mist
, obscuring the battlefield, Kabuto positioned Mū right in front of Madara but he was easily knocked away by a
lightened
 A. Afterwards, Mū was pursued by
Dodai
 and the
Hokage Guard Platoon
. Once recovered, Mū continued to elude his pursuers under Kabuto's direction, as the battle between Madara and the Kage intensified. Later, with the Impure World Reincarnation being released, Mū's consciousness returns to him but only for a short while as he was enveloped in a light of sorts and began deconstructing, much to his shock, regaining his consciousness only mere moments before starting to break down and his soul returned to the afterlife. In the anime, before his soul ascends, Mū told his opponents to tell Ōnoki that he must protect the future of the Shinobi Alliance and only then can he come and tell him all about it.

Trivia

Mū (
無
) can mean "nothingness" or "non-existence", possibly alluding to his ability to become invisible.

His combination of bandage-covering and the
technique
 he uses may be referring to Griffin, the main character of "
The Invisible Man
" novel of H.G. Wells.

Despite Mū being noted to use the
Dustless Bewildering Cover
, which is stated to
manipulate water
, he is not listed as a Water Release user in the fourth databook.

Mū is the only Tsuchikage not known to be related to all the other Tsuchikage.

Quotes

(To Ōnoki) "
After the conflict ends, an alliance becomes squabble over spoils of war. The victor there becomes the new dominant power.
"

(Before returning to the afterlife) "
Tell Ōnoki he must secure the future of the Allied Shinobi Forces. Only then can he come and tell me about it.
"
