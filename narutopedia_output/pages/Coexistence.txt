 anime.

Synopsis

Kawaki
 wakes up in a hospital room with
Naruto
,
Shikamaru
, and
Konohamaru
 watching him. Despite Naruto's claim of safety, he attempts to run out through the window, but is stopped by Shikamaru with his
Shadow Imitation Technique
, who points out that if they wanted to harm him, they would have done it already. Naruto properly introduces himself to Kawaki, who remains silent. Shikamaru argues against harbouring Kawaki based on Konohamaru's report. Naruto counters that as a
jinchūriki
, he might have been placed under the same strict security Shikamaru wants to place on Kawaki if it wasn't for the
Third Hokage
's interference, but agrees that decision isn't his alone. During the
Five Kage Summit
,
Katasuke
 and Naruto report what
Konoha
 has learned about Kawaki.
 Through use of
shadow clones
, Naruto proposes to physically monitor Kawaki at all times, which the other
Kage
 agree to support.
Team 7
 discusses Kawaki, and
Boruto
 leaves to feed
Mugino
's turtle, who bites him. Konohamaru shows up to sort Mugino's belongings, and is surprised to learn Boruto has been to Mugino's before. The two discuss and recall Mugino. Mugino's turtle doesn't bite Konohamaru, who decides to adopt it. Kawaki tries fleeing Naruto when he takes Kawaki home, but Naruto gets ahead of him every time. When Boruto arrives home, he's surprised by Kawaki's presence, and Naruto explains he'll be living with them for a while. Boruto shares his concerns with Naruto, who in turn shares his experience as a jinchūriki as a reason not to mistreat Kawaki. Boruto tries talking to Kawaki, who flips a table, and breaks
Himawari
's vase. Boruto admonishes him, he apologises, and reveals his name.
