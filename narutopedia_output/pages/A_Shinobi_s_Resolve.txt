"
A Shinobi's Resolve
" (
忍の覚悟
,
Shinobi no Kakugo
) is episode 37 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Kakashi
 has
Boruto
 pinned down in a way that would require Boruto to break his own arm to break free. He admonishes Boruto's lack of resolve and motivation to change, and reveals his Sukea disguise. Kakashi believes Boruto's influence on his classmates to have made them unsuitable to become shinobi.
Mitsuki
 and
Iwabee
 attack Kakashi, forcing him to let go of Boruto to defend himself and counterattack, allowing Boruto to escape with Iwabee's help. At night, several of the students gather,
Wasabi
 healing Boruto, and Boruto wishing she'd look after Mitsuki, who was injured by Kakashi. Boruto tells them of Kakashi's assessment of their class and Boruto's influence and apologises. Iwabee aggressively tells Boruto he made it this far because of Boruto, something he intends telling Kakashi.
Denki
 and
Sumire
 share Iwabee's opinion.
 Mitsuki also tells Boruto that by watching him, he learned to do things for other people, by his own volition. The group takes notice of the 24 hour limit, that they still have their bandannas despite some of them having been knocked unconscious before, and that while injured, the teachers have not given pursuit. Boruto determines the exam to be a test of their resolve: the targets, bandannas, and the bell hide the real test, namely how they choose to tackle the problem. Kakashi,
Anko
, and
Konohamaru
 discuss the exams while watching over captured students, saying the class will fail if they don't come to rescue them.

Boruto formulates a strategy. As the fastest in the class,
Metal
 and
Wasabi
 will distract Anko, while Sumire has
Nue
, under the cover of several smoke bombs, stealthily equip the captured students with earplugs as
Namida
 also sneaks in. The Anko they fight turns out to be a clone, but the real one gets knocked out by the frightened Namida with a sonic scream. They finish freeing the captive students. Boruto distracts Konohamaru, allowing Denki, Iwabee, and Mitsuki to lock them in place with fūinjutsu, almost suffering a heavy hit from
Sarada
. Konohamaru stops a punch from Denki at his target, but it gets hit anyway. Sarada and Boruto had transformed into one another, allowing Sarada to get close enough to cast
Sharingan genjutsu
 on him not to notice Denki's kunai in his fist.
Tsuru
 arrives, telling them only Kakashi remains. At sunrise, Boruto attacks Kakashi with shadow clones, but more appear than Boruto is able to use. His classmates are disguised as Boruto's clones. Kakashi knocks them down as well, but when Boruto gets close enough and signals it, they all hold Kakashi down with fūinjutsu, as they did with Konohamaru. When Boruto gets too close to the bell, Kakashi uses
Lightning Release
 against them, but they don't fall back. Boruto only manages to ring the bell before the 24 hours are up. Kakashi passes them all. They're all confused, as they didn't get the bell. Kakashi explains they wouldn't have been able to acquire the bell at all. He explains that
in the shinobi world, those who break the rules are called scum, but those who don't value their comrades are worse
, and when they all came together at him as a team, that's when they passed.
Shino
 congratulates them, and releases the transformation on their bandannas, which were
forehead protectors
 all along. The students celebrate.
Iruka
 scolds Kakashi for being too rough on the students.
