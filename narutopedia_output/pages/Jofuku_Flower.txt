The
Jofuku flower
 is a medicinal plant that can be found in the
Jofuku Forest
 at the border of the
Land of Fire
. The flower has two very peculiar traits, the first being that the flower has seven different colours. Secondly, when the flower is uprooted, it will release a pollen-like substance which takes the form of the target's arch-enemy, or whoever they were thinking of at the time, to attack and defend the flowers.

Trivia

On the
official TV Tokyo's page
, the term "Jofuku grass" (
徐福草
,
jofukusō
,
literally meaning:
 gradual good fortune grass) is used.
