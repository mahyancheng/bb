"
Izanagi and Izanami
" (
イザナギとイザナミ
,
Izanagi to Izanami
) is episode 338 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

With
Izanami
 activated, and
Kabuto
 trapped within its infinite loop,
Sasuke
 uses this time to question his brother about the technique.
Itachi
 tells Sasuke about the history behind Izanami's creation as well as the
Uchiha clan
's use of the technique. Itachi ultimately reveals to Sasuke that Izanami was created with the sole purpose of stopping the users of the technique's counterpart:
Izanagi
 so that they would accept their fate — which is also the way to escape the infinite loop.
 Angered by the fact that Itachi would cast a technique that has an escape route, Sasuke questions his motives to which Itachi says that he wished to give Kabuto an opportunity to accept his fate. Sasuke, however, claims that Itachi is perfect and rather different from Kabuto but the elder Uchiha refuses this claim. Elsewhere, somewhere in a forest seemingly some distance away, a grown-up
Urushi
 tells his comrade that he hoped by the time he gets
home
, Kabuto will be there. Back at the cave, Itachi prepares to put an end to the
Impure World Reincarnation
 technique.

Trivia

Due to
Neon Alley
's shutdown on May 4, 2016, this is the last episode of the English dub to have a premiere debut on a television/digital streaming broadcast. The dub for
Naruto: Shippūden
 episodes 339 onward makes its debut first on North American DVD releases and second on
Adult Swim
, when is reaching the new episodes on television set.

In the preview of this episode, the flashback of the Uchiha inter-clan rivalry was shown in colour. However, this episode showed the flashback in black and white when it first aired.

Itachi uses
Tsukuyomi
 on Kabuto with his right eye even though his Tsukuyomi eye is his left, which had lost its sight earlier in battle due to the use of Izanami.

When Itachi talked with Sasuke before he decided to release the Impure World Reincarnation, Itachi's left sclerae mistakenly appeared normal in one scene instead of black sclerae.

In Kabuto's mind when his horn was sliced off, the illusionary Itachi was not holding Sasuke's sword, which was an animation error. In the manga, he was holding it.
