Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown






Hippo Boss and the others fighting over Armadiko's affections.



At the time of the recruitment of all the animals on the island by
Naruto Uzumaki
, Hippo Boss was seen fighting Don and Chūji. As King joins the fray, Hippo Boss and the other are easily defeated by the gorilla. However, when Armadiko arrives and tells them that she had fallen in love with Naruto, the four animals band together and declare that they are going to beat him to death. This leads to Hippo Boss chasing after Naruto across the island. Later, sulking and somewhat beaten up, Hippo Boss and the other join the line entering the temple. Seeing Armadiko cosy up to Naruto, they look on in jealousy before quickly looking away as Naruto asks them if they want to fight again.






The four commiserating the revelation that Armadiko is male.



Later outraged when Naruto declares that he was going to start the ecological survey which required that he see the animals' genitalia in order to know their sexes, Hippo Boss and the others voice their dissent when Naruto states that he wanted to know whether or not Armadiko was female because of the kanji pattern for male on its armour. Soon after this, tremors are felt on the island and the animals are then thrown into the air after the Island Turtle is flipped over. Saved by
