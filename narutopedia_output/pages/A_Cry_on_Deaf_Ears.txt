"
A Cry on Deaf Ears
" (
届かない叫び
,
Todokanai Sakebi
) is episode 128 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 asks
Sasuke
 if he is willing to turn his back on all of his friends in
Konoha
 for the simple matter of getting stronger. Sasuke says yes and starts to walk away, enraging Naruto. Determined to bring Sasuke back to his senses and to Konoha, Naruto grabs hold of him and gives him an echoing punch. Sasuke, who appears to feel no pain at all from this, spits blood on Naruto's face, and Naruto resolves to bring him back to Konoha by force if he has to. Then Sasuke grabs Naruto by his shirt, raises him up and easily punches Naruto several metres backwards with the power of his
Cursed Seal
, inflicting several times more pain than his own attack. Naruto attacks Sasuke but is quickly kicked back into the water, and gets one of his weapon bags stolen. He creates some
shadow clones
, which are easily defeated by Sasuke. Naruto tries throwing
shuriken
 from a distance, but is no match for Sasuke's superior skill with the tools. Using the
wire strings
 from Naruto's bag, Sasuke traps him tied up to a rock skillfully and ignites the wire with
flames
, scorching Naruto with a burst of fire.
