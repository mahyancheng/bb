Kimimaro slashes the opponent with his
bone blades
, shoots numerous
finger bullets
 at them, and finishes the opponent by jumping in the air and releasing numerous bones from his back which can go in any direction, with the piercing bones then piling on the downed victim before they break apart and Kimimaro lands back on the ground.
