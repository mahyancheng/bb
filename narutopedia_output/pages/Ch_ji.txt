Background

Condor
, Chūji is trapped in a four-way lovers spat with
King
,
Hippo Boss
 and
Don
 over the affections of
Armadiko
. Whenever the four are together, they immediately start fighting believing themselves to be the most suitable partner for Armadiko.

Personality

Chūji is a very hard-headed individual who will not back down from a challenge as noted by Condor who states that he would not back down from the challenge over Armadiko's affections even though he feared King.

Appearance

Chūji resembles any normal penguin. Typical of all rockhopper penguins, Chūji has golden hair that frames his eyes as well as a small goatee of hair under his beard. He wears a Japanese straw hat and cloak and dons a toothpick in his mouth, giving him the overall resemblance of a Japanese assassin.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown






Chūji and the others fighting over Armadiko's affections.



At the time of the recruitment of all the animals on the island by
Naruto Uzumaki
, Chūji was seen fighting Don and Hippo Boss. As King joins the fray, Chūji and the other are easily defeated by the gorilla. However, when Armadiko arrives and tells them that she had fallen in love with Naruto, the four animals band together and declare that they are going to beat him to death. This leads to Chūji chasing after Naruto across the island. Later, sulking and somewhat beaten up, Chūji and the other join the line entering the temple. Seeing Armadiko cosy up to Naruto, they look on in jealousy before quickly looking away as Naruto asks them if they want to fight again.






The four commiserating the revelation that Armadiko is male.



Later outraged when Naruto declares that he was going to start the ecological survey which required that he see the animals' genitalia in order to know their sexes, Chūji and the others voice their dissent when Naruto states that he wanted to know whether or not Armadiko was female because of the kanji pattern for male on its armour. Soon after this, tremors are felt on the island and the animals are then thrown into the air after the Island Turtle is flipped over. Saved by
