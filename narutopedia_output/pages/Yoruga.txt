Yoruga
 (
ヨルガ
) was a shinobi from the
Land of Haze
.

Background

Yoruga and his brothers were orphans who found a home in the Land of Haze's orphanage. Despite it being a smaller and impoverished country, they enjoyed having decent meals. They would also often spend their time playing under a large peach tree.

Personality

Like his brothers, Yoruga was an extremely committed man. He would willingly sacrifice himself for his brothers and his mission. This came from the hardships of his childhood. Appreciating what it is like to suffer in life, he treasured any small peace of joy he could have. Of his brothers, Yoruga was apparently the most cheerful and laidback, always looking back on fond memories and eager to make new ones. His love for his brothers and country was so great, he would face his impending demise with a still carefree attitude.

Kara Actuation Arc

Yoruga and his brothers were given a mission to retrieve the cells of the First
Hokage

Hashirama Senju
, which made its way into the black market in the
Land of Silence
. Using their female disguises, Yoruga and his brothers attempted to seduce
Kirisaki
 to learn of the location of the cell. However, he lost interest when
Boruto Uzumaki
 arrived himself
taking the appearance of a woman
.

Witnessing Boruto and his comrades taking away an unconscious Kirisaki, Yoruga and his brothers tracked them to learn that
Sakuya
 had the cell in her possession. Seeing no way to bypass the castle's
barrier ninjutsu
, Yoruga decided to sacrifice himself by using his kinjutsu to allow his brothers inside the barrier. Before his passing Yoruga asked
Asaka
 and
Hiruga
 to promise him to leave his earring by the peach tree in their homeland.

Legacy

Yoruga's sacrifice filled his brother with newfound resolve to complete their mission, promising to hang his earring under the peach tree of their old orphanage.
