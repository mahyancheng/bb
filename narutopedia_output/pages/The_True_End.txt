 manga.

Summary

As
Gaara
 rushes to help
Naruto
,
Tobirama
 curses
Madara
 for stabbing
Sasuke
. Elsewhere, an attack from a
miniature version
 of
Hashirama
's
Sage Art Wood Release: True Several Thousand Hands
 technique is fended off by the
Third Hokage
, who is one of the only ones left with enough chakra to fight. The assailant is revealed to be
Tobi
, who still seems intent on uncovering the mechanics behind bowel movements.
 Meanwhile,
Orochimaru
 and his team take cover, planning a surprise attack on Tobi.
Karin
, who is visibly distraught over Sasuke, is barely able to convey what she
senses
. Naruto is brought to
Tsunade
 and her disciples
Shizune
 and
Sakura
, but of the trio Sakura is the only one who still has enough chakra to use
medical ninjutsu
. As the other sensor-type ninja detect Naruto's presence, Hinata
sees
 Naruto's failing heartbeat and rushes to his side, only to stumble and fall due to her low chakra levels. Tobi and a
White Zetsu clone
 note that despite Naruto being an
Uzumaki
, his death is inevitable due to
Kurama
's extraction. Elsewhere, Sasuke clings to consciousness by remembering his resolve to honour his
brother
's sacrifice and to change the shinobi world, but his energy fades as Madara walks away from him. As grief overtakes both Sakura, whose chakra is rapidly diminishing, and Karin, who senses Sasuke's predicament from afar, both realise that if things continue like this both Naruto and Sasuke will die.

Trivia

As Sakura starts healing Naruto, she is drawn without a chakra cloak whilst she had one pages earlier, only to be drawn with it again at the start of the next chapter, losing it.
