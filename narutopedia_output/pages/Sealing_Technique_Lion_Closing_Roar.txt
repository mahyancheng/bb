This sealing technique completely blocks the target's chakra with a sealing formula (
封印式
,
fūin-shiki
) drawn on the ground or a wall. This is done by closing all the
tenketsu
 of the person caught in the middle. When the target is sealed, a stylised kanji for
"close"
 or
"shut"
 (
閉
,
hei
) appears in the middle of the sealing formula.

To successfully seal the target, one has to get them exactly inside the sealing formula. This task requires great accuracy and is very difficult to accomplish. Various methods can be used to make this easier. For instance, one can prepare a
puppet
 or a
ninja tool
 to deploy this technique. Monzaemon once equipped this sealing formula to the
Lion-Headed Kannon
, a tool used to pin a target down — which Chiyo then came to possess.
