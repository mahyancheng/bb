Lyrics

Rōmaji

Kakaeta omou i tokitoshite kazoe kirenai itami o

Yuzurenai hokori mune ni imamade ikite kitadarou

Tatakau koto de mamotte

Omoigakenaku nakushite

Kizutsukiai ma nande

Taisetsu na koto ni kizukudarou

Koe ga todokanai soredemo (soredemo) `kokoro' shinjite iyou

Zenshin zenrei kimi wo mamoru yo

Towa ni sou towa ni

Nankaidatte tachiagare yo sono ishi de (sono ishi de)

Ungai souten asu wo egaku yo tomo ni sou tomo ni

Itsudatte akirameru na michi wo hirakou

Ruru...

Kanji

抱えた思うい時として数え

きれない

痛み を

譲れない誇り胸に今まで生きてきただろう

戦うことで守って 思がけなく失くして

傷つけ合い学んて 切大なことに気つくだろう

声が届かない それでも 「心」信じていよう

English (Full Version)

The feelings we cling to

Occasionally lead to pain

I'm sure an uncompromising pride

Has lived inside us all along.

Fighting in order to protect them

We lose more than we think

But by hurting one another, and learning from it

I'm sure we'll realise something important.

Our voices

May not reach

But let's keep on believing in these hearts.

With all my heart and soul I'll protect you

Forever and ever

So keep rising up again and again

By your own will

We'll overcome building your own tomorrow

Growing closer together

So never ever give up

Let's open the day forward.

On and on...

Weaving things together to keep them from ending

Connecting them with an invisible string

Layering a myriad of colours

I'm sure our lives will keep going on from here

Even amid darkness

That envelops all

Let's go searching for our light

Overcome this stalemate and shout aloud

Over and over

Even separated by millions of light years

I can hear you

I'll wish for your absolute existence

So let it thunder forth and be known

Whenever things get tough

Let's laugh together

I'll walk with you now

No one can untie us

We'll go on from here, further

Higher and higher without limits.

I'll take you to a place

That exists for us alone

So make sure our hands stay joined

Make sure we don't get separated.

With all my heart and soul I'll protect you

Forever and ever

So keep rising up again and again

By your own will

We'll overcome building your own tomorrow

Growing closer together

Let's always join our desires as one

Endlessly without fail

On and on...
