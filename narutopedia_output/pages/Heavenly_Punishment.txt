This is a suicidal technique which is done when the user covers their torso with
explosive tags
 and detonates themselves while in range of the enemy.

Trivia

The term "Tenchū" (
天誅
) was a popular term used by the
Four Hitokiri of the Bakumatsu
, assassins who believed in "heavenly punishment" against those who supported the Shogunate and foreign access to Japan.

When Hana Kaka used this technique, she placed the explosive tags onto the corpse of an ally instead of herself, creating a decoy to fake her death.
