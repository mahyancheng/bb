After water has been shot into the air, such as with the
Water Release: Water Bullet Technique
, this jutsu turns the water black. When the black water falls on a target it clings to their body and covers their eyes, blocking their vision. Because of the name ("
doku
" meaning "poison"), victims are intended to believe the water is poisonous. In truth the water is harmless, and the name is only meant to distract victims long enough for the user to follow up with another attack and/or escape.

Trivia

Although a novel-only technique, it is similar to
Amaterasu
 and
Black Lightning
, as it is also a black-coloured elemental technique.
