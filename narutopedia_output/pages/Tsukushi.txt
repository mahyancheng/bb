ツクシ
) was a prisoner at
Orochimaru
's
Northern Hideout

Personality

Tsukushi was a very daring man being extremely confident in his abilities to the point where he would fight anyone no matter how strong they may be.

Appearance

Tsukushi had long green hair with small black eyes that have a dark yellow-coloured outlining and wore the common attire of the inmates at the Northern Hideout. He, like many others, received a
cursed seal
 in the course of Orochimaru's experiments. When activated, the seal spreaded across his body in a ring pattern. He also had a light purple-coloured scar running over his right cheek.

Abilities

He was able to enter the second state of the cursed seal and had great confidence in his own strength.

Part II

Itachi Pursuit Mission

After news that Orochimaru had been killed, he is amongst a group of the more hostile inmates that were prepared to fight for their freedom as well as exact their revenge on their captors. He stood alongside the other inmates that faced
Sasuke Uchiha
 and
Suigetsu Hōzuki
 and though he had great confidence in himself, he was still defeated by the shinobi whom he found to be too strong before passing out and his cursed seal receded.
