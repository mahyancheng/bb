The Terror! Enko Onikuma

When Enko's secret technique acted up, she injured her team's jōnin leader. Eventually, Team 40 was assigned
Ibiki Morino
 as their new team leader. However, he immediately decided to disband Team 40, viewing that Dōshu and Tsuru's continued fear of Enko's power would only inhibit performance and instead decided to train Enko personally as an interrogator.






Team 40 helps Ibiki calm Enko down.



Wanting to help their friends, Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuki began helping Tsuru and Dōsho to master their fear, hoping to convince Ibiki to reinstate their team. After their various attempts failed, Tsuru and Dōsho found stray cat. Despite being friendly to it, the cat was scared of them and ran from them. This experience helped Tsuru and Dōsho to understand what Enko must go through all the time. Later, they chanced upon Enko going berserk again while Ibiki struggled to detain her and even considered cutting off her arms. Knowing that her rampage came from her feelings of loneliness, the two were able to reach her, insisting they won't leave their friend. Their genuine friendship ultimately calmed her down. Ultimately, Ibiki conceded that the three genin together would be best for Enko and officially reinstated Team 40.
