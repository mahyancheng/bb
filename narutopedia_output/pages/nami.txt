 Oonami) is a miner in the
Land of Water
.

Personality

Ōnami is a well-meaning, but trusting man. In his capacity as chief, he rushed to hire miners to boost the economy of Dotō Island, but neglected to run background checks, allowing bandits to infiltrate his crew. As such, his two-shift plan at the mines, which was arranged to avoid anyone stealing gold, ended up helping the bandits. He also takes things at face value, becoming concerned by
Konoha
 sent him only
Team 5
, and judging
Denki
 by his appearance. However, he is capable of owning up his mistakes, apologising to Denki for how he judged him after Team 5 apprehended the bandits and recovered the gold.

Appearance

He is a rather overweight, broad-shouldered man of medium height with a round face and blue eyes. He also has dark short hair, which has a shaved section behind the ears, which, as it were, divides the hairstyle into two parts. Ōnami wears a formal blue suit, as well as a white shirt and tie. As a miner, he carries a white helmet with him, which he puts on when necessary.

Abilities

Ōnami is a skilled miner, being able to lead a large mining company.

Following the discovery of gold deposits at Dotō Island, Ōnami became the chief of the mining operation to extract it. As the mining was dangerous due to complex geology, Ōnami commissioned
automated puppets
 from the Land of Fire. While he was unsure that Team 5 was up to the task, he was impressed to learn that the package Denki was struggling to carry up the trail to the mine was heavier than even he could lift. At the mine, he showed up the puppets to his crew, but was taken hostage by bandits who had infiltrated. The bandits locked them inside, but Denki was able to use the puppets to create an escape. After Team 5 apprehended them and recovered the gold, Ōnami apologised for his earlier judgement and praised Team 5.

Later, the
Funato clan
 invaded the island, separating Team 5 from Ōnami, the miners and the Konoha Scientific Ninja Tool researchers. They were taken hostage and forced to gather all the gold in the mines to give to the pirates.
Sarada Uchiha
 and
Mitsuki
 eventually arrived to free Ōnami and the other hostages and escorted them to safety after fending off the pirates. Along with the hostages, Ōnami safely evacuated the island with the help of the Konoha and Kiri-nin.
