While using
Yamato
 as a medium,
Tobi
 creates a massive statue, similar to
Hashirama Senju
's
Sage Art Wood Release: True Several Thousand Hands
 technique. Unlike Hashirama's much larger variant however, this creation does not utilise
senjutsu
 chakra. The wielder of this avatar is capable of using a
multitude
 of hands to assault their opponents.

Unlike its counterpart, this avatar does not have the
wood human
 or
dragon
 atop its heads, however, Tobi displayed the ability to channel its ability to
manipulate
 all five basic
nature transformations
 from the miniature faces that encircle its head.
