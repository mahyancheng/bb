The Spear of Shukaku is the attack counterpart of the
Shield of Shukaku
. Like the shield, Gaara crushes the hardest materials from the ground using
sand
, this time in the form of a halberd, in the shape of the Shukaku's hand. Just like the shield which has yet to find anything that could break its defence, the halberd has yet to find a defence that it can't break through.
