The
Human Bullet Yo-Yo
 is the technique derived from "Formation E" (
フォーメーションE
,
Fōmēshon Ī
) used by the 16th generation of the
Ino–Shika–Chō
 trio.

Usage






The mechanism behind the technique.



In performing this technique, Chōji firstly
increases his size
, while Shikamaru connects their two shadows. At the same time, Ino
detects
 any enemies in the immediate vicinity and
transmits
 this information directly to Shikamaru. As Chōji begins to attack with the
Human Bullet Tank
 technique, Ino continues to track their opponents so that Shikamaru can perfectly direct Chōji's movement by
manipulating the shadow
. How this formation functions and its overall appearance is akin to a person using a
yo-yo
, albeit in a destructive manner.

Trivia

In the telepathic dimension of Ino and Shikamaru, this technique when shown as a silhouette looks similar to
Ultraman
, a superhero who controls a huge yo-yo which is connected with his middle finger and uses it to smash his enemies.
