Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Shikamaru
 pursues
Gengo
 through the Fushū Castle.
Ino
,
Chōji
, and
Temari
 fight
Sai
,
Rō
, and
Hinoko
, Gengo's hold over them weakening as the fight drags on. Gengo lures Shikamaru in a dark room, both so he can't use his shadows and for his hearing to become more sensitive, and more vulnerable to Gengo's jutsu. Gengo tells Shikamaru about his past with
Zabuza
, and how it shaped his ideology. Ino enters Sai's mind to break Gengo's hold on him.
 He asks about Shikamaru, and tells them that they have to warn Shikamaru not to turn around when Gengo is trying to convert him. Gengo tells Shikamaru he had his followers infiltrate the hidden villages, and with a signal he can make them cause incidents all over. Gengo's jutsu manifests the darkness in Shikamaru, but thinking of
Naruto
, Shikamaru isn't affected by it, to Gengo's surprise. Shikamaru surmises Gengo's comrades are all dead, having been used by him. Temari and the others reach their location, and Shikamaru calls on Rō and Hinoko to finish their mission. Hinoko uses her chakra needles to open holes in the walls to let sunlight in. Gengo summons a great sword, and tries cutting Shikamaru down with it. Shikamaru manages to pin him down, allowing Hinoko to hit his tongue with her chakra needle, rendering his jutsu useless.
Konoha

Anbu
 arrive to take Gengo into custody. Shikamaru asks Temari to a date, as does Sai to Ino.
