The Sea Dragon.



The
Power of the Sea Dragon
 (
海龍の力
,
Kairyū no Chikara
) is a mysterious power to control the surrounding ocean; obtainable only by those of the
Funato clan
, specifically
Araumi
 and his bloodline, who each have the potential to use it. While the method to awakening this power is largely unknown, it requires one from the Funato bloodline to dive deep into the sea. Afterwards, the Funato clansmen will emerge from the water bearing large gills on their neck.

After
Ikada
 first awakened his powers during his coming-of-age, he could instinctively manipulate the seawater to save him from drowning, and upon making an effort to swim, his hands become webbed, allowing him to swim very efficiently. However, his awakening was incomplete as he did not manifest the gills on his neck at the time. Once he dove into the ocean a second time to fully awakened his power, he had shown a tremendous skill of water manipulation simply by thought, capable of splitting a large tidal wave during a storm to create a path for the Funato fleet to sail through and forming numerous waterspouts to sink a ship.

Trivia

Araumi noted that Ikada's inheritance of the Power of the Sea Dragon surpasses all before him.
