The
Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan
 is a more powerful version of the
Big Ball Rasengan
.

Usage

In an instant, the user creates a Rasengan of gigantic proportions.
 When it impacts, there is a large shock wave unleashed that can send unsuspecting shinobi flying. As with many Rasengan variants, Naruto needs the help of a
shadow clone
 in the Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan's formation.
 By the time he's
Hokage
, Naruto can perform this technique with one hand and even pass it on to
Boruto Uzumaki
 to use.
 This jutsu is so chakra-intense that it was capable of overwhelming Delta's shinobi-ware's formidable chakra absorption capabilities.

Senjutsu Influence





A senjutsu-enhanced Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan.



When in
Sage Mode
, the user can perform a
senjutsu
-enhanced version known as
Sage Art: Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan
 (
仙法・超大玉螺旋丸
,
Senpō: Chō Ōdama Rasengan
,
English TV:
 Sage Art: Massive Rasengan).
 It is said that its destructive power – were it to explode – would easily carve away an entire mountain.
 Fittingly, upon its first successful use it blasted through a
God Tree
 and kilometres of mountainside before bursting in the upper atmosphere, killing an empowered
Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki
.

Trivia

According to its
Sha no Sho
 entry, the standard Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan also used
natural energy
 when used by Jiraiya.

In the games, Jiraiya is able to use this technique without Sage Mode, though he referred to it as the
Gallant Rasengan
 (
豪傑螺旋丸
,
Gōketsu Rasengan
).
