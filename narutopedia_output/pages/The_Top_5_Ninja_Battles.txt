,

Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 and
Sakura
 host a special recap episode celebrating the completion of four years of the original
Naruto
 anime. The episode features highlights of five top battles from the
Sasuke Recovery Mission
. Placed at number five, the battle between Naruto and
Sasuke
 on the hospital roof is displayed after which Sakura beats Naruto. Placed at number four, the battle between
Chōji
 and
Jirōbō
 is displayed. Sakura interviews Choji after which he, using
Human Bullet Tank
, beats up Naruto for saying, "Chōji's fight made him sweat." Subsequently, popular battles that did not make the top five were displayed including
Kakashi
 vs
Zabuza
 during the
Land of Waves arc
, and Kakashi vs
Guy
, although the latter was not a formal combat and was a rock-paper-scissors match. The next one that came at number three was the battle between
Kiba
 and
Sakon
. Afterwards, Kiba appears and is interviewed by Sakura. He beats up Naruto for insulting him. Placed at number two, the battle between
Neji
 and
Kidōmaru
 is displayed. Neji also expresses his views and afterwards, hits Naruto with the
Gentle Fist
. Placed at the top, the battle between Naruto and Sasuke at the
Valley of the End
 is displayed. Some random videos of Sakura beating Naruto are also showcased. At the end of the show,
Jiraiya
 is introduced as a correspondent who announces a surprise guest —
Orochimaru
 — who gives Sakura and Naruto an opportunity to briefly see Sasuke.

Trivia

Even though it recaps
major battles
 from the
series plot
, the episode itself has no canon relevance.
