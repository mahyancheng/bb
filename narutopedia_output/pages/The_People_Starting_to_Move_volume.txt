. When asked why, Kabuto says it is to thank Naruto for being an "inspiration". When asked why, Kabuto describes how Naruto has always struggled to distinguish himself from the
Nine-Tails
 sealed within him, just as Kabuto always struggled to find autonomy from service to others. Following Naruto's example, Kabuto has opted to become strong enough to never need to serve someone again by integrating
Orochimaru
's remains into his body, thus making half of him Orochimaru.

Sasuke
. Sasuke tries to destroy the dragon, but it flies out his reach and attacks from afar, forcing him to activate level two of his
cursed seal
.
Tobi
 reports that he has buried the smaller explosives in the ground beneath Sasuke, meaning Sasuke will need to remain where he is or risk blowing up. Believing Sasuke is trapped, Deidara moves in to finish him off. Sasuke takes this opportunity to cut off the dragon's wing, causing it to fall to the ground and trigger the mine field.

Tobi
 to run away as he intends to use his
C4
 explosive.

I have a sensitive stomach. Air conditioning gives me bad runs. Frozen desserts give me bad runs. Milk, even if I drink it really slowly, gives me bad runs. Just thinking about bad runs gives me bad runs.
