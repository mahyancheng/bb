" (

,
Kakashi Koiuta
) is episode 191 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

While
Konohagakure
 is being rebuilt,
Kakashi
 notices a travelling musician, which causes him to flashback to a incident with his
team
. Kakashi remembers seeing a woman, disguised as a travelling performer, at the gate into Konoha. The woman,
Hanare
, was actually a spy for the
Jōmae Village
, and was taken in for interrogation with
Ibiki
. Fruitless with his results, Ibiki went to find
Inoichi
 who was able to get into her mind and find out all that she found out about Konoha and Jōmae Village, but Hanare used her
technique
 against him, to find out all that he knows about Konoha. Since Inoichi found a memory of a young Kakashi, he went to find him. When Kakashi and Hanare stop to look at the clouds after taking a walk, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura, who were eavesdropping on the conversation, fell out of a tree, causing Kakashi to fall on top of Hanare, making them accidentally kiss. Knowing about Hanare's assumed lack of any information on Konoha, the
Third Hokage
 assigns the ninja team to go rescue
Riichi
 from the Jōmae ninja, in exchange for Hanare. The exchange happened at the centre of the bridge, but when Riichi was on Konoha's side of the bridge, Kakashi
blew
 the bridge up, unwilling to let Hanare go. Hanare ran away, with Kakashi in pursuit, until they reached a cliff, where Hanare said that she wanted to die by Kakashi's hands, and that she already removed all that she had learned about Konoha from her mind. He told her that he would never kill a ninja that had lost their honour, and told her to leave. As Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura found them, Kakashi claims that Hanare jumped off the cliff. She was later shown walking where she first met Kakashi many years ago.
