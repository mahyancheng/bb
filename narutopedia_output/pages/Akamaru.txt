Akamaru
 (
赤丸
) is a nin-dog (
忍犬
,
ninken
) from
Konohagakure
's
Inuzuka clan
. He is
Kiba Inuzuka
's partner, as well as his best friend and constant companion. He is also a member of
Team Kurenai
.

Background

At some point, while Kiba was still in the
Academy
, his mother,
Tsume Inuzuka
, entrusted him with Akamaru. Although Akamaru almost immediately urinated on Kiba's face, much to
his mother
 and
sister's
 amusement,
 the two would soon become inseparable.

Personality

Akamaru has been described as active and devoted.
 This can be seen from his interactions with people, especially his best friend and companion Kiba whom he has always been with since the two met. They often spend their time going on walks, or more accurately, running through trees chasing one another. His devotion is most often seen when Kiba is hurt in battle; Akamaru will immediately run to his side.

Rai no Sho
, a story from Akamaru's point of view, reveals much of his personality. Akamaru is revealed to have a humorous thought process by erroneously explaining something, but then immediately correcting himself. He has a very scientific thought process about humans, thinking they enter oestrous too late in life when they should be focusing on being shinobi instead of finding a "mate". It's also revealed Akamaru is very overprotective of Kiba as he immediately tried fruitlessly to pull his master away from
Tamaki
 when he realised the two had a strong mutual attraction to each other, as he didn't want Kiba to shy away from his training in favour of romancing Tamaki like "the others".

In the epilogue, Akamaru had grown old and took delight in just napping most of the day and playing with his offspring. When prompted by Kiba to back him up, he mocked Kiba's notion that he turned down the Seventh Hokage seat, giving a sly smirk.

Appearance






Akamaru's red fur.








Akamaru and Kiba in Part II.



In Part I, Akamaru was a small puppy with white and some brown fur on his ears, and resembles a
Great Pyrenees
, regularly carried on Kiba's head or inside his jacket. Akamaru's eyes are usually squinted, appearing closed, and he has a brown nose, as well as brown patches on his ears and a brown outline around his mouth. His fur on top of his head is styled to somewhat resemble a
mohawk
. Whenever Akamaru ingests
soldier pills
 his fur turns red and he becomes more feral, which is why he was named Akamaru (赤丸) "Aka" meaning "red", and "maru" being a common ending for male names in Japan.

In Part II, Akamaru has grown into a full-sized adult large-breed dog. His size is such that Akamaru can now have Kiba ride on his back comfortably. Despite this, Kiba claimed he failed to notice due to the amount of time they spend together. Apart from his size, his general appearance has remained the same.
 Years after the Fourth Great Shinobi War, Akamaru aged a bit, with a few wrinkles appearing on his snout, though was otherwise unchanged.

Abilities

Akamaru's heightened senses, such as smell and hearing, along with Kiba's ability to communicate with him, makes him a highly capable ally for gathering and sharing information. He can 'sense' chakra with his nose, which allows him to judge an enemy's strength.






Akamaru transformed as Kiba.



In combat, Akamaru often takes Kiba's form (albeit having a much more feral appearance) using the
Beast Human Clone
 technique. This gives him the ability to perform a ferocious spinning attack with the
Passing Fang
, which can be
collaborated
 with his partner to make it more difficult for the opponent to avoid. The duo can also
fuse together
 into a giant, two-headed wolf to perform a
highly devastating attack
. Due to the sheer speed of this attack, it is difficult for them to see their target. To make up for this, Akamaru would mark the target by
urinating
 on them beforehand, allowing their heightened sense of smell to take over instead for attacks where they move to fast to see the target.

He has also been shown to be adept at setting traps, such as
explosive tags
 on his own.
 Akamaru has not been known to talk like some other ninken, but did speak briefly at the end of a special new years episode in the anime.

Part I

Chūnin Exams

Main article:
Chūnin Exams

Akamaru helped Kiba cheat in the first test, sitting on his head to keep an eye out for proctors and to get information from other exam takers. On their way to the tower during the second test, Kiba had the group stop to investigate
Gaara
's encounter with
Team Shigure
. Akamaru was immediately frightened by sensing the strength of Gaara's chakra, and was traumatised by seeing Gaara brutally kill all three Ame genin.






Kiba and Akamaru vs Naruto.



Akamaru fought alongside Kiba against
Naruto Uzumaki
 in the exam preliminaries. He was considered a ninja tool rather than an additional combatant, and was thus permitted to fight alongside Kiba. While Akamaru gave Naruto some difficulty, especially after he transformed into a clone of Kiba, Naruto was able to use Akamaru to trick Kiba, first transforming into Akamaru and coming out of the smoke bomb to ambush him. After Kiba used the
Beast Human Clone
 technique, Naruto turned into Kiba to prevent Kiba from attacking him, and when Kiba saw through his plan, Naruto transformed into Akamaru to make him think that he had hit Akamaru. Kiba then punched Akamaru, believing him to be Naruto.

In the finals, Akamaru was knocked out along with Kiba after
Kabuto Yakushi
, disguised as an
Anbu
 member, healed
Hinata Hyūga
. In the anime, Akamaru attempted to warn Kiba about Kabuto, having recognised who Kabuto was. However, Kabuto used his medical ninjutsu and knocked Kiba out. What happened to Akamaru was left unknown, as Kabuto didn't come near him but he still passed out.

Sasuke Recovery Mission






Akamaru and Kiba's combined transformation.



Over time, Kiba and Akamaru developed Dynamic Marking and Human Beast Combination Transformation: Double-Headed Wolf together. In the mission to retrieve
Sasuke
, Kiba and Akamaru remained with the group until they retrieved the container, but an
explosive tag
 blew them and
Sakon and Ukon
 into a canyon. Kiba and Akamaru initially struggled against the brothers, and Akamaru realised that they must use Double Wolf Fang. Kiba was hesitant, given the large amount of chakra needed, which would render them vulnerable if they missed. Akamaru bit him on the hand, and Kiba, realising that Akamaru saw him as pathetic, decided to take the risk. The attack severely wounded Sakon and Ukon, but they blocked the last attack with a Rashōmon barrier, and Akamaru was injured protecting Kiba from their counter-attack, but managed to urinate in Sakon's eyes at the same time. When Ukon began taking over Kiba's body, he stabbed himself in the stomach in an attempt to kill Sakon to prevent himself from being taken over and harming Akamaru. Kiba attempted to escape with Akamaru, and, after Sakon and Ukon caught up with them, Kankurō arrived and killed both of them.

Kiba and Akamaru's injuries took some time to heal. Kiba, not wanting Akamaru to suffer that much again, vowed to improve himself.

Main article:
Akamaru Monitoring Mission






Akamaru infected with a toxin.



In the anime, Akamaru was infected with a toxin that caused him to go berserk. When he attacked some Anbu members who were training, the order was given to have him taken into custody. As Hana attempted to make a cure for Akamaru, Kiba smuggled his dog out of the village and escaped, having heard that Akamaru might need to be put to sleep, but Akamaru continued to lose control of himself. By the time Naruto and Hana caught up with Kiba, Akamaru had turned into a giant version of himself, and attacked anyone near him. Kiba hesitated in the face of the possibility that Akamaru might die, but, after Naruto and Hana's attempt to pin Akamaru down and administer the antidote failed, Kiba apologised to Akamaru while standing still as Akamaru leapt at him. Kiba was severely injured, but managed to inject Akamaru with the antidote, and noted that Akamaru had tried his best to avoid killing him.

Interlude

In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths

Main article:
In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths

In the anime, after Naruto left the village for three years to train with
Jiraiya
 of the
Sannin
, Kiba's jealousy in Naruto's continued luck of recent made him determined to best his fellow Konoha-nin. To this end, Akamaru joined Kiba in new training to increase the power of their
Combination Transformation
 skills. Taking inspiration from Naruto's usage of shadow clones for support in battle, Akamaru and Kiba worked arduously to develop their
Three-Headed Wolf Technique.
 Two years after Naruto's departure, Konohagakure decided to host the Chūnin Exams early alongside
Sunagakure
. Akamaru joined Kiba as usual to enter the exams.

After Kiba passed the first exam, Akamaru joined his partner to Sunagakure where the second exam would be held. There, the second exam's nature was essentially the same as the one Konoha previously had, requiring everyone to obtain two matching scrolls before three days passed in a survival competition.
 Later, when the team engaged an
enemy team of Kusagakure-nin
, Akamaru joined Kiba against
Burami
, whose obese stature was used to his advantage, absorbing and repelling all of Kiba and Akamaru's attacks. Soon, the enemy realised Kiba had the Earth scroll and together were able to steal it from him before retreating. As Team Kurenai attempted to stop them, Burami blasted them with a
foul-smelling smokescreen
, impairing Kiba and Akamaru's sense of smell. While the enemy got out of Hinata's Byakugan range, Shino set one of his female insects on the enemy to track. While pursuing the enemy, Akamaru and his teammates fell into a quicksand pit. Akamaru, however, was able to use his
Dynamic Marking
 to solidify the sand enough for the team to escape. Once recovering, Team Kurenai resumed their pursuit of the enemy.

As Kiba and Akamaru continued following the scent, they soon found it
multiplied and scattered throughout the area
. When Shino's bugs failed to find the enemies as well and suggested going after other enemy scrolls, Kiba, finding to his annoyance thinking about Naruto again, became determined not to fail. Then realising that Burami's scent was his clothes from their earlier scuffle, Kiba and Akamaru used it to find the real enemy. While back on the trail again, the enemies ambushed Team Kurenai. While initially overwhelmed, the team swapped out of the predicament with Shino's
insect clones
, allowing them to regroup. Seeing through the enemies' tactics, Team Kurenai quickly pressured the Kusa-nin before Kiba and Akamaru finished them off with his
Three-Headed Wolf technique
, earning Team Kurenai a Heaven and Earth scroll.
 Later, Team Kurenai was caught in a massive sandstorm.
 Ultimately, the team was rescued by the Suna-nin proctors and brought to a building to wait out the storm before resuming the exams.

Part II

Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission

Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission

When Naruto met Kiba while looking for team-mates, he noticed that Akamaru was much larger, especially given that Kiba was now riding on him rather than having him sit on his head. Naruto asked Kiba to join his team for a mission, and even proposed having Akamaru go with him without Kiba, but Kiba refused the suggestion.

Twelve Guardian Ninja

In the anime, when Team Kakashi returned from the
Fire Temple
 with a young monk named
Sora
, Sora quickly made it known that he didn't care what any living thing thought of him, and quickly got into a staring contest with Akamaru, to which Kiba became annoyed at. Later, when
Furido
 and
his men
 attacked the Leaf Village, Akamaru demonstrated that his new size also helped considerably in battle, as he was able to take down several zombies without transforming.

Three-Tails' Appearance

Main article:
Three-Tails' Appearance

In the anime, when Kakashi was ordered to investigate the latest whereabouts of
Orochimaru
, Team Kurenai was assigned to work with him due to their tracking skills. When they managed to find Orochimaru's hideout, they triggered a trap that destroyed the base. Fortunately, Akamaru's nose was able to find a way out in time. Later, Akamaru began to have trouble concentrating due to a high-frequency sound. It was through this that the team realised that they were being spied on by bats. When the enemy ambushed them and rendered their sense of smell helpless with a smokescreen, Akamaru convinced Kiba to try their beast-like taijutsu to blow away the smoke.

Soon, the team found themselves being attacked by
Guren
. There, Kiba and Akamaru again worked together to fight off her attacks. After sensing their enemy's new overwhelming might, Akamaru saved Kiba by digging into the ground and hiding them in a pit.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Along with his partner, Kiba, Akamaru was assigned to the
Fifth Division
 of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. He and a team of shinobi are later sent to back up the
Second Division
. Akamaru and Kiba attacked the
White Zetsu Army
 clones with their
Fang Passing Fang
 technique, ripping the enemy to shreds. The two later regrouped with
Neji
, Hinata and Shino after the attacking White Zetsu Army clones are wiped out — seemingly exhausted. Akamaru then stood by as Kiba tried to get an exhausted Neji to go to the
medical compound
 for treatment. As Kiba lectured Neji about overusing his
Byakugan
, Neji responded to Akamaru instead of Kiba, confirming just how strained his eyesight was. Finally backing down from the front that he was all right, Akamaru later carried Neji on his back as the trio relocated.






Kiba and Akamaru confront the reincarnated Sakon and Ukon.



The next day, Akamaru alongside Kiba battled the
transformed
 White Zetsu Army clones that had infiltrated their ranks. In the anime, the battle turns more personal when the
Sound Four
 ninja are also summoned to the battlefield. Kiba and Akamaru face off again against
Sakon and Ukon
. With their improved skills, Kiba and Akamaru are able to completely
plough
 through Sakon and Ukon's defences and defeat them. However, their victory is short-lived, as the ninja twins engulf the four of them in a
strange technique
. Akamaru's body was left in a comatose state while his soul was sent to a new location where it was reanimated within a large barrier. Inside, the inhabitants are able to battle normally. However, the Sound Four inform their enemies that in time, their actual bodies' halted chakra flow will eventually cause them to die. In addition, killing the Sound Four will not undo the technique. Despite the initial stalemate, the Sound Four's enhanced Cursed Seals grow even stronger from their accumulated malice, quickly overwhelming the Konoha ninja. Seeing that, Shikamaru begins to intentionally provoke them, knowing that Naruto's new
senses
 would pick up on it. Eventually, Naruto finds them and breaks through the barrier, allowing Inoichi, through a telepathic connection, to release the technique and restore Akamaru and the others to their bodies. Upon awakening, Akamaru thanks Shino for his efforts in saving them.

Later, amidst the battles, Kiba warned
Neji
 that
Hinata
 was in trouble. Neji failed to save "Hinata" from an Iwa-nin, only for "Hinata" to be revealed as a White Zetsu Army clone. As Akamaru and Kiba continued toward the real Hinata, Kiba chastised Neji for going the wrong way, but before they could reach Hinata, she was saved by
Naruto
's
shadow clone
 which had arrived on the battlefield. After a brief argument between Kiba, Naruto and Neji, they mobilised with Naruto to sift out the fake shinobi from the real ones.

Akamaru, along with remainder of the Allied Shinobi Force, arrive at the battlefield.



Later heading out with the other members of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 to where the jinchūriki were, Akamaru and Kiba arrive on the battlefield and stood with the others to face their opposition. When the Alliance's counter-attack was launched, Akamaru and Kiba were buffeted by the fully matured
Ten-Tails
 as it emerged from the hole it had been trapped in.

Later when
Kurama
 had generated enough chakra, Naruto transferred some of it to Akamaru who afterwards, alongside Kiba, charged towards the Uchiha and the Ten-Tails where their combined efforts were able to separate the two Uchiha from the beast. When the Alliance was saved from the Ten-Tails' enormous
Tailed Beast Ball
, Akamaru's behaviour alerted them to the fact that
Minato
 was a reincarnated shinobi. Though Minato waved down their suspicion telling them that he was on their side, Akamaru was later shocked to see
Sasuke
 on the battlefield and even more so when he declared that he would become Hokage. When Kiba later made a comment on Shikamaru's resolve to become an adviser to the Hokage, Akamaru voiced some concern. Shino, however, told Akamaru it was all right as the Hokage could have up to three advisers.

After Madara was
revived

Two years later, during a walk with Kiba, Akamaru began to notice that all of Kiba's friends started finding girlfriends and started settling down, which he found annoying. He felt that humans entered estrous too late and that Kiba was the only real shinobi among his friends for not falling for such desires, believing he would become the Seventh
Hokage
. However, after hearing from many young women that they were certain Naruto was going to be the Seventh, he began to worry about Kiba.

Later, when Kiba went off on his own, Akamaru became worried since he realised Kiba was being deceitful and followed him. Seeing that Kiba was secretly meeting a girl, Akamaru became annoyed and even admitted that Kiba probably didn't have the skills to become Hokage if he focused so much on girls. However, he changes his mind when he realises Kiba was meeting a young vet to give him his immunisations by surprise.

In the end though, Akamaru became overly protective when he noticed Kiba had a strong mutual attraction with
Tamaki
 and tried to "protect" Kiba by fruitlessly pulling him away from her.

Trivia

The 'Aka' in Akamaru's name means the colour 'red', and 'maru' meaning 'perfection' or 'full circle' is a common suffix for Japanese male names. The reason for his name was explained by Kiba when Akamaru's fur turned red after eating a
Military Rations Pill
.

According to the databook(s):

Akamaru wishes to fight
Kuromaru
.

Akamaru's favourite food is the special dog food Kiba makes.

Akamaru shares the same birthday with Kiba, which is also the day when
Tanabata
 starts in Japan.

In an omake segment that aired in Japan for New Year's, Kiba attempted to get Akamaru to talk, with little success. There are no indications that Akamaru even has the potential to speak, other than the fact that other ninken can.

Interestingly,
Naruto
 was first published in a segment of
Weekly Shonen Jump
 known as "Akamaru Jump".

Akamaru in Part I and Naruto have the same seiyū, Junko Takeuchi. However, they have separate English voice actors.

During an interview, Kishimoto was asked which character he would like to see get a spin-off. Possibly as a joke, Kishimoto simply replied "Akamaru".

Akamaru and Kiba can communicate just with a look, but other animal companions such as
Tonton
 require sound to communicate.
