This technique is a speciality of
Konohagakure
's
Inuzuka clan
.

Usage

Following the principles of the clan's use of
ninken
 partners. After creating a
shadow clone
, the user fuses with this clone and their ninken companion into a gigantic, three-headed wolf. This drastically increases their size and power, whilst also gaining them sharp claws and canine teeth.

In their direct attacks, they demonstrate considerable efficiency. Furthermore, using techniques in addition to this gives birth to an extraordinary destructive power.

Trivia

Like its two-headed version, Kiba calls this technique by its full name, Inuzuka-Style Human Beast Mixture Transformation — Three-Headed Wolf (
犬塚流人獣混合変化　参頭狼
,
Inuzuka-Ryū Jinjū Kongō Henge — Santōrō
).

The Three-Headed Wolf transformation is based on the Greek myth of
Cerberus
, a three-headed dog that guards the entrance of the underworld.

Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles
 previewed this attack for comedic sake, with
Rock Lee
 jumping in the middle of Kiba and Akamaru's transformation to become the third head during the pet-sitting episode.

In
Naruto: Shippūden

episode 403
, it was revealed Kiba was inspired to create this technique from watching
Naruto
 use
multiple shadow clones
 at once. While originally wanted to created dozens of heads for the technique, Kiba lacked enough
chakra
 to maintain more than one clone for the technique.
