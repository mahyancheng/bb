Land of the Moon.



The
Land of the Moon
 (
月の国
,
Tsuki no Kuni
,
English TV:
 Crescent Island) is the focus of
Naruto the Movie: Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom
. It is an island nation in the shape of a crescent moon located in the Southern Seas. The guards of this country's kingdom wield
sabers
, spatha and spears. It appears to be a very wealthy kingdom, as prince
Michiru Tsuki
 spent $1,000,000,000 just to buy a circus he was fond of.

Trivia

When Michiru wrote a cheque to buy the circus, he used a $ sign, suggesting that the Land of the Moon does not use
ryō
 as their currency.

Unlike other countries seen in the series, the Land of the Moon is not ruled by a
daimyō
, but a king.
