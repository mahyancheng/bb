Parent and Child Day Arc

Daore and Kūi participate in
Konohagakure
's annual food eating competition. Because this year's contest falls on
Parent and Child Day
, only parents and their children can enter. Daore successfully makes it through the plates of food provided by
Ramen Ichiraku
,
Lightning Burger
, and
Yakiniku Q
, securing his and his father's participation in the final round. But the amount of food ends up being too much for Daore and he faints before he can even start eating the dumplings from
Ankorodō
. His father ridicules him as weak and begins eating the dumplings alone, but ends up vomiting, disqualifying both of them from the contest.

In the anime, the two instead are in league with the Ankorodō's owner, and she rigged the competition in favour of the Dōtonbori, ensuring their Lightning Burgers are not spicy, and their dumpling bowls are shallower than the Akimichi's. However,
Boruto Uzumaki
 caught on, and switched the rigged dumpling bowls to the regular ones, and ultimately, when the Ankorodō owner was exposed for her cheat, the three were scolded by
Shikamaru Nara
.

Some time later, Daore and his father went to a flee market in Konohagakure to look for new clothing. They ironically found what they were looking for from their hated rivals in
Chōji
 and
Chōchō Akimichi
. While Daore and his father were infuriated that the Akimichi didn't recognise them, they still decided to buy from them.

Trivia

His given name of Daore references
kuidaore
, "eat 'til you drop", while his surname could reference the
Osaka district
 associated with that phrase.
