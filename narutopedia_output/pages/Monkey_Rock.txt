This technique creates a giant stone monkey by accumulating surrounding ground and
shaping
 it into the animal, which is then reinforced with
fire
. It's powerful enough to keep up with a
fully manifested Kurama
 and even put it down, requiring a
Susanoo support
 to
defeat
 it. Although, it should be noted Kurama had half of its chakra drained by Momoshiki before Naruto was rescued.

Trivia

While unnamed in the movie and manga, this technique was named in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
.

Momoshiki's ability to create a
pheasant
,
dog
 and monkey is influenced by the tale of
Momotarō
, who befriends the three animals.

If this technique were to follow the same naming format as
Inukaitakerunomikoto
, it would be named Sasamorihikonomikoto (
楽々森彦命
,
Tranquil Forest Young Lord
), after Morihiko Sasa, one of the three retainers in the legend of
Kibitsu Hiko no Mikoto
.

In
Naruto x Boruto: Ninja Voltage
, Momoshiki has a version of this jutsu called Second Demon God: Slaughter (
二鬼神・暴虐
,
Nikishin: Bōgyaku
) in which he summons Monkey Rock to slam the ground, creating a volcanic area of erupting flames before him.

In
Boruto
 episode 62
, Momoshiki is briefly seen creating earthen golems. The golems lack the flames that would otherwise be indicative of this technique.

In the novelisation of
Boruto: Naruto the Movie
, Momoshiki releases a Fire Release that he's
absorbed
 and shapes it into a huge monkey and dog; its power is noted to be a result of the chakra he's just taken from
Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki
. The two forms are defeated by a
Rasengan
 and
Chidori
.
