" (

) is chapter 286 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Naruto
 has difficulty getting along with
Sai
, finding him unpleasant and otherwise inferior to
Sasuke
. Sai has no issues with not living up to Sasuke's precedent, thinking of him as nothing more than a traitor who went to
Orochimaru
 for the shallow reason of gaining power. Naruto tries to attack him for insulting Sasuke but
Sakura
 stops him, instead attacking Sai herself.
Yamato
 breaks up the fight and forces them to get along. To improve teamwork they spend the night at a spa, where Sai once again finds the opportunity to question Naruto's masculinity.
