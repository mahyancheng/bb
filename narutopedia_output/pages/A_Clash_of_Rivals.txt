Konoha Shinden
 manga.

Summary

Mirai
 relaxes in the hot spring of a
ryokan
 with
Tenten
. Because Mirai mistakenly believed her twenty day mission would only last two days, Tenten has brought her additional supplies. Mirai thanks her for going out of her way, but Tenten assures her that it wasn't an inconvenience since she was about to go on a hot spring vacation anyway. What's more, this has given her an opportunity to test a new
kunai
 design that doesn't rust, perfect for use while bathing. Mirai doesn't see why that would be needed, so Tenten contemplates asking
Guy
 and
Kakashi
 about naked women armed with weapons. Mirai asks her not to, worried that Guy and Kakashi would become embarrassed.

Tenten is delighted by this response as it means that Mirai understands Guy. They discuss him, with Mirai remarking how brave he is, but Tenten shares her suspicion that his bravery is an act: that Guy is secretly more scared than anyone else, but acts brave so that others won't be frightened. Mirai considers this while she gets dressed and concludes that, even if true, Guy is nevertheless an amazing person. Tenten agrees, but muses that even Guy would be helpless against ghosts. They find Guy by himself, waiting for Kakashi. When asked why he isn't waiting in his room, Guy offers several excuses, leading Tenten to suggest that he doesn't want to be alone, as the ryokan is rumoured to be haunted. Guy denies this.

Kakashi returns from a phone call with the
Seventh Hokage
. Mirai asks what the reason for the call was, and if perhaps the Seventh had a message for her, but Kakashi states only that they discussed
other matters
. With Kakashi now available, Guy challenges Kakashi to a game of
ping pong
, claiming it's his only reason for visiting this ryokan at all. As Kakashi and Guy head to the game room, Mirai tries to follow, but she's stopped by Tenten, who confides she has a fun idea.
