The Ōtsutsuki Invasion
" (
大筒木、襲来!!
,
Ōtsutsuki, Shūrai!!
) is episode 62 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Momoshiki
 and
Kinshiki
 descend on the arena, to the spectators' confusion. As
Gaara
 recognises the two based on the similarities to the one who attacked him,
Katasuke
 tells them they're interrupting his announcement, prompting Kinshiki to launch an attack. The attack damages the arena, causing it to start collapsing, leading various shinobi to aid with protecting and evacuating the civilians.
Shinki
 prepares to fight but Gaara tells him not to misjudge his own strength, and directs him to help evacuating people. Kinshiki attacks
Sarada
, but
Sasuke
 saves her while Momoshiki kicks
Naruto
 out of the arena.
Boruto
 tries attacking Momoshiki with various
Kote
 jutsu, but he absorbs them all.
Mitsuki
 then tries using his
Sage Transformation
 to save Boruto, but
Urashiki
 absorbs it with his fishing hook.
 Urashiki moves in on Mitsuki, but is blocked by Gaara and
Chōjūrō
.
Shikamaru

paralyses
 Momoshiki and Kinshiki with his shadow, but Momoshiki soon absorbs his jutsu. Sasuke informs Naruto on who they are and what they want, and as the Ōtsutsuki invaders explain how they'll acquire power, Boruto recognises it's the same as his use of the Kote. Naruto and Sasuke don't consider what they have as true power. Urashiki fights Gaara and Chōjūrō, using Gaara's
sand
 against him, and breaks Chōjūrō's
sword
. Chōjūrō creates a water spike from his hand, and he and Gaara chastise Urashiki on relying on the power of borrowed weapons instead of the skill acquired through dedicated training. Momoshiki and Kinshiki scoff at Naruto and Sasuke's assertion what they use isn't true power. Momoshiki eats a chakra pill, and produces an attack by
amplifying
 the many jutsu he has absorbed. Momoshiki sends a
fire pheasant
 at them, but Naruto blocks it by manifesting
Kurama
's head and creates
shadow clones
 to protect civilians still in the arena. Momoshiki sends several elemental attacks through the arena. Sasuke
armours
 Kurama's head with his
Susanoo
. Meanwhile, Urashiki blocks Chōjūrō's water spike with his fishing rod, and produces a
Lightning Release
 he absorbed from Mitsuki from his gourd. Urashiki sees through Gaara's sand, and uses sand of his own to counter it. Urashiki produces
many fishing hooks
 to attack Gaara, but is blocked by a
massive water vortex
 Chōjūrō created with underground water, which Gaara dug up for him with his sand. Urashiki activates his tomoe
Rinnegan
 and
escapes
, but not before taunting them with his clansmens' work on the arena. Naruto resists Momoshiki's attack, impressing him, so he consumes more chakra pills, creating a massive attack. Naruto asks Sasuke to protect the children, and fully manifests Kurama's form. He considers using a
Tailed Beast Ball
 to counter the attack, but chooses against it. Sasuke explains to Boruto that Naruto could have easily countered the attack, but doing so would damage a lot of the surrounding area. From all over Konoha, people watch Naruto take the full force of Momoshiki's attack. As it detonates, Boruto experiences Naruto's memories through his chakra, and cries out as the blast reaches him.

Trivia

When Momoshiki comments on his veil being damaged, he's depicted without his ponytail.

Momoshiki is seen creating the black sphere as his final attack for the second time, despite the fact that he'd already created the sphere in the beginning of his assault.

Naruto and most of his clones are depicted with the same design of
Six Paths Sage Mode
 as in the
movie version
 of the events, but one of the clones is briefly seen with the design of
Naruto Gaiden
.

The episode has a number of differences from
Boruto: Naruto the Movie
 including:

When Momoshiki and Kinshiki appear, they gently land on the arena, instead of crashing into it.

As Boruto's last battle was with
Shinki
 instead of
Shikadai
, Shikadai is digitally removed from the scene that he appeared right after the sudden arrival of the Ōtsutsuki.

The Ōtsutsuki stay on the ground during their explanation about their goal, which is much longer and more detailed than in the movie. They only begin to rise into the air to attack after Naruto claims their power is not a true power.

Gaara and Chōjurō confront Urashiki after he steals Mitsuki's chakra.

Momoshiki's black orb created by his absorbed chakra is much smaller and it doesn't darken the sky until he creates a second orb later. As a result, all scenes in-between were digitally edited to have a blue sky.

Naruto charges a Tailed Beast Ball but doesn't fire it.

When Kinshiki appears to destroy the arena in the movie, Momoshiki did not appear alongside him, in the anime however, Momoshiki does appear alongside him.
