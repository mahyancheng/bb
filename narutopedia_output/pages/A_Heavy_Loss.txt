 anime.

Synopsis

Funamushi
 stabs
Kagura
 so they can feel how he felt when
Seiren
 was injured.
Team 7
 and the
swordsmen
 attack, Funamushi counterattacks with
Water Release
. Enraged,
Boruto
 activates his
Kāma
 and lands a
Rasengan
 on Funamushi before joining the others in checking on Kagura.
Gokai
 commands the
Funato
 to retreat, Funamushi too injured to keep fighting despite wishing to avenge Seiren.
Hebiichigo
 closes Kagura's wound, and
Sarada
 and
Iwabee
 try
healing
 him.
Mitsuki
 notes the difficulty of providing
medical care
 in such an isolated village. Kagura asks them to protect the village, and hands Hebiichigo his petition for having the swordsmen released. He thanks
Buntan
 for sticking with him, and asks
Kyohō
 to protect them. He gives his final words to Boruto, and dies.
Misuno
 and
Chōjūrō
 confirm Kagura's intel that the Funato at sea are stalling for time.

Isari
 wants to keep stalling, but
Tenma
 wishes to fight, admitting he's not smart like Isari, wishing
Araumi
 to recognise him for his strength. He thinks back to being adopted by Araumi after his parents abandoned him, aiming to be strong like Araumi. They receive a message from Funamushi's group about Seiren being injured while trying to get
Ikada
. Tenma wants to fight, but Isari stresses they must reformulate the plan. Kagura is buried at the village's tree. At night, Boruto and
Kawaki
 want to strike back, but Sarada says they must have a plan. Buntan argues that following Kagura's orders brought them far, so they need to pick a new leader, and they agree it should be Sarada. Boruto thinks back to his history with Kagura. Team 7 asks him about the Kāma activating earlier. He explains that while
Amado
's drugs have halted its extraction, the process can't be undone, so he can draw on its power without
Momoshiki
 taking over.
Jibiki
 informs Isari that Tenma's boat is gone. He tries to infiltrate
Kirigakure
's ships with his unit, but is discovered. He fights Chōjūrō with his
weapon
 and
Water Release
, but Chōjūrō and the Kiri-nin overpower them until only Tenma remains. Chōjūrō kills him and he falls into the sea, wishing Araumi had praised him. Isari witnesses it. Kirigakure's fleet goes on the offensive and the Funato retreat. Isari swears vengeance on Chōjūrō.
