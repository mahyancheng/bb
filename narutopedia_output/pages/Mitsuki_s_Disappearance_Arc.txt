Summary

Five Kage Summit





The Kage Summit begins.



Mitsuki wakes up after dreaming of when
Log
 and
Orochimaru
 both orchestrated him to join either one of them, and becomes surprised he can dream. At
Lightning Burger
, Mitsuki tells his friends about having his first dream while wondering what to eat, and
Boruto
 is surprised Mitsuki has never had a dream. When Boruto asks him, he confesses he never felt like rebelling against his parent.
Shikadai
 and
Inojin
 joins them, the former who has a chicken on his shoulder, and explains it became attached to him after it hatched during his mission. When
Sarada
 and Boruto explain it imprinted on him, Mitsuki compares it to first seeing Boruto after deciding not to choose neither his brother nor his father. Sarada reminds Team 7 they have security duty for the
Five Kage Summit
. At the summit, due to the meeting's topic being about the
Ōtsutsuki clan
, the acting Kage invite
Kakashi
,
Mei
 and
A
.
Darui
 notices
Ōnoki
's absence, prompting
Kurotsuchi
 to inform the
shinobi
 her grandfather had travelled to
Konohagakure
 with her, but slipped away, leading to them deducing he's sightseeing.

While keeping watch, Mitsuki asks Boruto if he ever felt like his thoughts weren't his own, and wonders if his attachment towards his friends is like the chicken imprinting on Inojin. Boruto dismisses his concern, saying they're not chickens. Boruto goes onto to telling his teammates a question Naruto asked him earlier, about what the hardest rock in the world is. Learning that Konoha shinobi are searching for Ōnoki, Boruto becomes excited as he's sure the
Tsuchikage
 would know the answer to his father's riddle. Running into Ōnoki, he reveals he knows who Boruto and Sarada are, but not Mitsuki. Telling the Kage he needs to attend the summit, Ōnoki tells them he doesn't want to attend the boring meeting. Boruto then asks Ōnoki his riddle, resulting in Ōnoki agreeing to tell the three if they show him around the village, which they agree to. At the summit, they discuss
Urashiki
, and Naruto states
Sasuke
 has left to investigate, while Kurotsuchi is irritated by her peer's easygoing attitude.





Ōnoki befriends Team 7.



While touring the village, a construction beam falls towards a villager, leading to Ōnoki using
Dust Release
 to save them, resulting in him passing out from exhaustion. Waking up, Ōnoki mistakes Boruto for
Kozuchi
, and explains that he was Ōnoki's grandson who died in his youth. Fulfilling his promise to the
genin
, Ōnoki reveals the hardest rock in the world is the unbreakable will of shinobi. Ōnoki asks Mitsuki about his will, but the genin finds himself unsure and it being complicated.

Attack on Konoha

Mitsuki later returns to his apartment to find it had been entered, and notices a letter had been placed on his bed, which he decides to light on fire. The next day before dawn at Konoha's main entrance,
Uō
 and
Saō
 are attacked by two assailants. While the Konoha shinobi are losing in their fight, Mitsuki attacks Uō with
Lightning Release
. After sunrise, the site is turned into an investigation scene by the
Police Force
, and
Kōtarō
 reports to
Sai
 that the two guards had been in attacked and were in comas. While surveying the scene, Sai finds a
forehead protector
 in the woods.

While Sarada and Boruto wait for Mitsuki in the village, they decided to go find him to tell Mitsuki they their mission was cancelled. Unable to find him,
Chōchō
 informs the pair that all the village's
jōnin
 were instructed to assemble in the Hokage's office. Boruto and Sarada tell
Konohamaru
 that Mitsuki is missing, and questions why the jōnin had been ordered to assemble. Konohamaru states it's for a meeting in relation to the Five Kage Summit before departing. The two suspect him of hiding something, and go to Hokage's office to eavesdrop. Naruto discusses the earlier attack with Kakashi, Sai, Konohamaru and
Shikamaru
, during which
Tsunade
 enters the office. Sai brings out the headband he discovered, leading to Konohamaru identifying it as Mitsuki's. A shinobi informs Naruto that they were ready for the investigation, prompting the group to leave for the
medical department
.

Pursuit of Mitsuki

Ino checks the mind of the attacked guards, discovering Mitsuki attacked them alongside two Iwa shinobi. Naruto institutes a village lockdown until Mitsuki is brought back. Boruto and Sarada decide to bring Mitsuki back by themselves. Naruto contacts Kurotsuchi, who confirms she didn't send any shinobi, and promising that if she found Boruto, Sarada, or Mitsuki, they'd be taken to Iwagakure before being sent back to Konoha.
