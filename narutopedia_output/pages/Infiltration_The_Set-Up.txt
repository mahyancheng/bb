"
Infiltration: The Set-Up!
" (
潜入　仕組まれた罠
,
Sen'nyū Shikumareta Torappu
) is episode 171 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

While on the beach,
Anko
, still unconscious, was being tended to by
Ino
. Meanwhile,
Naruto
 spoke of his encounter with
Isaribi
 earlier. The episode then moved to Anko's sudden reflection on her memories. She saw
Orochimaru
 approaching towards her, telling her that the
Hokage
 had found out about their experiments.
Shino
, Naruto and Ino decided to continue with their original mission: to protect the official payments and to capture the Kaima.

The group headed to Demon Island, an island located in the
Land of the Sea
 where supposedly the Kaima resided. Anko awoke and explained that the Kaima was a human who had undergone physical transmutations. Whilst they were talking,
Yoroi
 and Isaribi headed underwater to Orochimaru's lair. Inside, Isaribi passed on the information relating to the official payments, and asked when she would return to normal. Yoroi told her that she was a prototype and that, when he was done collecting information from her, he would change her back. He then sent her to dispatch Naruto and the rest of the group, who had just arrived on the shore.

Shino, Naruto and Ino found themselves in an experimental laboratory with many creatures contained in test pillars. Isaribi approached from behind and triggered a trapdoor. The three
Genin
 fell through the trapdoor, after which Anko appeared behind Isaribi with a kunai at her throat. Isaribi managed to escape, and left Anko locked in the room to face three large lion-like mutations. Anko made quick work of the three.

The rest of the team faced Yoroi Akadō, who was working for the enemy. Shino accepted his challenge while Naruto and Ino continued on to meet up with Anko. Anko, Naruto and Ino then found themselves facing
Amachi
 and Isaribi. Amachi and Isaribi ran off just as
Misumi Tsurugi
 appeared to face them. Ino used her mind manipulation jutsu to restrain him. Shino's opponent disappeared as the island began to collapse. Isaribi, Amachi and Yoroi escaped on a ship, leaving Team Anko to perish in the collapsing building. Naruto began to frantically search for an exit.
