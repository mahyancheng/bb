The user uses a giant
roll of cloth
 to tightly wrap up the intended opponent, completely immobilising them, thus preventing them from moving or using any techniques. The ability itself is versatile as once completed, the addition of further
seals
 can be placed on top of the bound victims, preventing them from even being summoned while in effect. This technique is used by
Sunagakure
 ninja. Mere physical contact with the cloth seems to be required to use this technique.
