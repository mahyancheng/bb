The
Weaknessless Soaring Shortswords
 are
twin Jian
 created by the
Takumi Village
. They are designed to respond to attacks and allow the user to transform wind freely. They will also boost the user's attack power to the highest limit. These swords' greatest advantages are harnessing the user's chakra and performing high-level
wind
 techniques with a minimal cost of chakra,
 effectively, letting a Wind Release specialist fight for extended periods of time unhindered. The user can also create whirlwinds to carry them in midair, achieving a form of flight.

Hōki would later take this weapon for himself. Because the blades can be merged together, he wielded them as one powerful blade. Seimei was, however, not seen possessing the blades himself despite using their powers.
