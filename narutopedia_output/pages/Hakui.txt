Hakui
 (
白医
) was a
missing-nin
 of the "
Leaf's Anbu
" who appeared in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3
 that served under
Shinga
.

Personality

He was Shinga's loyal servant, and he referred to him as
Lord Shinga
 (
真牙さま
,
Shinga-sama
). He thought very highly of him, killing others simply because they were "his Lord's enemy", and shared his goals. Out of battle, he appeared to be very calm and collected, being a lot more reasonable and detached than his comrade,
Dōshin
.

Appearance

Hakui had long, light blond hair that he usually kept slung over both of his shoulders in two ponytails, which gave him a somewhat feminine appearance. His eyes were light bluish-grey. Like most of Shinga's subordinates, he wore a dark grey mask decorated with red marks that cover half of his face. After swallowing his ability-enhancing pill, his hair was spikier, and his body became bulkier and more muscled.

Abilities

Hakui was able to transform into a much more muscular version of himself by using a special type of food pill similar to the
Mind Awakening Pill
. While in this form, he had increased strength, speed, and agility. He was able to use attacks similar to those used by
Strong Fist
 users. He could also roll himself into a ball and spin, using his hair as spikes. In this form, Hakui's attacks were wild and rapid, but uncoordinated.

Plot Overview

Hakui was a member of Shinga's supporters, one apparently unaffected by his mind control. He assisted him in his attack against
Konohagakure
. When
Sasuke
 travelled to
Tsukigakure
, he stopped him in his path and challenged him. Though he utilised a food pill which increased his strength before fighting, he was defeated while battling Sasuke.

Trivia

Hakui's name is Japanese for "white doctor". When written as 白衣, it refers to the white clothes worn by
doctors
.
