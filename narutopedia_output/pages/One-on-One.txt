Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Knowing that, even in
Sage Mode
, he cannot defeat three
Rinnegan
 users that are able to share sight,
Jiraiya
 retreats. In addition to being able to react to any physical attack,
Pain
, a former student, knows all of Jiraiya's abilities. To get around this particular fact,
Ma and Pa
 propose a sound-based
genjutsu
, an area that Jiraiya himself has little skill with. While they prepare the attack Pain is drawn to their location. To buy time, Jiraiya cuts off the three Rinnegan from each other, allowing him to finally fight one-on-one.
