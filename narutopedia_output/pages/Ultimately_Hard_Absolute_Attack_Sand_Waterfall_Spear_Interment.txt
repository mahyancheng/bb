Gaara claps his hands together, causing a giant mound of sand to rise up from below the opponent, trapping and restraining every part of their body except for the head. He then summons a large amount of
sand
 in the form of Ultimately Hard Absolute Attack: Spear of Shukaku, which he then sends towards the giant mound of sand at intense speed, aimed at the opponent. Due to the size of the spear, it rips the enemy apart, killing them and causing the mound to explode.
