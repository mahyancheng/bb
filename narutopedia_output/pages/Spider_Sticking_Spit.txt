Kidōmaru
 spits a thick rope of webbing from his mouth at a target. The rope is very sticky because of all the webs that are layered together, which Kidōmaru can further increase (or decrease) the stickiness of by altering how much
chakra
 flows into the rope. The rope attaches firmly to targets at the point of contact, allowing Kidōmaru to fling them around into the surroundings. Alternatively, the rope itself can be used to damage targets directly as a
whip
.
