Plot Overview






Sandayū with the army of samurai, preparing to attack Dotō.



Sandayū hired
Team Kakashi
 to escort Yukie to the Land of Snow. He suggested this location to Yukie's movie director, so that he could bring her back to the land and make her the heiress of the throne which Dotō Kazahana had stolen.

When they reached the Land of Snow, Dotō arrived at the movie set. Later, Sandayū led a group consisting of 50
samurai
 to attack Dotō, in the hopes of avenging the late
daimyō
 Sōsetsu Kazahana, Dotō's brother and Koyuki's father, whom the latter had killed ten years prior. However, Dotō's ninja subordinates launched multiple waves of
kunai
 from their mortar-mounted train compartments, massacring the entire brigade. Later before his death and after Dotō's retreat, Sandayū managed to tell Koyuki not to cry for him with his dying breath.

After Dotō's demise, Koyuki became the new daimyō and saw the vision of Sandayū and her father until they disappeared.
