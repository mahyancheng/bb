Naruto RPG 2: Chidori vs. Rasengan
 is the second game of the
Naruto RPG
 series released for the
Nintendo DS
 (the first being released in the US as
Naruto: Path of the Ninja
). A limited edition version of the game was created as well. This version has Sasuke on the cover, as well as on the manual and game card.

Gameplay

The game's story spans from the
Search for Tsunade
 arc until the end of the
Sasuke Recovery Mission
. It deals with Sasuke's frustration at Naruto becoming stronger, while Sasuke himself is still too weak to defeat Itachi.

The graphics were significantly improved from the first game and all the character sprites were redesigned. Several new playable characters were added who can be switched out at various times in the story.  The game was not released outside of Japan, and was skipped, with the third game in the series, Naruto RPG 3, instead being released as Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2 in the US. It was the 105th best-selling game of 2005 in Japan, selling 121, 321 copies.
