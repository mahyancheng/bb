Viz:
 The Strongest Enemy!!) is chapter 196 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Kidōmaru
 fires an arrow at
Neji
's blindspot. Neji, having suspected his blindspot had been discovered, is able to dodge enough to keep the attack from killing him. Kidōmaru realises that Neji must have surrounded the area with
chakra
 to compensate for his blindspot and pick up on anything that approaches from that direction. Disappointed that the strongest "character" of the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 has been figured out so easily, Kidōmaru modifies his arrow to make it faster and adds a string to guide it mid-flight. Once a fleeing, injured, exhausted Neji presents his blindspot, Kidōmaru fires again and successfully hits him.
