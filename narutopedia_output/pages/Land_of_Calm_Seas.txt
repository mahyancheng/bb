The
Land of Calm Seas
 (
凪の国
,
Nagi no Kuni
) is a small, coastal country.
 Journey on foot from
Konohagakure
 takes two days. It has historically been a nation in ruins until its
current daimyō
 took control of the government and economy. The nation is dealing with an epidemic, but due to the daimyō monopolising the treatment, most citizens can't afford it.

After the
Konoha

genin
 managed to defeat the assassins sent by the daimyō and deliver
Mozuku
's medicine to
Aosa
, as they couldn't directly interfere with the daimyō's governance, the
Seventh

Hokage
 instead decided to send
medical-nin
 to act as aid relief for the Land of Calm Seas' citizens.
