After hearing
Team Jiraiya
's warnings, Kaya and the other villagers decided to go to safety. However, since her younger son Komichi lost his teddy bear, he and Ashitaba went back to the village, with Kaya being unable to stop them. Instead, she went to a shrine dedicated to the deity "Lord Mashima", praying for their safety. While doing so, she was approached by
Team Asuma
, who, after hearing her circumstances, joined Team Jiraiya in the underground to rescue Kaya's sons. They safely returned them, leading Kaya to initially believe the rescue was thanks to Lord Mashima's mercy.

After returning to their village again, a
giant explosion
 occurred during the night, killing Kaya and her family.
