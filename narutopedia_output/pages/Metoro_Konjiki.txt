Metoro Konjiki
 (
金色メトロ
,
Konjiki Metoro
) was a terrorist of
Ishigakure
 and
Etoro Konjiki
's younger twin brother. Metoro, alongside his brother, specialised in destroying buildings or merchant ships.

Personality

Compared to his older brother, Etoro, Metoro was very taciturn and the more silent of the two.

Appearance

Metoro wore a flashy ring on one of his fingers. Not much else is known about his appearance, except that with Metoro and his brother being twins, they were similar in appearance, as
Gaara
 noted them using their appearance as a factor in tricks.

Abilities

Metoro was capable of combining two unknown
natures
 to use the
Steel Release

kekkei genkai
, with which he was able to create
balls of steel
 in the form of projectiles, to use in unison with his older brother's
Lava Release
 techniques, and
steel shields
. He also showed some capability in
genjutsu
, combining it with a basic
Clone Technique
 to trick his targets into making the first move, leaving themselves open to cooperative attacks. Gaara noted that Metoro and his older brother,
Etoro Konjiki
 had large war potential.

Blank Period

Gaara Hiden: A Sandstorm Mirage

Metoro and his older twin brother Etoro were in an organisation of terrorists, who were targeting Gaara, with the
Kazekage
 recognising the two terrorists from the
Bingo Book
. As the two boasted about their achievements, Gaara attacked them with his
Sand Binding Coffin
, but it was revealed to be just a
Clone Technique
 in unison with
genjutsu
. When Gaara noticed them on the ceiling, Metoro created a ball of steel and his brother created a ring of fire for it to go through, aiming the attack at
Hakuto
. Their combined attack, however, was withstood by the Kazekage's
Shield of Sand
 with support from his
Wind Release
.
Surrounded in sand
, the brothers readied their second attack, but
Shijima
 came to back-up Gaara, throwing a bunch of hōshuriken to distract the two, with Etoro melting them. However, the
compressed air
 in the hōshuriken greatly injured Etoro. As Metoro was distracted by his brother's injuries, Gaara took the opportunity to slice Metoro with his
sand sword
, killing him. His body then fell off the ledge of the building.

Metoro was later shown to have survived the fall, but was killed in the desert by Gaara, when the terrorist appeared during the Kazekage's battle against
Shigezane
.

Trivia

Metoro's last name, Konjiki (
金色
), literally means "golden colour".
