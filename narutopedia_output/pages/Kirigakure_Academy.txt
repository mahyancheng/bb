Part of the Kirigakure Academy.



The
Kirigakure Academy
 is a building in
Kirigakure
, where
students
 train to become
shinobi
. Activities include training in
kenjutsu
, which is regarded as more advanced than what the
Konohagakure

Academy
 teaches, being also taught while walking on water.

During the days of the "Village of the Bloody Mist", students wishing to graduate had to fight their peers to the death, and only those who survived could advance to the ranks of shinobi (in
the novel
, this ritual only applied to the families who were annexed into Kirigakure after being defeated in battle)
. This was to eradicate emotions in exchange for combat efficiency. The graduation practice was discontinued after a young
Zabuza Momochi
 killed an entire year's graduating class.
