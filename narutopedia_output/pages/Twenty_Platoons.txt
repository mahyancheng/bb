The

 (

Fifth Hokage
 consisting of twenty four-man teams.
 Their mission is to scour the
Land of Fire

Known Teams

Led by
Asuma Sarutobi
, with

 as members.
 The team investigates the
Fire Temple
, which two members of Akatsuki have recently attacked. Though
Chiriku
 was killed in the attack, his body was not found among the dead, leading the team to suspect that the Akatsuki members intend to collect the
bounty
 on his head. They travel to the bounty office nearest to the Fire Temple and instruct other teams to check other offices in the area.
 The team finds the Akatsuki members,
Hidan

 but Asuma is mortally wounded during ensuing the battle and dies from his injuries. Hidan and Kakuzu are able to flee the scene,
 but are subsequently tracked down and eliminated by Asuma's students and friends.
