 manga.

Summary

Naruto
 continues to struggle with combining
Rasengan
 with his
Wind Release

chakra
. He suggests that it is impossible, like looking to the left and right at the same time. To lighten the mood,
Kakashi
 creates a
shadow clone
 to let him do just that, giving Naruto an idea. Meanwhile,
Akatsuki
 is busy sealing the
Three-Tails
.
Hidan
, irritated that his battle had to be interrupted, asks why Akatsuki is capturing the
tailed beasts
. The
Akatsuki leader
 explains that it is to develop a monopoly over wars by using the tailed beasts as weapons, thereby gaining control over the world.
