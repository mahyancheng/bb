The
Mangekyō Sharingan
 (
万華鏡写輪眼
,
literally meaning:
 Kaleidoscope Copy Wheel Eye) is an advanced form of the
Sharingan
 that has only been activated by a handful of
Uchiha
 when enduring a traumatic enough experience.
 They are noted to be the "heavenly eyes that see the truth of all of creation without obstruction" (
天壌の理を掌握せし瞳
,
tenjō no kotowari o shōakuseshi hitomi
).

Overview






Izuna and Madara after awakening their Mangekyō Sharingan.



A Mangekyō Sharingan is distinguished from a normal Sharingan by its appearance, which changes the form of the
tomoe
 seal. While the exact design differs for each user, they all resemble
pinwheels
. It is initially awakened by the trauma suffered from the fear or grief of losing someone dear, usually related to their death.
 Uchiha have historically misunderstood this criteria as the user needing to be responsible for the person's death, and for that reason they developed the practice of killing their closest loved ones in order to gain the Mangekyō Sharingan.

The Mangekyō Sharingan retains and enhances all of the Sharingan's generic abilities.
 In addition to that, the Mangekyō grants powerful abilities that differ between each eye, though abilities may be similar in nature; both Sasuke and
Itachi
 have access to
Amaterasu
's flames, though the extent to which they can use them differ, Sasuke's control of Amaterasu being regarded as superior to Itachi's. The abilities of a Mangekyō Sharingan may not be the same for both of a single user's eyes, as Sasuke's left eye can unleash Amaterasu while the right eye can manipulate his flames with
Kagutsuchi
. Likewise, each eye may not even be limited to just one ability, as at least Itachi's right eye has Amaterasu and
Tsukuyomi
, and Sasuke's right eye has shown to be capable of Amaterasu separately.

As each eye houses the particular
dōjutsu
, one can only access them if they currently house the said eye, even if they were the originator of the said technique. If a user awakens the Mangekyō in both eyes,
 they are able to perform
Susanoo
, even without either eyes. In even rarer occasions, it is possible for one to manifest the "straight tomoe" (
直巴
,
choku tomoe
) as in the case of both Madara and Sasuke,
 granting them greater fluidity in their movements when fighting.
 Madara was able to sense this form and later deduced that he and Sasuke must be
connected
 by
more than blood
. The Mangekyō Sharingan also grants its user the ability to read and decode the
Uchiha Clan's Stone Tablet
 to a greater degree than the standard Sharingan, but to a lesser one than the
Rinnegan
.

As with any dōjutsu, Mangekyō Sharingan can be transplanted into non-Uchiha, granting them all its abilities albeit with steeper
chakra
 demands. Unlike the standard Sharingan, a transplanted Mangekyō Sharingan can be freely activated or deactivated by non-Uchiha at will. Abilities of a Mangekyō Sharingan can also be programmed to activate under certain circumstances, either within the user's own eyes or in a target of the user's choosing; this programming remains even after death.

Using them comes with a certain sensation that
sensors
 can feel, although it doesn't show which technique is being prepared.
 Even for true wielders, usage of the Mangekyō Sharingan's abilities can cause a great strain on the user. It drains a considerable amount of chakra when simply activating and maintaining the advanced dōjutsu, and even more through each technique used. Even more, it can cause considerable damage to their being, leaving the body in agonising pain and causing deterioration to their vision until eventually over-usage leaves them blind.
 Their vision can be restored by transplanting the eyes of an Uchiha with strong blood ties — ideally a sibling — thus awakening the so-called
Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan
 (
永遠の万華鏡写輪眼
,
Eien no Mangekyō Sharingan
).
 Unlike with other transplants, this second evolution will allow the user to retain their original techniques in addition to obtaining the techniques of the new eyes (Sasuke's Amaterasu resided in his left eye, but after transplanting Itachi's eyes, he could use it with his right eye as well, Itachi's right eye was the one he used Amaterasu through). Although these eyes merge the designs and capacities of the two Uchiha's Mangekyō Sharingan, they're still the eyes of the original owner and thus react to certain
techniques
 that are aimed at the original owner's Mangekyō Sharingan.
Sasuke
 describes the process of gaining eternal eyesight as Itachi’s ocular power becoming his own.
 Also, they no longer suffer any negative side-effects from using them; bodily harm and chakra drain are reduced to an unnoticeably minimal level and the eyesight is no longer harmed at all. According to
Madara
, the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan is proof an Uchiha has continued to push forward despite experiencing great losses.

Variations

Itachi Uchiha

Itachi Uchiha
 awakened his Mangekyō Sharingan after witnessing the suicide of his best friend,
Shisui Uchiha
, shortly before the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
.
 Within each eye, he wields two extremely powerful techniques. The first is
Tsukuyomi
, a
genjutsu
 that distorts the victim's perception of time. The second is
Amaterasu
, creating inextinguishable and overwhelming black flames at the user's focal point. Since he awakened both his Mangekyō, he could use
Susanoo
. Because both Tsukuyomi and Amaterasu used vast amounts of chakra, combined with his terminal illness, multiple use of the Mangekyō's abilities in a short period of time was particularly debilitating for Itachi, such that after using it three times in one day, he was required to deactivate even his normal Sharingan to conserve energy.
 Sometime after Itachi's death,
Sasuke Uchiha
, desiring the power to kill
Naruto Uzumaki
, had Itachi's eyes transplanted into him. Years later, the left eye was destroyed by
Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki
.

Obito Uchiha



Obito Uchiha
 awakened his Mangekyō Sharingan after witnessing the death of
Rin Nohara
 during the
Third Shinobi World War
; Obito only had his right eye at the time, but the event caused his Mangekyō to simultaneously awaken in
Kakashi Hatake
, who wielded Obito's left eye.
 Obito's eyes both contained
Kamui
, the power to teleport targets to a
personal dimension
. Kamui had two aspects, one contained within each eye. The right eye has a short-range variation to seamlessly transport parts or all of his body, and those in contact with him into the dimension, effectively simulating intangibility to pass through solid objects. The left eye has a long-range variation to producing a portal of varying sizes with an attractive force that pulled things into the other dimension.
 The left eye could also target the user themselves for complete teleporting.
 During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, it was discovered that each eye was impervious to the others' Kamui.

Madara Uchiha
 stole Kakashi's eye in order to pursue Obito to Kamui's Dimension. There, he exchanged the eye for Obito's
Rinnegan
, returning both eyes to their original owner, who was currently
controlled
 by
Black Zetsu
. During this brief period, Black Zetsu also gained access to both Sharingan powers. After Obito was freed from Black Zetsu's control, he used them in combination effectively thereafter to retrieve Sasuke from
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
's distant dimension. But soon afterwards, both of his eyes are destroyed when he was killed by
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
's
All-Killing Ash Bones
. Using his small amount of stolen
Six Paths Chakra
, Obito's spirit briefly returned to the living plane and inhabited Kakashi, manifesting both Mangekyō with their respective abilities through Kakashi and, by extension,
Susanoo
.

Madara Uchiha

Madara Uchiha
 was the first Uchiha to awaken the Mangekyō Sharingan.
 It's not known what the individual abilities of each of his eyes were, nor what triggered the awakening, but he was able to use
Susanoo
. He also possesses a straight tomoe in his eyes, granting granted him even greater fluidity in his movements when fighting. When Madara's over-usage of his Mangekyō during the
Warring States Period
 left him blind, this prompted his brother,
Izuna
, to bequeath Madara his eyes on his deathbed for the sake of preserving the Uchiha, thus granting Madara the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan.
 Many however came to believe that Madara forcibly stole the eyes from his brother.

Towards the end of his life, Madara was able to evolve his eyes into
Rinnegan
, which he transplanted to
Nagato
 when Nagato was a child without anybody ever knowing. For the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Obito wielded Madara's left Rinnegan as wielding both would have been too strenuous. Eventually both eyes found their way back to Madara after he was
revived
.

Izuna Uchiha

Izuna Uchiha
 awakened his Mangekyō Sharingan shortly after Madara did.
 It's not known what the individual abilities of each of his eyes were, nor what caused the awakening. Before he died, Izuna entrusted his eyes to Madara in order to restore his vision and thus protect the Uchiha from extinction.
 Despite Izuna giving the eyes willingly, Madara is popularly believed to have taken the eyes by force.

Sasuke Uchiha

Sasuke Uchiha
 awakened his Mangekyō Sharingan the truth behind his brother,
Itachi
's
actions
 and lamenting his death. With either eye,
 Sasuke can cast
Amaterasu
, as well as
shape and extinguish them
. Because he awakened both of his Mangekyō, he can use
Susanoo
. The straight tomoe of his Mangekyō Sharingan grant him superior fluidity in his movements when fighting. Sasuke is initially reluctant to transplant Itachi's eyes and gain the Eternal Mangekyō, claiming that his views were different from Itachi's. Later, deciding he needs the increase of strength in order to kill
Naruto Uzumaki
, along with the severe deterioration of his eyesight from overuse, Sasuke accepted Itachi's eyes transplant.

After acquiring the half of
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
's chakra, Sasuke's left eye evolved further, into a Rinnegan. While Sasuke is evidently unable to deactivate the Rinnegan, it still retains access to all its Mangekyō's abilities. This eye was destroyed by
Boruto Uzumaki
 while being controlled by
Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki
.

Shisui Uchiha



Shisui Uchiha
 awakened his Mangekyō Sharingan after the guilt of allowing his friend and rival to die. With each of his eyes he could use
Kotoamatsukami
, a powerful genjutsu that manipulates a target's thoughts so perfectly and absolutely that no one, including the target themselves, would have the slightest idea that they were being controlled. However, this technique couldn't be used with the same eye more than once in a given day.
 In the
anime
, awakening the Mangekyō Sharingan in both eyes allowed him to use
Susanoo
.

When Shisui attempted to use Kotoamatsukami in order to avert the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
, his right eye was stolen by
Danzō Shimura
, who felt Shisui's plan was futile and desired its power form himself to protect the village in his own manner. Fearful that Danzō would take his other eye too, Shisui entrusted it to his best friend,
Itachi
, and begged him to use it to save
Konoha
.
 Danzō transplants the eye he took into himself and uses it over the years to manipulate others to his way of thinking, using the chakra of
Hashirama Senju
 to reduce its recharge time to a few hours. Danzō destroyed the eye before his death so that nobody else could have it.
 Itachi transplanted the eye he was given into a
crow
 that he planned to use to re-ally his brother, Sasuke, with Konoha.
 He used it on himself instead when he was
reincarnated
 in order to break free of
Kabuto Yakushi
's control. Itachi
incinerates
 the crow afterwards since it would take a decade to recharge and so that nobody else could have the eye.

Indra Ōtsutsuki

Indra Ōtsutsuki
 was the first user of the Mangekyō Sharingan. The individual abilities of each of his eyes were unknown, except that he was able to use
Susanoo
.
 In the anime, he awakened his Mangekyō Sharingan after killing his two closest followers. With his left eye, he was able to use
Hinokagutsuchi
 to produce black flames.
 In
Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
, Indra also has the ability to use
Amaterasu
.

Shin Uchiha





The Mangekyō Sharingan of
Shin Uchiha
 is unique as its form and powers are shared between multiple (yet connected) individuals. How it was originally manifested is unknown. With his right eye, Shin was able to
telekinetically manipulate any objects
 after first branding them with a special mark that he placed by direct contact with his hand.
 Shin's
clones
, being genetically identical to him, possess the same Mangekyō Sharingan design and with it the same telekinetic powers.

A creature
 also shares the same Mangekyō Sharingan design with Shin.
 Despite having multiple Mangekyō Sharingan, neither Shin nor his clones displayed the ability to use Susanoo.

Fugaku Uchiha

In the anime,
Fugaku Uchiha
 had awakened his Mangekyō Sharingan after witnessing a sacrifice of his dear friend during the
Third Shinobi World War
, yet chose to keep it a secret from the rest of the Uchiha Clan in fear of tempting its members to obtain this power through immoral means. Although not much is known about his Mangekyō, Fugaku was confident it was strong enough to control the
Nine-Tails
.

Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki

In the anime,
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 awakened this power after temporarily killing his brother,
Hamura
, to save him from their mother
Kaguya
's control; however, the design of his Mangekyō Sharingan is unknown because his eyes evolved further into the
Rinnegan
 at the same time. This unique simultaneous evolution apparently gave Hagoromo the same stability from using his Mangekyō and its techniques that would normally only come from an Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan. While the individual techniques his eyes had are unknown, he was able to create an exceptionally massive
Complete Body — Susanoo
, which was roughly the size of the
Ten-Tails
.

Sarada Uchiha

Sarada Uchiha
 awakened her Mangekyō Sharingan when
Boruto Uzumaki
 was framed for killing the
Seventh Hokage
 due to
Kawaki
's
wish
, crying in fear for Boruto's safety.
 However, she could not consciously access this power until three years later. Both of Sarada's eyes wield
Ōhirume
, which create numerous orbs that act as focus point for her to control the gravitational force for a variety of effects. In addition, she can specifically select what targets she will and will not affect with the orbs.
 When using it on herself, it allows her to simulate flight to move about freely in the air. When used on other targets, she can redirect or draw targets toward to the orbs of her choosing. Offensively, once a target is pulled into contact of the orb of her choosing, the gravitational pull is amplified to implosion, instantly obliterating the target.

Hikari Uchiha

In
Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
'
,
Hikari Uchiha
 awakened her Mangekyō Sharingan at some point during the
Warring States Period
 by unknown means. Much like Itachi, Nanashi was able to use both
Tsukuyomi
 and
Amaterasu
, and like Sasuke, can
control
 the shape of the black flames produce by the latter. In addition, she could also use the
Engraved Tsukuyomi
, a
genjutsu
 similar to the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 in which she reflected the light of her Mangekyō Sharingan off of the
Moon
 to brand all those caught within it with a marking resembling her Mangekyō Sharingan. She also has
Yachihoko
, which allowed her to control the minds and chakra of everyone branded by the marking of the Engraved Tsukuyomi all the while erasing their memories.
Merz
, who had a pair of
artificial Sharingan
 that could take on a Mangekyō state resembling Nanashi's, could also use the aforementioned techniques in addition to being able to use a
Susanoo
 much larger than Sasuke's own and Naruto's
Tailed Beast Mode
.

Trivia

Originally in the anime,
Itachi Uchiha
 was shown using techniques exclusive to the Mangekyō Sharingan without having it active.
 This is because
Kishimoto
 had not revealed the appearance of the Mangekyō Sharingan in the manga yet. A true form of the Mangekyō Sharingan was first seen, from Itachi, while
Sasuke
 remembered the events leading to the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
 as he fought with
Naruto Uzumaki
 at the
Valley of the End
.

Despite using his Mangekyō extensively for over a decade, Obito never displayed any signs of fatigue or deteriorating eyesight.

The manners in which an individual gains the Mangekyō Sharingan are almost parallel to how an Uchiha awakens their regular Sharingan for the first time, since both need intense emotions to awaken them. While the Sharingan simply requires an intense emotion of any kind, the Mangekyō Sharingan requires a person be traumatised by the loss of a loved one.

In the manga,
Sasuke Uchiha
's Mangekyō Sharingan is the only one with an inverted colour scheme, boasting a red design and black irides.

If a person is struggling between whether or not to feel saddened by a person's death, they will experience eye irritation, which will either fade as time passes or will eventually awaken the Mangekyō Sharingan, if they end up feeling genuine sadness.

In the manga, Indra's Mangekyō Sharingan is revealed to have a swirl design. This was also depicted and adapted to the anime. However, later in the anime, his Mangekyō bears the same design as Sasuke's.

While an Uchiha usually obtains their Mangekyō immediately after their trauma, in
Naruto Jinraiden
,
Sasuke
's Mangekyō didn't activate until several weeks afterwards as he was coming to terms with his trauma.






Sarada's Mangekyō Sharingan teased in a artwork.



Sarada's Mangekyō Sharingan was teased in a piece of artwork released in the
first volume
 of
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
, 7 years prior to its
debut
 in the manga.

Despite Fugaku's Mangekyō Sharingan being a secret, a similar design was featured in a book at the
Konoha Library
.

It is hinted that Straight Tomoe Mangekyō Sharingan is connected to Indra as Madara (correctly) speculated he and Sasuke shared some connection beyond blood due to both of them awakening Straight Tomoe Mangekyō Sharingan, even though he wasn't able to pinpoint their precise connection.

It is also hinted that being Straight Tomoe do not correlate to Mangekyō Sharingan design and it also exists in the Sharingan stage as well: Madara's original Mangekyō Sharingan did not have a straight design, but Izuna's did and Madara stated only he and Sasuke awakened a "Straight Tomoe Sharingan" rather than "Straight Tomoe Mangekyō Sharingan".

Sarada's Mangekyō Sharingan awakened uniquely compared to all those before her, as her Sharingan progressed to its next stage out of fear of losing someone dear to her as opposed to actually losing them and witnessing their death as the initial trigger. This would imply it is not the loss of a loved one, but enduring enough emotional trauma is what triggers the evolution.

In
Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
, Merz's
artificial eyes
, having copied Nanashi's dōjutsu, manifested the Mangekyō Sharingan with the same pattern as hers.
