Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Victor
 observes as the Konoha-nin fight
Anato
.
Mugino
 considers
Boruto
 soft for not wanting to attack Anato over his promise to
Mia
, so
Konohamaru
 suggests
sealing him
. Anato is able to break through Konohamaru and Boruto's seal, and attacks him.
Mitsuki

restrains him with snakes
, one of them biting through a chunk of his arm when he also breaks free. Victor's subordinates all attack him from afar with
Scientific Ninja Tools
. Victor berates them for failing to restrain Anato and tells them to return to Konoha, while his company will provide care for Anato. Boruto picks up Anato's wedding ring. Boruto is frustrated with their failure. Mitsuki experiences loss of feeling in his arm. Victor visits a facility Anato worked at, and tells a subordinate a missing item Anato had is still missing. They report what they know of the events. Victor orders Anato's death, and receives a report of a mismatch on the number of search party members and corpses found. Something is spreading over Mitsuki, starting from his arm. Mugino knows of a doctor nearby, and takes them to see
Yubina
. She notices Boruto's injury, and painfully grabs his hand, healing it in a show of her skill. Yubina examines Mitsuki, and determines a foreign matter has invaded his system. As
Sarada
 has some experience with
Medical Ninjutsu
, Yubina has her assist in removing the matter from Mitsuki while the others wait outside.
 Mugino vouches for Yubina's skill. Yubina extracts a wood chip from Mitsuki. After resting, Yubina comments on the uniqueness of Mitsuki's body, crediting it for his survival. She shows them the wood chip she extracted, and reveals it was created with
Wood Release
. Mugino finds it unlikely that Anato would have
Hashirama
's cells, but Yubina shows them
another patient
 with similar symptoms. Konohamaru and Mugino explain the dangers of those cells. Yubina wants to use Mitsuki's resistance to treat her patient. She doesn't know her patient's origin, who was just left unconscious on her door, but knowing that Hashirama's cells are involved, she connects it to a black market rumour she's heard. Mugino and Konohamaru are apprehensive, as the only black market around the area is in the
Land of Silence
.
