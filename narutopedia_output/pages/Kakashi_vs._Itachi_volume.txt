 a piece of

 engages Itachi. Itachi tries to catch him in a
genjutsu
 but finds that it is only a
shadow clone
. Having created an opening, Kakashi instructs
Naruto
 to attack. Naruto then strikes Itachi with his
Big Ball Rasengan
. When looking at the dead body, they discover that it was only a
body double
 used remotely by Itachi, just as
Kisame

人柱力…!!
,
Jinchūriki…!!

Out of curiosity
Sakura
 questions
Chiyo
 about
jinchūriki
, individuals that have had a
tailed beast
 sealed within them. Experiments intended to help in controlling the power of their
tailed beast
, jinchūriki have access to great power, power that interests
Akatsuki
. Sakura asks what will happen to
Gaara
 or any other jinchūriki that has had its tailed beast removed.
Chiyo
 says they will die. Sakura worries about
Naruto
, but he says there is no need. They continue towards Akatsuki's base. Akatsuki, meanwhile, finishes extracting
Shukaku
 from Gaara's body. At that same moment
Team Guy
 arrives outside.

Chapter 262

"
Raging Feelings…!!
" (
駆ける思い…!!
,
Kakeru Omoi…!!
)

Team Guy
 tries to break into the
Akatsuki
 lair, alerting Akatsuki to their presence. Elsewhere, knowing they are running out of time to save
Gaara
,
Naruto
 picks up the speed.
Chiyo
 asks
Kakashi
 why Naruto is so committed to saving Gaara. Just as Gaara is the
jinchūriki
 of
Shukaku
, Naruto is the jinchūriki of the
Nine-Tails
, a similarity that transcends the fact they are from rival villages. Touched, Chiyo reveals that she was the one who sealed Shukaku into Gaara's body, and wonders if perhaps ruining Gaara's life to give
Sunagakure
 a weapon was a mistake.
Team 7
 joins up with Team Guy.

Author's Note

“

These days, I often hurt my wrists when I wake up in the morning. When I sit up, I put too much weight on one hand and end up twisting it. You're not too aware of things when you just woken up. So, everyone please be careful when you wake up in the morning.
