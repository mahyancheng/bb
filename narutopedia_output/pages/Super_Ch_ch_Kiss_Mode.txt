Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

In her excitement about the kiss scene,
Chōchō
 briefly loses control over her jutsu, returning to her true form for a moment.
Sarada
 is impressed with Chōchō when she's done with hair and make-up. Chōchō wants to deliver
Tomaru
 the perfect kiss in their scene. At the set,
Inojin
 and
Shikadai
 notice Chōchō is nervous, and Tomaru tells her to be herself. As they record the scene, Inojin quietly comments it doesn't look like true love, which the director agrees with, and decides to cut the scene. Chōchō is furious with Inojin. Meanwhile,
Konohamaru
 and
Moegi
 investigate the scene of the first attack, and find footprints. Sarada suggests
Ashina
 they should postpone production, but she refuses. Between takes, Ashina makes suggestions for how Tomaru should deliver his lines, and it's revealed the episode they're shooting will be her last.
Boruto
 and Sarada comment on the strange atmosphere at the studio.
 Chōchō gets flustered when Tomaru likes the food they're eating. Based on the escape route they found, Konohamaru and Moegi determine the attacker either studied the studio very carefully to find the least guarded routes, or they were given inside information. Tomaru's fans break through the studio gates, so Chōchō takes him away while Shikadai and Inojin hold the fans off. Chōchō hides with Tomaru in a locker, and they almost kiss before Sarada finds them. Sarada questions Chōchō's focus on the mission. Tomaru asks Chōchō for the ring he gave her, and asks to read a scene with her. They almost kiss again, but are interrupted when
Mitsuki
 comes asking for a dress for Ashina, upsetting Chōchō enough that she attacks him. Ashina asks why Chōchō is wearing her dress. Tomaru takes Ashina aside to explain the situation, and they criticise each other based on how different they are from their characters. Chōchō continues attacking Mitsuki, and Shikadai has to stop her with his shadow. In her frustration, Chōchō reverts to her usual weight, ripping Ashina's dress just as she comes for it. Ashina and Tomaru don't recognise Chōchō, and Tomaru is rude to Chōchō based on her weight. Sarada tries to tell Tomaru off, but Chōchō stops her. Sarada later apologises to Ashina for causing trouble, but she is still upset and reminds Sarada that the production is very important to her. The
Amegakure
 assailant contacts someone from the studio with a radio, confirming Tomaru and Ashina's position.
