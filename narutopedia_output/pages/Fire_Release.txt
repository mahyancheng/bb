A Fire Release technique.



Fire Release
 (
火遁
,
Katon
,
English TV:
 Fire Style) is one of the five basic
nature transformations
. Fire Release is commonly affiliated with the Tiger
hand seal
.

Overview

Fire Release is almost always used offensively, typically by kneading
chakra
 in the body into flames that the user breathes from the mouth.
 Simpler applications of Fire Release include creating a
stream
 of fire, or alternatively breaking the stream into
bursts
 of flames. Once produced, the fire can be
shaped
 or otherwise
manipulated
, but exerting such control requires careful skill. If the flames are
channelled
 into weapons, such as a sword, that allows the user
greater finesse
 with how the fire is spread. Fire Release can take the form of
ash clouds
 that linger in the air, burning and blinding those caught in it, or be
erected as a shield
, burning away anything that tries to cross it. Less commonly, Fire Release encompasses using flames from other sources, such as
exploding tags
, with users
focusing
 the explosions against opponents.

Fire Release is common among ninja of
Konohagakure
:
Jiraiya
 frequently uses Fire Release in
combination
 with his
summoned

toads
, the toads'
oil
 increasing the flame's heat and range; members of the
Uchiha clan
 are not considered adults until they've learned to perform the
Great Fireball Technique
, and with practice they can
generate flames
 strong enough to overcome
Water Release
; members of the
Sarutobi clan
 frequently use Fire Release, and in fact
Fire Release: Great Flame Technique
 is considered a
hiden
 ability of the clan.

Fire Release is naturally strong against
Wind Release
 and weak against Water Release.
 Fire's strength over wind makes it an effective way to, when used collaboratively, make flames more powerful.
 If enough Fire Release techniques are used, that can create ideal weather conditions for
Lightning Release
, such as
Kirin
. When Fire Release is combined with other natures, certain
kekkei genkai
 are produced: fire and
earth
 make
Lava Release
; fire and water make
Boil Release
; fire and wind make
Scorch Release
. The combination of fire, earth, and wind produces the
kekkei tōta
,
Dust Release
.
