The user connects five "forbidden" (
禁
,
kin
) tags to each other using their own
chakra
. One of the tags is applied to a central location that the user wishes to prevent access to, while the other four are applied to surfaces in the surrounding area. So long as at least one of the tags remains in place, a
barrier
 will be created over the central location that prevents it from being opened or in any way physically damaged. Those wishing to remove the barrier are advised to break into two small teams for maximum efficiency: one team focuses on removing the four surrounding tags, while the second team removes the central tag and immediately afterwards storms the stronghold.

The Five-Seal Barrier erected over an
Akatsuki
 lair in the
Land of Rivers
 has tags spread across an incredibly wide area, with one tag being 500 meters northeast of the lair's entrance and another being 800 meters southwest of the entrance.
 This means having a
sensor
 among those intending to breach a Five-Seal Barrier can save a significant amount of time.
 Because the tags, once located, are simple to remove, the
Akatsuki leader
 pairs his Five-Seal Barrier with
a booby trap
.
