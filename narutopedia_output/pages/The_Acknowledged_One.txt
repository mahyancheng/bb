Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Naruto
 fights to clutch onto his soul that the now-revitalised
Nagato
 was attempting to
remove
 from his body,
B
 arrives at their location and attempts a surprise attack but it is foiled by the shared field-of-vision Nagato has with the
Giant Snake-Tailed Chameleon
 and the
King of Hell
 which had been summoned to store the young man's soul. In the clutches of Nagato's
mechanical arms
 with a
cannon
 pointing at him in point-blank range, the two
jinchūriki
 are saved by
Itachi
 and his
Susanoo
. Nagato, however, quickly regenerates and uses
Chibaku Tensei
 with the intent of crushing his targets into the planetary body.

Though Naruto raised the alarm that there was little they could do against this technique, Itachi rallies the group and has them use their most powerful
long

ranged

attacks
 to target the centre of the sphere, effectively neutralising the attack. In the aftermath of this, Itachi is able to pierce Nagato with his
Totsuka Sword
 freeing the
Rinnegan
-wielder from
Kabuto Yakushi
's control. With the time he had left, Nagato lamented the fact that he had sullied the brilliant legacy their
master
 had left behind and told Naruto to be the most amazing end to the trilogy that he could be. With this, Naruto tries to move out to the battlefield, but his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 wears off leading Itachi to tell him to not rely solely on his own power, but to put some trust in his comrades and their own power. After telling B to take care of Naruto, he incinerates the
crow
 with
Shisui
's
Sharingan
 and departs to deal with the person controlling the
reincarnated
 shinobi.
