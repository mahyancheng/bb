Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Naruto
 looks at
Jiraiya
's coded message, that appears to be a string of numbers. He informs
Shikamaru
 that the first character is not a number, but
katakana
 for "ta", a writing quirk of Jiraiya only Naruto would know.
Kakashi
 suggests that that is meant to indicate
Icha Icha Tactics
 is the key for the other, actual numbers. Taking the first word on each page of the book, they form the message of "the real one is not among them". They have no idea what this means, so ask someone who would. In
Amegakure
, the
Six Paths of Pain
 sets out for
Konoha
, the one Jiraiya captured having been replaced.
