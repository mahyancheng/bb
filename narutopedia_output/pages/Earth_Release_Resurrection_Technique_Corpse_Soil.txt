The
Earth Release Resurrection Technique: Corpse Soil
 is a jutsu that reanimates the deceased using bodies made of dirt and soil.
Kazuma
 described it as the ultimate
Earth
 element
resurrection technique
.

Overview

By utilising soil in the local ground, the user can revive the fallen in one of two ways.

The first version allows the user to seemingly continuously resurrect a large number of slain people as zombies, but with none of their rationality, physical prowess, or
techniques
 at their disposal. They are fairly easy to destroy. If the technique is deactivated either by the user's will or if the user is killed, the zombies will immediately turn to dust.

The second version allows the user to bring a person back as a perfect resurrection, able to use all their skills from when they were alive, with the addition of a preset directive the person is forced to obey despite being consciously aware. Unlike the
Impure World Reincarnation technique
, the
soul
 is not bound to the body, hence those resurrected cannot heal themselves and can be killed. This method requires a large amount of energy (i.e.
electricity
). At any time, by performing a Snake
hand seal
 and snapping their fingers, the caster of this technique releases the resurrected targets, turning them into loose soil.
