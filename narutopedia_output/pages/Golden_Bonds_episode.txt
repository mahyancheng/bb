Synopsis

With the situation becoming dire on
Darui
's battlefield, headquarters decides to send him the
Kohaku no Jōhei
 in order for him to seal the rampaging
Kinkaku
.
Shikaku
, through
Inoichi
's
telepathy
 alerts Darui to their plan, telling him to hold out until the
Ino–Shika–Chō
 trio could arrive. Wondering how they would be able to send the pot in time,
A
 allays
Tsunade
's worries noting that his secretary
Mabui
's abilities would come in handy here. Using her
Heavenly Transfer Technique
, Mabui transports the pot to Darui who then faces Kinkaku head on in order to protect the pot until reinforcements could arrive.

Joined by some of his
division
's remaining members, they lay a counter-attack which is able to hold off Kinkaku until
Ino
,
Shikamaru
, and
Chōji
 arrives. Calling out to his squad members, they launch an
explosive
 attack which masks Chōji's
attack
. The young man is easily thrown however, but buys enough time for Shikamaru to
bind
 Kinkaku. Declaring that this was trivial, Kinkaku easily breaks Shikamaru's technique and moves to attack him with his tail. This attack is stopped, however, within a split-hair of Shikamaru's face by Ino, who had
transferred
 her consciousness into Kinkaku. Opening the pot and calling out Kinkaku's name, Ino responds and Kinkaku is absorbed. Wondering how it was that he and his brother could have been defeated by such third-rate shinobi, Darui explains that when you amass enough copper pieces, they'll eventually be worth more than gold and silver. Regrouping and moving on to the next battle, the trio is confronted by
Kakuzu
 who looms over them as he tells them that even though they had captured his side's gold and silver pieces, Akatsuki also had gold and silver pieces of the Alliance as he shows them
Dan Katō
 and later, much more to their shock, their former sensei:
Asuma Sarutobi
.

Trivia

In the anime, Kakuzu is shown strangling three Iwa shinobi. In the manga, he is shown strangling an Iwa shinobi, a Kiri shinobi and a Konoha shinobi.

In the dub, due to a translation error, A said several shinobi tried imitating Kinkaku and Ginkaku's eating Kurama's flesh by eating Gyūki's tentacles and all died as a result. In the manga and Japanese dub, A said only one shinobi tried this method and died.
