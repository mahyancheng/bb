Hashirama Senju
 creates a dense growth of trees, controlling how it grows using his
chakra
. The trees' life force is immense enough to split the earth as they sprout and further pierce through any other obstructions they encounter. This growth is also fast enough that it can capture targets before they have a chance to escape. Hashirama used this technique to serve as a foundation for
Konohagakure
; none other than Hashirama have been capable of such a feat.
 In the anime,
Kinoe
 attempted to use this technique, but failed.
 Years later, he instead uses
Wood Release: Nativity of a Sea of Trees
, a similar yet smaller-scale version of this technique.

Trivia

"Sea of trees" (
樹海
,
jukai
) is an idiom referring to a large expanse of dense woodland. This technique changed the last kanji from sea (
海
) to world (
界
), probably to reinforce the greatness of the forest created.

In
Tō no Sho
, this technique is classified as
hiden
 instead of a
kekkei genkai
.
