Senbon
 are metal needles with a point at both ends. They often serve a medical purpose, being used to strike
acupuncture points
. They have little killing power, but can be thrown with great accuracy. A user with proper medical knowledge, however, can effectively use senbon in battle to incapacitate or even kill their target should they aim for vital spots. To make these needles more effective, the user can
poison
 the tips of the senbon. An added benefit of throwing these at the enemy is that they are smaller than a
kunai
 or a
shuriken
, making them harder to see and dodge. As explained by
Shikamaru Nara
 at the
Chūnin Exams
, ninja can also attach
bells
 to the senbon to trick their opponent.
