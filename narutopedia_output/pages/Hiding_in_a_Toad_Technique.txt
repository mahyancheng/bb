The user summons a special Diving
Toad
 (
潜り蝦蟇
,
Moguri Gama
) from
Mount Myōboku
 and hides inside its stomach.

The frog is able to dive up to a hundred metres in fresh water, making it especially useful for infiltrating enemy camps that are surrounded by a river or a lake. The stomach of the frog also has a special barrier that obstructs chakra, protecting the user from detection-type ninjutsu.
