This is a
genin
 team from
Sunagakure
, consisting of
Ameno
,
Kōji
, and
Shishio
. The team travelled to
Konoha
 to participate in the Konoha-Suna joint
Chūnin Exams
. After the team passed the first round of the exam, they raced to the
Demon Desert
 in the
Land of Wind
 where the second stage of the exam was being held.

The team lost its
scroll
 after clashing with
Team Asuma
 (with
Sakura Haruno
 as a temporary member). It is unknown if they could manage to gather both scrolls during the rest of the second stage, but a sudden change in the regulations renewed the possibility for them to become
chūnin
. Whether any of the members actually got promoted, however, is not known.
