This combo attack has the user elbowing the opponent, then punching them in the face, sweeping their feet, double kicking the enemy twice and sending them high into the air, then using
Lightning Cutter
 on the falling victim as they land on it with their back. This can only be performed with Kakashi's
Sharingan
 active.
