 (

) was once a member of the
Twelve Guardian Ninja
.

Background






Seito as a member of the Twelve Guardian Shinobi.



While he was still alive he was part of the Twelve Guardian Ninja. Ten years before the start of the series, six of the members tried a coup d'etat. He, alongside
Asuma Sarutobi
,
Chiriku
,
Kitane
,
Tōu
, and
Nauma
 fought against them, only to be killed by Kazuma when Seito and the three other survivors tried to use
Limelight
 on him.

Abilities






Seito's destructive capabilities using Limelight.



As one of the Twelve Guardian Ninja, he was one of the strongest shinobi in the
Land of Fire
, powerful enough to be chosen to be the direct guard of the daimyō. He had an elemental affinity for
lightning
. When in the four cardinal directions, he,
Kitane
,
Tōu
, and
Nauma
 could use a jutsu called
Limelight
 to reduce everything within the area they had surrounded, to ash.

Part II

Twelve Guardian Ninja






Seito and the other Twelve Guardian Ninja revived.



During the beginning of the filler arc his, along with Kitane's, Tōu's, and Nauma's corpses were stolen by grave robbers, and they were later revived using lightning. After being revived they were all approached by Asuma, who had figured out the scheme of the robbers. There he tried, without success, to stop the three of them, who seemed to have become mindless puppets. He started walking towards an unknown point whilst emitting large amounts of lightning, and, after arriving at his destination, began preparing his part of the Limelight technique. When Kitane was killed by
Asuma Sarutobi
,
Kazuma
's plan failed, and he decided to release the summoned Nauma, Tōu, and Seito.
