Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Sakura
 puts herself between
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 to get them to stop, but they are not able to.
Kakashi
 catches them and sends them into two opposing water towers. He points out that they went overboard for a casual fight, and Kakashi lectures Sasuke for using the
Chidori
 against a friend. Sasuke is unconcerned, instead happy to see that his Chidori did more damage to the water tower than Naruto's
Rasengan
. On closer examination, however, he finds that the Rasengan did more damage. He jealously leaves. Kakashi also lectures
Jiraiya
 for teaching Naruto the Rasengan saying he is too young to handle it, and Jiraiya shoots back that Kakashi shouldn't have taught the Chidori to someone hellbent on vengeance. Kakashi continues saying he should know better since Sasuke and Naruto are like
Orochimaru
 and Jiraiya once were; Naruto longs to be acknowledged by Sasuke as an equal, and Sasuke is feeling inferior to Naruto's growth . Kakashi assures Sakura that he will speak with Sasuke. Elsewhere, the
Sound Four
 observe Sasuke.
