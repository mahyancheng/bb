Summary

Before leaving for the
Kage Summit
 with his bodyguards,
Danzō
 arranges extra surveillance on
Naruto
, needing him to remain on
Konoha
 and also believing
Sai
 may betray him. As Naruto is elsewhere beaten up by
Karui
 so that she can relieve her anger, Sai steps in and stops her, saying
Sasuke
 is not worth the trouble either of them are going through. Sai tends to Naruto's wounds and takes him to
Kakashi
 and
Yamato
. Naruto tells them about his meeting with the
Fourth Hokage
 and the Fourth's allegations against
Tobi
. Fearing the influence Tobi is having on Sasuke, Naruto wants to speak with the
Fourth Raikage
 and ask him to forgive Sasuke. Kakashi and Yamato agree. Elsewhere, Danzō and his bodyguards are attacked by several enemies. Wanting to deal with them on his own, Danzō reveals his
Sharingan
.
