Fury
 (
怒髪天
,
Dohatsuten
) is a technique which could create a massive explosion, capable of wiping out an entire village. It was developed by En no Gyōja, and his granddaughter
Hotaru
 had the kinjutsu implanted on her back.
Tonbee
 stated that En no Gyōja gave him the scroll to unseal and destroy the deadly
kinjutsu
.

Usage

Before the technique can be performed, the user must first gather a large amount of
chakra
 by using the
Tsuchigumo Style: Forbidden Life Technique Release: Creation of Heaven and Earth
 to power it. Seeing the technique's enormous potential as a weapon of mass destruction, the
Third Hokage
 proclaimed this as a kinjutsu, so as to keep
his village
 safe. Despite the technique's power,
Utakata
 was able to absorb all its power and destroy it by using his
Tailed Beast Mode
.

Trivia

In exchange for declaring Fury as a kinjutsu, the Third Hokage and En no Gyōja made a treaty that Konoha will lend aid to the Tsuchigumo Clan in times of need.
