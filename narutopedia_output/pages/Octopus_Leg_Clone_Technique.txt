By using a small portion of
Gyūki
's chakra and sacrificing one of its tentacles, Killer B can create a flawless clone of himself that neither the
Sharingan
, nor the
Akatsuki
, could distinguish. This clone is apparently long-lasting and can sustain considerable damage, only reverting back into the tentacle when completely drained of chakra.
