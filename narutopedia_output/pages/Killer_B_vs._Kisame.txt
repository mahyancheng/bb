Summary

Sakura
 refutes
Naruto
's claim that she is lying. Although Naruto points out that she would not come to the
Land of Iron
 just to tell him she loved him, Sakura insists it is true. She encourages Naruto to give up on trying to bring
Sasuke
 back to
Konoha
 for her, but he states that that is no longer his main reason for looking for Sasuke. Sakura leaves without another word. She then starts her own search for Sasuke, unaware that
Sai
 is leaving behind an
ink clone
. Elsewhere, the battle between
Kisame
 and
Killer B
 starts to heat up. B tries various times to attack Kisame, but Kisame's
Samehada
 absorbs his
chakra
 before any of the attacks can connect.
