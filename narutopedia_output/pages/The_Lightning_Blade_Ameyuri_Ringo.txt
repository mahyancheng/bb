As
Guy
 and
Kakashi
 prepare to regroup their forces, they receive word that one of the units were engaged in battle with
Ameyuri Ringo
 and decide to head to that location. Elsewhere, Ameyuri mercilessly attacks the members of
Yurui
's unit. With Yurui dead and only a handful of members left, the new leader of the team
Nurui
 decides that they should escape as they were no match for one of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
. As they flee,
Omoi
 who believes that they should stand and fight, gets into an argument with Nurui and
Kayui
 tries to quell the argument, but, Omoi unable to take the coward's way out turns and prepares to face Ameyuri. Clashing with the
kunoichi
, Omoi is soon overpowered until Nurui and Kayui arrive and lure her away as Ameyuri notes that she always saved the best for last. The two shinobi are soon incapacitated by Ameyuri's attack, leaving Omoi to lure her away once again. Using her
Lightning Release: Thunder Gate
 once again, Ameyuri is shocked to see the ground beneath her give way as she and Omoi began to sink into the uncovered marsh. When the Third Division arrives in time to rescue Omoi, Ameyuri who had seemingly grown to like the young
Kumogakure
-nin, gives him her
swords
 as a parting gift.
