Sasori uses the
Third Kazekage

puppet
 to release a spike of
Iron Sand
 at the opponent that then drills them into some rocks. He then makes a huge cube of iron sand to
fall
 on the opponent, crushing them.

Trivia

The moves done by Sasori to perform this technique are similar to how he fought
Sakura
 in the manga and anime.
