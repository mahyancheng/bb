Viz:
 Nine O'clock) is chapter 587 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Using this time,
Sasuke
 questioned his brother about
Izanami
.
Itachi
 explained the mechanism behind the technique, the history of
their clan
, their use of
Izanagi
 and why Izanami was created. He then told his brother that
Kabuto
 would be freed from Izanami once he accepted his fate. Somewhat angered that Itachi would use a technique that the victim could escape, Sasuke questioned his brother who told him that he wanted to give Kabuto the opportunity to accept his fate — something he himself could not do during his lifetime. This explanation only served to irate Sasuke more who believed his brother to be perfect, but Itachi refuses this claim. All throughout this, Kabuto continued to battle on in his mind, refusing to give up. Elsewhere on the battlefield, a grown up
Urushi
, told one of his comrades about his
home
 and hoped that by the time he got back, his brother, Kabuto, would be there. Meanwhile at the cave, Itachi prepared to end the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
.
