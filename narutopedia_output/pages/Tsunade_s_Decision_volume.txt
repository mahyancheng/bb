Tsunade's Decision!!
 (
綱手の決意!!
,
Tsunade no Ketsui!!
,
Viz:
 Tsunade's Choice) is volume 18 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 154

"
Arrival…!!
" (
到達…!!
,
Tōtatsu…!!
)

Worried,
Tsunade
 tries to leave
Tanzaku Quarters
, but
Shizune
 convinces her to visit some tourist attractions first. Meanwhile, the mark on his palm is still not helping
Naruto
 to concentrate his
chakra
. He remembers back to his days in the
Academy
 when
Iruka
 had him concentrate on his studies by placing a leaf on his forehead. Deciding to make use of a lesson he dismissed at the time, Naruto modifies the mark into the appearance of a leaf, finally helping him concentrate enough chakra into his
Rasengan
 to burst the rubber ball, completing the second step. As Tsunade and Shizune elsewhere look at Tanzaku Castle, the castle collapses and
Orochimaru
 emerges from the rubble.

Chapter 155

"
The Third Step
" (
第三段階
,
Daisan Dankai
)

For the final step of his
Rasengan
 training,
Naruto
 must again use a balloon. This time, however, he is not to pop it. He is instead containing the power of his spinning chakra within a spherical shape; the balloon is merely a guide to achieve this goal. Although this is much more difficult than the first two steps, Naruto and
Jiraiya
 must keep moving if they are to find
Tsunade
. In
Tanzaku Quarters
,
Orochimaru
 confronts Tsunade. Seeing the condition Orochimaru is in, she immediately refuses to heal him. She does ask how his arms were so badly damaged, to which he responds it was carelessness when killing the
Third Hokage
. When this upsets Tsunade, the Third having been her teacher, Orochimaru points out that she should be used to losing loved ones.

Chapter 156

"
The Deal
" (
取り引き
,
Torihiki
)

Angered by
Orochimaru
's words,
Shizune
 attacks him.
Kabuto
 blocks her attack.
Tsunade
 tells her to calm down and then proceeds to decimate the wall behind her, a warning for Orochimaru not to mock her again. She tells them to leave but Orochimaru offers to revive her two loved ones if she will heal his arms. Finally interested, Tsunade asks what he would do if regained use of his arms. He responds that he would destroy
Konoha
.

Chapter 157

"
The Answer is…?!
" (
答えは…!?
,
Kotae wa…!?
)

Jiraiya
 and
Naruto
 near
Tanzaku Castle
. Along the way they learn that the castle was destroyed by a giant
snake
. Suspecting
Orochimaru
, they race to the scene.
Tsunade
 considers Orochimaru's offer to revive her loved ones in exchange for healing his arms, despite knowing it would mean
Konoha
's destruction.
Shizune
 tries to convince Tsunade to kill Orochimaru since Dan and Nawaki would not place their lives over the village, but Orochimaru takes advantage of Tsunade's fear of blood to immobilise her. Deciding to give her a chance to think, Orochimaru leaves and tells her he will be back in a week to see what her answer is. Jiraiya and Naruto arrive after everyone has left, but happen to run across Tsunade and Shizune while later getting dinner. Jiraiya bluntly asks her to become the next
Hokage
, confirming the
Third Hokage
's death for Tsunade.

Chapter 158

"
I Won't Forgive You…!!
" (
許さねぇ…!!
,
Yurusanee…!!
)

Tsunade
 refuses to become
Hokage
.
Naruto
 does not care about her answer and suggests dragging her back to
Konoha
 so that she can heal
Kakashi
 and
Sasuke
. Tsunade observes to
Jiraiya
 that Naruto is more obnoxious than the
Fourth Hokage
, his previous disciple. Tsunade goes on to say that the Fourth needlessly gave his life for the village. With the
Third Hokage
 having now done the same, just as the
First Hokage
 and
Second Hokage
 did, Tsunade concludes that being Hokage is a joke. Naruto lashes out at her for insulting the previous Hokage. Tsunade agrees to fight him and, although he is out-classed, he continues trying to attack her. She asks why he cares, to which he responds being Hokage is his dream. Reminded of
Dan
 and
Nawaki
, Tsunade is distracted, giving Naruto a chance to attack with his incomplete
Rasengan
.

Chapter 159

"
The Wager…!!
" (
賭け…!!
,
Kake…!!
)

Recognising the
Rasengan
,
Tsunade
 creates a fissure in the ground. Naruto falls in and the Rasengan is forced into the ground. Seeing that it is incomplete, Tsunade reprimands
Jiraiya
 for teaching him such a technique as it just gives Naruto unwarranted hope. Determined to prove her wrong, Naruto vows to master the Rasengan in three days. Tsunade offers the deadline of a week instead. If he can stay true to his word, he can have her
priceless necklace
; if he fails, she gets
his wallet
. Naruto accepts and runs off to start training. Tsunade and Jiraiya get drinks, during which Jiraiya reveals he is aware of some deal she has made with
Orochimaru
. If she decides to help him, Jiraiya states he will not hesitate to kill her. He then observes that Naruto is very much like her brother
Nawaki
, which
Shizune
 elsewhere decides to tell Naruto about.

Chapter 160

"
The Necklace of Death…!!
" (
死の首飾り…!!
,
Shi no Kubikazari…!!
)

To defend
Tsunade
's harsh words,
Shizune
 tells
Naruto
 about why she is now so pessimistic and why her
necklace
 is so important. When Tsunade was younger she gave the necklace to her younger brother,
Nawaki
, in the hopes it would help him achieve his dream of becoming
Hokage
. He died the next day, a casualty of the
Second Shinobi World War
, returning the necklace to her. After that she began advocating adding
medical-nin
 to squads to prevent more deaths like her brother's. This gained
Dan
's attention who, also wanting to be Hokage, wished to save as many lives as possible. Tsunade gave him her necklace when they began dating to help him in his goal. He too died during the war, and in her failed attempts to save him she developed a fear of blood. The necklace came to be regarded as cursed and Tsunade lost faith in dreams and the Hokage. Deciding to prove her wrong, Naruto resumes his
Rasengan
 training so that he can win the necklace from Tsunade.

Chapter 161

"
Tsunade's Decision!!
" (
綱手の決意!!
,
Tsunade no Ketsui!!
)

Tsunade
 thinks about
Orochimaru
's offer to revive
Dan
 and
Nawaki
 and, in turn, her time with them when they were alive. All the while, she observes
Naruto
's progress with the
Rasengan
. Naruto is still unable to contain the Rasengan's strength into a sphere shape. After a week, he appears to have lost his bet with Tsunade, not having mastered the Rasengan.
Jiraiya
 and Tsunade have drinks together the night before the deadline, during which Tsunade slips something into his drink.

Chapter 162

"
The Unresisting Heart…!!
" (
抗えぬ心…!!
,
Aragaenu Kokoro…!!
)

Tsunade
 checks on an unconscious
Naruto
. Because of his week of intense training, she concludes he will sleep for several days. Knowing that he hadn't mastered the
Rasengan
 and believing it now impossible for him to do so before the challenge deadline, Tsunade begins to leave.
Shizune
 tries to convince her not to help
Orochimaru
 and goes so far as to face off with Tsunade, but she is easily bested and knocked unconscious. As Orochimaru and
Kabuto
 head towards the meeting place, Orochimaru remembers Shizune's earlier actions and sends Kabuto to eliminate her. The next morning Naruto wakes up Shizune, the
Nine-Tails
 within him having healed his injuries faster than the two women expected. Shizune tries to pursue Tsunade but is stopped by
Jiraiya
, who has been drugged by Tsunade and is having difficulty moving. Noticing Kabuto, Jiraiya questions Shizune about Orochimaru's secret arrangement with Tsunade. At
Tanzaku Castle
, Tsunade offers to heal Orochimaru's arms if he will promise to leave
Konoha
 alone. He agrees.
