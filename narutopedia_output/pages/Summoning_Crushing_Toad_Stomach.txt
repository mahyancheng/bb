This technique bares some similarity to the
Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind
 technique. However, instead of warping the battlefield into the digestive tracts of a giant
toad
, Jiraiya reverse summons himself and his opponents into the stomach of a giant toad (possibly the same species as the giant, fire-breathing toad used in his Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind technique), essentially bringing the battle to a new battlefield.

This technique is also similar to the
Barrier: Toad Gourd Prison
, which is used to capture and isolate a victim, trapping them inside of a toads stomach, cutting them off from any allies, but also completely immobilising them while the stomach crushes the opponents to death.
