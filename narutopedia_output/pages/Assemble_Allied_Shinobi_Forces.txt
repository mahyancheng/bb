"
Assemble! Allied Shinobi Forces!
" (
集結! 忍連合軍!
,
Shūketsu! Shinobi Rengōgun!
) is episode 256 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Using his
Earth Release: Ultralight-Weight Rock Technique
,
Ōnoki
 carries the
Island Turtle
 all the way to
Kumogakure
. Having completed his
S-rank
 mission,
Naruto
 decides to check out the situation on the surface and to find out why
Yamato
 has not returned. However,
Aoba
 tells him that Yamato is still conducting surveillance, and is saved from prolonged inquiries when
Killer B
 offers to help Naruto hone his mastery over the
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
.

At the
Mountains' Graveyard
 hideout,
Kabuto
 asks
Tobi
 to extract information from Yamato without killing him, citing that he needs Yamato alive to further his experiments on
Zetsu
 and the
White Zetsu Army
, as the latter two contain
Hashirama Senju
's cells like Yamato does. Tobi is vexed that
Orochimaru
 discovered that secret while also noticing that Kabuto has discovered the cells' weakness — snake venom.

Unbeknownst to Tobi, the
Infiltration and Reconnaissance Party
 are above the underground hideout, where
Tokuma Hyūga
 uses his
Byakugan
 and discovers, to his shock, that the White Zetsu Army consists of 100,000 members. Relaying this information back to team captain
Anko Mitarashi
, she decides to notify the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. As a result, the
shinobi
 of
chūnin
 status or higher from each of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 as well as
samurai
 from the
Land of Iron
 arrive at Kumogakure to be mobilise into several divisions, with each of them receiving a new headband signifying their alliance.

Chōza
 and
Tenten
 are placed into the
First Division
 led by
Darui
 of Kumo, a unit composed of combatants who specialise in mid-range combat. The
Second Division
, consisting of short-range fighters such as
Hinata
,
Neji
,
Karui
, and
Kurotsuchi
, are led by
Kitsuchi
, a
jōnin
 from
Iwagakure
.
Guy
,
Lee
, and
Sakura
 are positioned in the
Third Division
, a unit comprising of short and mid-range combat specialists, with
Kakashi
 as the unit commander, while
Chōji
,
Shikamaru
, and
Temari
 are stationed in the
Fourth Division
, tasked with long-range battling, with
Gaara
 serving as the captain of the Fourth Division as well as the commander-in-chief of the Allied Shinobi Forces.

As a contingency to counterattack any disadvantageous circumstances in battle, a special battalion known as the
Fifth Division
 is formed, consisting of members who specialise in
hiden
, such as
Ino
,
Kiba
, and
Shino
, led by
Mifune
.
Kankurō
 is assigned as captain of the
Surprise Attack Division
, comprised of shinobi who are adept at ambush tactics, including
Sai
 and
Omoi
. An
Intelligence Division
 is spearheaded by
Inoichi
, while
C
 is placed under
Ao
's command in the
Sensor Division
; last but not least, the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
 is established under
Shizune
's supervision. With all nine battalions being formed, the Allied Shinobi Forces are officially mobilised and ready for battle.

Back at the Mountains' Graveyard hideout, Yamato is secured to
Hashirama's Artificial Body
, where the cells of the First Hokage contained within his body are transplanted to the White Zetsu Army. To supplement their troops, Kabuto uses the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 technique to call forth dead warfare aficionados to supplement their military force. Amongst the resurrected soldiers are the
jinchūriki
 of the
second
,
third
,
fourth
,
fifth

 and
seventh

tailed beasts

Third Raikage
 and the

,
Hanzō
 of

, one of

 of the
Ice Release
; in addition,
Deidara
,
Itachi
,
Sasori
,
