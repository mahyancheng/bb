The Fire Temple.



The
Fire Temple
 (
火ノ寺
,
Hi no Tera
) was a large
ninja temple
 or shinobi monastery in the
Land of Fire
 that strongly resembled the
Shaolin Monastery
 except that it only housed
ninja monks
. It was particularly famous among ninja temples.

The monks were led by former
Twelve Guardian Ninja
 member,
Chiriku
. The Temple was located in an area surrounded by forests and was said to overflow with nature. In the anime, the temple was surrounded on three sides by mountains and a large field to the south. The graves of four of the
Twelve Guardian Ninja
 lie in each of the cardinal directions with the temple in the centre.

There were many statues and images of both Karasu and Yamabushi Tengu, including two statues on either side of the front gates. This was significant as in legend
Tengu
 and
Yamabushi
 taught humans the arts of
ninjutsu
. The monks had access to a special ability known as the
Gift of the Hermit Group
.

The grounds of the monastery were surrounded by, under normal circumstances, impenetrable
Sealed Iron Walls
 that had only been breached twice. The first was when
Sora
 unleashed the
Nine-Tails
'
chakra
 after it was first sealed into him as a child. The second was when
Akatsuki
 members
Hidan
 and
Kakuzu
 launched an assault on the temple to collect the head of Chiriku. Chiriku and most of the monks were killed in the latter attack, and the temple itself was destroyed.

The only known monk survivors in the great monk purge are
Bansai
,
Sentoki
, and
Zenza
. In the anime, Sora is also considered a survivor in the said eradication due to his journey outside the temple borders to have a profound search for himself.
