Sage Art: Goemon
 is a
cooperation
 technique used by
Jiraiya
 with
Shima
 and
Fukasaku
.

Usage

After having driven the enemy into a corner, for instance indoors or in a pit, then on Shima's command, Jiraiya creates a
large volume of oil
, followed by Fukasaku performing a large
Wind Release
 technique to propel the oil, and Shima performing a large
Fire Release
 technique to ignite it. Within an instant, that area will be filled with oil burning at temperatures of thousands of degrees. The superheated oil creates an inferno of such magnitude that, within an instant, the target and the surrounding area will be reduced to cinders.

Trivia

"Goemon" comes from the legendary sixteenth-century ninja
Ishikawa Goemon
 (
石川五右衛門
) who was boiled alive in oil after a failed assassination attempt on the daimyō
Toyotomi Hideyoshi
 (
豊臣秀吉
).

In
Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu
, the name that appears when Jiraiya uses this technique adds "bath" (
風呂
,
furo
), although he doesn't say it.
