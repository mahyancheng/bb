Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 236

"
The Promise that Couldn't be Kept
" (
守れなかった約束
,
Mamorenakatta Yakusoku
)

Shikamaru
 points out to
Tsunade
 that a
medical-nin
 should have been assigned to the
Sasuke Recovery Team
. She agrees, but says that being a medical-nin requires "something special". Shikamaru goes to visit
Naruto
 in the hospital and gets confirmation that
Sasuke
 would not come back to
Konoha
.
Sakura
 overhears this but pretends not to, entering the room to see how Naruto is doing. Naruto apologises for failing but she avoids the subject. He persists, saying that he will one day fulfil his promise of bringing Sasuke home. Seeing how much Naruto has gone through, Sakura leaves after telling him that he won't need to fulfil that promise by himself next time. Sakura goes to see Tsunade and asks to learn how to become a medical-nin. Seeing that Sakura has that "special something", the desire to avoid losing those one is close to, Tsunade accepts.

Chapter 237

"
Idiot…!!
" (
馬鹿…!!
,
Baka…!!
)

Although
Sakura
 has said she will help him find
Sasuke
,
Naruto
 is unwilling to wait for her and wants to try again as soon as he is better.
Jiraiya
 visits him and offers to train him since
Akatsuki
 won't be coming after him for another three years. Naruto declines, saying he needs to take Sasuke back from
Orochimaru
. Jiraiya tells him that Orochimaru won't be able to take Sasuke's body for another three years. He also suggests giving up on Sasuke, having previous experience with his own futile attempts to persuade Orochimaru to change his ways. Only a fool, he claims, would pass up years of training to save someone who doesn't want saving. Naruto says he would rather be a fool. Happy with this answer, Jiraiya leaves, telling Naruto that they will leave for his training as soon as he gets out of the hospital.

 is running late, for which his teammate, a young
Kakashi Hatake
, reprimands him when he eventually arrives. Kakashi, having recently become a
jōnin
, is given gifts by his team-mates.
Rin Nohara
 gives him a personalised medical-kit. Their master, the future
Fourth Hokage
, gives him a
special kunai
. Obito has forgotten to get him anything. Kakashi is to be the team leader for their mission to destroy the
Kannabi Bridge
, which will give
Konoha
 an advantage over
Iwagakure
 in the war effort. As they travel through
Kusagakure
 they discover they are being watched by an enemy ninja. Kakashi decides to deal with the ninja with a new technique: the
Chidori
.

" (

His master
 tries to stop him from attacking, but
Kakashi
 reminds him that he is the team leader for this mission. Kakashi charges at the enemy with his
Chidori
, defeating wave after wave of
shadow clones
. When Kakashi finally reaches the real opponent, the speed of his Chidori leaves him unable to dodge a counterattack. His master saves him and quickly kills the ninja. He advises that Kakashi not use the technique again until he can overcome its drawback, and they rest for the night so that Kakashi can recover. Despite his injury, Kakashi continues to pick on
Obito
, drawing attention to each of his infractions of the
Shinobi Rules
. Though their master does not entirely approve, he explains how Kakashi's father,
Sakumo Hatake
, was disgraced when he didn't follow the rules and encourages Obito to be more understanding.

's forces on the frontlines. The three try to travel in secret but are
found by

enemy ninja
 looking for
the ninja
 the team had encountered earlier. They kidnap Rin to see what she knows. Obito immediately tries to go after her, but Kakashi stops him, saying they must complete their mission first as the
Shinobi Rules
 dictate. Obito lists a number of reasons why they should place saving a teammate above the mission's success, but Kakashi is unmoved. Obito leaves, claiming that those who abandon their friends
are scum
. He also says that
Sakumo Hatake
, despite being disgraced when he abandoned a mission to save his team, was right to do so.

Chapter 242

"
Side Story 4: The Crybaby Ninja
" (
外伝其ノ四:泣き虫忍者
,
Gaiden Sono Yon: Nakimushi Ninja
)

On the front lines of the
Third Shinobi World War
,
Iwagakure
's forces have almost defeated
Konoha
's. Despite this, when
Konoha's Yellow Flash
 arrives, the surviving Konoha ninja are confident that the battle is about to turn in their favour. Meanwhile,
Obito
 nears the location where
Rin
 is being held captive. He is found by
Taiseki
, but before he can be killed he is saved by
Kakashi
, having been convinced to help because of Obito's words. Taiseki survives and tries to attack Obito again, but Kakashi saves him once more, though his left eye is damaged. Obito awakens his
Sharingan
 and kills Taiseki to protect Kakashi.

Chapter 243

"
Side Story 5: Gift
" (
外伝其ノ五:プレゼント
,
Gaiden Sono Go: Purezento
)

Kakashi
 ignores his damaged left eye and joins
Obito
 in confronting
Kakkō
,
Rin
's only remaining captor. They attack him and manage to release her. Kakkō, rather than let a group of kids continue to believe it would be that simple, causes a cave-in. Obito pushes Kakashi out of the way of falling debris. His right side is crushed and neither he nor his teammates are able to free him. Kakashi regrets allowing this to have happened, but Obito makes a proposition: since he never gave Kakashi a gift for becoming a
jōnin
, Kakashi can have his remaining
Sharingan
 eye as a replacement for Kakashi's damaged one. Rin performs the transplant and Kakashi emerges from the rubble to face Kakkō.

Chapter 244

"
Side Story Final Story: The Hero of the Sharingan
" (
外伝最終話:写輪眼の英雄
,
Gaiden Saishūwa: Sharingan no Eiyū
)

With his new
Sharingan
,
Kakashi
 is able to overcome the
Chidori
's weakness; though the attack is still fast, the Sharingan gives him enough reaction time to avoid counterattacks. He kills
Kakkō
 and returns to
Obito
's side. With
Iwagakure
 reinforcements incoming, Obito asks Kakashi to take
Rin
 away and protect her from harm. When the cave-in resumes, Kakashi reluctantly complies. Obito dies, regretting that he couldn't spend more time with his team while also regretting the fact that he couldn't tell Rin that he loved her. Kakashi attacks the newly arrived Iwagakure ninja to fulfil his promise, but soon loses consciousness. He awakes some time later to find the enemies dead, having been killed by
his master
. With Rin safe, they complete their mission by destroying the
Kannabi Bridge
.

Author's Note

“

Perhaps it seems abrupt, but it felt right to end Part I with this volume. The next book will begin Part II. In a sense, though, I don't think
Naruto
 needs to be broken up into parts... Anyway, stay with me, folks!
