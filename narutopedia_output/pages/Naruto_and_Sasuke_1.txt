"
Naruto and Sasuke 1
" (
ナルトとサスケ①
,
Naruto to Sasuke 1
) is chapter 694 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

At the
Valley of the End
,
Sasuke
 speaks about his notion of a "true
Hokage
", and talks about
Itachi
 and his past related to
Konoha
. He tells
Naruto
 that Itachi is "the true Hokage". He then speaks about Itachi's mistake, and the loss of his
clan-members
, how he wants to shoulder the pain and hatred of
shinobi
 on his own. He then goes on to state that through this method, he would unify the
villages
, and eradicate the darkness in the world.
 Despite Naruto telling him that no-one would agree to this, Sasuke replies that it did not matter what they thought of him, as he is the only one with the power to control them. Naruto contemplates how he too had tried to shoulder everything and remembers
Itachi
's words that if he forgot the people that gave him strength, and took it all on his own, that he would become prideful like
Madara
. He then voices the fact that Sasuke still did not understand what Itachi really wanted, noting that their fight with
Kaguya
 should have shown him that he couldn't do everything on his own. However, Sasuke rebuffs Naruto's reply and reaffirms his goal of severing the past. With nothing else left to be said, the two exchanged blows once more.
