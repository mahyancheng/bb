By continuously flowing chakra into it, this technique increases the blade's sharpness and durability, preventing it from chipping. At the same time, it is a delicate technique, requiring constant focus to keep active.

Trivia

Despite its parent technique being officially called
Uchiha Style Kenjutsu
, in line with
other Uchiha jutsu
, VIZ translated 流 as "flow" for this technique's name instead of "style".

It is noted that Uchiha Style Kenjutsu uses Lightning Release to coat the blade and increase its sharpness,
 possibly referring to this technique, which would make it Lightning Release as well.

Though it is read the same as the
Sage of Six Paths
, the name of this technique has different kanji, and could be translated as "Cloaked Sword", referring to the blade being covered/coated.

It appears the chakra flow of this technique is not always visible on the blade.
