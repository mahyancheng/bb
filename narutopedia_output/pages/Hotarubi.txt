Hotarubi
 (
ホタルビ
) was a
jōnin
 from
Hoshigakure
.

Background

Both he and
his wife
 had completed the
star training
. They both stole the star after seeing the side effects of the training, but were later caught by the
Third Hoshikage
 and his
Anbu
. The Hoshikage acknowledged their concerns in regards to the star training and had long considered discontinuing it. However, the more militaristic
shinobi
 of the village were likely to reinstate the star training if ever given the chance. The Hoshikage promised to halt the training, but in exchange, asked that Hotarubi and Natsuhi watch
the village
 from afar, should the more aggressive members of the village ever attempt to bring back the star training. Hotarubi later died by the star training side effects.

Personality

A man of few words, Hotarubi had great love towards his village, willing to steal the Star in order to assure that no one would suffer from the side effects of the training ever again.

Appearance

Hotarubi has a short crop of shaggy black hair and big brown eyes. He wears a light purple-coloured Hoshigakure
forehead protector
 with part of his hair hanging down to the end of the left side of it. He wore a light purple-coloured Hoshigakure flak jacket.

Abilities

Hotarubi mastered the difficult and highly dangerous star training alongside his wife Natsuhi which means that he was well versed in the
Mysterious Peacock Method
. The fact that he became a
jōnin
 furthermore implies that he was a very powerful shinobi.

Trivia
