A Lightning Release technique.



Lightning Release
 (
雷遁
,
Raiton
,
English TV:
 Lightning Style) is one of the five basic
nature transformations
.

Overview

In order to perform most Lightning Release
jutsu
, users must convert their
chakra
 into electricity.
 One of the simpler ways to use this electricity is to
channel
 it into
ninja tools
, increasing the weapon's
cutting power
 by making it vibrate or causing a
numbing effect
 to those the weapons contact. For the
Chidori
 (and the
Lightning Cutter
),
Kakashi Hatake
 simply gathers the lightning chakra to his hand, causing severe piercing damage to anything or anyone his hand touches.
Sasuke Uchiha
 sometimes makes broader use of the Chidori's chakra, such as giving it
shape
 so he can attack from
greater distances
 or
emitting it around himself
 to attack those nearby. Less commonly, users can instead take control of natural lightning, as Sasuke does with
Kirin
; because natural lightning can be difficult to come across, he uses
Fire Release
 in order to produce ideal weather conditions for lightning.

Lightning Release is common among ninja of
Kumogakure
, who make varied applications of it:
C
 uses lightning as a
medium
 for
genjutsu
, making it easier to entrance opponents;
Darui
 generates a unique
Black Lightning
, which he learned from the
Third Raikage
;
 the
Fourth Raikage
 uses
Lightning Release Chakra Mode
 by coating his body with electricity, which shields him from harm, increases his speed, and enhances the strength of his
physical attacks
. The Third Raikage's
Hell Stab
, usable with his own Chakra Mode, is so powerful as to referred to as the "strongest spear". In
Naruto Shinden: Parent and Child Day
,
Chōji Akimichi
 says it's a bad idea for Lightning Release users to wear metallic accessories, such as earrings.

Lightning Release is naturally strong against
Earth Release
 and weak against
Wind Release
;
 in
Kakashi Retsuden
, this strength against earth is explained to be because impurities in the earth naturally conduct electricity. If Lightning Release is used with
Water Release
, the water can
increase the range
 of the lightning, or the lightning can give the water a
numbing quality
. Individuals who make heavy use of Water Release, such as members of the
Hōzuki clan
, are similarly very vulnerable to Lightning Release.
 When Lightning Release is combined with other natures, certain
kekkei genkai
 are produced: lightning and water make
Storm Release
; lightning and earth are suggested to make
Explosion Release
.

Trivia

According to
Jin no Sho
, it is because of Kumogakure's experience using lightning that it has been able to pioneer so much technology that runs on electricity.

When enhanced with
Six Paths Chakra
, Lightning Release techniques change in colour, from blue to black, as seen with
Kamui Lightning Cutter
.

In the anime,
Limelight
 is said to be the most powerful and destructive of all Lightning Release techniques.
