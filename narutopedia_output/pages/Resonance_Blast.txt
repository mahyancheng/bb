Obito grows a large tree from beneath the ground with four flowers that forms four large Tailed Beast Balls. To ensure the balls would not miss, Obito had used
Six Red Yang Formation
 to contain the blast, although the
Allied Shinobi Forces

teleported
 outside the barrier to avoid it. The resultant explosion was strong enough to completely distort the shape of the unbreakable barrier.
