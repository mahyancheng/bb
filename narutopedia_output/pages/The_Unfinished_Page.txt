Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Yamato
 tells
Naruto
 that he was the one who caused
Sakura
's injury, causing Naruto to recall a bloodied
Jiraiya
 who questioned whether he retained any memory of the attack or not. Naruto realises that he was the one who destroyed
Tenchi Bridge
 and the surrounding terrain, and Yamato berates him for succumbing to anger and unleashing a power he was already aware could hurt the individuals near him. Yamato tells Naruto that the
Nine-Tailed Fox
's power is not his own, and to not rely on that power to save Sasuke or protect Sakura. Instead, he is told to rely on his own natural abilities, which he claims makes Naruto strong enough.

Sai
,
Orochimaru
 and
Kabuto
 continue to run on a river, heading to their base. They decide to stop and take a break in order for Kabuto clean his medical supplies and weapons. Kabuto tells Orochimaru that he needs a new male cadaver, between the ages of 15 and 17, to replace the one he had summoned to lay their trap. Sai notices that his picture book is not in his bag and recalls dropping his belongings when Kabuto had ambushed him.

As Naruto and Yamato discuss a combat strategy, Sakura decides to read Sai's picture book. She invites Naruto and Yamato to come take a look too, and they discover that the book is about two young boys who fight enemies, vanquishing them and taking their armour and weapons. In the middle, the two boys face off against one another; however, one page is blank while the other page has a black-haired boy with no face. Naruto points out that the black-haired boy is none other than Sai, and Sakura deduces that the other boy must be his brother, who had died.

Orochimaru, Sai and Kabuto finally reach their hideout. As they enter, Sai notices a man waiting for them, whom he immediately realises is none other than
Sasuke Uchiha
. Sasuke, with his
Sharingan
 activated, tells Orochimaru that he is late.
