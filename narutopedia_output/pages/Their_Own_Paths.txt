Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

The escaping duo is soon caught by
Kakashi
 but an adamant
Kinoe
 refuses to surrender
Yukimi
. Remembering the things that
Orochimaru
 had done for
her clan
, however, Yukimi opts to return to them in order to save them putting an end to the skirmish between the two
Anbu
.
 Chasing after her, the young Iburi returns to find several of her kinsmen dead and the
Sannin
 feeding on another. Fleeing from him, Orochimaru gives chase to the young girl, however, Kakashi and Kinoe arrive at the hideout shortly after. Unable to find Yukimi, they are guided by the smoke trails of the departed clan members and they are able to stave off Orochimaru's assault and cause him to flee. Apparently too late though, Yukimi begins to turn into smoke and in an attempt to save her, Kinoe tries to use
Wood Release
 to encase the smoke. Then, the smoke trails of the clan members gather around Yukimi, changing the artificial encasement into an actual tree from which Yukimi emerges again. Ultimately, Kinoe and Yukimi decided to walk their own paths, with Kakashi informing Kinoe that he neither saw Orochimaru, nor discovered the clan.
