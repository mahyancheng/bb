The original
Chidori
 gained its power by shaping it into a form sufficient for an electrical discharge and using it together with the user's own "thrust". This technique uses
shape transformation
 to form the original Chidori into a spear or blade-shape, adapting it for mid-range attacks with a maximum range of about five metres.
 Its increased range means there is less of a risk to the user. It also has the advantage of being able to be used for surprise attacks and capturing.

When the enemy's body is pierced, the user can alter the spear's shape into multiple additional blades, increasing the number of wounds.
 The blade can also be swung in order to cut things as well as cause fatal injuries. Sasuke has shown that he can also channel this technique through his
chokutō
.

Because of Sasuke's mastery in kenjutsu, this technique can act as a makeshift sword if he loses his sword.

After infusing this technique with
Six Paths Chakra
, Sasuke was able to bisect through the
revived

Madara
 in his
jinchūriki form
.

Trivia

In the
anime
, this technique was shown off-screen before its proper début.
