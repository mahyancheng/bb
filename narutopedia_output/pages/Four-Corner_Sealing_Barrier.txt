The Four-Corner Sealing Barrier
.

This technique was designed by
Tsunade
 for the purpose of sealing a tailed beast. The technique is performed with four separate scrolls and a sample of blood similar to a
Summoning Technique
. Shizune mentioned that good
chakra
 control and concentration are needed to perform the sealing technique. To use this technique, a scroll is needed to seal the numerous amounts of chakra. This technique was supposed to seal the
Three-Tails
 in its own dimension, permanently. While sealing the users are vulnerable to enemy attacks. This technique has three stages:

"Search": the barrier is erected to locate the target.

"Bind": the barrier is then stretched out above the target.

"Lock": the barrier is lowered and the sealing begins.
