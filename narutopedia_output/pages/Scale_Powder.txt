The user releases a large amount of fine powder from their mouth or body, which, due to its luminous quality, shines so brightly that it can temporarily blind multiple targets within its area of effect.

Trivia

While the kanji in the term "rinpun" (
鱗粉
) literally mean "scale powder", the term refers specifically to insect
scales
 (such as the "dust" on moth wings). According to old wives' tales, that dust causes blindness.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
 and
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
, the powder appears to be orange as well as
combustible
, while in the anime, it is bright white. They are also an ability of Chōmei's, while in the manga, that is unconfirmed.

In the anime, the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 version of
Chōmei
 in
B
's dream is able to use this technique.

In the anime and video games, this technique was shown to be an offensive one causing damage to the opponent, however this was not indicated in the manga.
