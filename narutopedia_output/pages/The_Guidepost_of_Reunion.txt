 manga.

Summary

After
Sasuke
 spots
Itachi
, he chases his brother down. Itachi refuses to be swayed from his mission, so Sasuke attempts to use
Susanoo
 to stop him, but Itachi counters with his own. While Sasuke chases his brother the two have a conversation. Elsewhere, a regenerating
Madara
 decides to target
Tsunade
 after realising she was a
Senju
. Deeming her a weak woman who had seemingly inherited nothing from
Hashirama
 who he claimed was even more skilled in
medical ninjutsu
 than she was, he goes on to say that even more so that a weak person, he detested a weak Senju. Tsunade however rebuffs him, telling him that though she had not inherited the
Wood Release
 kekkei genkai her grandfather possessed and that he may have even been more skilled than her with medical ninjutsu — since he did not require the use of
hand seals
 to use it, Madara made two mistakes. One was assuming she was a weak woman and the other was that she had inherited nothing from her ancestor. She states that she inherited something more than simple power, the
Will of Fire
 — something Madara should not take so lightly.
