"
As One's Friend
" (
親友として
,
Tomo Toshite
) is episode 208 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Jūgo
 and
Suigetsu
 attempt to flee the hideout disguised as
samurai
, but are instantly discovered.
Sai
's
ink clone
 notifies
Kakashi
,
Naruto
 and
Yamato
 that the other members of the
Konoha 11
 have decided to kill
Sasuke
 themselves in order to prevent a war from spreading. Naruto does not believe that Sakura would have consented to it, since she is in love with him. However, Sai responds that it is because she loves him that she has agreed to eliminate him, and adds his personal conjecture that he believes that she is planning to kill him herself, much to Naruto's shock. Sai tells Naruto that the only reason Sakura "confessed" was to alleviate Naruto from the
promise he made
, but when Naruto was steadfast in his decision to save Sasuke regardless, she could not bring herself to tell him of their plan to terminate him. He also adds that the reason Sakura is doing all of this is because of what Sai said to Sakura back in Konoha, unintentionally guilt-tripping her into doing this. Naruto's mind is overwhelmed and he almost breaks down, but at that moment the
Three Sand Siblings
 arrive, claiming that they have urgent news to relay.

Madara
 encounters
Danzō
 on the
Samurai Bridge
, who commands his two subordinates
Fū
 and
Torune
 to deal with Madara until he can remove his
Sealing Arm Braces
. Using his
intangibility
, Madara is able to evade all of Fū and Torune's attacks, including the former's
Mind Body Switch Technique
. Realising that Madara must manifest physically in order to strike back, Fū rushes at him. He goes right through Madara, who turns back and forms a fist. Seeing this, Torune, who had removed his shirt, unleashes his
rinkaichū
. However, Madara had tricked them into thinking he would manifest and Torune's attack hits Fū instead. As Torune heals Fū, Madara realises that Fū and Torune are from
Konoha
's
Yamanaka clan
 and
Aburame clan
, and compliments Danzō for his choice in subordinates. He then uses Kamui to transport Fū and Torune elsewhere, and proceeds to disappear himself.

Meanwhile,
Gaara
,
Temari
, and
Kankurō
 relay the events that transpired at the
Five Kage Summit
 to the three, and notify Kakashi that he is being considered as the Sixth
Hokage
 candidate due to Danzō's actions. Yamato declares that such a decision would need approval from the village elders, but Temari replies that
Suna
 would form their immediate response to the upcoming
Fourth Shinobi World War
 as if Kakashi was Hokage. Gaara tells Naruto that if he is to ever become a
Kage
 someday, he would have to learn to do what was best. He adds that before he met Naruto, he did not know what the word 'friend' meant, and that he considers Naruto to be his friend. Before leaving, he asks Naruto to think of what the word friend means to him before deciding on what to do about Sasuke.

In
Kamui's Dimension
,
Karin
 finishes healing Sasuke just as Madara phases in front of her. He tells Sasuke that he has a present for him and warps the three of them back to the bridge, where Danzō awaits. Madara tells Karin to step away, warning her that she would be killed if she interfered. Danzō removes the bandages on his arm, revealing numerous
Sharingan
 implants, and states that he is about to add Sasuke and Madara's eyes to his collection.

Trivia

When
Naruto
 reminisces about
Team 7
, and the picture of his past team shatters, their team photo is different from the one usually shown.
