This technique is a variation of the Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm where either two
Gentle Fist
 users,
 or a single person using both hands,
 sends a powerful wave of compressed
chakra
 from either palm simultaneously and with great force towards an opponent. The chakra released from the user's palms targets their opponent's vitals while also knocking them off their feet with concussive force.
