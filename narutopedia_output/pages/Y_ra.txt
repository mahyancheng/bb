Yūra
 (
由良
) was a
jōnin
 from
Sunagakure
. He was also a sleeper agent of
Sasori
.

Background

As a Suna ninja, he served as a trusted member of the
Kazekage
 advisory council of Suna for four years. At some point in the past, he became a sleeper agent for Sasori, under the influence of his
Memory-Concealing Manipulative Sand Technique
.






Yūra during a meeting.



When it was agreed between the
Fifth Hokage
 and
Gaara
, the newly appointed Fifth Kazekage, to host an early
Chūnin Exams
, Yūra explained the details to the
Suna Council
. While many on the council voiced their concerns of making Gaara the Kazekage because of his powers, Yūra's stern glare ceased all further debate. Later however, Yūra secretly approached the naysayers about Gaara's plans to host the second exams in the
Demon Desert
 location, subtly telling them to use it as a means to kill Gaara and disguise the deed as an accident.

Personality

Yūra was said to be an industrious and loyal person.
 From the little that was seen of him, this was true as he advocated new strategies and plans all geared towards improving the village. With regards to his loyalty, though two-sided, he was fiercely loyal to Sunagakure and after being awakened as a sleeper agent, showed great loyalty towards Sasori as well. In the anime, he showed a subtly treacherous side, having openly supported Gaara's appointment as Kazekage, but leaving discreet hints for his opponents to assassinate him.

Appearance

Yūra was a short man with black hair that hung over his right eye, a goatee and dark eyes. Usually he was seen wearing beige robe with black trousers and sandals. On missions, he wore a standard Suna shinobi attire, including a face-guard which covered his cheeks.
 Being used as a sacrifice to play the role of
Itachi Uchiha
's
double
, Yūra wore the Akatsuki robes up to the point of his death.

Abilities

As a
jōnin
 and part of Sunagakure's council, Yūra was a very powerful shinobi. Sasori had chosen him to be a sleeper agent for good reason, which was justified when Yūra wiped out the entire force which was tasked with guarding Sunagakure's gate single-handedly despite the fact that there were many other jōnin and even
Anbu
 present.

Kazekage Rescue Mission






Yūra's death.



Around the same time as
Naruto Uzumaki
's return to Konoha, Yūra and other members of Sunagakure's council were discussing intel gained from
Jiraiya
 about the organisation known as
Akatsuki
, and he also had prepared a task force to be stationed around the borders of the village, to watch out for any members of Akatsuki. As he and
Deidara
 approached the village, Sasori activated the technique to reawaken Yūra's memories of being an Akatsuki spy. After realising his true mission, Yūra killed the guards at the border, allowing Sasori and Deidara to enter the village to carry out their mission. Sometime later, Yūra was used by
Pain
 as a sacrifice for the
Shapeshifting Technique
, becoming a replica of
Itachi Uchiha
 and soon met combat with
Chiyo
 and
Team Kakashi
. Ultimately, Yūra was defeated and killed by Naruto's
Big Ball Rasengan
. His corpse was later devoured by
Zetsu
.

Trivia

In the
Disney XD
 English version of the anime, his face upon death isn't shown.

Yūra is notable for being the only person killed canonically by Naruto himself.
