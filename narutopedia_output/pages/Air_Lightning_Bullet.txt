The user punches the opponent twice with their fist, then palms them upward to launch them high into the air. The user then jumps above them and punches them back down. Then, the user binds the opponent with large
shuriken
 from above, then lands on them with a powerful stomp.

Trivia

This move becomes Iruka and Mizuki's new neutral special in both
Gekitō Ninja Taisen 3
 and
4
, and as a result, Kakashi can only copy this attack with his Sharingan instead of
Air Lightning Strike
.

While Mizuki's version functions the same, it instead has a different name known as the Kūsendan (空旋弾, lit. Air Whirling Bullet) instead.
