"
Eat or be Eaten: Panic in the Forest
" (
喰うか喰われるか!エサになったナルト
,
Kū ka Kuwareru ka! Esa ni Natta Naruto
) is episode 28 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 has to pee and
Sakura
 hits him and makes him go pee in a bush. When he comes out,
Sasuke
 starts hitting him and explains to Sakura that this person is not Naruto because Naruto had a scar on his cheek. With his identity being compromised, the
Ame

ninja
 ditches his disguise and fights Sasuke, who defeats him while spotting the real Naruto, freeing  him after he beats the Ame-nin.

Sasuke tells the others that
Team 7
 needs a password, although the one he chooses is too long, with Naruto struggling to remember it before a powerful gust of wind separates him from his team. Just as he reorients himself, Naruto finds himself swallowed by a giant
snake
. When Sasuke and Sakura later meet up with who they thought was Naruto, Sasuke suspects something is wrong when "Naruto" repeats the password word for word. Sasuke explains that the real Naruto would not have recited such a difficult password, hence why he chose a lengthy one, and the impostor revealed to be the
Kusagakure
 ninja
Shiore
. Swallowing his scroll, Shiore paralyses Sasuke and Sakura with visions of their deaths.

Sasuke succeeds in regaining his composure and getting himself and Sakura away from Shiore. Meanwhile, Naruto uses his
Shadow Clone Technique
 to burst out of the snake. Once freed, Naruto quickly comes to his friends' aid as Shiore corners Sasuke and Sakura.
