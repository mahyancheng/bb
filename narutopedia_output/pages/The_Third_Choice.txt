Konoha Shinden
 manga.

Summary

As the
Quarrel Festival
 gets underway,
Kiba
 and
Tamaki
 begin arguing over its origins, Kiba believing the story about the dog deity and Tamaki believing the story about the cat deity.
Mirai
 calls out to them in an attempt to calm them down, but this only catches the attention of several dog worshippers, who recognise Kiba's name. Because of Kiba's lifelong commitment to dogs, as well as the rumours that he's in line to become
Hokage
, the dog worshippers believe that his presence will give them an advantage against the cat worshippers. Kiba is initially enthusiastic to help until he sees Tamaki sadly walking away, having lost faith in their relationship. Kiba becomes distraught, but is prevented from following her because of the intensifying fighting.

Mirai removes
Kakashi
 to a safe distance. Seeing that Mirai is upset by Kiba and Tamaki's argument, Kakashi encourages her to help them. Mirai doesn't know what she could do, so Kakashi points out how their argument briefly stopped when they were distracted by the festival's
mikoshi
. This gives Mirai an idea and she begins running back to the centre of the town; Kakashi requests that she also look for
Guy
, who Mirai neglected to bring with them. Mirai creates a
fire
 near where the cat and dog worshippers are fighting, which she then gives the
appearance
 of an entirely new deity, one that is equal parts cat and dog.
