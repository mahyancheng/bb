"
Naruto and the Old Soldier
" (
ナルトと老兵
,
Naruto to Rōhei
) is episode 190 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Konoha
 begins to rebuild itself following
Pain's assault
, an old man named
Kosuke Maruboshi
 looks up at
Hokage Rock
 and remembers a time when he had a mission with
Naruto
.

After the
Konoha Crush
, a captain named
Hayama
 had recruited
Tekuno
, a
jōnin
, and two
genin
, Naruto and Kosuke, to patrol the border of the
Land of Fire
 and fend off intruders who were attempting to strike at the crippled Konoha. Despite Kosuke having been a genin for more than fifty years, he proved himself useful in cooking and detecting enemies. He revealed that he had been on missions with the
Second Hokage
, the
Third Hokage
,
Jiraiya
, and
Sakumo
, all of whom eventually surpassed him and went on to achieve great fame.

Iwagakure

shinobi
 were the ones by the border, and they proceeded to attack the four-man team. Hayama dealt with them using his
Vacuum Sword
 while Tekuno stalled them with his
explosive tags
; Naruto attempted to keep them at bay with his
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
, but failed. As Naruto was nearly killed by an Iwa-nin, Kosuke used his
Leaf-Style Willow
 technique to kill the enemy and saved Naruto. Naruto pondered as to how Kosuke knew a technique that was not genin level, while Kosuke merely retorted that Naruto's
Shadow Clone Technique
 was also not a genin technique. Kosuke mused on his past, on how he had sacrificed his comrades in an attempt to attain
chūnin
 status and how in shame he had decided to be a genin forever, despite the Third's insistence that he become a jōnin. He was snapped out of his reverie by incoming enemies, and told Naruto to notify the village while he dealt with the others.

Kosuke was eventually cornered by an
Iwa Kunoichi
, whose
Earth Release: Underground Split
 was blocked by Kosuke's
Water Release: Water Formation Wall
 technique. He was outraged to discover that she had purposely sacrificed genin as she believed that was the genin's duty, while she was shocked to discover that Kosuke and Naruto were just mere genin. The
kunoichi
 planned to dismember Kosuke as a result, only to be stopped in her tracks by Naruto, who told Kosuke that he would not allow a comrade to die as he would become
Hokage
 one day. Kosuke was reminded of the
Fourth Hokage
 once telling him the same thing while bandaging his leg, and resolved to prove to the Iwa kunoichi that Konoha-nin would not give up. Using his
Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique
, he countered her
Earth Release: Earth and Stone Dragon
 and defeated her, while reflecting on how Naruto was like his father.

Kosuke smiles at Hokage Rock as he finishes with his recollection while Tekuno shares the same tale with the other villagers, trying to convince them that it was a real story and that he did in fact go on a mission with Naruto, Konoha's new hero. Kosuke looks at Minato's face on the monument and mentally remarks how Minato should be proud of his son.
