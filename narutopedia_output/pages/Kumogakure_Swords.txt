These blades are a special type of
sword
 utilised by some
Kumogakure
 shinobi; more prominently used in
Killer B
's
signature kenjutsu
 alongside his
chakra flow
. The characteristic shape of each sword not only makes them ideal for cutting, using either edge of the blade, but also means they can be thrown with great accuracy.

Trivia

If any of these swords are lost, B can seemingly replenish his stock upon returning to
Kumogakure
.

During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, B stored five of the swords within
Samehada
.
