This is an ability that allows one to replicate themselves. Unlike most self-multiplying techniques, there is no actual original, as this ability splits off the individual, making them each completely independent and permanent until reuniting. Also unique from any other living replication technique, each individual retains the same original full strength and chakra levels as before the technique is used. However, this technique proportionately decreases the intelligence with each divide. Anything up to 20 divisions will still have satisfactory intelligence. Likewise, for each division that is killed, the intelligence will proportionately increase back among the remaining divisions. Also, the more one divides, the more their senses of pain will dull. For this ability to be activated, one must have both eyes intact.

Despite their general independent need for existence, the divisions tend to flock together, especially if their intelligence is reduced, making them instinctively unable to leave one behind to prevent their downfall.
