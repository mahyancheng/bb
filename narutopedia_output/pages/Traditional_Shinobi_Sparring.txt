The Seal of Reconciliation.
1/2

Traditional Shinobi Sparring
 (
伝統的の忍組手
,
Dentōteki no Shinobi Kumite
) is a combat training method that has been passed down for generations in
Konohagakure
 as a training method for
Academy students
. According to protocol, the two opponents must face each other and make the
Seal of Confrontation
 (
対立の印
,
Tairitsu no In
), which represents one half of a seal that might be used to activate a ninjutsu and essentially means "
I've come to face you in battle
". When the spar is over, both participants make the
Seal of Reconciliation
 (
和解の印
,
Wakai no In
) by locking the fingers they used to make the "
confrontation
" seal, acknowledging that they are still comrades.

Trivia

When
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Sasuke Uchiha
 first sparred, they refused to make the "
reconciliation
" seal. However, years later when the two fought each other at the
Valley of the End
, they had a flashback of their younger selves making the "
reconciliation
" seal.
