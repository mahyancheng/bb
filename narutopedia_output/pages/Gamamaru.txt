Gamamaru
 (
ガマ丸
), more commonly known as the
Great Toad Sage
 (
大ガマ仙人
,
Ōgama Sennin
) is the oldest and most respected toad of all the inhabitants of
Mount Myōboku
. Because of his age, the other toads affectionately call him
Great Honourable Geezer
 (
大じじ様
,
Ōjiji-sama
,
English TV:
 Great Lord Elder). He is famed for his highly accurate prophecies.

Background






Gamamaru telling Hagoromo of his prophecy.



In the anime, over a thousand years ago, Gamamaru was a witness to
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
's enslaving the land via the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
. Years later, Gamamaru approached the princess' twin sons,
Hagoromo
 and
Hamura Ōtsutsuki
. He revealed to them the sinister nature of their mother's regular ritual to the
God Tree
, urging them to seek out the truth. Once the twins learned about the people being
offered to the tree
, they sought out Gamamaru to hear the whole truth about their mother's actions and the dangers posed by the God Tree, as it was continuously draining
Natural Energy
 from the world, depleting the supply.

Ultimately, the twins asked Gamamaru to teach them
senjutsu
, which he intended to do from the start.
 As Hagoromo finished his training in senjutsu, a messenger toad came to inform him and Gamamaru of Hamura's sudden disappearance, speculating that Kaguya discovered their plan. Upon returning the village and evacuating the people for the impending battle, Gamamaru gave Hagoromo a final gift, a sacred seal tag created by the Sage Toads over the centuries that could revive anyone from near death once. From a distance, Gamamaru then watched as Hagoromo confronted Kaguya only to have to fight a brainwashed Hamura. To Gamamura's surprise, Hagoromo chose to fatally wound Hamura to free him from Kaguya's control before using the seal to save him. This impressed Gamamaru, as it also awakened Hagoromo's
Mangekyō Sharingan
 and
Rinnegan
.

Several years later, Gamamaru gave Hagoromo a prophecy, stating that a "
mischievous blue-eyed boy
" would unite the
tailed beasts
 and change the world.
 Years later, Gamamaru approached Hagoromo again after he sent his two sons,
Indra
 and
Asura Ōtsutsuki
, on separate missions to determine the successor for
Ninshū
. When noting the two siblings' respective development, he asked Hagoromo what he hoped to gain from this. To which, Hagoromo noted how differently his sons developed, hoping that the journey would help each of them become better balanced by improving where they were found lacking: Indra in compassion and Asura in strength.

As time passed, Gamamaru would often meet with Hagoromo to discuss his plans for his sons. While respecting Hagoromo's request to not interfere, Gamamaru would still watch from afar to see how the two brothers matured.






Jiraiya meets with Gamamaru.



Centuries later, when
Jiraiya
 was training at Mount Myōboku, the now-elderly Toad Sage made a prophecy concerning him: Firstly, that he would go on to become both a talented ninja, and a pervert without equal. Jiraiya would walk across the world as a sage, "
observing all creation, watching as nature takes its course
", and in doing so he would also write a book. Jiraiya was also told that he would one day have a student with the power to save or destroy the world, and that it would be Jiraiya's actions that will determine which path this student takes.

Personality

At his great age, Gamamaru seems to constantly smile and tends to have his eyes closed or takes to squinting. He is portrayed and described as being senile, and sometimes out of touch with his present situation, so he does tend to forget things easily and quite quickly. However, when reminded, he is still able to remember things and can easily tell things very precisely. As a
sage
, he is also very wise, and is quick to stop
Shima
 and
Fukasaku
 from bickering and encourages harmony. It would seem that unlike most other toads, he actually has respect for Jiraiya, and has urged both Shima and Fukasaku to cooperate with him.

Appearance






A young Gamamaru.



He is one of the largest inhabitants of Mount Myōboku, easily equalling
Bunta
,
Ken
, and
Hiro
 in size. He is brown in colour, with a white belly, is very wrinkled and has taken to squinting. He wears a professor's hat with tassels and an orb on top of it. He also wears a necklace with the toad's village symbol for "oil" (
油
,
abura
) on it.

The place where he called Jiraiya and Naruto to receive their prophecy is lined with what appears to be giant scrolls and he sits in a shallow pool of water which has the kanji for "sage" (
仙人
,
sennin
) inscribed on it.

Abilities

Being the oldest toad
sage
 of Mount Myōboku, he is very wise and has immense knowledge and is greatly respected by his fellow toads. Gamamaru is shown to have immense longevity, having been around since at least before the arrival of
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 on Earth.

Senjutsu

Gamamaru is a powerful master of Senjutsu. Even while he was still very young, Gamamaru already had a deep understanding and control of
natural energy
. By harnessing it, he could easily lift massive stone structures. His knowledge and skill was so great that he played a pivotal role in aiding Hagoromo and Hamura to stop Kaguya, having taught them personally.

Ninjutsu

He could use
Water Release
 to produce a powerful stream of water able to repel a massive bear through solid rock. He can also
observe
 anyone he wants over a great distance as long as he knows the person's chakra pattern using his crystal ball.

Divination

The Great Toad Sage also possesses the ability to see into the future, but to a limited extent, evident by him predicting that Jiraiya would take on a student who would be known as either the Saviour or the Destroyer of the World. He had even bestowed a prophecy to Hagoromo himself, which even to the present day, he still has faith in. Whether this ability is due to his status as a Sage is unknown.

Gamabunta and Gamamaru watching the rest of the battle.



Using the
Telescope Technique
, the Toad Sage watched the meeting between
Nagato
 and Naruto. Jiraiya had originally believed that Nagato was the boy mentioned in the prophecy, but shortly before his death came to believe that Naruto was what the prophecy referred to. When he saw Naruto convince Nagato to sacrifice himself for the citizens of
Konoha
, the Toad Sage told Gamabunta that both he and Jiraiya were wrong: the prophecy was about Naruto
and
 Nagato. He wonders if
The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi
 really was the key to changing the world.

When

 asked the Toad Sage if he should give Naruto the
key

creature with octopus tentacles
" and would battle a "
young man with powerful eyes
". He also saw that Naruto would be given the key, so he instructed
Gerotora
 to go ahead and give it to him.

(To
Gamabunta
) "
It's over… As it was foretold… but I never thought
Jiraiya
's
two

pupils
 together would be the "
Children of the Prophecy
", the ones to lead a revolution in the ninja world… Maybe this was all meant to be from the time Jiraiya decided not to give up…
That book
