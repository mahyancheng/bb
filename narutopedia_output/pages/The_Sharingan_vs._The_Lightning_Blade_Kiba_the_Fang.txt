 anime.

Synopsis

Boruto
 sees
Kagura
 approaching him,
Hiramekarei
 in hand.
Buntan
 attacks
Sarada
 with lightning from
Kiba
. Sarada blocks her attack and activates her
Sharingan
. Buntan continues throwing
Lightning Balls
 at Sarada, who dodges them. Buntan comments on getting to face the Sharingan, and lures Sarada into a trap.
Kyohō
 misses his attack,
Chōjūrō
 goads
Hassaku
 into attacking him, using the attack to cut some of the wires holding him in place, allowing him to grab his own sword and cut the rest.
Ichirōta
 watches it and comments from afar. Sarada blocks another of Buntan's attacks, and causes her to retreat to avoid
genjutsu
. Buntan remotely controls Kiba to attack Sarada.
 As she dodges the swords, Sarada notices water around. Creating a
Lightning Fish
, Buntan limits Sarada's mobility to small rocks in the water, and continues attacking from a distance, so Sarada can't read her hand seals. Boruto tries talking Kagura down from fighting. Chōjūrō fights Hassaku, Kyohō, and
Hebiichigo
. Buntan finally manages to cause Sarada to fall pray to her Lightning Fish, but it turns out to be a shadow clone. Buntan tells Sarada about how her father died by Naruto's hand without knowing of her existence. Sarada charges ahead, and with Buntan in sight, starts countering her with her own copied
Lightning Release
. Buntan uses Kiba to cover herself in Lightning Release, and throws Sarada into the water, on the path of her Lightning Fish.
Shizuma
 moves in to kill Boruto himself, but Kagura steps forward to do it. Buntan and Sarada clash, and Buntan recalls her unhappy childhood. Chōjūrō defeats Hebiichigo and Hassaku, causing Kyohō to surrender. Ichirōta prepares to attack Chōjūrō from afar, but is interrupted by
Iwabee
, who manages to cut him down. Ichirōta explodes
Shibuki
 trying to take him down. Sarada notices Buntan's fish causes bubbles as it swims. Buntan decapitates Sarada, only for it to be genjutsu, which Sarada used since she got close enough to copy her jutsu. Sarada also points out that all during their fight, her fish has been electrolysing the water, building up hydrogen gas in the area. Sarada detonates it with an
explosive tag
, defeating Buntan, before passing out from exhaustion. Kagura continues attacking Boruto, claiming how they grew up was completely different.

Trivia

In the original Japanese TV broadcast and streaming simulcast, the scene in which Buntan seemingly decapitates Sarada is censored, instead freezing on the frame a moment before her head falls from her neck with spurts of blood. The footage was restored in the DVD release.
