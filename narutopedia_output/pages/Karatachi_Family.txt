This family was a group of people from
Kirigakure
, which has produced renowned
shinobi
. One of its members
Yagura
, went on to become the Fourth
Mizukage
. He used fear to rule the village and enforced Kiri's reputation as "Village of the Bloody Mist".
 Before dying, he had a child, who went on to have
Kagura
. Because of his grandfather's tyrannical reign, villagers kept their distance from Kagura. After the era of the "Bloody Mist", the family name no longer appears on memorials, which
Shizuma Hoshigaki
 attributes it to being due to this family being considered a nuisance in the peaceful time.
