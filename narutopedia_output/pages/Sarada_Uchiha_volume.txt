Sarada Uchiha
 (
うちはサラダ
,
Uchiha Sarada
) is the collected edition of
Naruto Gaiden: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring
 sequel mini-series.

Chapter 700+1

"
Sarada Uchiha
" (
うちはサラダ
,
Uchiha Sarada
)

As
Shino Aburame
 explains to his class that within one week they'll be going through graduations for
genin
 positions, the majority of the class voices their views on the opportunity. As
Sarada Uchiha
 walks home, she begins to show jealousy over all her classmates getting training from their fathers for the coming graduation, with
Chōchō Akimichi
 eating with her father
Chōji Akimichi
,
Inojin Yamanaka
 getting
drawing lessons
 from his father
Sai
, and even
Boruto Uzumaki
 playing an expansive game of hide-and-seek with his ever busy father the Seventh
Hokage

Naruto Uzumaki
, coupled with being given a lecture by
Shikadai Nara
 and his father
Shikamaru Nara
.
 Seeing all this, Sarada quietly admits she has never seen her own father,
Sasuke Uchiha
, in her whole life. Upon returning home and seeing a picture of her parents together, Sarada questions her mother
Sakura Uchiha
 on if her father needed glasses like her. However, when Sakura can't give her a straight answer, Sarada openly questions the validity of her parents' marriage causing Sakura to
violently lash out
 for the comment. Seeing that her daughter is acting out of sadness rather than anger she collects herself, Sakura apologises to her daughter but realises her outburst has destroyed their house, much to her horror as apparently this is not the first time Sakura destroyed it as she cries out about a loan she took out, fainting. Dropping off her mother to
Shizune
, Sarada returns to her house's ruins to collect some valuables. However, as she picks up the picture from before, Sarada makes a horrifying discovery: the picture is fake. Pulling out the larger picture of her father, she sees him with the rest of his team
Taka
 and, to her horror,
Karin
, a girl with glasses similar to her, causing Sarada to further question the validity of her parents' marriage and, more importantly, her own parentage as well. All the while, Sasuke appears to be returning to
Konoha
.

Chapter 700+2

"
The Boy with the Sharingan…!!
" (
写輪眼の少年…!!
,
Sharingan no Shōnen…!!
)

After encountering a mysterious
boy
 possessing the
Sharingan
 and wearing the crest of the
Uchiha clan
,
Sasuke
 sends a
hawk
 back to
Konohagakure
 to contact
Naruto
 about the matter. Meanwhile,
Sarada
's identity crisis continues as she reveals to
Shizune
 that she knows that there is no record of her birth in Konoha; heavily raising her suspicions on her parentage — which Shizune's evasive demeanour on the topic does not help. In a restaurant,
Chōchō
 complains about her
father
's excessive eating habits, which her
mother
, simply ignores.
 Annoyed that she is being ignored while trying to lose weight, she simply sighs as Sarada appears. Humorously, Chōchō explains to her that she doubts her parents are her real parents. This is challenged by an eavesdropping
Mitsuki
, who simply states that it was normal for girls at their age to start questioning their identity, angering Chōchō. Sarada eventually decides to simply find her father herself or ask the
Seventh Hokage
, about her dilemma. In his office, Naruto sees Sasuke's hawk and realises the situation Sasuke is in and consults
Kakashi
. Together, they doubt that the boy is an
Uchiha Clan Downfall
 survivor, but more likely another one of
Orochimaru
's experiments. Naruto leaves a
shadow clone
 to run the village with
Shikamaru
 as he heads out to meet Sasuke and
Yamato
. Sarada, however, secretly hears this and decides to tail him until she realises Chōchō has invited herself along, thinking Sarada is helping her find her "real" parents. Elsewhere, the mysterious boy meets a
person
 cloaked in an
Akatsuki
 mantle, informing him of his brief fight with Sasuke. They both declare they cannot forgive Sasuke for killing his older brother,
Itachi
, and promise to make him pay.

Chapter 700+3

"
A Chance Meeting 1
" (
邂逅①
,
Kaikō 1
)

As he was about to leave the village,
Naruto
 asks
Shikamaru
 to say sorry to
Boruto
, and heads off towards
Orochimaru
's hideout. Just as Naruto leaves, Boruto arrives together with
Mitsuki
, with the intent to bring Naruto his lunch.
Sarada
 offers to help bring the food to Naruto and though he is hesitant at first, Boruto later hands it over to Sarada and she heads off together with
Chōchō
. Unbeknownst to them, however, the two are being watched by a
tiny figure with a single Sharingan
. At a remote clearing,
Shin
 is ordered by his
father
 to capture Sarada.
 Sarada and Chōchō continue to pursue Naruto to deliver his lunch, to which Naruto notices using
Sage Mode
 and hurries back to them in order to avoid wasting time. Stopping momentarily as they catch their breath, Sarada and Chōchō are intruded by Shin. Sarada remarks on his Sharingan as her
mother
 had told her that aside from
Sasuke
, they were the
last
 of the
Uchiha
. Shin quickly engages and overwhelms the girls in their brief scuffle, until Naruto intervenes in the end and saves them.

Chapter 700+4

"
A Chance Meeting 2
" (
邂逅②
,
Kaikō 2
)

Chōchō
 is surprised to see that
Naruto
, the Seventh
Hokage
, has come to their rescue when
Shin Uchiha
 tried to kidnap
Sarada
. Shin reveals his
Mangekyō Sharingan
 and tries to attack Naruto with his
kusarigama
 from behind, only to fail as Naruto blocks the attack with multiple
chakra arms
. At the behest of a
creature
, Shin
retreats
.
 Naruto concludes it's safer for the girls to continue the journey with him, and denies Chōchō's assumption she was the target. Sarada hands him
Boruto
's lunchbox. While having lunch, Naruto eases Sarada's doubts on her parentage by telling her she heavily resembles her father physically and her
mother
 personality-wise. This, coupled with stories Naruto tells her about her father's and his rivalry, give her great joy and anticipation to finally meet him. As they approach the
Ridge Tower
 where Sasuke is waiting, Chōchō collapses to exhaustion and demands rest despite being so close to the destination. Too eager to wait, Sarada fibs needing to use the restroom to go on ahead, awakening her
Sharingan
 from the feeling of finally meeting her father. However, upon seeing her,
Sasuke
 draws his sword at her, asking if she's affiliated with Shin.

Chapter 700+5

"
The Future
" (
未来は
,
Mirai wa
)

As
Sasuke
 reaches to attack
Sarada
, she calls out to him as her father, and is disappointed that her father didn't recognise her.
Naruto
 and
Chōchō
 arrive, with Chōchō berating Sarada for going off on her own. Sasuke questions Naruto why he brought children with him, and Sarada explains they tailed Naruto to reach Sasuke. Chōchō wonders if Sasuke is her father. Sarada asks Sasuke if
Sakura
 is her real mother.
Shizune
 informs Sakura about Sarada's findings and intentions. Sarada vents her anger at Sasuke's obliviousness and unwillingness to share information about himself, and leaves the room.
 Chōchō concedes Sasuke is Sarada's father. Naruto recalls a Kage meeting where Sasuke revealed a potential
new enemy
 related to
Kaguya
 and the
White Zetsu Army
, and asked to be allowed to investigate the matter in secrecy. Naruto comforts Sarada, as Sakura makes her way to their location.
Shin's father
 proclaims the rebirth of
Akatsuki
 to
Shin
 and several of his copies, revealing his various
Sharingan
 through his head and left arm. He uses his
creature
 to teleport to Naruto's location. While Chōchō suggests Sasuke to use food to reconnect with Sarada, Sasuke detects their enemies' arrival. Shin and his father attack Sarada and Naruto, who parries the attack. As Shin's father rushes to Naruto, Sasuke joins the fray.

Chapter 700+6

"
Unevolving Species
" (
進化無き種
,
Shinkanaki Shu
)

As the
mysterious man

guides
 the weapons towards
Sasuke
, the latter easily deflects them with his
sword
 before pointing it against the opponent, who catches it in order to let
his son
 land a successful attack. However, Sasuke's
Rinnegan
 lets him
swap
 places with Shin, shooting a
dense ball of fire
 to complete the counter-attack. The attack is deflected thanks to the enemy using Shin as a shield, though both of them get caught in the explosion.
 Noticing Sasuke's great ocular prowess, the enemy presents himself as Shin Uchiha, to which
Sarada
 comments that he has the same name as his son. After telling
Naruto
 to take care of the children, Sasuke goes on the offensive, but adult-Shin manipulates the opponent's sword into stabbing Naruto, who ends up deactivating his
chakra cloak
 due to the injury. Since the cloak had blocked some weapons beforehand, the sudden lack of protection led Sasuke to shield his daughter with his own body, which ends up being paralysed by said weapons.
Sakura
 arrives in time to stop the two enemies,
punching
 the older Shin into the ground. However, as Sakura apologises to Sarada for the situation, Shin's
creature

teleports
 both Shins – along with Sakura, who got caught up in the technique – to their base, where the father orders her to transplant his injured son's organs into his own body to repair the damage she had caused.

Chapter 700+7

"
Genetic Slaves
" (
遺伝子の奴隷
,
Idenshi no Dorei
)

Shin
 assures
Sakura
 that as his "children" are actually
his clones
, they're expendable. Sakura disapproves of this, comparing him to
Orochimaru
, prompting Shin to divulge his former role a test subject for Orochimaru's cloning experiments.
Naruto
 fails to
sense
 Sakura's
chakra
 and discusses with
Sasuke
 the possibility of Shin being connected with Orochimaru due to the similarities between his
Sharingan
-filled arm and
Danzō
's.
 They decide to pay Orochimaru a visit and take
Sarada
 and
Chōchō
 with them, so they're better protected. Chōchō tries to dispel the heavy atmosphere by offering chips. Shin explains to Sakura his philosophy about life, death and evolution, which she criticises. Naruto and Sasuke meet up with
Yamato
 outside of Orochimaru's hideout, who stays outside in order to pursue Orochimaru should something go wrong. Sasuke leads the way inside, and the group encounters
Jūgo
 and
Suigetsu
, who Sarada recognises from her father's photo. They're all joined by Orochimaru. Sasuke questions him about Shin, and Orochimaru tells him of Shin's admiration of Itachi, as well as his usefulness as a cloning test subject. On a way to another room, Sarada pulls Suigetsu aside and asks him about
Karin
, learning she's in another hideout. Naruto notices their absence. Surprised about Sarada's predicament, Suigetsu aids her in running a DNA test with a sample retrieved from Karin's belongings and a cheek swab from Sarada. The test is a match, and Suigetsu declares Karin to be Sarada's mother. Naruto listens from around the wall. Suigetsu leaves as Sarada begins crying and is berated by Naruto on his way out. Naruto approaches Sarada, telling her they have to rescue Sakura, but she snaps at him with her Sharingan activated, accusing him and everyone else of lying to her her entire life, as well as denouncing any relation to Sakura.

Chapter 700+8

"
The Real Thing
" (
本物
,
Honmono
)

After calming down from her tirade,
Sarada
 explains to
Naruto
 that since everything she knows has been a lie, she intends on leaving the village and continuing her journey alone. As she attempts to leave, Naruto stops her and tells her that even though they aren't blood-related, Sarada and everyone else from
Konohagakure
 are like family to him. Sarada accuses Naruto of not knowing anything about her situation, which triggers his childhood memories of
Iruka
 and
Sasuke
. Naruto informs Sarada that a family is not about blood relation but the connections that are made between people.
After asking Sarada to try and remember this feeling one more time, she begins to reminisce about her history with
Sakura
. Realising that she does genuinely care about Sakura, Sarada decides that she wants to help her, and they return to the group. Sasuke chastises them for wandering off, and Naruto responds that they need to have a serious talk after rescuing Sakura.
Orochimaru
 comments that it's possible Sakura has already been killed, though Sasuke states that she is strong enough to protect herself. Sasuke activates his tomoe
Rinnegan
 and
Mangekyō Sharingan
, stating that he has finally regained the chakra he had lost after travelling through
Kaguya's dimensions
 in search for the mysterious enemy. Manifesting his
Susanoo
, Sasuke declares that he is taking everyone to save his wife from
Shin
. Meanwhile, Shin completes his surgery and reveals that it is his goal to eliminate the genes of peace-lovers. Sakura refutes this fact, prepared to take him down.

"
I'll Protect You
" (
私が守る
,
Watashi ga Mamoru

Shin
 creates a makeshift arm out of scalpels and prepares to engage
Sakura
 in battle. As
Naruto
,
Sasuke
,
Sarada
, and
Chōchō
 fly to Shin's location in Sasuke's
Susanoo
, Sarada thinks about Sakura, Sasuke, and
Karin
, and what Sasuke's relationship with his wife really is like only to be comforted by Naruto and regains her composure. Shin uses his scalpels to form a large shuriken and throws it at Sakura, but it is intercepted by Sasuke's
Susanoo Sword
. Sasuke then
crushes
 Shin's bones, removes the scalpels from Sakura's arm, and burns them with
Amaterasu
 while Sarada smiles with delight that there is love between husband and wife.
 The group prepares to capture Shin so he can be interrogated at
Konohagakure
, but
Shin's clones
 stab him with their kunai, much to everyone's shock. The clones declare that Shin's genes have become weak and that they will become strong and evolve instead of him. An army of Shin clones appears and starts fighting Naruto and Sasuke. While his enemies are distracted, Shin attempts to
warp
 away from the battlefield and take the girls with him using his
creature
. However, Sarada intervenes and
kills
 the creature with a single punch. More clones of Shin arrive and Naruto suggests they retreat. Sakura tells Sarada to stand back, but Sarada instead charges at the clone army. Dodging a kunai and stating her desire to protect her mother, Sarada
attacks
 the clones.

's
punch
 sends many
enemies

 and
his clones
 scare the other opponents by showing them a glimpse of
who
's inside his body.
Chōchō
 compliments Sarada's strength and notices the similarity between her and Sasuke's eyes.
Sakura
 tells Sarada that she truly is her biological mother, and Sasuke says that Sarada herself proves the connection between him and Sakura. After returning to

 presents himself as their new father, with
Urushi
 at his side, while thinking about whether to give a name to every one of them.

Chōji
, who lost a lot of weight, and tells him to start training her the day after. That night, the
Uchiha
 family has dinner together, and the following morning, Sasuke leaves again for his mission. He pokes Sarada on the forehead as a goodbye but doesn't do the same with Sakura, much to her annoyance and Sasuke's amusement. At the
Academy

Orochimaru
's hideout,

Suigetsu
 she wasn't the one who gave birth to Sarada, but the one who helped with her delivery, and that what Suigetsu used for the
