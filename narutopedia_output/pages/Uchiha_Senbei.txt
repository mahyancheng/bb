Uchiha clan
 that sold
senbei
 within
Konohagakure
. The closely guarded secret recipe of the senbei gave the shop its fame. It was owned by
Teyaki Uchiha
 and his wife
Uruchi
, until they both were
killed
 by
Itachi
. The shop was abandoned after its owners' deaths.
Sasuke
 would sometimes come here after his day at the
Academy
 to get food.
