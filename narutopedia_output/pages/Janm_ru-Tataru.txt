Astronomy Research Institute
.

Background






A meteorite passing by Tataru and Hagoromo.



Tataru established the Astronomy Research Institute high in the mountains, just beyond the northern border of the
Land of Redaku
. One day he met the Sage of Six Paths, who was searching Redaku for a way to cure damage to his
chakra pathway system
 caused by his time as a
jinchūriki
. Tataru took the Sage in and, despite having no medical training, offered to help him. On the night that the Sage would ultimately be cured, a shooting star passed overhead, which the Sage caught and cut in two using only his
chakra
. One of these halves immediately dissolved into dust, which Tataru dubbed "
polar particles
". The dust enveloped the Sage and healed his body.

The Sage immortalised Tataru as the "shepherd" in
Hoshinarabe
, a card game he created that could be used to track down some of the leftover polar particles he hid near the Institute.
