Limelight
 is a lightning-based technique that is used when all four users take place in the cardinal directions. They will then join their lightning-
chakra
 in the form of four connecting streams that shoot high into the sky above the target area. It will then create a massive ball of lightning powerful enough to incinerate everything within the area of the four users. It is considered to be the most powerful and destructive
Lightning Release
 technique. While walking towards their designated positions, the users will generate fluctuating pillars of electricity from their bodies.

As the technique requires all four users to be in position, if even one of them is disabled, then Limelight cannot activate at all.

Trivia

The technique's name is a pun, similar to certain techniques of
Kumogakure
-ninja, in which it has an English name with a given kanji that somewhat matches the pronunciation.
