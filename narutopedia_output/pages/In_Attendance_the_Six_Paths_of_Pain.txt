"
In Attendance, the Six Paths of Pain
" (
ペイン六道、見参
,
Pein Rikudō, Kenzan
) is episode 132 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Pain
 summons two more
bodies
 — the
Preta Path
 and the
Human Path
.
Jiraiya
 is shocked beyond his wits to see three
Rinnegan
 wielders before him; Pain decides to take advantage of the situation by having his Human Path rush towards Jiraiya, only for Jiraiya to give him a roundhouse kick in the face and blind him.
Fukasaku
 uses a
smoke bomb
 while Jiraiya unleashes his
senjutsu
-influenced
Hair Needle Senbon
, which Pain is able to block by
summoning
 a
Giant Panda
. Jiraiya attempts to destroy the three Paths using his
Sage Art: Goemon
, a
cooperation ninjutsu
 used alongside the
Two Great Sage Toads
, only for the Paths to be unscathed. Amazed at how they were able to escape its effects, Jiraiya tries to destroy the Preta Path with an
Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan
; however, the Path proceeds to
absorb the technique
 and render it useless.

Jiraiya, Fukasaku and
Shima
 decide to escape through the pipes, wondering how to defeat three Rinnegan wielders as neither
ninjutsu
 or
taijutsu
 would work on them. Since Jiraiya does not use
genjutsu
, a fact that Pain is aware of, Jiraiya asks the two toads to use their genjutsu, which he would not be expecting, while he tries out a gamble of his. Since Fukasaku was able to deduce that the three Paths shared the same vision through their Rinnegan eyes, Jiraiya has the toads lure them with their genjutsu, which involves croaking frog sounds that reveal their location to Pain. As the three Paths rush towards them, Jiraiya hits one of them with his
Fire Release: Big Flame Bullet
. After the Path absorbs it, Jiraiya's theory is confirmed — each of the Paths only possesses one ability, hence why the earlier Animal Path had only summoned creatures to fight Jiraiya instead of using actual jutsu. The three Paths are struck by the toads'
Demonic Illusion: Toad Confrontation Chant
, and Jiraiya proceeds to use three
stone swords
 to impale them.

As he walks away, believing he has killed them, he is struck from behind by
another Path
, who manages to destroy Jiraiya's left arm. Pain then brings forth five other bodies, including the three that Jiraiya had just impaled. He reveals that Pain is just an alias, meant to refer to the
Six Paths of Pain
, while Jiraiya seems to recognise
one of the Paths
.
