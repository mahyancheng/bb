This weapon is used by Hidan mostly in his
Jashin

rituals
. The spear is a retractable cylinder that can be extended to its full size quickly. It is regularly used as Hidan's main killing move during his ritual, by stabbing himself in the heart. Hidan's rituals are usually long due to him liking to toy with his opponent, such as stabbing himself in several different areas of his body, to make them suffer before finishing them off. Hidan may also use it for combat, although this has only been shown to be used as a last resort when his
Triple-Bladed Scythe
 was unavailable to him.
 He is shown to hide at least two of these spears in his
Akatsuki
 cloak.

Ryūki also used these in large quantities for traps, so they fell on his victims and on the
dolls connected to them
.
