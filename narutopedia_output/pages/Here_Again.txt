Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Naruto
 beseeches
Sasuke
 to release the
tailed beasts
 who had only just acquired their freedom. Despite assuring him that they would no longer be used as tools of war, Sasuke callously notes that after he uses them to end the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
, he plans to eliminate all traces of the tailed beasts, which included Naruto who now hosted portions of their
chakra
.
Kakashi
 tries to go after Sasuke as he departs, but is still suffering the effects of using the
Sharingan
.
 A tearful
Sakura
 tries one last time to persuade Sasuke into coming back to the village, but she is then coldly silenced by
genjutsu
. As Kakashi's words fall on deaf ears once more, Naruto tells Kakashi of the promise he made long ago to Sakura before leaving in pursuit.
Hagoromo
, staying behind with Kakashi and the unconscious Sakura, tells Kakashi about his sons
Indra
 and
Asura Ōtsutsuki
, and how he regretted his actions in unintentionally causing the ill-fated events of today. Meanwhile, Naruto and Sasuke arrive at the
Valley of the End
. Naruto tells Sasuke that he will never be the
Hokage
; reiterating what
Itachi
 told him before. Sasuke retorts that he already knows that, but states that because he wishes to ignite a revolution, his version of the Hokage will be different from Naruto's view. With that Sasuke declares that he will teach him his meaning on what a "Hokage" is.
