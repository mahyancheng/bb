Synopsis

Iruka
 welcomes a new class of
Academy students
.
Naruto
 gives them a speech about what he hopes they learn. Among the new students are
Himawari
, her friends
Ehō Norimaki
 and
Yuina Itomaki
, and
Kawaki
. She is glad they're with her. Some boys ask
Mimi
 for a trick with her dog. Kawaki is in the
Academy
 for a secret
mission
, guarding
Kae Yukiwari
, heir to the crown in the
Land of Bamboo
, a smaller ally nation. Kae's life is being threatened by another claimant to the crown, so her father sent her to
Konoha
 for protection. Kae herself is unaware of the threat, and is excited to study abroad. Kawaki is lower profile than
Boruto
, and is to keep at the mission until Kae's father uncovers who is behind the threat. Naruto also asked him to keep the mission from Himawari. Their homeroom teacher,
Hana Kaka
, introduces herself, followed by other students. Most of the class is excited about Himawari being Naruto's daughter,
Osuka Kamakura
 being
Gongorō Kamakura
's daughter, and Kae being a princess from a foreign nation. Most of them are scared of Kawaki, though Kae finds him interesting.
Eiki Fūma
 develops a crush on her, and Osuka is annoyed at not being the centre of attention.
 Kawaki approaches Kae, and mistakenly comes across as hitting on her. Hana is quite timid, as this is her first class as a teacher.
Anko
 and
Shino
 reassure her she'll get better at it. At home, Himawari tells about her day, and Boruto wonders why Kawaki would want to attend the Academy. Himawari wants to ask Kawaki why he was acting strange at the Academy, and Boruto wonders if he was nervous. As the days go by, the students continue finding Kawaki odd, knowing personal details about Naruto, but nothing about the previous
Hokage
, getting battle-ready when woken up by the school bell, and having a cute, packed lunchbox. Himawari notices him paying attention to Kae, and can tell Kawaki is hiding something. She tells him of Kae's interest in romance novels, so he buys one, puzzled at how it might be useful. Reporters come to take photos of her at class. Eiki tries to best Kawaki, who he finds suspicious, in sparring to impress Kae, but he effortlessly dodges all of Eiki's attacks. At the infirmary, Eiki hears Anko and Hana talking about the tool storage room, and sneaks into it. Kawaki finds Kae acting like herself, and she explains people have expectations of how a princess should act, so she plays along as she's a representative of her country. Eiki arrives, thinking Kawaki lured Kae somewhere remote, and attacks him with a summoning scroll. However, he lacks a contract, and is knocked out by the summoned creature. Kawaki defeats the summon with a punch, commenting on his preference for such missions. She asks who he is, and he says he just wants to be her friend, and offers her the romance novel he bought. She promises to be his friend if he keeps her true personality a secret. Kawaki bemoans having to keep another secret, but accepts it. She looks forward to knowing him, and is concerned about Eiki, but Kawaki says he'll wake up soon. At night, a subordinate asks about her time in the Academy, and Kae is pleased to have made a friend, wanting to enjoy the last of her freedom. Kawaki reports to Naruto about the mission, and complains about the low-level exercises. Naruto tells him he'll see things to learn at the Academy. Himawari listens in on them through the door, excited to learn about Kawaki's secret mission.
