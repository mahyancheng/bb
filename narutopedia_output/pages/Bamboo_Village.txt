The
Bamboo Village
 (
竹ノ村
,
Take no Mura
) is a small village in the
Land of Hot Water
. It is surrounded by a forest of bamboo, and as such most of the village's buildings and goods are made out of bamboo.
 Because it is such a remote village, the villagers received aid from the
Lightning Group
 in the past. When the Lightning Group came into conflict with
Kirigakure
, its surviving members sought refuge in Bamboo Village. The villagers refused to help them, fearing reprisal from Kiri. Years later, this rejection of the Lightning Group causes Bamboo Village to be attacked by the
Dark Thunder Group
, but the village is saved by
Sasuke Uchiha
.
