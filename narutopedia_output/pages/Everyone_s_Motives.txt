 anime.

Synopsis

The genin leave the foggy limits of the cave.
Chōchō
 feels tired and claims to have a spotty memory on what happened.
Boruto
 is relieved
Mitsuki
 isn't a traitor.
Naruto
 and
Shikamaru
 visit
Uō
 at the medical unit, where
Sakura
 says he can't speak for long. Uō tells them the assailants were
Iwagakure
 shinobi, who asked if Mitsuki wanted to go with them to the
Land of Earth
, and that one of them was puppet-like.
Shikadai
 is still open to the possibility Mitsuki is a traitor. Boruto points out Mitsuki wants to know the answer they spoke about. Shikadai wants Chōchō and
Inojin
 to return to
Konohagakure
, to alert them of their discoveries.
Yurito
 is alive, but in critical condition, and Shikamaru blames himself for not noticing it sooner.
Sai
 informs Naruto and Shikamaru that the jutsu that injured Yurito was
Explosive Clay
.
Kokuyō
,
Sekiei
, and Mitsuki approach the border with the Land of Earth. Sekiei points out that once Mitsuki enters the Land of Earth, he'll have betrayed Konohagakure, and asks what betrayal feels like. At Iwagakure,
Kirara
 discusses the situation with
Kakō
, who says
Kū
 will pass judgement.
 Kū says they still have time, and he and a doctor enter an area with several of the puppet-like creatures. On their way back, Chōchō and Inojin find paralysed jōnin. Kokuyō kills one of the puppet-like creatures struggling to keep up with them. Sekiei explains to Mitsuki they're
Akuta
, created with kinjutsu by Kū, and that they can't live long like humans. Kokuyō tells Sekiei to stop telling Mitsuki things. Sekiei has taken a liking to Mitsuki. Shikadai, Boruto, and Sarada are catching up with them.
Mirai
 tells
Konohamaru
 she has learned about Mitsuki being
Orochimaru
's son, but Konohamaru assures her he doesn't hate Mitsuki. Naruto calls
Kurotsuchi
, informs her of the situation, and requests permission for his tracker to enter Iwagakure. He also tells her Boruto and Sarada are tracking the assailants. Kurotsuchi denies permission for trackers to enter Iwagakure, at least until she has conducted her own investigation to make sure the targets are indeed Iwagakure shinobi. Konoha shinobi are attacked by Akuta. Boruto's group arrives at the destroyed Akuta, which Boruto recognises. Kokuyō detects they're being pursued, and instructs Sekiei to go on ahead with Mitsuki, while he and the remaining Akuta deal with the pursuers. Kokuyō deals with several Konoha trackers, the battle catching the attention of Boruto's group. They arrive to see Kokuyō victorious, and he asks if they're also trackers.
