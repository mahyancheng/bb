Agira Ryūdōin
 (
Ryūdōin Agira
) was the father of
Jakō
,
Rokkaku
 and
Genshō
.

Background

Sometime in the past, he fought
Might Guy
 and was defeated. He was left badly injured and died soon after. His sons tried to take revenge on Might Guy, but in the process, they realised that they misunderstood their father's beliefs.

Appearance

Agira was a large man, who were seen to wear a long coat and shirt, dark fingerless gloves which  extended to his elbow, long pants and common shinobi sandals. He had white shoulder-length hair which parted around his face, not unlike his eldest son, although Agira's fringes were shorter. His face was slightly wrinkled and his forehead was adorned with a tattoo-like arrangement of three tomoe, somewhat resembling the
Cursed Seal of Heaven
.

Personality

As noted by Guy, Agira was a fine honourable man, evident as he had chosen to fight Guy using his taijutsu instead of his Wooden Puppets and after their battle, when he asked for another try with a satisfied smile. Though Agira himself did not survive to do so, he wished to have a rematch until his death. Guy himself had a great fondness for Agira, noting his respectful ways and even calling him Agira-chan.

Abilities

Agira was proficient in the
Wooden Puppet Manipulation Technique
, being able to control and summon a large number of them. His
taijutsu
 prowess was equally impressive, forcing Guy to open at least three of the
Eight Gates
 in order to gain victory. The particular style he used was allegedly
kenpō
, a Japanese martial art where fist strikes, pressure points and joint-locks are primarily used for self-defence.
