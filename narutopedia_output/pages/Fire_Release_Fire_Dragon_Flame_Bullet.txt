After kneading
chakra
, the user breathes fire from their mouth. The flames are manipulated into the shape of a dragon and divided to strike the target from the left, right, and front all at once. Unlike the
Great Fireball
, which covers a wide area, the Fire Dragon Flame Bullet makes focused strikes, quickly reducing targets to ash upon contact.
 Alternately, the flames can coil around the target and form into a vortex, effectively keeping them trapped in place unless they can escape through the top.
 This technique is regarded as one of the most powerful Fire Release techniques, being several times more intense than the Great Fireball and greatly surpassing it in range.
 Even among the techniques mastered by the Third Hokage, this technique has outstanding power that he was proud of. Because of the power of this technique, as well as the amount of skill it takes to control the flames, there are very few shinobi who can perform it, the Third Hokage being one such user.

Trivia

When first used in the anime, this technique is depicted as a high-pressure stream of fire with no definitive shape. The fire also becomes white in colour, suggesting it becomes increasingly hot during use.

In the anime, the
Shisui Uchiha
 of
Jiraiya Shinobi Handbook
 can use this technique.
