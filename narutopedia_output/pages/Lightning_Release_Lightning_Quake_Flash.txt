The user releases a current of purplish lightning from their hands forward, damaging and knocking away opponents. This technique is similar to
Chidori Current
 as they both have the effect of shooting lightning currents at their opponent. Its range, unlike that of Chidori Current, is much smaller. Unlike Lightning Cutter it has a smaller current of lightning so it will not completely kill them.
