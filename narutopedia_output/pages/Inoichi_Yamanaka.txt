Inoichi Yamanaka
 (
山中いのいち
,
Yamanaka Inoichi
) was the head of
Konohagakure
's
Yamanaka clan
, and along with
Shikaku Nara
 and
Chōza Akimichi
, he was a part of the
15th generation Ino–Shika–Chō
 trio. He was also the head of the
Analysis Team
 in the village's
Intelligence Division
.

Background






Ino–Shika–Chō meeting with Iwa-nin for a peace treaty.



When he became a
genin
, he was partnered with Shikaku and Chōza. In the anime, nearing the end of the
Third Shinobi World War
,
his team
 was assigned to deliver a request for a peace treaty between the Konoha and
Iwagakure
. Anticipating the Iwa shinobi to turn hostile, the meeting was strategically held at the borderline of the
Land of Wind
, knowing that the
Fourth Kazekage
 would oversee the meeting should a battle breakout on his own land.

During the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
, Inoichi and his team-mates assisted in the village's defence.

In the anime, Inoichi was placed in charge of interrogating
Hanare
 after she was captured and brought to Konohagakure. After seeing a memory of
Kakashi Hatake
 as a child in her thoughts, he sent her over to him and see if he remembered her as their other methods of interrogation so far had failed.

Personality

Inoichi had a calm and perceptive nature, generally staying calm under pressure. He was also very analytical being able to put together the information he got from his interrogation to aid
Shizune
 in uncovering the secret behind the
Six Paths of Pain
. He had also been described as having an indulgent and gentlemanly disposition.

Inoichi loved his daughter
Ino
 very much. This sometimes led to him indulging her a great deal, but nonetheless he was proud of her. He firmly believes that Ino will one day become the most prominent member of their clan.
 The bonds that she has with her friends, as well as her clan's
ninjutsu
 prowess, stating before his death that she has truly blossomed to reflect the meaning of the bush clover that he raised her to symbolise.
 He was determined to pass on all his knowledge and skill to Ino to make sure she was ready to become head of their clan one day, likewise showing a strong believe in his clan's traditions.

Appearance






Inoichi in Part I.



Inoichi had long ash blond hair reaching into his lower back, which he wore spiky on top and ending in a long ponytail, light green eyes and strong facial features, which included a well defined jaw line. In Part I, Inoichi was seen wearing the standard flak jacket over a black outfit, complete with hand-guards, forehead protector and a sleeveless red
haori
. In Part II, he wore the standard outfit of the Konoha Interrogation Unit, complete with a long black overcoat. During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, he donned the standard uniform of the Konohagakure shinobi.

Abilities

Inoichi, who was the head of the Yamanaka clan, has shown himself to be a highly capable shinobi that could use
Water Release
. He was known among other villages, as he was recognised by
Tenga
, who was looking forward to working under his command.

Ninjutsu

Yamanaka Clan Techniques






Inoichi causing the invading shinobi to attack each other.



He was well-versed in all of his clan's secret techniques as witnessed during the
Konoha Crush
 where Inoichi skilfully performed the
Mind Body Disturbance Technique
, causing the invaders he encountered to fight against their own allies. In the anime,  he was also able to use an
advanced version
 of the technique which manipulates the mind of several enemies at once.

He has also shown the ability to
communicate telepathically
 with other people. His skill with telepathic communication was such that he contacted and relayed a message to the entire Allied Shinobi Forces, despite its vast size for twenty seconds even though he stated he could only do it for ten, suffering only a nosebleed and fatigue.

Mind Reading Techniques and Sensory Perception

Further proof of his skills was shown from his status as an interrogator in the
Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force
 during
Pain's assault
 on Konoha where he was able to skilfully
probe the mind
 of one Pain's
Amegakure loyalist
 and go through an entire days worth of his memories in mere seconds with the aid of
a device
, even though Pain had set up
mental blocks
 and traps in the shinobi's head.

He was also a very skilled
sensor
-type shinobi, considered the best of his clan.

Aoba Yamashiro
 has praised him, admitting to not being as skilled as him in the area.
 Using his sensory perception, he could track down targets through by following their chakra trail, as long as their chakra signature stayed the same.
 Alongside
Ao
, he could create a wide-ranged
detection-type barrier
, big enough to cover all battlefields during the Fourth Shinobi World War.

 to cause the invading shinobi to fight amongst themselves. Inoichi then said fighting alongside his team-mates
Chōza
 and
Shikaku
 reminded him of old times when they were renown across the nations. Chōza then remarked that they still are.

Not long before the start of the joint Chūnin Exams, he teaches Ino a
high level technique
 of their clan, though she is only able to learn the basics of the technique at the time.

As Ino participates in the joint Chūnin Exams, he gets worried. Seeing how inexperienced she is with her clan's techniques, he wishes she focused more on them rather than the medical training she's been getting from the
Fifth Hokage
. However, Tsunade reveals to him that his daughter's medical training will help her better perform her clan's techniques as she'd gain excellent chakra control from it. Inoichi, who was satisfied by this, stated that Ino may yet become the strongest member of their clan.

Part II

Pain's Assault

Pain's Assault






Inoichi reading Yūdachi's mind.



When
Ibiki Morino
 proved unable to learn anything about
Pain
 from
Yūdachi
, he called on Inoichi for assistance. He probed Yūdachi's mind, rapidly going through his memories before arriving at the revelation that Pain had requested of Yūdachi: dead bodies. Before he could think further on this, Ino arrived to inform him of Pain's attack on Konoha, and the village was soon afterwards destroyed.
Shizune
 was killed in the chaos by the
Human Path
 and, using the information Shizune had learned before her death, Inoichi realised that Pain was animating dead bodies in a manner similar to his own clan's mental manipulation techniques, thereby meaning the true Pain was in a remote location somewhere relatively close by.

While looking for Pain's real body along with Shikaku and a shinobi from the Hyūga clan, they ran into
Naruto Uzumaki
. Inoichi asked if Naruto had defeated Pain, to which Naruto answered that it didn't matter and stated that he had found Pain's true body while in Sage Mode. He asked them not to follow him, as he wanted to talk to Pain alone. Inoichi stated angrily that talking didn't solve anything, but, after a brief argument, Shikaku told Inoichi to just let Naruto go, to which Inoichi hesitantly agreed. Inoichi along with the rest of the village, were overjoyed at Naruto's return to the village.

Inoichi and the Intelligence Division.



Inoichi was placed in charge of the
Intelligence Division
. When
Aoba Yamashiro
 returned from his mission, Inoichi questioned him about his time on the
Island Turtle
 stating that it seemed as though they had a rough time. His first act within the war, was to set up a
barrier
 with
Ao
 with which the
Sensor Division
 could use to monitor the battlefields from headquarters.

He later relayed new information to the members of his division in the fields about the enemy forces travelling underground. After the Alliance realised that the
First Division
 was soon going to be overwhelmed by the enemies' forces, Inoichi relayed the new battle strategy as created by
Shikaku
 to the divisions. He then reported that
Shizune
 had also split up her division equally in order to better attend to the wounded shinobi on each battlefield.






Inoichi and Ao creating the Sensing Water Sphere.



When headquarters needed to get in contact with
Darui
, Inoichi used a variant of his
telepathy
 by placing his hand on Shikaku's forehead but told him he could not hold the connection for long. Nevertheless, this allows Shikaku himself to telepathically contact Darui,
Ino
,
Shikamaru
 and
Chōji
, where he told them of his strategy to seal
Kinkaku
. After Kinkaku was sealed, Inoichi praised Ino's uses of the
Mind Body Switch Technique
 as her use and release of the technique had increased greatly.

As the night dragged on, Inoichi received reports from multiple divisions that shinobi from the Alliance were being assassinated and that they could not find the enemy. After being asked by Shikaku what the corpses look like, he reports that they all died from external wounds and not from covert methods like poisoning. After receiving a report from the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
 it was revealed that it was in fact members of
White Zetsu Army
 who had
transformed
 into shinobi from the alliance and were killing other shinobi and causing chaos.






Inoichi allowing Shikaku to communicate with ninja on the battlefield.



After
Naruto
 and
B
 were allowed to head to battlefield by
A
 and
Tsunade
, Inoichi once again used his telepathy to allow Shikaku to converse with the two jinchūriki. He is later contacted by
Dodai
 who asks him to allow Naruto to talk to
B
 and the
Eight-Tails
. Inoichi then asks Naruto how comes he wasn't with B before patching him through.

Later, in the anime, the
Sound Four
 are also summoned to the battlefield. After
Neji
, Shikamaru,
Kiba
, and Chōji seemingly defeat them, the Sound Four and Leaf ninja are struck by a
strange technique
 that has left them in a comatose state. After learning the truth of the technique, that it removes the victims soul and transports it to another location, he explains it can be dispelled like genjutsu, by pouring chakra into the actual technique. However, it has a seal that prevents even Inoichi, equipped with special enhancement tools, from being able to detect or communicate with them. Later, Naruto contacted Inoichi to explain the situation, making Naruto rush to his friends aid. Eventually, Naruto found the barrier and destroyed it, allowing Inoichi to locate Shikamaru and the others and dispel the technique to restore them.

Later, after a tremor was felt all the way at headquarters, Inoichi reported that it was due to a
meteorite
 falling from the sky where the
Fourth Division
 was located. He later facilitated Shikaku's contact with
Genma
 and the
Hokage Guard Platoon
, instructing them to transport
Mei Terumī
 to the front lines using the
Flying Thunder God Technique
.






Inoichi relaying information to the entire Allied Forces.



After headquarters received intelligence about the situation on the battlefield with Naruto, B and
Tobi
, Shikaku asked Inoichi to relay a message to the entire Allied Shinobi Forces in fifteen seconds. Though the other members of the Intelligence Division protested, stating it would put too great a strain on him, Inoichi told Shikaku that what he was asking was ridiculous and he would only give him ten seconds. Contacting the entire alliance, he relayed the message and spurred on the troops to aid Naruto and B. Suffering a nosebleed afterwards, a fatigued Inoichi stated that it seemed he wasn't good at speeches after all and ended up taking twenty seconds instead of ten and apologised.

Inoichi realises that the enemy is aiming for HQ.



Later, when the Sensing Water Sphere in HQ became distorted, Inoichi hastily followed through with Shikaku's order to check out the situation. After Shikaku had formulated a strategy during the time Naruto used to chide the opposition, Inoichi enabled Shikaku to communicate this to the entire Alliance. Inoichi later coordinated the various attacks as they attacked
Madara
,
Obito
, and the
Ten-Tails
. As the Ten-Tails reached maturity, Inoichi briefly connected Shikaku with Kakashi until the beast began to attack. The Ten-Tails fired a barrage of
Tailed Beast Balls
, destroying many locations. This lead Inoichi to wonder whether or not they were attacking the civilians until it is realised that they were aiming for HQ. Knowing there was no escape, Shikaku has Inoichi allow him to give out one last strategy to the Allied Shinobi Forces. Before being killed once the Tailed Beast Ball destroys HQ, Inoichi telepathically said his farewell to Ino, stating how proud of her he is and that he would always be watching over her.

Legacy

Leaving behind a quietly understated legacy, Inoichi was someone that many shinobi in the field of intelligence looked up to greatly because of his renown. For those who were able to witness his skills in person, they were always left in awe, and would aspire to attain his level of skill. Konoha, on a whole, benefited greatly from these skills as even the booby-trapped minds of those unwilling participants stood no chance against his prowess. The shinobi world at large would later come to heavily depend on these skills during the Fourth Shinobi World War where he was responsible for receiving and dispensing crucial information to and from
HQ
. Above his duties, however, Inoichi shared a close bond with his daughter whom he loved dearly. This would most often translate into him overindulging her, but despite this, Inoichi was proud of his daughter's growth, not only as a kunoichi, but as a person who protected her friends. In this, Inoichi was content that his daughter had truly grown to reflect the meaning of their clan flower symbol: the
bush clover
. Inoichi's compassion for his family and allies, along with devotion to his duties, and his sacrifice inspired Ino to continue his work in protecting the village.
