Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2
 is a turn-based role-playing game.

Plot Overview

Unlike the past instalments in the
Path of the Ninja
 series, this game's plot is original filler. It is a turn-based strategic role playing game, where the user and the opponent take turns during battle. The story is a filler, but made to last much longer. In the story, the player faces all of the
Three Ryūdōin Brothers
 and needs to obtain 5 mirrors hidden in the game.
Nazuna
 (a girl in the story) says that
Genshō Ryūdōin
 is reanimating the
Spirit Beast
, and the only way to stop it is by collecting all 5
Hope Mirrors
. Once the player collects a mirror, the player has to go through a past event from their memory again (like when Gaara transformed into Shukaku during the Konoha Crush, when
the

four

jōnin

fought
 Itachi and Kisame, when Zabuza and Haku fought Kakashi in the Land of Waves and when Sasuke left Konoha, the player fights them again). But each time, the player near the mirror, Genshō tries to stop the player with through his brothers,
Jakō Ryūdōin
 and
Rokkaku Ryūdōin
. On the attempt to obtain the last mirror,
Gaara
 kills Rokkaku and after Jakō's last encounter with the player, he loses and Genshō decides that he's useless now and kills him. As Genshō is about to kill the heroes,
Naruto Uzumaki
 taps into the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra and faces Genshō. Once he is defeated, all the collected mirrors are kept in place to seal the Spirit Beast. But once again for one last time, Genshō merges with the Spirit Beast in an attempt to get rid of the heroes once and for all. After defeating Genshō in his final form, peace is restored around the world (
Konohagakure
 and
Sunagakure
) and all things come back to normal. In the end, the heroes go back to their respective places (Gaara and co. return to Sunagakure and the Konoha ninja return to Konohagakure), where they are welcomed after clearing their S-ranked mission.

After completing the game,
Tsunade
 adds a new member to the Konoha team, who is an
Anbu
 that mostly represents the player itself.

Trivia

Some characters, like Sasuke and Haku, are almost impossible to obtain without cheats like Action Replay nowadays due to them only being unlocked if you played the Wi-Fi Multiplayer, which Nintendo shut down in 2014.

Kakashi, Iruka, Jiraiya, Tsunade, Orochimaru, Zabuza, Haku and Hiruzen have unknown stats in this game.

At the Konoha Theatre, you can take up to 4 characters to see
Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow
, and up to 4 adult characters (Kakashi, Guy, Tsunade, Jiraiya, Orochimaru, Iruka, Itachi, Kisame and the Anbu) to see
Make-Out Paradise
. Some characters can trigger special cutscenes when paired up, such as Naruto and Lee, Team 7 or Itachi and Kisame.

You can't take Hiruzen, Zabuza and Haku into the theatre for some reason, possibly due to them being dead.

If you take 4 characters to see the other 2 movies, they will only have generic dialogue.

In this game, the movie poster of
Naruto the Movie: Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom
, can be seen in the village outside of a Konoha Theatre, saying, Naruto the Movie: Animal Panic on Moon Island!. Coming soon to theatres August 5, 200X!.

Animal Panic on Moon Island is the Japanese title for Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom, as the English version of the movie has not released yet when the game came out.
