"
The Demon in the Snow
" (
ザブザ雪に散る…
,
Zabuza Yuki ni Chiru…
) is episode 19 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Gatō
 tells
Zabuza
 that he planned to betray him from the beginning since his services were too costly, and orders newly hired thugs to kill him. Zabuza tells
Kakashi
 their fight is over now he's no longer employed. Gatō kicks
Haku
's dead body, which infuriates Naruto, but Zabuza is unfazed, saying he merely used Haku as weapon just as Gatō used him. Naruto can’t accept this and begins crying, telling Zabuza he was so precious to Haku, who gave everything so that Zabuza could accomplish his goals. Not being able to live his own life the way he wanted to, because he was so devoted. Moved by Naruto's tears and words, Zabuza reveals that he is crying as well, finally acknowledging Haku's sacrifice.

Without the use of his arms that have been immobilised by
Kakashi
, Zabuza borrows Naruto's
kunai
, taking it in his teeth, and charging at Gatō. Zabuza is stabbed multiple times by Gatō's thugs but still manages to kill the mob boss despite severe injuries. Meanwhile, the rest of
Team 7
 are relieved to discover that
Sasuke
 is still alive, having been purposely spared any lethal injuries by Haku. Gatō's men are soon scared away by the villagers of the
Land of Waves
 who arrive to defend
Tazuna
 and their village.

Afterwards, a wounded Zabuza requests that Kakashi place him beside Haku. Before dying, Zabuza wishes he was able to go to the same place as him in the afterlife. Kakashi says that he believes they'll be together, seeing Zabuza's change of heart in the end. Team 7 bury the two ninja in a peaceful place, leaving Zabuza's sword,
Kubikiribōchō
, as a marker for his grave. Naruto is unsatisfied with the prevailing notion that ninjas should strive to become merely tools, and declares he will find his own ninja way. He says goodbye to
Inari
, and the team returns to
Konohagakure
. After their succeeded mission, Tazuna decides to name their finished bridge; the
Great Naruto Bridge
.

Trivia

In the manga, when attacking Gatō, Zabuza beheads him, rather than slashing him up and pushing him into the sea.
