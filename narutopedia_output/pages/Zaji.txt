This article is about the Konoha shinobi. For the gambler, see
Zaji
.

Zaji
 (
ザジ
) is a
shinobi
 from
Konohagakure
.

Personality

Zaji is very confident in his abilities to the point where he will constantly boast about them. He is also shown as impulsive and often acts without thinking over the given situation. These traits, however, could be due to the fact that he is somewhat inexperienced and still a little naive as
Ittan
 pointed out.

Appearance

Zaji has brown, jaw-length hair that frames the sides of his face and dark eyes. He wears the standard attire of the Konoha shinobi inclusive of
flack jacket
 and sandals as well as the
Allied Shinobi Forces
'
forehead protector
.

Abilities

Zaji is a
sensor
 type shinobi and can detect a person through their chakra within a certain range of himself.

In the anime, Zaji also played a more supplementary role in battles aiding his comrades from a distance while also employing battle strategies in close-quarter combat, which culminated in him blowing off
Pakura
's left arm.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Zaji is placed in the
Surprise Attack Division
 during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, and acts as its sensor. When the team landed in enemy territory
their captain
 assigned Zaji the task of surveillance along with
Hoheto Hyūga
. He boasted that he was assigned to the team because of his skills, which prompts
Ittan
 — who seems more experienced in war — to reprimand him, telling him never to let his guard down in battle.






Muta is forced to attack Zaji.



While on surveillance duty Zaji quickly realises that something was
interfering
 with his ability to sense properly, but he could still tell someone was coming. When it turned out to be
Muta
, Zaji rushes out to help him and is taken hostage by Muta who was being
controlled
 by Sasori from the shadows. As Deidara detonates the clay explosive that they filled Muta's jar with, Kankurō acts quickly enough to save Zaji from the explosion that was caused, pulling him back with his own
chakra threads
. He was slightly injured but even more shocked and confused when he saw that his fellow Konohagakure ninja
Ranka
 and
Tokuma
 — who were also being controlled — had attacked them. He later alerted everyone to
Shin
 attacking them from above them before the attack is intercepted by
Sai
. During the battle he remained with
Kiri
 as he healed Tokuma and Ranka in the
protective dome
 Ittan had created.






Zaji, Omoi and Sai launch a second assault.



After Deidara used Shin as bomb, Kiri was confused as to what had happened outside, and Zaji assured him that everyone from their team was still alive. After the battle in concluded and the Surprise Attack Division advanced, they encountered
Zabuza
,
Haku
,
Gari
 and
Pakura
, while riding on Sai's
ink birds
. After Sai's first attack, Zaji lights a flare, which signalled
Kakashi Hatake
 and the rest of the
Third Division
. Shortly afterwards, Haku used his
Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals
 to knock everyone off the ink birds after their assault on the revived shinobi failed. On the ground, Zaji recognised
Gari
 and
Pakura
 and stated that they were all shinobi with
kekkei genkai
, to which Zabuza retorts that he was the exception.

In the anime, he, Omoi, and Sai would later battle
Fuguki Suikazan
 and he and Omoi would go off to aid Maki and her team to fight
Gari
 and
Pakura
.

Trivia

In
chapter 520
, his hair is depicted as dark, not white. This, however, was corrected in subsequent chapters as well as in the tankōbon.
