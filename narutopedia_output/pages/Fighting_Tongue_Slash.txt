By kneading senjutsu
chakra
, Fukasaku's long tongue gains utmost solidity and sharpness. It then leaps from his mouth with tremendous speed and force, enough to tear a hole through bedrock and metal pipes with ease. With that ground-splitting power, the enemy is cut in half. The way that both the enemy and the ground itself are cut apart is reminiscent of the strike of a great sword.

Trivia

"Zessen"
 is written with the kanji for
"tongue"
 and
"battle"
. It can be translated as to
"battle with tongues"
. In normal use, however, it means
"war of words"
, or
"verbal dispute"
, in reference to Fukasaku and Shima arguing all the time. The full kanji can be translated as "War of Words Slash".

In the anime,
colourised manga
, and various video games, Fukasaku is depicted firing a highly pressurised stream of
water
 from his mouth, rather than extending his tongue.
