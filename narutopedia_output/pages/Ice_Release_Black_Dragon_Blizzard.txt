An
Ice Release
 technique formed from already existing ice. After forming the needed hand seal Dotō will thrust his arm to send out a black ether-like dragon to strike his opponent. As it flies through the air it will begin to turn. When it hits the target it will use its motion to launch the opponent high into the air.

Trivia

Although a movie-only technique, the fact that the user manipulates a black-coloured element makes it similar to
Amaterasu
 and
Black Lightning
.
