This article is about Sasori's father. For the puppets modelled after Sasori's parents, see
Mother and Father
.

He was a
shinobi
 from
Sunagakure
. He was also the son of
Chiyo
 and the father of
Sasori
.

Background






Sasori's parents bid farewell to their son before heading out.



He and
his wife
 were killed by
Sakumo Hatake
 during a war,
 leaving Sasori in the care of his grandmother Chiyo for much of his childhood. After learning the
art of puppetry
, Sasori created
puppets
 with their likeness, in the hopes that doing so would help him feel loved. Because they were still only puppets, this failed, and Sasori lost interest in the two and left them behind when he defected from
Sunagakure
.

Appearance

Sasori's father had very shaggy red hair, purple eyes, and wore a long, loose fitting outfit with a poncho like top; common pieces of clothes amongst the Sunagakure villagers. As a shinobi, he wore the standard uniform of a Suna-nin, complete with a
flak jacket
, a
forehead protector
, and a white ghutrah.

Legacy

With his departure, the puppets came into the possession of Chiyo, who once used them against Sasori, and ultimately to their current wielder
Kankurō
.
