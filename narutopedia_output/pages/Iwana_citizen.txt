Great Sea Battle of Kirigakure Arc

Years after leaving the village, Kagura returned and was greeted by Iwana and Yamame. Kagura informed his childhood friends of the threat of the elite forces from the
Funato clan
, who would pass by their village on their way to
Kirigakure
. Iwana agreed to help his childhood friend and his allies to help defend the village. Later, Iwana noticed
Kyohō Fuefuki
 cutting down trees by himself, both him and Yamame offered to help him in setting up the village defences. Impressed with his strength, Iwana suggested Kyōho should return to their village once the war with the Funato is over to do some work for them. After the Funato's attack, Iwana and Yamame made repairs on their village while still mourning for Kagura.






Iwana and Yamame ask Kyohō to stay in the village.



As the elite forces return for another attack, Iwana and Yamame hid with the other villagers while they both implored
Boruto
 to avenge Kagura. After the Funato's second attack, Iwana and the other villagers rebuilt their village stronger than before. When an injured Funato soldier was brought back for interrogation, Iwana and the other villagers were against it, resentful of the Funato. He and Yamame asked Kyohō to stay and protect the village now that he had been pardoned, but he refused, saying he had to help
Buntan
 against the Funato. When
Team 7
 returned from an ambush at Boruto, which involved
Funamushi
's son
Kobuna
, they remained in favour of fighting the Funato. Later, Iwana and Yamane informed the villagers on the upcoming clash between the Funato and Kirigakure.
