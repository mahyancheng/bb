Mabui
 (
マブイ
) was a
kunoichi
 from
Kumogakure
, and the
Fourth Raikage
's assistant.

Personality

Mabui remained calm in stressful situations and immediately completes the tasks she was given. Furthermore, she, like
Darui
, appeared to be quite exasperated when the
Raikage
, instead of using the door, decided to burst through his
office
 window, and even suggested that he had done the same on previous occasions. In the anime, Mabui is shown to be very respectful, as she referred to both
Naruto
 and
B
 by honourifics despite Naruto being younger than her.

Appearance

Mabui was a dark-skinned young woman with green eyes. She wore very formal attire consisting of a long-sleeved, high-collared dress shirt and skirt, along with a pair of long earrings and high-heel sandals. She wore her light grey hair pulled back into a bun with two bangs that fall on either side of her face.

Abilities

Mabui possessed a unique technique that allows her to
transfer
 matter over long distances at the speed of light. It was for this technique that she was made the Raikage's assistant.

Mabui transfers the Kohaku no Jōhei, using her Heavenly Transfer Technique.



Remaining at headquarters, Mabui was present when they were informed about the forces opposing the
First
 and
Fourth Divisions
. She helped to seal
Kinkaku
 by using the
Heavenly Transfer Technique
 to send the
Kohaku no Jōhei
 to Darui on the battlefield. Later, after learning how the enemy
White Zetsu Army
 had infiltrated the Alliance's ranks
disguised
 as shinobi, and, under the cover of night was murdering shinobi sending the forces into near chaos, she surmised that the whole reason for the battle during the day was in preparation for their current assault.






Mabui aiding Shikaku in analysing data.



As Mabui aided
Shikaku Nara
 in going over all the intel that they had at their disposal, Shikaku came up with the idea to utilise Naruto's ability to
sense negative emotions
 to uncover the clones that had infiltrated their ranks, she stated that the plan was not viable as the Raikage would never allow Naruto to participate in the war, a fact which Shikaku lamented. However,
Katsuyu
 then told them that it might in fact be an option due to the Raikage finally allowing Naruto and B to pass him and enter the fray, an occurrence which baffled Mabui greatly.






Mabui transports A and Tsunade to the front lines.



After the real
Madara Uchiha
 was
reincarnated
 and summoned to the battlefield, Tsunade declared that she would be heading to the front-lines, and demanded that Mabui get her
teleportation technique
 ready, intending to use it to travel to the battlefield. Mabui, however, objected to this, claiming that it wasn't intended to be used on living targets, going even further to note that only the
Third Raikage
 would be able to endure the technique due to his special body. Another
method of travel
 was proposed but Tsunade rejected it, claiming that she can use her
Creation Rebirth
 technique to counteract any damage her body suffered. Mabui pleaded for A to make Tsunade change her mind, but A simply ordered her to prepare the technique for two people instead of one. An exasperated Mabui again voiced her concern, now sought help from
Shikaku
 in convincing the two Kage not to attempt to endure the transfer. Shikaku simply tells her it's time for the Allied Shinobi leader to make an appearance on the battlefield prompting Mabui to reluctantly prepare the technique, before hesitantly activating it and transporting A and Tsunade to the coordinates given by
Dodai
.

As the
Ten-Tails
 reached maturity, the beast fired a
Tailed Beast Ball
 straight towards
HQ
, killing Mabui and the other inhabitants besides Ao.
