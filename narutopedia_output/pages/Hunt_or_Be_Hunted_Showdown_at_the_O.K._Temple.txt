 anime.

Synopsis

Sazanami
 reveals that he was accused of murdering a family (he was delivering a sword they had ordered) and that the thief that he and
Naruto
's group is hunting is the main suspect; he wants to capture him to prove his innocence. The four locate the thief in a nearby city, in the process of attempting to steal a valuable bell from a temple. After Sazanami captures the thief, he is also captured himself, but his innocence is revealed. Despite this, Naruto's group fails the mission because they did not capture the thief, but are happy for him.
