The
Flying Thunder God — Second Step
 is a technique developed by Minato from the
Flying Thunder God Technique
. Minato first throws a
Flying Thunder God Kunai
, be it a direct attack at his opponent; once the kunai has reached close proximity to the target, or even past them, he would then teleport to the said kunai, immediately attacking his target from their blind-spot. The speed at which this technique is executed along with the unpredicted secondary attack is such that even an individual who possesses the
Sharingan
 is unable to react in time.

Trivia

Tobirama
 executed a similar manoeuvre with a regular marked kunai.
