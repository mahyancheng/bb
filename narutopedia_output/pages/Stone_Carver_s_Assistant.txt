Part II

Five Kage Summit

Before the stone carver could carve the Sixth
Hokage
 Candidate's face into the
monument
, he informs the stone carver that
Danzō
 is dead. Before
Kakashi Hatake
 could attend an emergency meeting with the
Fire Daimyō
, he helps the stone carver to make preparations for his stone carving by measuring his face and preparing a mould by painting thin layers of plaster. He later informs the stone carver that
Tsunade
 has awoken from her coma, cancelling Kakashi's appointment to be Hokage and face on the monument.
