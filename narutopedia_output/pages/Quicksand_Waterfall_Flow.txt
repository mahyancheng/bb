Using his personal
sand
,
Gaara
 grinds up rocks and minerals underground into a huge volume of sand that he brings above ground. The earth shakes as the sand surfaces, which Gaara then manipulates like a tsunami that he crashes against his targets. Targets are battered multiple times by the waves of sand as it spreads throughout the area. When the sand settles, the landscape is dramatically altered, taking on the appearance of a barren desert. Gaara can then use this sand to perform additional attacks, such as
Sand Waterfall Imperial Funeral
.

Because of how much sand Gaara uses for this technique, the
Fourth Kazekage
 assumes he can only use it in
Tailed Beast Mode
 in order to gain access to the full power of
Shukaku
. He is subsequently surprised to see Gaara using it on his own.
