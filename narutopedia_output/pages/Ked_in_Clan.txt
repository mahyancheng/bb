The clan was first introduced when
Kiba Inuzuka
,
Hinata Hyūga
 and
Naruto Uzumaki
 go on a treasure hunt mission. Agari's servants copied Naruto, Kiba, and Hinata's appearances and left them trapped in the cave while they left to go "mess up their village." The one posing as Naruto gave the real one a hard time and Kiba managed to take down Agari and the Kedōin clan members impersonating him and Hinata. Naruto finally defeated his impostor using the
Shadow Clone Technique
. Moments later in
Tsunade
's office, Tsunade revealed that she hired Agari to test the genin's teamwork and to see if they should be sent back to the
Academy
 or not. Naruto, Kiba, and Hinata passed and collected the treasure chest, which contains the bill for Tsunade.
