"
That Guy Can't be Killed
" (
あいつは殺せない
,
Aitsu wa Korosenai
,
Viz:
 Unkillable) is chapter 322 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Asuma
 admits that he hasn't smoked recently, but insists it is not because of worry over a fight with
Akatsuki
, although he is concerned about how they will fare. In
Konoha
,
Naruto
 and his
shadow clones
 struggle to combine
Wind Release
 with the
Rasengan
, a process that is frustrating enough that some clones lose control of the
Nine-Tails
'
chakra
.
Yamato
 suppresses them. Elsewhere,
Hidan
 waits outside a bounty station for
Kakuzu
 to finish his business. Asuma appears and attacks him, though Hidan blocks the attack. Before he can retaliate he is captured by
Shikamaru
's shadow, giving
Izumo
 and
Kotetsu
 a chance to strike. They believe they have killed him, but Hidan merely asks who they are.
