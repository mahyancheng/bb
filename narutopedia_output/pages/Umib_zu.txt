Umibōzu
 (
海坊主
,
literally meaning:
 sea
bonze
) was a creature used by
Amachi
 to terrorise the
Land of the Sea
.

Appearance

Umibōzu looked pretty much like a giant water formation with spots that looked like two eyes and a mouth. It was light blue in colour and translucent.

Abilities

Umibōzu itself is nothing more than a gigantic mass of water, that has been gathered, and held together by the summoner's
chakra
.
 Being made completely of water, it is virtually indestructible unless it is completely evaporated. The creature can also expand its size with a larger supply of water. Other than being able to morph its form, Umibōzu's main attack method is capturing targets in its water body and drowning them, which, according to Amachi, refers it as a "Moving
Water Prison Technique
" (
動く水牢の術
,
Ugoku Suirō no Jutsu
).
 It can also shoot powerful bullets of
condensed water
 at its opponents.

Part I

Kaima Capture Mission

Naruto Uzumaki
 got swallowed by its indestructible water mass and was completely immobilised, until he gained a burst of chakra from the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 and eventually broke free, shattering it into tiny droplets. During a later encounter, after Umibōzu reformed, Naruto resorted to summoning
Gamabunta
 and it was defeated by Naruto throwing an
explosive tag
 attached to a kunai into Gamabunta's
oil
,
completely evaporating it
.

Trivia
