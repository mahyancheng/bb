The
Valley of Lies
 (
偽りの谷
,
Itsuwari no Tani
) is what
Ameyuki
 calls the area surrounding
Shangri-la
, because so little of what happens there is as it appears. The valley lies deep within a mountain range. The river that runs through the valley produces a pleasant aroma whenever the water levels rise, which the residents of Shangri-la use as a medium for
genjutsu
: the genjutsu makes Shangri-la invisible to visitors to the valley and otherwise leaves people with positive, cheery feelings.

When Ameyuki
destroys
 Shangri-la, a large quantity of
mud
 is deposited in the valley. Shortly afterwards,
Konan
 inadvertently spreads the seeds of a rare white flower within the valley, which end up thriving there. The mud eventually attracts
Kanyū
 to the valley for use in her
Hanasaki
 ceramics and the white flowers attract
Kiiro
 for his
bees
 to produce medicinal honey.
