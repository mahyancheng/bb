With his
dōjutsu
,
Ranmaru
 is able to cast a
genjutsu
 involving the creation of silhouettes or illusory beings as a means of distraction. The entities are so realistic that they even have their own
chakra pathway system
, which can fool even the "all-seeing"
Byakugan
. When one of these entities is attacked, it vanishes like a ghost and then reappears.

This technique can also become more effective when used in conjunction with techniques like the
Hiding in Mist Technique
.
