This article is about the jōnin during the Third Shinobi World War. For the synthetic human, see
Kakō
.

Kakkō
 (
カッコウ
) was a
jōnin
 from
Iwagakure
.

Background

During the
Third Shinobi World War
 he was partnered with
Taiseki
 and
Mahiru
. He most notably engaged
Team Minato
 of
Konohagakure
, led by
Kakashi Hatake
. He was successful in capturing
Rin Nohara
 and placed her under a genjutsu, but was unable to extract any information from her.

Soon after, Kakashi and
Obito Uchiha
 appeared to rescue Rin, seemingly defeating Kakkō in the process. However, he managed to
corner them
. The right side of Obito's body was crushed by a boulder, and he was believed to have died during a second cave-in.

Rin and Kakashi survived the cave-in, with Kakashi now possessing Obito's
Sharingan
 in place of his original left eye, which he had lost in a fight with Taiseki. Kakkō was able to break Kakashi's
White Light Chakra Sabre
, but Kakashi's Sharingan allowed him to kill Kakkō using a newly-perfected
Chidori
.

Personality

Kakkō was a very shrewd man that has been described as being hostile and aggressive.
 This is witnessed mostly in his fighting style which is ruthless and precise. He had no qualms with killing or torturing children. He was also very overly self-confident in his abilities.

Appearance

He had black eyes and shaggy, high, black (brown in the anime) hair which was styled in a manner that somewhat resembled an afro. He wore the standard Iwa shinobi uniform, complete with a
flak jacket
 and a shirt having no right sleeve along with a dark indument hanging from his waist onto his right leg, reaching to his knees.

Abilities

Though belligerent by nature, Kakkō excelled in all areas of shinobi abilities:
ninjutsu
,
taijutsu
 and
genjutsu
, which made him a highly influential and powerful figure in Iwagakure. His extensive battle experience allowed him to formulate and use advanced tactics to defeat his enemies. He fought using retractable
blades
 attached to his arms and showed great proficiency in wielding them. He was also shown to make use of
earth
 release techniques, such as the
Earth Release: Rock Lodging Destruction
. He also excelled at gathering information, being shown using a high-level interrogation genjutsu, illustrated when he
interrogated
 Rin.
