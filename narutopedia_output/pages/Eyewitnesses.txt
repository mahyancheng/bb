Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Anko
 observes that, in addition to completing the
second phase
  in only ninety-seven minutes,
Gaara
 did so without even getting a speck of dust on him, something that would be almost impossible for even veteran ninja. Ten hours earlier,
Team 8
 had already acquired their second scroll and was proceeding to the second phase's ending destination. Along the way they came across
Team Shigure
 facing off with the
Three Sand Siblings
. Despite not knowing if each other had the scroll they needed,
Shigure
 attacked Gaara, but Gaara's
Shield of Sand
 protected him from any injury.
