The
Genin Exams
 (
下忍試験
,
Genin Shiken
),
 also known as the
Graduation Exams
 (
卒業試験
,
Sotsugyō Shiken
) are an opportunity for
Academy Students
 to be promoted to
genin
.

Originally,
Konohagakure
 students were given a two-phase exam in which they had to be able to properly perform the
Clone Technique
 to pass, and those who succeed will further be
tested
 by a
jōnin
 to determine whether they can officially become genin, or be sent back to the Academy for further training; the second phase was set up to ensure only 33% of the student body would be able to become genin. However, at least ten years after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
,
 the graduation process had changed to a timed written test and a twenty-four hour practical application exam the following day.

Trivia

During
Kirigakure
's reign as the "Village of the Bloody Mist", Academy students wishing to graduate had to fight to the death against their peers. This was abolished when
Zabuza Momochi
 massacred the year's candidates.
