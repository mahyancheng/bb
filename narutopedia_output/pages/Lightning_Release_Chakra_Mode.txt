The user wraps their body in a layer of
lightning

chakra
 to increase their physical parameters, with more lightning causing greater increases. As users coat more lightning chakra around themselves, the more their hair sticks up.
 The lightning augments the strength of the user's
taijutsu
, creating what is called
nintaijutsu
.
 The lightning also defends the user from most attacks, deflecting them away on contact;
 the
Fourth Raikage
 is impressed when
Chidori
 pierces through to him, however slightly.

The lightning chakra stimulates the user's nervous system, enhancing their speed and their reaction time.
 The user's reflexes are heightened enough to perform a
Lightning Release
Body Flicker
 (
雷遁の瞬身
,
Raiton no Shunshin
,
English TV:
 Lightning Style: Teleportation), dodging attacks as fast as
Amaterasu
.
 The user is so fast that not even the
Sharingan
 can track their movements;
 only
Minato Namikaze
's
Flying Thunder God Technique
 and
Naruto Uzumaki
's
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 have been shown to be faster.

Trivia

In lieu of
tailed beast
 chakra, the Fourth Raikage uses this mode to empower himself when performing the
Lightning Release: Lariat
, producing the same effects due to his high-powered chakra.

On the cover of
volume 59
, the Fourth Raikage's Lightning Release Chakra Mode is shown to be yellow.
