Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 visits
Ramen Ichiraku
 after a while, stating that the place has not changed a bit.
Teuchi
 and
Ayame
 are surprised as well as relished. Teuchi asks Naruto to order anything he wants. However,
Iruka
 arrives, stating it is his treat. He asks Naruto about
Sakura
 to which Naruto replies that if he knew Iruka would be treating him, he would definitely have brought her along. Meanwhile, Sakura ponders over her decision of not letting Naruto to treat her half a bowl of ramen.

In
Sunagakure
,
Gaara
 manages to protect the village from
Deidara
's
C3
 using his
Air Sand Protective Wall
, though it costs him a large amount of
chakra
. Some, like
Kankurō
, praise Gaara for his effort stating that they expect nothing less from the
Kazekage
. Suddenly, Deidara explodes his
small bird
 near Gaara's
defensive shell of sand
, but Gaara is unharmed because of the sand enclosing him. Meanwhile,
Baki
 is informed of the completion of attack preparations. Gaara notices the emergence of small
clay
 ants from within his shell. Deidara reveals that when Gaara
crushed
 his arm, he managed to mix some of his explosive clay with sand. Deidara activates the clay bomb ants and blows up the shell of protective sand around Gaara.

On the other hand, Iruka remembers the time when Naruto was much younger. Naruto grows despondent due to the fact that out of all his classmates, only he has been left as a
genin
. To this, Iruka encourages him by making him realise that he has been privately trained by
Jiraiya
, one of the legendary
Sannin
. The two then talk about Naruto's training that leads them to the discussion of Gaara becoming the Kazekage. Back in Sunagakure, the sand from Gaara's defensive shell begins to pour down as his shield disintegrates.

Tsunade
 and
Shizune
 argue about the mission that should be assigned to
Team Kakashi
. Tsunade proposes a
B-rank
 mission whereas Shizune insists upon a
D-rank
 mission, stating her concern about the
Nine-Tails
 present inside Naruto. Finally, they agree upon a
C-rank
 mission. When the Kazekage becomes vulnerable due to the loss of the sand protection, Sunagakure
shinobi
 try to attack Deidara, still riding his clay bird, to no avail.
Sasori
 is frustrated at being kept waiting. Already weak, with his last bit of power, Gaara manages to move the sand he used to protect the village from C3 out of the village. The Sunagakure shinobi make an unsuccessful attempt at rescuing Gaara. Deidara succeeds in capturing Gaara.
