Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Sarutobi
 attacks with a
fire
 technique, which the
Second Hokage
 neutralises with a
water
 technique. The
First Hokage
 follows with one of his signature
Wood Release
 techniques, immobilising Sarutobi. Sarutobi summons
Enma
 and has him transform into a staff to release him. Sarutobi attacks
Orochimaru
 with Enma, and Orochimaru parries with his
Kusanagi
. In the midst of his attacks Sarutobi plants
explosive tags
 on the First and Second. Although it removes their legs, the damage regenerates, a side-effect of the technique used to reincarnate them. Seeing that a normal fight will accomplish nothing and that he is already tiring, Sarutobi prepares for his death.
