Ningame
 (
忍亀
,
literally meaning:
 Ninja Tortoise) is
Might Guy
's personal summon.

Background

In the anime, Ningame was summoned by Guy to enter into a contract with his other student
Tenten
, but she offended Ningame, and he refused to enter into a contract with her.

Personality

Ningame is often-time a very stern and serious tortoise seen from his scolding of Lee when the latter tried to use the Front Lotus on Sasuke. Like his summoner Might Guy, Ningame is also easily moved to tears; this is shown when Lee hugged Guy and apologised for what he had attempted to do to Sasuke.

Appearance

He is a very large tortoise. His shell is red with a yellow underside and swirls on the top with markings around his eyes which are also yellow. He wears a standard Konoha
forehead protector
 around his neck, and an orange bandage on his right front leg. He has seemingly got larger between his Part I and Part II appearances.

Part I

, and prevented the former from using the
Front Lotus
. He then scolded Lee for what he was going to do as Lee apologised emphatically. Guy
appeared
 on top of his shell shortly after. He then proceeded to cry along with Might Guy and Lee as the two men embraced.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown






Guy summoning Ningame in mid-air.



Guy summons him while chasing after
Kisame Hoshigaki
 while losing momentum after being thrown by
Killer B
. He complains that this is the first time he has summoned him in years, and the fact he did so in mid-air. Guy uses his shell as a platform and jumps again causing him to fall to the ground; he ricochets off a giant tortoise's shell before hitting the ground. Ningame has a conversation with the giant tortoise, and marvels at his size. However, the tortoise claimed that he was basically still a hatchling, which shocked him as he had never seen or even heard of a tortoise that big.

Video Games

Although not playable, Ningame appears in
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2
. He pops up on some maps and spins while gliding across the area hitting and damaging anyone he comes in contact with.
