Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Leaving
Shino
 to deal with
Kankurō
,
Sasuke
 continues his pursuit of
Gaara
. Kankurō attacks Shino with
his puppet
, using its many hidden weapons to catch Shino by surprise. Shino is able to dodge the attacks through the use of his bugs, though he eventually makes the mistake of inhaling poison by the puppet's poison gas bomb. As the battle goes on, Shino directs his bugs to Kankurō's location. They consume his chakra once they get there, causing Kankurō to collapse. The battle won, Shino also collapses due to the poison in his system. Gaara awakens as Sasuke catches up to them, and Gaara sends
Temari
 flying. Gaara claims that while he and Sasuke are alike, he must kill Sasuke in order to prove his own existence, adding that Sasuke is his prey. Gaara then enters his initial
jinchūriki
 form to overwhelm Sasuke, terrifying Temari.
