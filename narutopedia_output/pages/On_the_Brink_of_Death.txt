Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Gaara

transports

Sakura
 and
Naruto
 to the
Fourth Hokage
 in order to have Yin-Kurama sealed into Naruto to save him. While being transported, Sakura attempts to
heal
 Naruto. As the Nine-tails' chakra cloak disappears, Sakura discovers that her
medical ninjutsu
 is unable to reverse the effects of the Yang-
Kurama
's extraction and resorts to
slicing
 open Naruto's chest and manually pumping his heart. Meanwhile,
Karin
, distraught, goes after
Sasuke
 to
heal
 him. As Karin heads towards him,
Tobi
 uses a
miniature version
 of
Hashirama
's
Sage Art Wood Release: True Several Thousand Hands
 to stop her.
 Karin evades the attacks and uses
chains
 to counter it. Tobi impales her with a wooden staff, which shoots out several branches. Karin, however, bites her arm and
heals
 herself.
Suigetsu
 then comes to Karin's aid with his
Water Gun: Two Guns
 technique.
Jūgo
 quickly follows and attempts to
grab
 Tobi, who dodges but is unable to evade
Orochimaru
, who temporarily paralyses him with a cursed seal. Leaving Sasuke,
Madara
 seals the Ten-Tails into himself and heads towards
Obito
, pausing for a moment to spit out the
Benihisago
 and
Kohaku no Jōhei
 from his mouth, which land on
Lee
 and
Guy
, who are retreating with
Tenten
. When Karin senses ominous chakra where Sasuke is located, she rushes onwards. As
Kakashi
 and Minato prepare to separate Obito and
Black Zetsu
, Yin-Kurama tells Minato to use his sensory mode. Gaara and Sakura then bring an unconscious Naruto and explain the situation to Minato. Minato tells Kakashi to deal with Obito, with Gaara volunteering to help him, while Minato prepares to
seal
 Yin-Kurama into Naruto. However, Yin-Kurama is instead accidentally sealed into Black Zetsu, who
intervenes in the process
. Madara arrives at their location, berating Black Zetsu for the delay in retrieving the
Rinnegan
.
