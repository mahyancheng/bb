"
Hate Among the Uchihas: The Last of the Clan!
" (
愚かなる弟よ　恨め、憎め!
,
Orokanaru Otōto yo Urame, Nikume!
) is episode 85 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Kisame
's would-be fatal attack is blocked by
Gama
, and
Jiraiya
 tells the two
Akatsuki
 members that cheap tricks like putting a
young woman
 under
genjutsu
 would never work on him. Standing to his feet again,
Sasuke
 tells
Naruto
 to stay out of his own fight, but is easily beaten down by
Itachi
, who tells his brother that he is still too weak and he still hasn't mustered enough hatred. Deeming it necessary to make him stronger, Itachi activated
Tsukuyomi
 and forced Sasuke to relive his parents' and other clan members deaths. As Naruto rushes forward to aid his comrade, Kisame prepared to attack him, but Jiraiya uses the
Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind
 technique to stop the two Akatsuki members.

The entire area became the oesophagus of the Mountain Toad, with Kisame's foot and sword already starting to be absorbed as Jiraiya began explaining his technique. Sasuke was absorbed into the wall, thus being saved from Itachi. Itachi instructed Kisame that it was time to flee, knowing that the only way they could survive this technique was to escape. Itachi is forced to use
Amaterasu
 to burn a hole in the toad's oesophagus, allowing them to escape; Jiraiya then
seals
 away the flames, remarking that it had to be a powerful technique to burn through and allow them to escape.

As Jiraiya and Naruto are checking on Sasuke,
Guy
 suddenly appears out of nowhere and kicks the
Sannin
 in the face with his
Dynamic Entry
. He had thought that Naruto and Jiraiya were Itachi and Kisame after using the reflection from his
forehead protector
 to check what was ahead. He had seen two figures in the dull reflection, so he had automatically assumed that Itachi and Kisame were still there. Naruto thinks back on Sasuke's defeat at Itachi's hands. He resolves to go after Itachi and Kisame for doing that to Sasuke, but is quickly shot down by a more realistic Jiraiya, who tells him that he is nowhere near Itachi and Kisame's league. Naruto learns that
Kakashi
 was also struck with the same technique Itachi used on Sasuke, and Guy mentions that they need a medical specialist to help, not only with Kakashi and Sasuke, but with
Lee
 as well. Jiraiya tells Guy the person he needed was the one whom they were searching for: the healing specialist, queen of slugs and elixirs, legendary Sannin, and failed gambler,
Tsunade
.

Trivia

When Itachi activates his Mangekyō Sharingan in order to use Amaterasu, his eyes do not change; instead, they remain as his three-tomoe regular Sharingan. This is because at the time the original episode aired,
Masashi Kishimoto
 had not yet designed the Mangekyō Sharingan.
