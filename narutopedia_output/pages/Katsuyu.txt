Katsuyu
 (
カツユ
) is a slug and the personal summon of the Fifth
Hokage

Tsunade
, and her disciple
Sakura Haruno
. Katsuyu resides in the legendary
Shikkotsu Forest
.

Background

At some point during the
Second Shinobi World War
, Katsuyu was
summoned
 to the battlefield, alongside
Gamabunta
 and
Manda
.

Personality

Katsuyu is quiet and more subservient to its master especially when compared to Manda or Gamabunta. It addresses Tsunade with the highly respectful honourific "-sama", and, in the English versions, calls her "
Mistress
" or "
Milady
". Katsuyu tends to also use honourifics like "-kun" and "-san" on other villagers. Sakura and Shizune show it considerable respect, addressing it as "Katsuyu-sama". In the English dub, it is referred to as "Lady Katsuyu". Katsuyu is also shown to have a playful side and a jovial friendship with Tsunade as seen in the
omake
 at the end of
Naruto: Shippūden

episode 118
. It tells Tsunade of the way Sakura overreacted when it fabricated a story of its difficult journey (including: the physical limitations of its slug body, falling off a rope bridge, and being attacked by villagers) in reaching Team Three during the Three Tails Arc. Tsunade comments on Sakura's naivete and they both share a chuckle at Sakura's expense.

Appearance






Katsuyu's full appearance.



Katsuyu is an enormous entity whose true size is unknown. The general size of the summoned portion of Katsuyu is easily as tall as the
largest building in Konoha
.  During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Tsunade mentioned that her and Sakura's combined capabilities are only able to summon one-tenth of the slug's actual size, which easily dwarfed neighbouring mountain ranges — being able to cover the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 when liquified.
 In fact, unlike other summons which may be multiple in number as well as vary in size, the slugs summoned by Sakura and Tsunade are all portions of the same entity.

It is predominantly white in colour with three blue streaks that run vertically down the middle and side of its body from its head and tapering off at its tail. Its optical tentacles have a slight tint of grey to them and it also has two sensory tentacles on either side of its mouth.

Abilities

Manda
.



Offensively, Katsuyu can spit acid using its
Tongue Tooth Sticky Acid
 technique, which is strong enough to melt through rock with ease. With its
Slug Great Division
, Katsuyu can divide itself into smaller clones to evade attacks or to serve small-scale functions, and is capable of quickly reforming itself if need be.

Katsuyu's clones can attach themselves to injured people, allowing its summoner to channel their chakra through it to heal the injured person; these clones also establish a sensory connection with the patients, allowing the summoner to make an assessment of their condition instantly upon contact.
 Katsuyu's clones can also telepathically share information with each other which allows the slug to serve other supplementary purposes when divided such as gathering and dispensing information.
 Katsuyu was also capable of putting Tsunade's bisected body back together, although due to Tsunade being weakened, the process took a considerable amount of time as Katsuyu needed assistance bringing the two halves of her body together before Katsuyu could rejoin her.






Katsuyu begins to deconstruct.



Furthermore, due to its genetic and physical make up, Katsuyu is extremely resistant to damage, as seen during
Pain's Assault
. Katsuyu is also able to encapsulate people into its body to protect them from physical harm — like the large-scale
Shinra Tensei
 — or put them in stasis to prevent loss of life.
 A palm-sized version of Katsuyu even survived the corrosive chakra of Naruto's
eight-tailed form
 and Nagato's
Chibaku Tensei
.
 Katsuyu's clones were fast enough to throw themselves in front of
Shizune
,
Ino
 and
Inoichi
 before the Animal Path's
rhino
 summon even managed to hit them.
 Due to its ability to divide, a summoner is able to separately summon her divisions so portions of Katsuyu can be in more than one place at any given time.
 Also due to this physical make up, the slug is able to alter its bodily form and is able to deconstruct entirely into nothing more than a pool of body fluids. This does not render it incapacitated and Katsuyu is still able to function just as it would if it were corporeal.

Katsuyu has also noted that its power is directly tied in to that of its summoner and their
Strength of a Hundred Seal
. For that reason, when Tsunade summoned the slug in her weakened condition during the Fourth Shinobi World War, the healing proceeded slowly, as not only was Katsuyu multi-tasking, but Tsunade's chakra reserves were extremely low.

Katsuyu escapes Manda's hold.



After Tsunade healed herself from what should have been a fatal attack, all three Sannin decided to use their most powerful summons and all three succeeded at the same time. Katsuyu was summoned and when the battle begun, it was constricted by Manda, but escaped using the
Slug Great Division
 technique.

The Appearance of Strange Visitors

The Appearance of Strange Visitors

In the anime, it was summoned again to deal with
Mondai
 and
Potcha
, a pair of outsiders impersonating
Might Guy
 and
Rock Lee
. In this instance it had a cold, and sneezed acid, which Mondai and Potcha, along with a clueless Naruto, were forced to anticipate and assist (although it is entirely possible that it was faking the cold in order to help Tsunade make Mondai and Potcha's lives miserable and prevent them from having the time to gather any information).

Part II

Three-Tails' Appearance

Three-Tails' Appearance

In the anime, fearing that
Shizune
's
team
 would need further assistance to seal the
Three-Tails
, Tsunade sent Katsuyu to aid them. Four of its clones appeared in time to help the sealing team by giving them an extra supply of chakra.
Ino
 and
Hinata
, who did not recognise Katsuyu, were initially alarmed, but
Sakura
 explained who it was to them.

In the anime, Tsunade sent Katsuyu to tell the
Eight Man Squad
 about the
Tsuchigumo clan
 for the mission.

Pain's Assault

Pain's Assault






Katsuyu aiding the villagers.



When Pain began attacking civilians all over
Konohagakure
, Tsunade summoned Katsuyu. She then told the giant slug to take her chakra and heal the injured all over the village. When
Pain
 used
Shinra Tensei
 to destroy Konoha, Katsuyu surrounded all the villagers to protect them from the blast and heal their injuries. When Naruto returned to Konoha, Tsunade ordered one of its smaller clones to stay in Naruto's pocket and keep him informed of Pain's abilities. Other Katsuyu clones informed the villagers of the situation, and helped facilitate communication between them;
Shikaku
 asked the clone nearest to him to have the other clones find out what they could from all the ninja who had fought Pain. After
Hinata Hyūga
 was stabbed and Naruto lost control of himself to the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
, the clones on him observed this and reported the events to all the ninja in the village. The clones on Naruto survived his transformation, and told him that he had not harmed Hinata or any of the other villagers while under the Nine-Tails' control, which greatly relieved him. When Nagato proceeded to reincarnate those he had killed, the Katsuyu clone relays to Naruto the villagers coming back to life. After Pain's defeat, Katsuyu informed Sakura, Hinata (who had just regained consciousness) and Team Guy of Naruto's victory, and tried to tell
Neji
 that Naruto did not want help, but Neji insisted that Katsuyu lead them to Naruto.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Katsuyu accompanies Tsunade and A to confront Naruto and B.



As Tsunade leaves headquarters with
A
, she apparently summons Katsuyu, who divides, with part of it going with Tsunade and part staying at headquarters to more than likely be used to keep the channel of communication between them open. When Tsunade and A confront Naruto and B, Katsuyu comments on the chakra of the
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
. Katsuyu later expresses relief when
Killer B
 intercepts the Raikage's attack on Naruto.






Katsuyu alongside Shikaku and Mabui at headquarters.



Meanwhile, back at headquarters, Katsuyu asks whether or not it would be best to alert the Raikage and Hokage of what was happening, but Shikaku states that he was appointed to handle things at headquarters while they tried to stop Naruto and B. When Katsuyu tries to inform him of what was happening with Tsunade and A, Shikaku asks for silence in order to concentrate of formulating a strategy to combat the disguised members of the
White Zetsu Army
 that had infiltrated their ranks in the dead of night. Later, when Shikaku realises that the only way to expose the imposters was to use Naruto's ability to
sense negative emotions
 that he gained through his control of the Nine-Tails,
Mabui
 states that is impossible as the Raikage would not allow Naruto to participate in the war, Katsuyu informs them that this might not be entirely impossible due to the Raikage finally allowing Naruto and B to pass. Katsuyu later relates the information of what happened, much to Mabui's disbelief.

As Tsunade who had returned to headquarters prepares to depart for the front lines after hearing the reports of the real
Madara Uchiha
 being
revived
 and slaughtering the
Fourth Division
, Katsuyu calls out to her to stop. As
Shikaku
 states that they should use the
Flying Thunder God Technique
 to transport Katsuyu instead of Tsunade, Katsuyu said that would be fine since her body could withstand being ripped to shreds by
Mabui
's
Heavenly Transfer Technique
.

Katsuyu summoned to the battlefield.



Katsuyu, in its entirety, is later summoned to Tsunade's side by the severely wounded Kage. Distressed about its master's condition, Katsuyu immediately states that it would put the bisected woman back together, but is cut off by Tsunade who tells the slug instead to first bring all the other Kage to her as there was still time to save them.

Later on, another part of Katsuyu was summoned by
Sakura Haruno
 to the battlefield, where it was pleased to learn that Sakura was finally able to complete the
Strength of a Hundred Seal
 and exclaimed that Tsunade would be glad to hear this. Sakura, however, asked Katsuyu to leave that to less pressing times and requested that it split itself up and attach its clones to the members of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, so that they could be healed. With this Katsuyu divided itself and made its way to the wounded shinobi and began transmitting the
healing chakra
.






Katsuyu watches on as the Kage prepare to head to the battlefield once again.



Back with Tsunade, Katsuyu was shocked when
Orochimaru
,
Suigetsu
, and
Karin
 arrived at their location. When the Sannin and his group made their way over to Tsunade, a wary Katsuyu prepared to
attack
 them. The slug only stood down after considering Orochimaru's promise that he meant them no harm, and contemplating their current situation. When asked why the healing was progressing so slowly despite its presence, Katsuyu noted that due to Tsunade's weakened condition, it was not operating at full power as it had to maintain the summoning, while treating the other four Kage, and piecing together Tsunade's body. Later, while keeping a watchful eye as the newcomers kept their word and healed Tsunade, Katsuyu later reported to her and the other Kage about the situation on the battlefield.

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki

Main article:
Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki

The clone of Katsuyu with Sakura later informed its summoner when the Version 1 mantle reappeared around her that it had sensed it while healing the others, noting that the shroud had never really disappeared entirely. When the
Ten-Tails
' tree form began attacking the shinobi, sapping chakra from their body, a worried Katsuyu looked on as Sakura lay on the ground. Though Sakura recovers from the ordeal and is informed by Katsuyu that the Kage were also on their way, Katsuyu later regretfully told Sakura that they could not remotely attend to
Shikamaru
 because its clones had suffered the same fate as the shinobi who had come in contact with the tree leading Sakura to rush to her comrade's aid instead. When later Sakura is joined by Tsunade, the two summon one-tenth of the real Katsuyu to the battlefield. When summoned, Katsuyu immediately deconstructed itself underneath the shinobi creating a literal recovery area where the shinobi would be able to heal themselves and continue fighting.

Trivia

The name
Katsuyu
 apparently comes from
slug
 (
蛞蝓
) in on'yomi.

The first part of Katsuyu's name:
Katsu
 (
割
), means "split" or "divide". This could be a reference to its ability to divide into many smaller bodies.

A variation of the worldwide game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" in Japan presented in the early 1640s was the "Slug, Snake, Frog" variation. In this variation, the Frog is afraid of the Snake, the Snake is afraid of the Slug, and the Slug is afraid of the Frog. This is influenced by the
Sansukumi way of thinking
 where it keeps the three objects in a deadlock. This concept was referenced and joked upon in an
omake
 of
episode 164
 of
Naruto: Shippūden
, where Katsuyu feared that with
Manda
 deceased,
Gamabunta
 and the
toads
 of
Mount Myōboku
 would now try eating it. This was also played for in episode 8 of
Rock Lee no Seishun Full Power Ninden
 where after Tsunade and Naruto summoned Katsuyu and Gamabunta, the latter swallowed the former shortly after appearing, much to Tsunade's horror.

In English translations of the series, Katsuyu is referred to with female pronouns. In the original Japanese, Katsuyu is only referred to with gender-neutral pronouns which could relate to slugs being naturally
hermaphroditic
.
