Nanafushi
 (
ナナフシ
) is a ninja from the
Land of Valleys
.

Personality

Nanafushi is very overconfident in his abilities. He was also somewhat afraid of being found out by Konoha. He seems to be proud of himself, because he declares to himself that he will certainly reveal the secrets of a strange village. Nanafushi is genuinely surprised that the kids from Konohagakure have a power that he can't resist.

Appearance

Nanafushi has a short crop of spiky brown hair and black eyes with a green-colour underneath them along with a rather pointy chin. He wears a dark long-sleeved turtleneck over which is a lilac cape, as well as grey shorts, long socks and a pair of sandals. Nanafushi also wears a red thin headband around his head.

Abilities

Nanafushi is a fairly skilled shinobi, being able to infiltrate Konohagakure without being detected. He was also capable of using the
Transformation Technique
 to fool even high-ranking shinobi, such as
Might Guy
. He showed physical endurance, surviving a long battle with
taijutsu
 masters, falling from a height and breaking walls with his body without taking serious damage.

Nanafushi defeated by Might Guy.



He was set to steal
Konoha
's secrets. He used the
Transformation Technique
 to disguise himself as Might Guy. As he entered the village, Naruto thought he was the real Might Guy and took him to
Rock Lee
's dōjō. After a few fights he received, the real Might Guy returned and fought Nanafushi, who concealed himself as Rock Lee by using the Transformation Technique again. After they carried him to
Tsunade
's office, she gave them the mission to find Nanafushi, which caused some confusion since they already had him.

Trivia

"Nanafushi" (
ナナフシ
) means "stick insect".

After Might Guy beats up Nanafushi and his true form is revealed, the green markings under his eyes disappear.
