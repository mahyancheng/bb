Summary

Tsunade
 refuses the
Konoha Council
's instructions to keep
Naruto
 under constant surveillance. Since
Akatsuki
 will inevitably come after him, it is important that he go on missions in order to get strong enough to face them. They agree, but only if one of
Danzō
's men will be added to
Team 7
 as protection. She allows it, but selects
Yamato
, a capable ninja from the Anbu as
Kakashi
's replacement and asks him to keep an eye on Danzō's choice. Meanwhile,
Sai
 eludes Naruto and
Team 10
, promising to see them later. This proves to be when the new Team 7 first meets, and he wastes no time insulting his new teammates, Naruto and
Sakura
.
