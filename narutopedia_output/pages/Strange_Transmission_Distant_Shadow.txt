Through an application of
Sakon
's
kekkei genkai
, Kabuto is able to use the techniques of anyone whose cells are integrated into his body, including even
kekkei genkai
 and
hiden
 techniques. Using Sakon's
Twin Demons Technique
, he makes a clone of the person's upper half form out of his own body, emerging from the base of the snake growing out of his torso. This clone is then able to perform any of the techniques used by its genetic source, all the while Kabuto himself is free to continue moving and fighting independently. Once generated, the clone is able to transform into others on the fly in order to access their techniques, and it can even use one person's abilities in conjunction with another's; for example, a clone of
Tayuya
 is able to cast
genjutsu
 using a bone flute
created
 by a clone of
Kimimaro
. In theory, there are no techniques that Kabuto cannot use thanks to this ability.

Trivia

The pronunciation of this technique is a corruption of the Japanese word
dīenuē
 (
ディーエヌエー
,
literally meaning:
 DNA), given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation.

Despite using Sakon's cells, the
fourth databook
 does not classify this technique as kekkei genkai.
