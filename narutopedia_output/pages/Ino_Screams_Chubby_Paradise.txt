Synopsis

Princess
Fuku
 is meeting her fiancé for the very first time. She is hesitant to appear to him in person, thinking that she looks unattractive because she is overweight as a result of bingeing on snacks to relieve stress. She hires
Ino Yamanaka
 - who looks exactly like the princess except for the one obvious difference - to take her place and win the heart of her fiancé's
Chikara
 (who resembles Elvis Presley). Ino tries to behave like a princess worthy of the man's admiration, but she finds his flamboyant displays of affection unbearable.
Naruto
, frustrated by the mission's slow progress, takes matters into his own hands by transforming into the princess himself. His interference upsets Ino and Fuku, and accidentally reveals her as the real princess. It is revealed that the prince likes chubby women, and Ino is unable to comprehend why.
