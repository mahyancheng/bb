"
Everyone's Struggle to the Death
" (
それぞれの死闘
,
Sorezore no Shitō
) is episode 67 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

The
Konoha

shinobi
 continue to defend the main border against the reanimated corpse army besieged upon them. Although the corpses are not too difficult to defeat, the sheer number of their forces makes the shinobi's tasks more arduous. Meanwhile,
Naruto
 is still engaged in combat with
Fūka
, who offers to spare his life if he gives her his body. Naruto, hanging off a roof, refuses, and thus she uses her
Lightning Release: Lightning Rod
 technique to shock Naruto and cause him to fall to his presumed death. Naruto manages to save himself using his
Shadow Clone Technique
 and tells her that he does not have time for her at the moment. She responds by using her
Earth Release: Mud Spore
 combined with her
Water Release: Snake's Mouth
 to create a mudslide that crashes into Naruto and wipes him off the roof.

Down below,
Sakura
 is trapped in a cave by
Fuen
. After touching the walls, she comes into contact with
poison moths
 that surround her body. She wakes up on the ground with Naruto leaning over her; however, "Naruto" tries to stab her with a
kunai
. As she runs away, the Naruto's split into three and one of them seemingly stabs her. Fuen then releases her genjutsu and prepares to finish off the unconscious Sakura, only for Sakura to use a
Body Replacement Technique
. Using her
Chakra Enhanced Strength
, she punches Fuen and sends her flying through a tree. She explains how she remember Fuen's use of poison before finishing off an enemy, as opposed to facing them head on, and thus prepared herself by using an
antidote
. Standing above the fallen Fuen, Sakura builds up chakra into her fist and
strikes her in the abdomen
, killing her. As Fuen cast the
Barrier Gate Five Seals Technique: Castle Closing Eight Gates
, her death causes the barriers around Konoha to recede.

In
Tsunade
's office,
Shikamaru
 tells her that he cannot come up with a countermeasure without being on the front lines. Coming across
Ino
, the pair head to the main gates, where they overhear
Chōji
 telling the others that whoever defeated the barrier caster had done their job, and now it was time to do theirs. After asking everyone if they had enough
chakra
, Shikamaru formulates a strategy to defeat the reanimated corpses quickly.

Back at the power station,
Kitane
 traps
Asuma
 with his
Lightning Release: Thunder Binding
 in order to prevent Asuma's interference without killing him. Asuma is unable to get out of the lightning trap due to the electricity that flows through the walls. In another part of the village,
Yamato
 is avoiding being struck by
Fudō
. Using his
Rock Armour
, Fudō tries to strike Yamato, only for Yamato to keep evading. Yamato uses his
Earth Release: Earth Flow Spears
 to create spikes to skewer Fudō, but the latter merely punches them away. Using Fudō to soften the terrain, Yamato then uses his
Water Release: Tearing Torrent
 to create a powerful current of water that causes the soft ground beneath Fudō to swallow him up. As he struggles to get free, Yamato uses his
Wood Release: Tree Bind Flourishing Burial
 to constrict and squeeze Fudō to death.

At the main gate, Shikamaru has Chōji use his
Multi-Size Technique
 followed by his
Human Bullet Tank
 technique to roll over and destroy some of the reanimated corpses. He then has
Lee
 use his
taijutsu
 to create a powerful whirlwind that sucks in the corpses, and prepares to have
Kiba
 and
Akamaru
 use their
Fang Passing Fang
 to take out the rest. However, to their surprise, the corpses all turn into dust, as Fudō, their caster, had just been killed.

On the outskirts of the village,
Furido
 tells
Sora
 that everyone in Konoha must die as they are all loyal to their king, the
Hokage
. Sora puts his
Chakra Enhanced Triple-Bladed Claw
 against Furido's throat in an attempt to protect the village, but Furido dodges the move and uses his cane to pull Sora down to ground level. Berating Sora for showing weakness towards Konoha for showing him compassion, he proceeds to beat Sora with his cane.

Trivia

second
Naruto: Shippūden
 movie
 is seen on one of the buildings in Konoha.
