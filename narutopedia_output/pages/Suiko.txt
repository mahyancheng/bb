Suiko
 (
水虎
) was a
shinobi
 from the
Takumi Village
 and a member of the
Four Celestial Symbols Men
.

Personality

Like many minor villains in Part I, Suiko was overconfident about the power his shield  provided, and believed nothing could breach its defences. This presumption led to his death at the hands of
Gaara
 who managed to tear through it. Like all members in his team, Suiko was single-minded about his goals, using any method he thought necessary to achieve them.

Appearance






Suiko and his armour.



Suiko was by far the largest of his group. A broadly built man, he wore a purple coat over which he wore his armour which was designed with a silver tiger-like head breastplate and a pair of dark blue pauldrons. His eyes had small black pupils and wavy brown hair with a small beard. He wore a type of
chakra
 absorbing armour called
Infinite Armour
 and carried a
mace
 around with him as a weapon.

Abilities






Suiko using a mace.



Suiko had immense physical strength, able to swing his giant mace with great speed and power. He was in possession of the
Infinite Armour
 which granted him the ability to absorb the
chakra
 of anyone who tried to attack him with both
ninjutsu
 and
taijutsu
, as well giving him a natural defence, durable enough to withstand a direct kick delivered by
Rock Lee
. He was strong enough to take on
Naruto Uzumaki
, Rock Lee and
Gaara
 simultaneously for a short amount of time. He was also very important for the strategy of the
Four Celestial Symbols Men
, more precisely, was tasked to hold Gaara up for the time the rest of his team needed to prepare the
Ninja Tools Barrier: Reverse Fish Scales Formation
 and did this with bravery. He was also skilled in
bukijutsu
, wielding a flail which could double as a mace.

Part I

Sunagakure Support Mission

He and his group abducted
Matsuri
,
Gaara
's student, to get access to Gaara's
Shukaku
 powers to revive
Seimei
, Takumi Village's founder. He injured
Rock Lee
 at his entering in their battle with Gaara. With his armour protecting him for the most part Suiko and Gaara, another defensive expert, were engaged in a stand-off as neither could harm the other until he was eventually overpowered and impaled by Gaara's
Ultimately Hard Absolute Attack: Spear of Shukaku
.

Trivia

His name, meaning "Water Tiger" comes from
Byakko
, the White Tiger of the West. It is also a
type of water goblin
 often mistaken for a
kappa
.
