After Kandachi performs the necessary hand seals, the Conch King opens its shell and releases a mist that puts the opponent under a
genjutsu
. In the genjutsu, the Conch King licks the opponent until they're frozen, which results in the opponent being overcome with fear and going into a mental breakdown in a matter of time. The power of the genjutsu was greatly increased by the magnetic forces of the trees surrounding the swamp they were in.
