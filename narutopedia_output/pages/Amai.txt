Amai
 (
アマイ
) is a
medical-nin
 from
Kumogakure
.

Background

On a mission with the
Fourth Raikage
 and his comrades,
Karai
 was incapacitated and taken back to Amai for treatment. Though his group had successfully acquired the
scroll
, he was unable to
treat
 Karai. While in town, he saw
Tsunade
 and reported this to the Raikage. Though Karai objected to this, the Raikage noted that he would have Tsunade heal him. When they approached Tsunade, Amai beseeched Tsunade to heal his comrade despite her refusal due to the bad blood between the two nations. He would later aid
Shizune
 during the procedure to remove the
Exploding Insect
 from his chest cavity.

Personality

Amai is a dutiful shinobi, willing to do what he can to help and improve his own ability, but at the same time aware of his limitations. He is less cautious of other nations than his countrymen, willing to ask Tsunade for help. He is seemingly considered quite soft by Karai.

Appearance

Amai is a young man with brown hair, a long fringe hanging over his white
forehead protector
 and large, dark eyes. He wears the standard uniform of Kumogakure with a closed collar and no sleeves.

Abilities

Amai is a competent medical-nin, able to use the
Mystical Palm Technique
 and could even use it to perform haemostasis to control bleeding during his comrade's surgery.

Trivia

"Amai" (
甘い
) literally means "sweet".
