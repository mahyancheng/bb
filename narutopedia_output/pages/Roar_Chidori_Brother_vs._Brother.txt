Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Naruto
 opens the door and finds himself face to face with
Itachi
, he realises that he looks just like
Sasuke
 and has the
Sharingan
 eyes as well. Meanwhile, Sasuke is running through the streets, desperate to find Itachi. While running, he reminisces on his past. When he was younger, Sasuke had always looked up to his brother. One morning, he had asked Itachi to help him with his
shuriken training
, only for Itachi to brush him off. Sasuke then asked
his father
 how come Itachi never had time for him. His father told Sasuke that Itachi was very closed off and distant, and that not even he knew his own son very well.
Sasuke's mother
 then gave Sasuke his lunch, and Sasuke headed off to the Academy.

On the way there, he came across
a relative of his
, who mentioned that by his age, Itachi had already awakened his Sharingan and had become a
genin
. Sasuke was initially put down, but his uncle
Teyaki
 assured him that in time, he would be a great shinobi as well, for he was an Uchiha like his brother. After school, Sasuke rushed home, fearing he was late as the sun had already set. Sasuke then noticed the bodies of his relatives littered across the streets, with blood,
shuriken
 and
kunai
 on the walls and doors. Fearful, Sasuke rushed home, only to find his parents dead. Realising it was Itachi who was responsible, Sasuke demanded to know why he had slaughtered their entire clan. Itachi claimed that he had murdered everyone to test his strength. Sasuke ran outside and begged to live, to which Itachi stated that he was not even worth killing. He then told Sasuke to live the rest of his life with hatred and vengeance towards him.

Back in the present, as
Kisame
 and Itachi contemplate how best to carry Naruto, Sasuke arrives. Kisame is shocked at seeing Sasuke, not only because he looks similar to Itachi, but because he too possesses the Sharingan. Itachi tells him that Sasuke is his younger brother, which Kisame finds funny as he had believed that Itachi had murdered every single Uchiha. Sasuke tells Itachi that he has been living this entire time with hatred in his heart, his only purpose in life to kill Itachi. Sasuke then rushes at Itachi with his
Chidori
. Uninterested in their quarrel, Itachi easily stops the attack. To try and help Sasuke, Naruto uses the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
's
chakra
 in an attempt to summon a
toad
, though Kisame uses his
blade
 to absorb and devour the chakra. As Kisame prepares to attack Naruto,
a toad
 arrives to block the would-be attack, followed by
Jiraiya
.
