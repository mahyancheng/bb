"
Power - Episode Final
" (
「力-Chikara-」episode Final
) is episode 295 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Absorbing the power within the
Ama no Hoko
, the
Nine-Tailed Naruto Clone
 mutated into a hydra-tailed version of the Nine-Tails while seemingly killing
Disonasu
. Overpowered, Naruto almost gave in to the Nine-Tails' offer for power when Minato's voice urges the boy to control the tailed beast as Naruto is engulfed in
an incomplete six-tailed chakra cloak in the Nine-Tails' image
. Over time, as he starts to lose against the clone, the Nine-Tails starts to take control over Naruto's body and assumes a seven-tailed
jinchūriki
 state with
Yamato
 trying to restrain it. At the same time, though followed by
Kakashi Hatake
,
Kabuto Yakushi
 manages to take his leave in midst of the ensuing chaos.
Dokku
 and
Shiseru
 decide to deactivate the Ama no Hoko and say good-bye to the children. On their way there, they confess their love for each other and decide to get married if they survive before portions of the ground start to sink, with Dokku keeping Shiseru from falling. By that time,
Miina
 is able to get through to Naruto, regaining control as he assumed a
new form
 to save Shiseru after telling Dokku to go forward and stop the Ama no Hoko.

Dokku recalls the tune Miina hummed to change the sounds in the
Saezuri
 to deactivate the tower, and Naruto uses his new power to destroy his clone. Ama no Hoko recedes into the ground as the sun rises. Elsewhere, Kabuto finds Disonasu, who has fled the scene. Disonasu begs for his life, but Kabuto summons the
Tonika Village Head
, who promptly kills him. As the village head watches Dokku reunite with Shiseru and the orphans in the distance, the
Impure World Reincarnation
 is dispelled and his body returns to dust. With the threat eliminated, Naruto, and his allies celebrate with Dokku, Shiseru, and the orphans. Some time later, Naruto, Sakura, and Sai receive a letter, photographs, and drawings from Dokku and the orphans, thanking them for their heroism, and explaining what has happened since the battle: the Saezuri was resealed in
the Hole
 and the surviving villagers performed a funeral ceremony of the victims of the
Tonika Village
 massacre. He eventually married Shiseru and adopted the orphans; with the power of the Hole sealed away, Miina's hair also gradually turned black. Following the end credits, Kabuto is seen standing amidst coffins containing the reincarnated
Akatsuki
, the former
Five Kage
, and the late
jinchūriki
, undergoing a painful transformation. After shedding his skin, Kabuto dons his maroon snake cloak and glasses, then walks away and smiles as a white serpent emerges from beneath his cloak.

Trivia

The DVD version of this episode is a director's cut, which differs significantly from the original TV broadcast version. When originally broadcast, the scenes immediately following the final battle were re-edited and cut down for time, with the ending credits and theme playing over the footage.

The director's cut includes an extended epilogue in which Naruto, Sakura, and Sai receive a letter and photographs from Dokku, and a post-credits tease in which Kabuto is seen transforming from his appearance during the
Power arc
 to his appearance in the
Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown
.
