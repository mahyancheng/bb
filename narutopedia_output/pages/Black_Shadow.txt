True to his namesake, Black Shadow possessed numerous shadow-based abilities. For example, he could employ darkness to restrain a person which apparently so powerful that no mortal was able to escape it. He could also summon a large number of shadow ninja for combat assistance. Another notable abilities of Black Shadow were shooting flying spikes that home in on their foe, creating wooden tentacles that burst from the ground through impaling his tail, splitting into smaller forms (be it a number of his humanoid forms or a pack of fast and agile wolf-like creatures that must be destroyed in order to force him to reform), teleporting, performing the
Bringer-of-Darkness Technique
, and generating a crystalline near-impregnable barrier to block a section of Tree Felling Village's cave.

He also appeared to have immense physical strength, as one slash from his paw sent Naruto flying back several feet and in another case, he created several fissures through direct contact with the ground.
