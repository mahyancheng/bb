This technique requires special
umbrellas
 that have been spring-loaded with hundreds of
senbon
. The user opens several of these umbrellas and spins them into the air. As they spin, they release the combined thousands of senbon, which the user controls with their
chakra
. The user directs the senbon to fall upon the target, striking them all over like rain; to control so many senbon at once requires a great deal of training. Because of how many senbon there are, evading all of them is almost impossible. Furthermore, each senbon is supposed to be able to penetrate a five millimetre-thick steel plate.
 The senbon can also be dipped in
poison
 to increase their lethality.
 Despite all this,
Gaara
's
Shield of Sand
 completely protected him from damage.

Trivia

In
Naruto Mobile
, Genma Shiranui and Kin Tsuchi use this technique without using umbrellas. They just jump into the air and shower the enemy with a hail of senbon.
