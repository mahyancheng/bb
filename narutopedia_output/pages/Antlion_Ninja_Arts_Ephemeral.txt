This article is about the anime-only kinjutsu used by Kagerō. For the genjutsu used by Itachi Uchiha, see

. For other uses, see
Utakata (disambiguation)
.

The user creates four firefly-like chakra wings and fires out a powerful energy blast from them. Kagerō claims that this technique can be used only once in a lifetime since it consumes so much chakra that the user is left in a near-death state after performing it. During the duration of this technique, the user can also transport themselves instantaneously using a technique that is similar to
teleportation
.
