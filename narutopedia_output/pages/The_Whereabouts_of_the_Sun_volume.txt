Chapter 5

"
Target
" (
目標
,
Tāgetto
)

In a flashback during the three years away from
Konohagakure
,
Boruto
 practises his
kenjutsu
. He takes a break with
Sasuke
 and asks about his progression. Sasuke acknowledges that he taught Boruto nearly everything he knows, and doesn't think there’s anything left to teach him, due to the boy's talent for being a quick learner. Sasuke compares Boruto's determination to
Naruto
's and finally understood why
Sarada
 asked him to protect Boruto, trusting that he and Sarada are the only ones who can resolve whatever is going on. At a later instance, Sasuke and Boruto fought
Code
 and his
Claw Grimes
, Sasuke slashing Code's left eye. Boruto wished to aid Sasuke, but he ordered Boruto to run, certain they were currently unable to defeat Code. He told Boruto to survive, build on what he taught him, and watch over Sarada, before channelling
Lightning Release
 through his sword and engaging the enemy. Boruto later returned to find several Claw Grime defeated, Sasuke stuck on a tree, and collecting his master's sword.
 In the present,
Konohamaru
 finds
Team 10
 by a tree that grew around
Moegi
, who was protecting a mother and child when she was bitten. Her students and Konohamaru vow to find a way to release her.
Matsuri
 can sense their sadness and rage.
Jura
 finds it to be proof of her individual awareness being stimulated, despite all of them being the same biological entity, who wishes to consume
Ōtsutsuki
.
Mamushi
 and
Hidari
 discuss the origin of their feelings. Jura wishes to devour Naruto, attributing the desire to eat a non-Ōtsutsuki to their differing evolution as God Trees.
Ada

watches
 them, as Jura instructs the others to listen to their inner desires to find personal targets. Matsuri determines Konohamaru is hers. Hidari asks Jura what they are. Jura considers it a reasonable, but ultimately meaningless question, placing more importance in what they do instead of what they are, finding action to be the cornerstone of their identities. Ada speculates that these God Trees were created by the chakra of those eaten by the Claw Grimes. Bug's God Tree perceives her watching them, and declares her to be his target, startling her during her meal with
Daemon
. Hidari declares his target is Sarada, Jura approving it.
Sumire
 discusses Boruto's return with
Amado
. Recalling his objective, Sumire asks if Boruto's death doesn't run counter to restoring his daughter. Amado understands her question and points out how curious it is that no one knows who modified
Kawaki
's body. He recognises his own work in Kawaki, as well as the
Kāma
 containing
Akebi
's information. This physical evidence contradicts his memory of events, leading him to believe his memory was tampered with. As Kawaki is the one with Akebi's information, he is not concerned with Boruto. Watching the conversation,
Sai
 asks
Shikamaru
's opinion on it. Sumire informs Sarada of Amado's awareness of his memory being changed. Boruto approaches them, telling him Sasuke doubted his own memories to save him because of Sarada. She hugs him, telling him he's late and calling him an idiot. Boruto apologises and says he's home.

Chapter 6

"
Three Years
" (
3年
,
3-Nen
)

Shikamaru
 has a meeting with
Koharu
 and
Homura
, who question him about
Boruto
's return. Shikamaru has no idea on his motives, but points out that Boruto was essential to drive
Code
 back. Homura opines that Boruto should still be eliminated, to restore
Konoha
's honour over the attempt on
Kawaki
, and to placate the
daimyō
, who are responsible for determining the village's budget. Koharu asks Shikamaru to accept the title of
Hokage
 permanently, pointing out that three years is the period he himself suggested at first, as not doing so weakens his position in the
Land of Fire
 and with the other villages. He merely says he'll report again. In his office, Shikamaru asks
Ino
 to personally deliver him old mission logs, tapping his temple. After leaving, Ino establishes
telepathic contact
, Shikamaru explaining he wants no log from the sensor team, and no way for
Ada
,
Amado
, or Kawaki to listen in, only the two of them should participate. Ino is concerned by such a violation of regulation. He has a request for her. Ada informs Kawaki on the development of the sentient
God Trees
, including that one of them is after
Naruto
.
 He questions why they'd be after Naruto, but is confident he can eliminate them.
Daemon
 points out that while no one would believe Boruto and
Sasuke
 over being criminals, if the God Trees come after Naruto, that's a thread others can pull to expose his lie about Boruto having killed Naruto. Ada admonishes Daemon. Kawaki leaves, refusing to explain himself, telling Ada to
spy
 on him if she wants to keep an eye on him. Kawaki is bothered by
Mitsuki
's watching him and Ada, who retorts it's his mission, and to complain with Shikamaru if he wishes.
Sarada
 is embarrassed by her outburst of emotion, unsure what to ask Boruto first.
Sumire
 breaks the ice. Boruto is relieved they're both ok. Sumire is worried if Boruto should linger, he explains that he's
suppressing his chakra
, so only Kawaki should eventually notice him, giving him a little time. He reveals that Sasuke was absorbed by the
Ten-Tails
. Kawaki notices Boruto's presence, Mitsuki prepares a
snake
. Boruto blames himself, as Sasuke sacrificed himself so Boruto could get away. Sumire asks why the
Claw Grime
 are attacking those who aren't
Ōtsutsuki
. Boruto explains the usual life cycle of a Ten-Tails, which only turn into God Trees upon consuming an Ōtsutsuki, but something changed. Mitsuki contacts Shikamaru about Boruto's presence, leading them to realise Boruto can erase his chakra like Kawaki. Mitsuki wants Ada to pinpoint Boruto's location. Shikamaru asks about Kawaki. Mitsuki knocked him out by having a snake bite him, pointing out that Boruto can also sense Kawaki, making him unsuitable to pursue Boruto. Boruto speculates that the reason the God Trees already evolved is because of the Claw Grimes. Code isn't an Ōtsutsuki, but his
Kāma
 is an aspect of
Isshiki
's chakra. Shikamaru contacts Boruto telepathically through Ino, telling him not to let it show. Boruto is surprised and asks why he should trust him, Shikamaru warns him he's about to have company. Mitsuki restrains him with a snake and attacks. Sasuke's
sword
 unsheathes itself, and Boruto
teleports
 to it. Sarada attempts to calm Mitsuki, but he carries on attacking. Boruto channels
Lightning Release: Purple Electricity
 through the sword, cutting through Mitsuki's ethereal
Sage Mode
 snakes. He attempts an
attack from below
, but Boruto flies out of his reach. Boruto promises Sarada to rescue everyone turned into trees and retreats, before telling her he'll be back. He complains to Shikamaru he could have made it so they could talk uninterrupted, but Shikamaru points there's only so much he can do without exposing himself. He says he wants Boruto's help, and asks if he's Boruto Uzumaki. His learning that Amado is considering his own memories were fabricated makes things make sense when flipping Boruto's and Kawaki's situations. Boruto lands outside Kawaki's sensing range, but still in Ino's communication range. Boruto tells Shikamaru he has a loose end to tie up, aware he'll have to be a bit rough with Mitsuki, who is coming after him.

Chapter 7

"
The Whereabouts of the Sun
" (
太陽の行方
,
Taiyō no Yukue
)

Mitsuki
 ponders on the importance of the "sun" to him as the "moon". He attacks
Boruto
 with
chakra snakes
, deflecting Boruto's
shuriken
. Boruto avoids them,
teleporting
 to his shuriken, and asks about
Kawaki
, having expected him to have given chase. Mitsuki feels there's no point in answering as he's the one there.
Shikamaru

explains
 that Mitsuki
knocked out
 Kawaki, so Boruto couldn't detect his approach. Mitsuki believes Boruto is much stronger than
Code
 at the moment, and therefore much stronger than Kawaki. Boruto adds that by that logic, Mitsuki is no match for him either deeming their fight pointless. Mitsuki explains he came alone so he wouldn't defer to Kawaki, intending to let loose, but doesn't elaborate. He attacks Boruto with
snake clones
, significantly damaging the environment, which Boruto points out, in addition of stressing that more isn't always better. Mitsuki just wants him to die over being the root of the problem. Boruto concedes he's to blame, but can't die over unfinished business, so he makes
short work
 of Mitsuki's clones. Mitsuki attacks with
Lightning Release
, which Boruto cancels out with
his own
, allowing him to close in and have his
sword
 to Mitsuki's neck.
 Mitsuki exits
Sage Mode
, telling him to finish it. Boruto explains that what Mitsuki is feeling isn't that he's prepare to die, but that he lost hope, no longer trusting what he wants to believe in. Mitsuki is confused. Boruto continues, elaborating that Kawaki's sun no longer shines on him. Shikamaru asks if
Ino
 can extend her jutsu to include Mitsuki to get all his words, but she refuses, as it would give him access to their conversation. Mitsuki accuses Boruto of being a grudge-bearing traitor, and Boruto sheathes his sword, claiming he does know where Mitsuki's sun is, referring to himself as it. Incredulous and outraged, Mitsuki wraps a
snake
 around Boruto, ready to have it bite him. Boruto is unconcerned, asking why the snake hasn't bitten him yet. Mitsuki himself questions why Boruto hasn't freed himself yet. Boruto speculates that Mitsuki has realised Kawaki isn't his sun a while ago, that no matter how close he stays to Kawaki, he won't shine on him. Mitsuki is distraught. Boruto tells him he knows it's true, because he's the only one who gets to decide what it takes to be his sun. Mitsuki retracts his snake, asking who Boruto is. Boruto just wants to clear a misunderstanding with Kawaki. He asks why Boruto killed
Naruto
, and Boruto reveals that both Naruto and
Hinata
 are alive. Turning around to leave, he considers Mitsuki capable of shining on his own, but to come find him anytime if he does want a sun. Ino is shocked that Naruto is alive, Shikamaru asks Boruto to go somewhere private so they can resume talking. Kawaki wakes up at
Ada
 and
Daemon
's, and asks about Mitsuki. Shikamaru summarises the situation, but Boruto tells him not to bother trying to learn about
Omnipotence
, having forgotten about the many times
Sarada
 and
Sumire
 told him about it. The very concept of it fades from one's memory. Boruto does commend Shikamaru of figuring it out on his own. Shikamaru asks how to reverse it, but Boruto says they can't, and doing it wouldn't resolve the issues between him and Kawaki. Kawaki
sealed
 Naruto away to protect him, so he has to have motive to unseal him himself, if they rescue Naruto, Kawaki would just seal him again. Shikamaru believes that in Boruto's situation, he'd want to rescue Naruto and kill Kawaki. Boruto denies wanting to kill Kawaki, settling for slugging and making up with him. Boruto will have to continue being hunted, and Shikamaru wants to avoid Kawaki feeling cornered, so they can't expose him yet until they are ready. Boruto is in agreement. Elsewhere,
Jura
 reads several books, with
Hidari
 by his side, fascinated by the fact that the more he learns, the more he becomes aware of his own ignorance. However, none of the books have the answers to his questions, so he decides to go visit Naruto.

Chapter 8

"
It Doesn't Matter
" (
どうでもいい
話
,
Dō demo ī Hanashi
)

Ada

observes

Boruto
's talk with
Mitsuki
, being flustered by Boruto's attitude.
Kawaki
 hurries her to find Boruto by tracking Mitsuki. He ignores
Delta
's admonishing of his rudeness to Ada. Ada gives Mitsuki's position as around 20 kilometres south of the main gate. Kawaki flies off, followed by Delta, who Ada asks to look after Kawaki. She assures Kawaki she'll kill him the moment Ada loses interest him, he merely says he'll leave on his own when his goals are met. Boruto explains to
Shikamaru
 how the
self-aware God Trees
 work, and answers Shikamaru's question about those who become trees after being eaten by the
Claw Grime
. Shikamaru receives a report from an in-coming
connection
 from Kawaki, and confirms with
Ino
 that the connections are independent before accepting it. Kawaki reports he's going after Boruto based on Ada's intel. Shikamaru discreetly warns Boruto, and tries to caution Kawaki into waiting for back-up, but he's not waiting. Boruto
leaves
. As they approach the location, Kawaki stops, noting he can't sense Boruto, who likewise wouldn't sense him until he was close enough. Delta just finds him unlucky. Mitsuki joins Ada and
Daemon
, and they discuss their relationship with Kawaki.
 Despite knowing it's a false emotion, Mitsuki thanks her for showing him what loves feels like. He feels there's much he doesn't understand or care about over being an artificial human, including himself. However, now he knows he has to assert himself not to lose sight of that the sun is for him. He wonders if he and Ada are similar, not knowing why they love Kawaki. She wonders if he's saying she just loves being in love. He apologises in case he's being presumptuous. Ada finds their conversation dramatic, and wants to have a talk with Boruto soon. A Claw Grime approaches
Konoha
,
Jura
 and
Hidari
 leaping through it. Ino finds it hard to believe Boruto, but Shikamaru orders her to keep quiet about it. Shikamaru receives the report of two intruders, one of them matching
Sasuke
's chakra signature.
Sarada
 and
Sumire
 also receive the report. Shikamaru gives evacuation orders, Ada contacts him to let him know that the intruders are
Ten-Tails
, apologising for not reporting them earlier. Jura and Hidari make short work the guards. Jura is excited to run into a bookstore. Kawaki and Delta arrive, attacking Hidari. Kawaki
escapes
 Jura's binding, but Jura's attack breaks through his
body modifications
, telling him to stay put as he's not ready to eat him yet. Delta goes to check on Kawaki, while Jura believes he has sensed
Naruto
, explaining to Hidari that as an incarnation of a
tailed beast
, he can detect the tailed beast chakra in Naruto. Sarada recalls Boruto's explanation of what happened to Sasuke and wonders who arrived.
Team 10
 and
Himawari
 mobilise. The God Trees intercept them, Jura is confused by finding Himawari instead of Naruto.
