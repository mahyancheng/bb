 Ino contacts Shikamaru and informs him that Shikadai has been captured by Amado, who strapped a bomb to his neck. Moegi returns with lunch, and is startled by Shikadai's capture. She restrains Amado with
Earth Release
, and backup arrives. Amado detonates a bomb like the one on Shikadai on a tree branch with a voice command, and reveals the one on Shikadai is set to explode in 48 hours. Under
Sai
's order, Moegi releases her jutsu. Amado apologises for his drastic measures, but stresses that time is critical and requires an audience with Shikamaru. Shikamaru talks to him through Ino's jutsu. Amado wants to talk to Shikamaru because he has decision-making authority if the
Hokage
 is unavailable, which he believes to be the case, knowing of Naruto's loss to
Jigen
. Shikamaru takes this knowledge as proof of Amado's Kara membership. He asks Ino to connect the others into the conversation, and reveals to Amado that Naruto has been recovered. Kawaki confirms Amado's identity. Amado reveals his wish to defect to Konoha, in exchange for providing intel on Kara, Jigen, the
Ten-Tails
, and the
Ōtsutsuki

Koji meets with Jigen, who asks for a mission report. Amado gets a rise out of Shikamaru before he is interrogated, and Naruto orders him to talk. Kawaki tells
Boruto
 and
Sumire
 of Amado's role in Kara, and that Jigen has never granted him leave. Katasuke expresses interest in having Amado's expertise at his disposal if his defection is approved, as it would beneficial to Kawaki. Naruto wants Amado to share some of his intel to see if it's worth it, and promises him not to use dirty tricks like Amado did. Amado agrees to it, but his glasses begin beeping. He asks Shikamaru to position them, and they begin a transmission of Jigen and Koji's meeting. Amado explains Koji is his ally. Their discussion reveals that Koji and Amado were responsible for the airship crash which allowed Kawaki to escape. Jigen wants to know why they betrayed him, and Koji attacks. Jigen evades him and pierces Koji with chakra rods, but it's only a
shadow clone
. Koji explains he was created to kill him.
