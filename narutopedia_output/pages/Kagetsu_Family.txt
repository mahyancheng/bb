The
Kagetsu Family
 hail from Motoyoshi Village within the
Land of Fire
. They were originally ordinary herb-sellers that, though poor, lived happy lives filled with laughter. When they discovered that the herbs growing in the surrounding mountainside were valuable, the family became rich.
 They also became serious and laughter disappeared from their lives.
Tōbei Kagetsu
, the head of the clan, fakes his death in an elaborate attempt to remind his children to smile and laugh again.

Trivia

The family's name means "flowers and the moon", and is also an
archaism
 for "refined leisure" or "elegant pastime".
