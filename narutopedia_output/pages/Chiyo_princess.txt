This article is about the anime-only character. For the Sunagakure elder, see
Chiyo

Chiyo
 (
千代
,
Chiyo
) is the daughter of the
daimyō
 of the
Land of This
.

Background






Chiyo with her father and Shū watching the eating contest.



Chiyo attended the eating contest alongside
Shū
 and her father. After, she witnessed
Tatewaki
's harsh training methods and scolds him for mistreating Shū.

The next day, Chiyo woke
Naruto
, who disguised as Shū, and notified him of breakfast's start and later takes literature classes with Naruto. Chiyo watched Naruto train with Tatewaki and was quick to notice his strange skills. Realising Naruto was only pretending to be Shū, she held a weapon to his neck and threatened him, asking where the real Shū was. However, after using a
smoke bomb
, Naruto was able to escape. She found Naruto once again, but was unable to fight him due to the
Akatsuki
's invasion. She was saved by Tatewaki and protected by Naruto during that time, and at the invasion's end, was able to escape to the
Land of That
 with Shū where his father welcomed her into their home.

Presently, Chiyo was travelling with Shū.

Personality






Chiyo tells Tatewaki to stop the training.



Chiyo is shown to be a polite and caring person, frequently referring to Shū with the suffix "-sama" and showing concern for his well-being, physical and emotional, as she later reprimands Tatewaki for his training methods, which she called too strict. Aside from that, Chiyo, alongside her father, is shown to be impressed by the final contestants as they struggled to finish their portions in the last part of the eating contest.

While seldom shown, Chiyo could also be fierce and decisive, as seen when she threatened Naruto after Tatewaki caught him impersonating Shū.

Appearance

Chiyo has brown eyes and long curled brown hair with a red ribbon. While reminiscent of the Hime hair-style, she also kept two bangs framing her face that are curled up in the ends. She wears a pink kimono with a light pink sleevless haori with purple trimmings and an red and blue obi with a yellow cord around the waist.

Abilities






Chiyo wielding a naginata.



While not explicitly shown, Chiyo was confident in the use of a
naginata
, certain that she could cut off "an arm or leg or two" of a cornered
shinobi
 like Naruto. However, perhaps due to her status, she showed very little experience in stressful situations, falling on her butt after being startled by a
smoke bomb
.

Trivia

Her name being Chiyo and nearly getting killed by one of
Sasori
's
puppets
 is a reflection to Sasori going to fight his grandmother Chiyo in the future.
