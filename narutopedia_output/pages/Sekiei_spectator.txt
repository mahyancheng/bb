This article is about the shinobi. For the Fabrication, see
Sekiei
.

Sekiei
 (
セキエイ
,
Sekiei
) was one of the
Kumo spectators
 who attended the
Chūnin Exams
' final round.

Personality

Sekiei was shown to be an opportunist, using the chaos created by the
Konoha Crush
 to obtain the
Byakugan
. He had proposed to his
partner
 that he should kill Hinata Hyūga in order to take her Byakugan back to
Kumogakure
, meaning that he had no moral qualms about killing the young
genin
. He also proved to be a cautious individual, not allowing his opponents the chance to catch him by laying a number of traps, as well as hinder their movements during combat, even if that opponent were much younger than himself and a genin.

Appearance

Sekiei had short brown hair that framed his face and dark eyes. He wore a grey suit underneath the old-style
flak jacket
 of his village and wore his
forehead protector
 like a bandanna. He also wore a sash around his waist and a pair of brown gloves.

Abilities

Sekiei was a competent shinobi, capable of escaping
Konohagakure
, albeit in the middle of a great battle, with a prisoner. He was very analytical, noticing that
Neji Hyūga
 was mainly a
taijutsu
 type fighter, and used a series of techniques to bind him, thus disabling his techniques.

Most of Sekiei's battle tactics revolved around his use of the
earth nature
 and he used this in several ways to combat his foes, from laying skilful traps that reshaped itself, to direct combat with large enduring earth techniques and more subtle
clones
 for diversions.

Part I

Konoha Crush

Main article:
Konoha Crush

When the
Suna
 and
Oto
 ninja attacked, Sekiei and his
partner
 took advantage of the ensuing mayhem to kidnap an unconscious
Hinata Hyūga
. Their purpose was to learn the secrets behind the Byakugan. They were later pursued by Neji Hyūga,
Kiba Inuzuka
,
Akamaru
, and
Tenten
 at the behest of the
Hyūga Elder
, who was unsuccessful in stopping the pair earlier. Despite managing to delay the pursuing genin with a
trap
, Neji, Kiba, and Akamaru eventually caught up with the two while Tenten remained behind. When Neji began fighting him, he was quickly overpowered. His escape, however, was halted long enough for
Hiashi Hyūga
 to arrive and intervene, easily defeating Sekiei and rescuing Hinata.

Trivia

"Sekiei" (
石英
) means "quartz".

Even though they tried to steal one of Konohagakure's most valuable kekkei genkai, they were not ordered to do so by Kumogakure but seemingly acted on their own initiatives.

In the
Naruto Collectible Card Game
, his name is Mikage while Sekiei belongs to
