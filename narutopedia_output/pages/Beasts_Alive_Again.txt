"
Beasts! Alive Again!
" (
蘇る獣たち
,
Yomigaeru Kemono-tachi
) is episode 28 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Team Guy
 continues to fight with their
clones
, and
Guy
 notices that there seems to be no more noise emanating from the
Akatsuki
 hideout.
Neji
 uses his
Byakugan
 and verifies to the team that
Sakura
 and
Chiyo
 have managed to defeat
Sasori
. However, because the clones still exist, Neji theorises that perhaps it must have been
Deidara
 who cast the jutsu, although he also adds the possibility that even if the caster is defeated, the jutsu will still continue.

Back in the cave, Sakura heads to the exit to the cave as Chiyo collapses, due to the poison in her system. Having no more antidote on her, she tells Chiyo that they should rush back to
Sunagakure
, where she will send a request to
Konoha
 to send her the materials she needs to make more antidote. Chiyo, however, does not wish to return yet, as she believes she has not finished with her duty yet.

Outside,
Naruto
 and
Kakashi
 continue to pursue Deidara, the latter now wielding his
Mangekyō Sharingan
. Naruto tells Kakashi that even his newfound Sharingan technique does not work, he himself will find a way to defeat Deidara. Meanwhile, Team Guy continues to fight their clones, although they get beaten as their clones seem stronger. Neji tells them that the clones have not gotten stronger, but that they have gotten weaker. Since they are of flesh and blood, they can get tired and exhausted, but the clones have no such drawbacks.
Lee
, however, theorises that since the clones maintain the exact same level of strength as they had the moment they ripped off the seals, then they would simply need to be stronger than they were then.
Tenten
 finds the idea of gaining extra strength in a short time ludicrous, but Lee recalls back to their training days, where their team motto was to be stronger than they were yesterday. Lee tells them that his own personal credo is to be stronger than he was a minute ago, and manages to use
Youth Full Power
 to defeat his clone. Tenten uses
Manipulated Tools: Heavenly Chain Disaster
, which is a stronger version of her
Twin Rising Dragons
 technique, to impale her clone; Guy uses
Leaf Great Flash
 to take down his clone; and Neji uses
Eight Trigrams Mountain Crusher
, which is a stronger version of his
Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm
, to send his clone flying through a boulder, defeating it.

Trivia

This episode is unique to the anime because only the start and end of Team Guy's fights against their clones are seen in the manga.
