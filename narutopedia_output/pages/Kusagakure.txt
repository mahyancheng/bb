Kusagakure
 (
草隠れの里
,
Kusagakure no Sato
,
literally meaning:
 Village Hidden in the Grass) is located thus far in an unnamed country. Because it had
genin
 participating in the
Chūnin Exams
 organised by
Konohagakure
, it can be assumed the two villages are allied.
 Although it has never been named, the country Kusagakure is located in has been shown on several occasions. The country is rich with forests, some consisting of giant mushrooms or bamboo. It also seems to have many rivers and deep ravines.

During the
Third Shinobi World War
, the country was invaded by
Iwagakure
 and served as an important front between Iwa and Konoha. More than a decade later,
Orochimaru
 had a hideout somewhere in the country.

Kusagakure is skilled in diplomacy, a trait they constantly use to read the movements of other countries and stay one step ahead of them. They also analyse techniques from other villages in a similar manner. Because of these principles, others find it hard to read the shinobi from this village's attitudes.

After the end of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Kusagakure was approached and offered to join the
Shinobi Union
.

Land of Earth
 in the northwest,
Takigakure
 in the north and
Amegakure
 in the south.

In
Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison
, the village possessed an
ancient superweapon
 dating back to the days of the
Sage of the Six Paths
. The weapon was so powerful that Kusagakure was seen as a powerful force in the world at that time.

After the old Kusagakure was destroyed, the weapon was hidden and two factions arose, namely "Grass Fruit" (
