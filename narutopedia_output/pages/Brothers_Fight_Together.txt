 Uchiha Brothers United Front) is chapter 579 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Closing his hood and stating that he was an introverted person and as such it was unsettling to be stared at by so many people,
Kabuto
 sends his snakes charging towards
Sasuke
 and
Itachi
. The brothers are able to fend this attack off, however Kabuto uses this opportunity to hide in one of his snakes. Here, Kabuto reveals the abilities that he had gained from experimenting with Sasuke's former teammates:
Karin
's healing abilities (which derive from her being an
Uzumaki
), a similar ability to
Suigetsu
's
Hydrification Technique
 as well as
Jūgo
's ability to absorb the forces of nature. After revealing that he had found and trained at the
Ryūchi Cave
 — much to Itachi's shock — he narrowly dodges Sasuke's attack. Emerging from the snake's mouth he reveals that he had finally surpassed
Orochimaru
 and was able to become a
sage
 and declares that he was now a dragon after Sasuke calls him an imperfect snake like Orochimaru.
