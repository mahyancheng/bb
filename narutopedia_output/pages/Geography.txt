Earth



The
Naruto
 series
 is set on a fictional terrestrial blue planet called
Earth
 (
地球
,
Chikyū
). Most of the series takes place on a large continent that is divided into a number of different countries; additional continents are occasionally depicted in supplementary media. This region and the society that prevails within it is often referred to as the
Ninja World
 (
忍界
,
Ninkai
) or
Shinobi World
 (
忍の世界
,
Shinobi no Sekai
).

History

From countless millennia worth of war amongst Earth's population, the bloodshed lead to the planet's
God Tree
 absorbing it to subsequently grow a Chakra Fruit, which was forbidden for humans to touch. The God Tree was revered by some cultures; humans used to worship it as a sacred pillar that extended into the heavens and remained ambivalent to all conflict.
 The
Ōtsutsuki clan
 considered Earth as the region
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 was in charge of.
 Arriving to the planet with a portion of the clan in search for fruit of the God Tree, she ate it, resulting in her manifesting
chakra
 which she used to bring an end to the constant wars. Afterwards, she had twin sons,
Hagoromo
 and
Hamura
, whom were the first humans born with chakra.





The Ten-Tails decimating the land.



Becoming corrupted by chakra, Kaguya began turning the planet's
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 victims into an army of
White Zetsu
, and integrated with the God Tree to become the Ten-Tails in order to reclaim the chakra her sons inherited. Causing havoc to the planet, the beast was sealed away by the twins. Believing chakra was a power that linked everything in the world, Hagoromo set out to
spread
 the message to the people of the land, during which his teachings became known as
ninshū
.
 This act eventually lead to the planet's population acquiring chakra, which they became dependent on possessing to sustain living. Hagoromo's eldest son
Indra
, weaponized chakra, which lead to the creation of
ninjutsu
 and as a result the Shinobi World as it came to be known.

During the
Warring States Period
, the countries of the world were uniformly small, and constantly hired
shinobi

clans
 to fight their battles for land. The constant warfare lead to the average lifespan of the mercenaries to thirty years.
Hashirama Senju
 offered the
Uchiha clan
 a peace treaty, which
Madara
 accepted. The Uchiha and
Senju clan
 allied with the
Land of Fire
 to establish a shinobi village. Other clans would soon join the village, and it would later become known as
Konohagakure
. Clans in other countries that were fearful of the combined might of the Senju and Uchiha, adopted the ideology and created their own villages. This system lead to the creation of many shinobi villages, with the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 standing out as the strongest.

Tension between nations lead to the
First Shinobi World War
, which involved the majority of nations. It ended with an armistice treaty, after all of the Five Great Nations had been seriously damaged.
 Over a decade later, the
Second Shinobi World War
 erupted, which some viewed as Konoha starting. When the
Third Shinobi World War
 broke out, it involved shinobi from every land, and ended with an armistice agreement between Konoha and
Iwagakure
.

Countries

Countries operate as separate political entities and are presumably all monarchies, ruled by
daimyō
 who stand as a ruler for the entire country. Hidden Village
heads
 are the generals that take care of shinobi matters. The
Naruto
 world is similar to feudal Japan in many aspects; those countries maintain balance between themselves through nothing but power. Treaties are periodically signed, but they are generally not worth much more than the paper they are written on.
