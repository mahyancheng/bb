Daemon
 (
デイモン
,
Deimon
) is a former member of
Kara
 and a citizen of
Konohagakure
.

Background

Daemon and his older
sister
 were modified with
Shinobi-Ware
 and
Shibai Ōtsutsuki
‘s DNA by
Amado Sanzu
 in his hopes of bringing down
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
's vessel
Jigen
. After learning that Daemon and his sister are among the cyborgs with the capabilities to defeat him in Jigen's weaker body, Isshiki ordered their destruction.
Boro
, who was captivated by Ada, had secretly hid the siblings away at one of his
hidden establishments
.

Personality

Daemon is a very energetic and mischievous child. He enjoys playing with others and can quickly grow attached to certain people. At the same time, he is fiercely protective of his sister, not letting anyone with less than sincere goals about her near and is determined to protect her from anything he deems a threat to her well-being. Likewise, he is very loyal to her orders, willing to keep quiet about things he would like to tell otherwise. Daemon turned out to be sentimental as he got angry after Bug tried to run away without even talking to him. Once engaging in battle, he is very sadistic and remorseless. He enjoys fighting, quickly getting excited when Code pulled him into one, and just as disappointed when Code sent him back away from it. He is very confident in his abilities, considering himself stronger than Jigen, Code,  Naruto, Sasuke and also Boruto and Kawaki. With his strength, Daemon wishes to fight strong opponents, and became interested in
Himawari Uzumaki
 when he felt an unspecified intensity coming from her, despite thinking she also appears weak. After the rest of the world had their memories of Boruto and Kawaki swapped, Daemon was amused by the possibility of Kawaki's lie being exposed by the God Tree who wanted to consume Naruto.

Appearance






Daemon's full appearance.



Daemon is a young boy with short, turquoise hair that has a pink-coloured streaks in it, with a beauty mark on the upper corner of his mouth, purple eyes and yellow pupils and pronounced canine teeth.
 He wears a red hoodie jacket with star patterns over a turquoise shirt, red shorts tied with a white belt and dark sandals. He also has yellow nail polish on his fingernails and toe nails.

Three years after Boruto left Konoha, Daemon now wears a hoodie jacket with a hood that resembles rabbit ears and three star pattern buttons.

Abilities

As with every Kara member, Daemon’s body had been modified with
Scientific Ninja Tools
 and
Shibai Ōtsutsuki
‘s DNA by Amado.
 While the true depths of his power are unknown, Amado has noted that his combat abilities greatly surpassed
Jigen
's.
 Ada considers Daemon the only non-
Ōtsutsuki
 capable of killing her.

Physical Prowess

He is shown to have advanced
taijutsu
 skill and immense raw strength, able to break a grown man's neck with a single kick,
 as well as easily overpower the full-powered
Code
 with only a few hits.
 He is also shown to be incredibly fast and stealthy, able to instantly sneak out of his pod and catch Code off guard,
 as well as quickly reacting to
Kawaki
's
Daikokuten
 chakra rods in mid-air.
 Even Sarada's fully-matured Sharingan struggles to follow his movements.

Shinjutsu






Daemon repelling Kawaki's attack.



From his infusion of Shibai’s cells, Daemon gained the
shinjutsu
 to instantly, even without intent or awareness,
turn an opponent's attack on him against them
. However, this requires Daemon to be touching someone with his hands,
 even if who he is touching and who is attacking him are not the same person.
 His ability will extend to the person he is touching. Merely thinking of harming Daemon will trigger the reflection, which scales with the
killing intent
.
 Also because of his infusion, Daemon can potentially develop the ability to fly.

Code's Assault Arc






Daemon being awakened.



After Ada had awoken and formed a partnership with Code, she ordered
Bug
 to awaken Daemon. Daemon quickly jumped out of his stasis pod to ride Code's back, questioning if he is his sister's "new man". He quickly calmed down when Ada assured him that Code was only a new friend and not her type of man. When Boro's guards learned of Code's intrusion, they attacked the cyborgs, only for Daemon to use his ability to reflect their attacks back at them, killing them all.






Daemon being used to protect Code.



Later, Daemon quickly began warming up to Code, constantly forcing himself on Code for rides. As Daemon turned his attention to Bug who was trying to escape, Code suddenly struck at the boy with his
Claw Marks
, which were instantly reflected back on Code. Code explained that he wanted to better understand how Daemon's power worked, explaining that his marks let him teleport to wherever they are. As Daemon found the power cool, Code asked how the boy's power works. While wanting to tell Code, Daemon was forbidden by his sister. While Ada was guiding Code on Kawaki's location, Daemon slept on her lap. He was woken up by her pleas for Code not to kill Kawaki, but she told him to go back to sleep. When Kawaki activated his new Kāma, granting him access to Isshiki's powers, he began to overwhelm Code, shrinking his Claw Marks to prevent him from escaping. When he was about to blast Code, Code pulled Daemon through the Claw Mark on his face, reflecting Kawaki's attack back at him. This woke Daemon up, just for Code to send him back to Ada. She informed Code that it Kawaki had died, she'd have sent Daemon to kill him.

Daemon rode Code's back as Ada reminded him of the terms of their agreement, displeased with him using Daemon without her permission. She warned him that if she deemed him a hindrance even after having his power limiters lifted, she and Daemon would dispose of him.

Daemon overwhelming Code.



Later, Code and Ada successfully captured Amado, who Daemon mockingly greeted upon his return. He watched as Amado begged for his life in exchange of lifting the power limiters. When Amado appealed to Ada's interest in Kawaki, she signalled Daemon to stop Code from killing him. When he tried to attack Amado again, Daemon considered Code had to be disposed of. When Ada dissolved their partnership, Code attempted to replace Daemon as her knight, but he maintained the upper hand against Code, even after Bug revealed the caveat of his reflecting ability. After Code retreated with Bug, he jumped on Amado's back as he and Ada continued discussing their positions and
Shikamaru Nara
's offer. Daemon was confident he could deal with Kawaki, negating Konoha's need of Amado. Amado considered it, but maintained his goal was different, and asked them to go to Konoha, where he'd also mediate for their alliance. After Amado had a phone call with Shikamaru, and Ada threatened to kill him if he didn't help her with Kawaki, Daemon clarified he would be the one killing him. On his way to Konoha, Daemon was startled by Ada's reaction as she spied on his mission briefing to Team 7, and noticed how her heartbeat had quickened when she hugged him. She assured him everything was fine.

Upon arriving in Konoha, he and Ada were greeted by Konoha shinobi. Already aware of Shikamaru's setup, she took off flying, carrying Daemon piggyback with her to their new home. Inside the house, Daemon quickly antagonised and attacked Boruto and Kawaki, knocking them both out. When they woke up, Daemon said he had to make it clear he was stronger than they were, to discourage them from defying himself and Ada. He asked Kawaki if he liked Ada's lap, and Boruto informed Shikamaru through the comm system that Daemon gave them a baptism by fire. As Amado explained the shinjutsu nature and origins of Daemon's and Ada's abilities, Boruto expressed scepticism about Daemon's ability, who asked if he wanted to test them. He did not, but Kawaki did, his own killing intent reflected back at him. The next day, Daemon teased Boruto when he asked Ada why picked Kawaki over him. When the boys began arguing, she asked for
Sumire Kakei
 and
Sarada Uchiha
 to join her, as she wanted to talk to girls. While they did, Daemon and Kawaki exchanged insults, and Daemon later lost to Boruto in a video game. When Kawaki caused a commotion while accusing Momoshiki of planning something, Daemon agreed that the Ōtsutsuki don't care about their mission. After Kawaki's departure, he joined Ada and the girls for a shopping trip, riding on Boruto's shoulders, still teasing him over finding him weak and asking if he knew of any strong opponents. Feeling something, he rushed outside to find Himawari, interested in who she was. Learning she was Boruto's sister, he was confused about her weak appearance despite feeling something intense from her. Boruto pulled him away from her, disapproving when he thought Daemon has a crush on her.

While with his sister and Sumire, Ada noticed Kawaki being pursued by Konoha shinobi for his recent attacks on Naruto and Boruto with her
dōjutsu
, prompting her to fly to his location and Daemon telling her not to leave without him. Pursuing Ada, he noticed her
flash
 enveloping the sky. Upon catching up with Ada, he tackled Kawaki to the ground, demanding that he better not have done anything shameless with Ada. After it was revealed that Ada subconsciously swapped the history of Boruto and Kawaki to everyone in the world, Daemon joined Ada to find and talk with Boruto. Upon finding him with
Sasuke
, the latter realising that the situation was not as it seemed, Ada apologised for her unintentional stealing of Boruto's life. Despite the situation, Boruto did not blame Ada, but rather became committed to get strong enough to resolve things with Kawaki as brother-to-brother. Daemon told Boruto to get strong enough so he could finally fight someone with all his strength.

Boruto's Return Arc

Three years later, Daemon considered Sumire and Sarada's attempt to convince anyone else to listen to Boruto and unwinnable game, and kept watching them when Ada raised the possibility they weren't captivated by her, just like how their memories weren't rewritten.

When Code attacked the village to draw out Boruto, Ada watched the events through her Senringan, telling Daemon of the events. When Code's effort worked, Boruto unveiled his new
Rasengan: "Uzuhiko"
. Daemon explained to Ada how it worked, leaving him interested.

When Ada reported her discovery of the sentient God Trees targeting herself and Naruto to Kawaki, he initially dismisses the threat, confident he could eliminate them, but Daemon teased him that if they attacked looking for Naruto, this could lead to the exposure of Kawaki's lie, earning himself Ada's admonishment.

Daemon continued watching over Ada as others came to talk to her. Kawaki came needing her help to find Boruto. Then came Mitsuki talking about how he could relate to Ada in talking about their feelings and trying to find purpose in themselves. Later, when Boruto was captured and interrogated by Konoha, Daemon listened to Ada's report of events through her Senrigan. To which, he mocked Kawaki about how Boruto was going to expose Kawaki's ruse. To their shock however, Boruto refused to do such, actually trying to protect Kawaki's status in Konoha.

After Boruto was able to escape from Konoha's custody, Daemon slept on Ada's lap as she looked into Boruto's past three years to better understand his intentions.

After Ada learned about Sarada and Sumire's new feelings of love for Boruto, she asks to meet with them. As she voices her doubts that the two girls are attracted her like everyone else, Daemon quickly grabs the two and subdues them, ready to kill them. Ultimately, he let them go, proclaiming he only wanted to prove how easy it would be for him to kill them. Ada returned focus to the subject at hand. She had concluded that Sarada and Sumire didn't break free from her allure, nor were they ever affected by it. She also concluded that the reason behind this was because Ada had subconsciously made it so, wanting have friends who liked her on their own. To which, she truly believed that over the past years, Sarada and Sumire had become her genuine friends with no real desire to hurt her. Sarada and Sumire were moved by this, hugging Ada to affirm their genuine friendship. Daemon smirked at this development.
