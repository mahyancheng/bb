"
Attack of the Gedō Statue
" (
外道魔像の襲来
,
Gedō Mazō no Shūrai
) is episode 276 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Arriving at the
daimyō
's location,
Black Zetsu
 prepares to launch an attack but is quickly rebuffed by
Mei Terumī
. Ready to fight alongside the
Mizukage
, the rest of the
Daimyō Protection Squad
 arrives and confronts the
Akatsuki
 member. Somewhat amused, Zetsu
buries
 his flytrap extensions into the ground and with this, the battle between the two sides gets under way. After Black Zetsu
senses

Naruto
 and
B
, he quickly alerts
White Zetsu
, who notifies
Tobi
. The masked man tells them to continue with the guerilla tactics despite the fact that the
jinchūriki
 were out in the open as a method to keep their forces divided. On the battlefield, the
First
 and
Second Divisions
 are able to either subdue or defeat their enemies before Tobi arrives on the battlefield and summons the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
.

As the statue begins the rampage, a giant-sized
Chōza
 calls his son
Chōji
 to his side as both giants prepare to take on the statue. Unable to stop the statue as it lets out a high shock wave which devastates everyone in the immediate area,
Kitsuchi
 steps in immediately and tries to
crush
 the statue with his signature technique. Shocked when the statue moves to the coast, it is revealed that Tobi had gone there to steal the
Kohaku no Jōhei
 and
Benihisago
. The masked man is confronted by
Darui
 and
Shikamaru Nara
 but uses his
intangibility
 to his advantage and manages to get both tools before leaving. Elsewhere the
Third
,
Fourth
 and
Fifth Divisions
 continued their battles. As night fell, both sides retreated and regrouped to wait for the next day of battle, while the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 headquarters discussed their next plan of action. Elsewhere, Naruto and B continued to travel to the battlefield through the night.

Trivia

In this episode,
Kabuto
 calls back his reincarnated shinobi for the night, which did not happen in the manga.

When Tobi picked up the Treasured Tools, the Benihisago was depicted momentarily without the red cloth around it.
