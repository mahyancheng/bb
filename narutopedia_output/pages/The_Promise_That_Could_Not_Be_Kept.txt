Synopsis

The retrieval team was brought back to

 where, despite the severity of their injuries, all managed to fully recover. When
Naruto
 came to, he apologized to
Sakura
 for not managing to keep his promise and failing to bring
Sasuke
 back. Sakura didn't mind and still thanked Naruto for his wanting to fulfil his promise to her in the future. Afterward, Jiraiya offered Naruto a chance to leave with him for three years to train. Naruto accepted, and
Jiraiya
 told him they would leave whenever he was ready. Elsewhere, Sasuke arrived at
Orochimaru
's lair, where he soon proved himself worthy of Orochimaru's guidance. Meanwhile,
Akatsuki
 assembled, ready to start their mission three years from then.
