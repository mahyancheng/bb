Fubuki Kakuyoku
 (
鶴翼 フブキ
,
Kakuyoku Fubuki
) was a kunoichi from
Yukigakure
 and a member of
Dotō Kazahana
's group,
Dotō's Three-Man-Team
 alongside
Nadare Rōga
 and
Mizore Fuyukuma
.

Background

Ten years prior to the movie plot, Fubuki participated in overthrowing the
daimyō
 of the
Land of Snow
,
Sōsetsu Kazahana
, on the orders of Dotō Kazahana.

Personality

Fubiki was a proud and confident individual bordering on arrogant, near constantly smirking even while in combat, and reminding her
opponent
 not to underestimate the Yuki shinobi.

Appearance

Fubuki was a curvaceous woman with green eyes and pink spiky hair that stuck out of two holes at the top of her grey helmet, reminiscent of pigtails. She has small circular dark pink eyebrows. Much like her teammates, she wore
Chakra Armour
.

Abilities

Fubuki, like the rest of her team, used
Ice Release
, though this version wasn't a
kekkei genkai
 as they had to use pre-existing ice for their techniques. Fubuki used Ice Release to pull pillars of ice out of the ground to
imprison
 her opponents or defend against attacks. She could also create
flying ice needles
 that she can remotely control. She wore
Chakra Armour
, which protected her from
ninjutsu
 and
genjutsu
, as well as amplified her own
chakra
. Hers, in particular, had built in wings that allowed her to glide around at high speeds.

Plot Overview






Fubuki defeated by Sasuke Uchiha.



As the new movie stared by
Koyuki Kazahana
 was being filmed in
Yukigakure
, Fubuki and the rest of her team ambushed the filming squad.
Team 7
 began their mission, and fought against the Yuki shinobi. Fubuki took on
Sasuke Uchiha
, and was able to counter his
Fire Release
 with Ice Release.
Kakashi Hatake
's clash with
Nadare Rōga
 gave the filming squad and the
Konoha
 shinobi the chance to retreat.

Fubuki, Nadare, and
Mizore Fuyukuma
 were later sent to finish off the Konoha shinobi by
Dotō Kazahana
. Fubuki once again fought Sasuke and was ultimately defeated, as she was sent plummeting towards Mizore. This caused their Chakra Armours to explode, killing her.
