Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

A group of
Suna
 shinobi have lost track of their target. From above,
Deidara
 flies on his
dragon
, and sends one of his clay figures their way, killing them.
Zetsu
 watches it from afar, and its halves discuss Deidara, who arrives shortly. They are met by
Hidan
, who berates Deidara for blasting the Suna shinobi, and
Kakuzu
, who manages to retrieve a body not too damaged. They all leave together.
Naruto
 manages to unmask the
Root
 member fighting him, revealing her to be
Anko
.
Shikamaru
 realises their mission is to ensure
Sasuke
 reaches
Orochimaru
, and has the group flee from the fight and continue pursuing Sasuke.

Lee
 stays behind to stall the Root shinobi, but
one
 of them engages him, allowing the others to continue. Lee takes off his weights and opens the fifth of the
Eight Gates
. Kakuzu delivers the corpses somewhere. Zetsu, Deidara, Kakuzu, and Hidan meet up with
Sasori
, who intervenes when an argument begins between Deidara and Hidan. Hidan accuses Sasori of siding with Deidara, and in turn is reminded of the
Hizashi
 incident, and that
Akatsuki
 as is might exist because of Deidara. He was the one responsible for the explosion that destroyed the village and killed
Yahiko
 years ago, and Sasori presented
Nagato
 and
Konan
 with a
Flying Thunder God Kunai
, blaming
Minato
 and
Konoha
 for the explosion. In
Ame
, Nagato vows to make Konoha know his pain, through the
Deva Path
, using Yahiko's body. Lee fights the Root shinobi, and Tenten stays behind to stall
another
 when they begin to catch up with the group. Orochimaru waits for an approaching Sasuke. Naruto, Neji, and Shikamaru continue to give chase, followed by two remaining Root shinobi.
