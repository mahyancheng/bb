"
Naruto's Wedding
" (
ナルトの結婚
,
Naruto no Kekkon
) is episode 494 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Konohamaru
 records a congratulatory message from
Sakura
 for
Naruto
 and
Hinata
's wedding.
Sai
 isn't sure he can express himself in such a manner, but Sakura forces him to record a message as well. Sai struggles, coming off too stiff or too forced.
Lee
 delivers a high-spirited message getting too close to the camera,
Tenten
 finding it doesn't quite come across as congratulatory.
Guy
 thinks there should be something symbolic onscreen, and suggests recording the message during the sunrise.
Ino
 begins recording her message, but gets angry with
Chōji
 and
Shikamaru
's comments.
Akamaru
 suddenly topples her, and
Kiba
 takes over the recording, sparking an argument with Ino.
 Konohamaru is bothered he can't seem to find someone to record a proper message. Konohamaru tries
Iruka
, who is very nervous, asks to postpone it so he can think of something to say. The next day, while trying to come up with something, Iruka finds
Sadoru
, a new Academy instructor, distressed by vandalism from students. He easily spots the perpetrators and when they try claiming they were just playing hide and seek, he tricks one of them into admitting to the vandalism, impressing Sadoru. Iruka comments that compared to Naruto, that was nothing. Sadoru is impressed, but the vandals think he's making it up, so Iruka adds to their punishment. Iruka reflects on how the village sees Naruto. Iruka is invited to take an exam for being vice-principal position in the
Academy
.
Kakashi
 looks over the schedule for missions, seeing that if all of Naruto's friends go to the reception, there will be unfulfilled missions on the day. Konohamaru tries recording a message from
Orochimaru
, but
Yamato
 covertly and emphatically tells him not to do it.
Shizune
 tells Kakashi that Tsunade made a rule to determine which shinobi get to attend shinobi weddings based on their gifts, much to his dislike. Konohamaru and
Ebisu
 find Iruka at Ichiraku, and Ebisu gets self-conscious upon learning of Iruka's offer. Kakashi asks what's up, having been there for a while without being noticed. When they tell him about Iruka's possible promotion, he says it would be difficult. After he leaves, the others discuss what he meant. Iruka decides to take the exam for vice-principal, and his efforts are visible to all in Konoha.
Tsukune
, one of the vandals, steals the
Scroll of Seals
 after learning Naruto did that. Kakashi almost explains what he meant in Ichiraku about Iruka, but Shizune tells him about the scroll's theft. Iruka finds Sansho and
Mibuna
, some of the vandals, who confirm his suspicion. He finds the vandal and the scroll at the Hokage Rock, and apologises for always comparing his students to previous students, realising he just wanted attention. The vandal promises to try harder. Kakashi shows Iruka the scroll just has an
Icha Icha
 volume, as if he'd leave the scroll where someone could steal it so easily. He then explains that what he meant about the exam being difficult is that it's on the same day as Naruto's wedding, and considers moving the exam to another day, but Iruka decides not to take it, noting his failure to notice his current students. Kakashi decides to make getting a wedding gift for Naruto and Hinata a mission, so he can determine who should go to the wedding and who should be on mission duty on that day.
