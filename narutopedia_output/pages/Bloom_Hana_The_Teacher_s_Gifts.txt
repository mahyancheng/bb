"
Bloom, Hana! The Teacher's Gifts
" (
花開け!!教師の才能
,
Hana Hirake!! Kyōshi no Sainō
) is episode 263 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

On the way to the
Academy
,
Himawari
 and
Kawaki
 discuss the progress of his
mission
. Himawari points out that
Hana
 is pleased that Kawaki made friends, concerned for her student. Kawaki has been unimpressed with her. He mentions that Himawari might have a better chance at learning
ninjutsu
 from special instructors coming to their class. At the Academy, the students speculate and gossip on who the special instructors might be.
Ehō
 wants them to acknowledge him so he can go on missions with them in the future, impressing
Yuina
.
Soul Tao
 finds it pretentious. Hana arrives, and introduces
Team 7
 as the instructors, to the delight of the class and Kawaki's discomfort. The students are impressed by
Boruto
's
Rasengan
. Kawaki asks Boruto not to let the students know he's already a
genin
. Kawaki loses his patience with Boruto, the two start fighting, and get called out by
Sarada
. She and
Mitsuki
 demonstrate
Fire Release
 and
Lightning Release
. Hana warns the students not to get too close, and pushes them away from their jutsu with
Wind Release
 when they do. Many of the students ask Team 7 to be their teachers. Hana feels deflated, lacking flashy jutsu.

Shino
 is concerned about Hana, and
Anko
 points out her qualifications, hoping she'll be able to display her true abilities. Everyone is hungry, and were told not to bring lunch. Boruto arrives with
Lightning Burgers
, which the students will have to fight over, to simulate missions in which they have to fight on empty stomachs. Team 7 sets up who has to fight with who, whoever retains a rubber ball in the end gets to eat, but there are fewer burgers than there are students. They're free to use any ninjutsu, can fight alone or in groups, but will be disqualified if they leave Academy grounds. Sarada gives the go ahead.
Neon
 steals Yuina's with her drone. Hana is concerned, but Team 7's goal is for them to realise they can share the burgers.
Mimi
 eats a candy bar, because it's enough for her, and she doesn't want to take anyone's food. Ehō takes it away, as it defeats the purpose of the exercise, and her dog bites him. Soul tells him to give it back, as there were no rules against the candy bars, seeing it as reading a hidden meaning. Tensions escalate between the students over it. Himawari and
Kae
 inform Boruto about it. He tells about sharing the burgers, but they remain hostile with each other. The next day, only Kae is in class when Himawari and Kawaki arrive, everyone else boycotting class after taking sides with Ehō or Soul. Shino thinks the lesson might have been too advanced for students who know little of team-work. Boruto tries having them make up by playing
Extreme: Shinobi Picture Scrolls
, but they remain hostile. Kawaki tries reconciling them over food, but they also have different preferences. Hana checks up on the students' records to find what preference they share. Hana visits Soul, and reveals to her that her hero,
Might Guy
, had a friendly rivalry with
Kakashi Hatake
, which helped both of them grow, and hopes the same can be true for her. She gifts a tracksuit like Guy's, though Soul isn't as fond of it as she is of Guy, and hands her a letter. Next, she talks to Ehō over ramen at
Ichiraku
's, also giving him a letter. She's concerned she's not cut out to be a teacher, but is determined to help her students. The next day, everyone waits for Hana outside. She has cancelled class for the day, so everyone can have a cherry blossom viewing party. She uses jutsu to spread paper petals. Soul and Ehō agree to go back to class over seeing how hard Hana is trying and how much she cares about them. Kawaki asks Hana what she would have done if no one had shown up, and she says she had to have faith in her students if she's to have faith in herself as a teacher. They all have a picnic. Shino and Anko note Hana's improvement, and Boruto declines their invitation to teach again.
