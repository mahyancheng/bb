) is episode 273 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Kawaki
 and
Himawari
 confront
Hana
. Himawari asks if she's really not their teacher, and Hana explains that was a separate personality she used as a cover for her
mission
.
Kae
 corroborates it. Hana attacks them with
Fire Release
. Kawaki and Himawari retreat, dodging the
fireballs
. Hana says she has risked everything for this mission for a decade, hiding within the weak Hana, and she won't let them get in the way. Kawaki can't hold back, but Himawari points out that if he kills her, Teacher Hana will die as well. Hana claims that the teacher is as good as dead, sealed deep within her. Kawaki has to prioritise defeating her and saving Kae. Hana targets them with her dark fireballs again, Kawaki rushing to protect Himawari. Hana converges the fireballs on them. Kawaki falls to the ground, but disperses as a
shadow clone
. Hana deflects a
Gentle Fist
 attack from Himawari, and Kawaki causes her to drop an
explosive tag

kunai
 near Kae. Assassin Hana talks like Teacher Hana to stop Kawaki from landing a hit on her, and counterattacks. Hana creates a
paper barrier
, obscuring her movements and where she attacks from, and prepares to end them.
Eiki
 leads the rest of the class towards the harbour, hoping to get word of the developments out. Someone appears in front of them.
 Kae reasons that Hana shouldn't have enough
chakra
 to main such a taxing jutsu for long. Hana reveals that more
jōnin
 level allies should be arriving by boat, which will allow her to overpower them soon without
Konoha
 ever learning a thing. Kawaki tells Himawari she can see where Hana is with her
Byakugan
, reminding her she's his partner. Encouraged by his words, they fist bump. Kawaki blocks Hana's attacks on Himawari with his body while she looks for Hana. Kae throws the explosive tag kunai at one of the fireballs, exploding it and opening a whole through the barrier, briefly exposing Hana before it reforms. Himawari keeps track of Hana's position outside and opens a new hole with her Gentle Fist, allowing Kawaki to kick her. Hana reforms the barrier, but the children break through again, defeating her, and dispelling the barrier. Hana says it doesn't matter, as her allies have had time to arrive. The rest of the class hails them, having brought
Sai
 and
Batora
 along, who reveals Hana's allies have been caught by
Anbu
. Defeated, Assassin Hana tries killing herself, but her exhaustion allows Teacher Hana to fight her. The students call out to their teacher, giving her the strength to get in control again. The class rejoices. Later, Kawaki, Sai, and
Shikamaru
 report to
Naruto
. In the hospital, Hana talks to
Shino
,
Anko
, and
Sakura
, having decided to use
fūinjutsu
 to suppress Assassin Hana until she can teach her to do more than live for her mission. Shikamaru finds it risky, but Naruto respects her wishes, hoping they might come to an understanding. Kae wants to keep the incident under wraps, and is scheduled to return home. She says goodbye to her class-mates, explaining her father has taken ill, necessitating her to step up in ruling and look after her brother. The class wants to finish the play they rehearsed, but Kawaki is no longer there to play
Katsuyu
. They arrange for
Neon
's drone to act as Katsuyu, but Kawaki arrives in time to play the part. The students and Hana see Kae off at the train station, except for Kawaki. She waves at them from the back of the train, and spots Kawaki by himself on a railing. She wishes him good luck on his missions, and thanks him for their time together. Later, Himawari goes off to the
Academy
, her parents noting how engrossed by it she's become. By himself, Kawaki smiles at his class photo.
