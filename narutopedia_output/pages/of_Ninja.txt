Naruto
 manga.

Summary

As
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 finally make physical contact with
Kaguya
, the powerful
fūinjutsu
: Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei is finally activated, and just as her sons
Hagoromo
 and
Hamura
 had done before, her
third eye
 is obscured by the moon and sun respectively leading to the
tailed beasts
 being extracted from within her body.
 Kaguya soon reverts to the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 before ejecting
Madara Uchiha
's unconscious body as the earth begins to encase her body, forming another satellite. Silently watching on as his mother is sealed away once more,
Black Zetsu
 resigns himself to the fact that he would have to bide his time and begin the process to revive his mother again, however, Naruto — who has other plans — finds Kaguya's severed arm, and after decrying Zetsu's sentiments that he created the
shinobi
 world tells Black Zetsu that the shinobi history was actually created by the lives of shinobi who all lived and died before telling Black Zetsu that it is nothing more than a snot-nosed brat too afraid to leave his mother's side. Naruto then throws the disembodied arm into the
Chibaku Tensei
 sphere. The tailed beast are all elated that they have been freed and while they praise Naruto,
Team Kakashi
 soon finds themselves in another predicament: they had no way to escape Kaguya's dimension. Just then, they are all
summoned
 to the real world, by Hagoromo who called on the spirits of all the deceased
Kage
 and used their power along with the
Hokage
's to summon them out of
Kaguya's dimension
. Looking on at the team, Hagoromo thanks them sincerely for saving the world.

Trivia
