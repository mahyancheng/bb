Using his clay, Deidara creates several explosive spiders and throws them in the air as Sasori uses the
Third Kazekage

puppet
 to make shards of
Iron Sand
 blades that carry the spiders to the opponent. The opponent is forced into the ground where the spiders detonate. The detonation is so powerful that Sasori has to make the Third Kazekage puppet create an iron sand barrier to shield them from the blast.
