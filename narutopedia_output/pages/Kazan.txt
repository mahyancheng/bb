He wore a long-sleeved green kimono shirt with white trimming underneath a yellow, sleeveless jacket held closed by a broad sash. He also wore a pair of black pants and soft, Chinese shoes, and what appeared to be a scarf around his neck.

Plot Overview

Kazan disguised himself as
Naruto Uzumaki
 and assassinated
jōnin
 from
Iwagakure
 and
Kumogakure
, as well as attempted to kill the Fourth Raikage, framing the real Naruto of such crimes, having been hired by
Mui
 to do so, in order for Mui to make use of Naruto. Kazan later infiltrated the
Hōzuki Castle
 and was causing much trouble for jailers. The reason behind this was revealed to be the fact that they had captured his son. Later after being confronted by Mui and a group of masked individuals on a cliff, before Kazan was able to attack them, they paralysed him and send him plummeting to the sea below. It was later revealed that Mui had saved Kazan from the fall "
on a whim
" he noted, as well as Kazan's son. Kazan would later fight side by side with Mui — even assuming his identity. When the council of masked individuals tried to stop Mui from wasting the one wish granted by the
Box of Ultimate Bliss

Muku
