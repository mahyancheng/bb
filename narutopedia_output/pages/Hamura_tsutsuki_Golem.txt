The giant
golem
 was a creature that resided on the
moon
 alongside
Toneri Ōtsutsuki
. Prior to being animated, it was a stone monument made in
Hamura Ōtsutsuki
's image.

Appearance






The Statue's full appearance.



The golem's body was originally a stone monument to Hamura carved into a rock wall over a shrine, but was transformed into a living entity by
Toneri Ōtsutsuki
 using his
Tenseigan
, allowing it to separate itself from the cliff's side and to crawl using primitive stone arms. As such its appearance resembles that of Hamura's, complete with the horns and six magatama designs carved on its collarbones, resembling the necklace worn by Hamura himself. Several large glowing orbs appear to be embedded in its back.

Abilities

The golem was able to fight hand-to-hand, and temporarily overwhelm
Kurama
, the strongest of the nine
tailed beasts
. It was durable enough to survive a
Tailed Beast Ball
 launching it into orbit through the moon undamaged. It could also regenerate any damaged piece of its body, making it very difficult to defeat. It was also capable of manipulating the gravitational force to draw meteorites from its surroundings to rain down the
moon
's surface.

The Statue fighting Kurama.



When
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
his team
 saw the golem emerging from beneath Toneri's castle, he activated his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 and summoned Kurama outside of his body. Kurama and the golem then engaged in a fierce fight. When Toneri was defeated, the golem froze temporarily. It was later able to move again only to punch Kurama, but missed and was quickly defeated by Kurama's Tailed Beast Ball, sending it flying into space.
