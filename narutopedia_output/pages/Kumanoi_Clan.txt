The
Kumanoi Clan
 (
熊胆一族
,
Kumanoi Ichizoku
) was a clan of the
Howling Wolf Village
. They accidentally discovered
blue fire powder
 while trying to find a medicine that would grant eternal youth.
 The Kumanoi profited greatly from the sale of blue fire powder and were also able to use it to help the Howling Wolf Village defeat
Amegakure
; after the battle, however, the Kumanoi forced the prisoners the village had taken to walk through a field of mines, killing them all. This action placed
Tenma Kodon
 in opposition to the Kumanoi when they started advocating for the Howling Wolf Village to declare neutrality and cease being a
hidden village
. When, in the midst of the decision,
Rōen
 abruptly attacked the village, the Kumanoi clan believed Tenma was behind the attack. They used their blue fire powder to defend the village from Rōen, but left the village after it was defeated.
