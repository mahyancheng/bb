Gantetsu
) is a former
shinobi
 from
Iwagakure
. He was reputed as the

Background

Gantetsu claimed to have been a dangerous chūnin of Iwagakure, known as the
Legendary Dark Shinobi
 (
伝説の暗忍
,
Densetsu no Annin
). He eventually left his village, arriving at
Tanzaku Quarters
 to seek a more luxurious life with his partner
Chōseki
.

Personality

Gantetsu seems to be quite rude and impolite, as well as arrogant in his self-proclaimed status. He is also quite belligerent, readily attacking or intimidating people when they don't do what he wants. He also seems to have a taste for designer clothes, willingly paying a great amount of money for one.

Appearance

Gantetsu has a head of spiky dull-black hair, thick sideburns and dark-coloured, squinted eyes. He wore a yellow collared shirt with a blue tie underneath a high-collared white jacket suit.

Part I

Search for Tsunade

After
Naruto
 accidentally spilled some food on Gantetsu's jacket, Gantetsu was ready to force him to pay for a new jacket, which apparently was very expensive. Gantetsu, alongside
Chōseki
, then got beaten up by
Jiraiya
's
Rasengan
. Jiraiya also took Gantetsu's money to pay for
Kazabune
's destroyed cart.

Trivia

In the manga, Jiraiya steals his wallet while in the anime, he is given it out of respect.

The Second Databook labels both Gantetsu and his partner, Chōseki, as
Fallen Ninja
 (
忍者崩れ
,
Ninja Kuzure
). Whether this is meant to be
Missing-nin
 or not is unknown.
