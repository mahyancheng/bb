A seal placed on the
Fire Temple
's gate to protect against intruders from the outside world. The two statues placed on either side of the gate form a barrier. Only
ninja monks
 of the temple have access to enter due to the special chakra gifted from the
Gift of the Hermit Group
. However, a powerful enough physical strike can break through the defences, as demonstrated with
Kakuzu
's
Earth Release: Earth Spear
.
