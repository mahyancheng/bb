Himushi
 (
ヒムシ
) is a
mercenary ninja
 and the leader of the
Nokizaru Group
.

Background

Himushi and the Nokizaru were hired by the
Sugi Village
 to hunt down the
Fourth Raikage
 and his men after they stole a scroll detailing their employer's hidden techniques. While on their tail, the Nokizaru unleashed a blinding light which dispersed microscopic
Exploding Insects
 which the
Kumogakure
 shinobi inhaled. After killing
Nigai
 with this method, A escaped with his
ill subordinate
.

Tracking them down, Himushi
spied
 on A and
Tsunade
 and prepared a plan to retrieve the scroll by unleashing more exploding insects and offering the cure in return for it. The result of this plan is unknown as Himushi and his team fled when backup from Kumo arrived.

Personality

Himushi appears very devious and cunning, knowing the risks and benefits to his own techniques and tactics on how to use them effectively. He is also very cautious, opting to wait until the exploding insect had matured and then, once it had erupted, dispose of any survivors.

Appearance

Himushi has shaggy, shoulder-length white hair, hark eyes and purple markings framing his face. He wears a red and black bandana and a kimono shirt: half of which has the same red and black pattern of the bandanna and the other half is solid red in colour. Along with this he wears a pair of black pant, sandals and a sash that resembles a monkey's tail.

Abilities

Himushi is an insect user, effectively using them to spy on his targets and defeat them from within by turning their own
chakra
 into fuel for his exploding insects. He was also able to create clones that would disperse into
smoke
 upon being struck.

Trivia

"Himushi" (
蛾
) literally means "moth".
