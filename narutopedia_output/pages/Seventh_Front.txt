The Seventh Front.



The
Seventh Front
 (
第七戦線
,
Dainanasensen
,
English TV:
 Battlefield Seven) was one of the fronts on which the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 battled the
White Zetsu Army
. Originally being held by twenty-four members of the
Water Attack Raid Unit
, they were quickly overrun by a force of two thousand
White Zetsu
. A group from the Supply Unit, the
Thundercloud Unit
 of
Kumogakure
 went to support them, but were trapped. They were eventually rescued by reinforcements from the main forces.

Appearance

The Seventh Front was a wide open, barren terrain near open water. It had two distinct features marking it apart from other areas, those being, a damp red soil that made up the area nearest the water's edge and a large stone statue similar to a
reclining Buddha
 with some compound mostly made of metal built into it.
