This is a huge medical encyclopaedia kept by the
Nara clan
. The book has the kanji for "deer" (
鹿
,
shika
) on one cover and a simplified version of the clan's symbol on the other. The members of this clan are apparently skilled in the field of medicine and as such have created and maintained an encyclopaedia of sorts with medical herbs, preparations and the effects of such items as the closely affiliated
Akimichi clan
's
Three Coloured Pills
.  This book was instrumental in saving
Chōji Akimichi
's life after he ingested the last of the pills during his battle with
Jirōbō
.
