The Land of Wind.



The
Land of Wind
 (
風の国
,
Kaze no Kuni
) is one of the more prominent countries in the series. It is located to the south-west of the
Land of Fire
 and borders the
Land of Rivers
 and
Amegakure
. Its government leader is the
Wind Daimyō
. The country covers a vast realm, but is significantly composed of deserts and thus has little productivity.
 Because there is very little rainfall throughout the year, the people of the country live in villages built on one of the desert's many oases. Despite the country's extremely harsh environment, it has a large population. Although they have warred with each other in the past, the Land of Wind is now on good terms with the Land of Fire, with a great deal of trade going on between the two countries.

The
"Sand
Dumpling
"
 (
砂団子
,

hidden village
 of the Land of Wind. As the village of one of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
, Sunagakure has a
Kage
 as its leader known as the
Kazekage

Trivia

In
Naruto the Movie: Legend of the Stone of Gelel
,
Haido's Knights
 attacked the Land of Wind in their quest of searching for the
Gelel vein
, meaning the country is close to
Temujin's Continent
.

The Land of Wind is often said to border the
Land of Fire
, however, maps show that the
Land of Rivers
 is right in between them. Whether the map is wrong or the Land of Rivers is smaller than initially thought is currently unknown.
