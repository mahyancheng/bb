"
Enter: Naruto Uzumaki!
" (
参上!うずまきナルト
,
Sanjō! Uzumaki Naruto
) is episode 1 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Twelve years ago, a vicious
tailed beast
 known as the
Nine-Tails
 attacked the
shinobi
 village of
Konohagakure
. Many shinobi fought the beast but killed all those standing before it. The
Fourth Hokage
 saved the town by sealing the beast with an infant boy at the cost of his own life.

In the present,
Naruto Uzumaki
 is a prankster who is constantly causing trouble throughout Konohagakure, most recently having placed graffiti all over the
Hokage Rock
. Much of the village dislikes him, but he enjoys the attention garnered from reprimands, as he has no parents or friends due to the villagers abusing him daily. Despite claiming to be a talented shinobi who would someday become
Hokage
, Naruto cannot perform basic techniques such as the
Clone Technique
. When this leaves him unable to graduate from the
Academy
, one of his instructors,
Mizuki
, tells Naruto that if he could steal the
Scroll of Seals
 and learn one of its secret techniques, he would be allowed to continue the ranks of the ninja anyway and graduate.

After successfully stealing the scroll, instructor
Iruka Umino
 finds Naruto, who realises that Mizuki has tricked Naruto. Mizuki arrives and asks Naruto for the scroll, to which Iruka ordered Naruto not to, as Mizuki lied and only wanted the scroll for himself. Mizuki then tells Naruto that he wasn't the one lying, explaining since the day he was born, Nine-Tails has been sealed inside him and that is the reason the villagers hate him so much. He explains that Iruka must hate him the most because the Nine-tails was the one who killed his parents. However, Iruka refutes the accusation, saying he did not blame Naruto for the beast's actions and that he, having grown up also craving attention, sympathised with him. Naruto believing Iruka, uses his newly-mastered
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 to defeat Mizuki.

Amazed by the complicated technique that Naruto has learned, Iruka officially makes Naruto a ninja by giving him his
forehead protector
. He says that he may one day have the potential to become Hokage.

Trivia

Shikamaru
,
Ino
, and
Sakura
 were behind Naruto in the anime, but in the manga, different unnamed Academy students were behind him.

This episode does not contain the opening sequence; only the title appears at the end of the prologue and the theme song plays only in the scene where some of the  Konohagakure shinobi are chasing Naruto for defacing the Hokage Rock.

The English dub of this episode was originally released as TV-Y7-FV. Due to the heavy content of the series, though, this rating was never used again.

In the cut version, the blood from Iruka's nosebleed was edited out, so he was only seen falling back.
