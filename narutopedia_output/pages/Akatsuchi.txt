Akatsuchi
 (
赤ツチ
) is an
Iwagakure

shinobi
. A war-experienced point-of-pride for Iwagakure, Akatsuchi's unwavering loyalty to the
Third Tsuchikage
 earned him the title as his "shield".

Background

In the anime, Akatsuchi was present during a council meeting to discuss an invitation from
Konohagakure
 and
Sunagakure
 to join an impromptu
Chūnin Exams
 they would be hosting together. As Ōnoki arrogantly believed this was an attempt by the two villages to better gauge Iwagakure's strength for an upcoming fight, Akatsuchi simply suggested they just turn down the offer, to which Ōnoki firmly agreed.

Personality

Akatsuchi is a very jovial individual who always seems to have a cheerful disposition. He is also somewhat childish and laid-back, witnessed through his excitement at the prospect of flying once again, even though there was the possibility that they were going off into a battle.
 He was even excited when he thought
Deidara
 survived the battle against
Sasuke Uchiha
, despite Deidara being a criminal and their enemy. During battles, however, he is level-headed and efficient as the Tsuchikage's bodyguard. He is also fiercely loyal to the Tsuchikage, and refused to leave his side when he heard of Sasuke's fight, just in case Ōnoki's hip went out. Deidara also attested to the fact that Akatsuchi rarely ever leaves Ōnoki's side when he fought the two.

Appearance






Akatsuchi's full appearance.



Akatsuchi is a large and imposing man, with dark eyes and black hair that spikes out at the back from underneath his bandanna-styled
forehead protector
. He also has large cheeks, and a plump nose which give him an overall look of constant joviality. He wears the red Iwagakure uniform which has both its sleeves, underneath his
flak jacket
, and accentuates it with a yellow scarf which he wraps around his neck.

In later years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Akatsuchi grows a beard and seemingly discards his forehead protector and retains his yellow scarf. He also ties his hair in a ponytail and he has apparently trimmed down somewhat as his cheeks became less plump. He wears a brown kimono and pants.

Abilities

As a
jōnin
, he is likely a formidable shinobi. With his credibility, he was chosen to guard not only the Third Tsuchikage, but the
Fourth Tsuchikage
 as well, during their respective meetings at the
Kage Summit
.

Ninjutsu

Nature Transformation

Akatsuchi is able to use the
Earth Release

nature transformation
. With it, he displayed the ability to mould and expel a large
rock golem
 from his mouth, capable of tearing through a
White Zetsu clone's
 head. The golem can also be used to shield himself and allies from an opponent's attack.
 He can also condense the earth near him around a target's feet to
immobilise and trap them
.

Physical Prowess

Akatsuchi has been noted to possess unrivalled physical strength in his village.
 As such, he was capable of effortlessly carrying the Tsuchikage and both of each other's luggage for an extended period of time.
 Despite what his size entails, he is quite fast, as seen when he rushed to the Tsuchikage's side after reacting to the
Fourth Raikage
's aggressive action.
 He also shows noticeable stealth skills, tailing multiple genin for hours without them noticing while still gathering intel on them.

Five Kage Summit






Akatsuchi accompanying the Tsuchikage to the Summit.



He was setting off with
Kurotsuchi
 to escort the
Third Tsuchikage
 to the Five Kage meeting, called for by the
Fourth Raikage
. When Ōnoki hurt his hips when trying to carry his bag by himself, Akatsuchi carried him along the way.

When the Raikage destroyed his table during the meeting, Akatsuchi and Kurotsuchi moved to protect the Tsuchikage after the Raikage's physical outburst, but was soon dismissed by Ōnoki. When
White Zetsu
 appears during the summit, Akatsuchi and
Kurotsuchi
 guard the Tsuchikage. Later, when
Sasuke Uchiha
 infiltrates the meeting room, Akatsuchi and the Tsuchikage decided not to engage him, moving out of the way to let the
Fifth Mizukage
, deal with him. Later, he is ensnared in Zetsu's
Spore Technique
. Seeing Sasuke escape Mei, Ōnoki suggests to two of them join the fight. Akatsuchi agrees, and uses the
Earth Release: Golem Technique
, creating a large, earthen
golem
 which proceeds to bite and rip the Zetsu clone from Akatsuchi's body.

After
Tobi
 told the story of the
Ten-Tails
 and the
Sage of the Six Paths
, then declared the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Akatsuchi returned to Iwagakure with the Tsuchikage and Kurotsuchi, where they were informed that the
Earth Daimyō
 has approved of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. He later assumes that the daimyō made a quick decision due to being informed of Madara and the loss of
Tailed Beasts
. When Ōnoki states that the war will result in a failure due to the ignorance of the youth, Akatsuchi recounts the strong words
Gaara
 had directed towards him.

 on the same mission to stop
Ganryū
 in the process.

Akatsuchi stops Ōnoki from disintegrating the Island Turtle.



When news got to headquarters that
Kisame Hoshigaki
 had managed to divulge the
location
 where
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Killer B
 were hiding, Ōnoki took Akatsuchi and Kurotsuchi with him to improve the defences. Once they reached the sea, Ōnoki noted that they would have to
fly
 the rest of the way which pleased Akatsuchi greatly. On their way, they encountered
Kabuto Yakushi
 and the
reincarnated

Deidara
. Akatsuchi as well as Kurotsuchi expressed joy thinking that he had in fact survived his fight against Sasuke before being reminded by the Tsuchikage that the Deidara in front of them was no more than a reincarnation.






Akatsuchi protects himself and Ōnoki against Deidara's assault.



As the battle got under way and the Tsuchikage attempted to use a
Dust Release

technique
, Akatsuchi stopped him, in fear for the Island Turtle's safety which the Tsuchikage had mistaken for part of the landscape. Using this opportunity Deidara sends an
explosive bird
 flying their way and detonates it. Akatsuchi however uses his golem to defend against the attack — saving them. As Ōnoki and Deidara took the battle higher in the sky, they flew so fast that Akatsuchi had trouble keeping up.

New Era

Years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Akatsuchi attended a Kage Summit alongside Kurotsuchi in
Konohagakure

threat
 to the world from Sasuke. Later, after an attack from missing-nin took the lives of several Iwagakure citizens, Ōnoki began research on the
Akuta
. While Akatsuchi and many were impressed by the creatures at first, their unstable nature cause for alarm, making Kurotsuchi, as the Fourth Tsuchikage, to reject her grandfather's proposal.

Mitsuki's Disappearance Arc






Akatsuchi fights Kū.


 In the anime, Akatsuchi was assigned to look over Ōnoki in Iwagakure as his advanced age caught up to him. Later, Kurotsuchi mysteriously disappeared, Akatsuchi helped in a cover story of her leaving the village for reconnaissance to keep the village calm. He then caught wind of five Konoha-nin sneaking into the village and decided to follow them. When he heard about their goal to find Ōnoki for help in dealing with some mysterious Iwa-nin that attacked Konohagakure and took their ally
Mitsuki
. Realising that their goals were noble and probably relating to Kurotsuchi's disappearance, Akatsuchi approached the genin to help them. He brought them to Ōnoki, who at first was delighted to see Boruto and Sarada again. Once they revealed their goal of finding Mitsuki however, Ōnoki's attitude suddenly changed, refusing to help them. As Akatsuchi and the genin begged the Third Tsuchikage to help, a group of
Akuta
 appeared and surrounded Akatsuchi and the genin. Then, the creatures' handler,
Kū
 appeared. He was revealed to be Ōnoki's son and in league with the elderly man, much to the horror of everyone else.

As Ōnoki began explaining the nature of his plans and his genuine desire to protect people, realising that with his secret out in the open, he would have to accelerate his plans before the other Great Shinobi Countries learned. While Ōnoki told his son to gently takes the prisoners away, Boruto and the others chose to resist, and a fight ensured. As the battle escalated a massive column was knocked over towards Ōnoki. He was narrowly saved by Boruto, who then retreated while carrying the elderly man.

As Akatsuchi desperately tried to escape the relentlessly attacking Akuta, he concluded that he had to tell Konohagakure the truth of the situation. He was saved by a mysterious
Anbu
, who quickly destroyed the Akuta, and just as quickly disappeared. Akatsuchi managed to find the Konoha-nin, but he was soon after captured by
Kirara
 and the Akuta. He was soon brought back to the village and put with the rest of the captured villagers, but not before watching Kū usurp Ōnoki on the grounds that the Third Tsuchikage was too sentimental to see their plan through.

After escaping his captors thanks to distraction from Shikadai, Akatsuchi stumbled his way through the village. He was later found by
Sekki
. Akatsuchi explained the situation and tasked him with rescuing the Third Tsuchikage as he was too injured to move anymore. Ultimately, he arrived after the battle was won, mourning the loss of Ōnoki who sacrificed himself to stop the Fabrications. Akatsuchi attended his funeral. Later, Akatsuchi joined Kurotsuchi to visit Konogakure to give an in-person thanks for all Konohagakure did for them.

Akatsuchi and Kurotsuchi attended a Kage Summit in Konoha at the Hokage building, during which the Kage bickered about topics concerning Konoha, leading to Kurotsuchi demanding Konoha to disclose all of its confidential information as the village's proof to peace by the next summit, and said Iwagakure would leave the Five Great Shinobi Country alliance if they didn't. After the demand, the summit ended.

Creation and Conception

Kishimoto
 noted that for Akatsuchi's design, he simply took Ōnoki, and made him larger. Expounding on this, he noted that the nose shape he had created for the Tsuchikage, fit Akatsuchi as well, but noted that he did not intend for Akatsuchi to look like the Tsuchikage's child.

Trivia

Akatsuchi
 (
赤土
) means "Ultisol" or "Red Earth".
