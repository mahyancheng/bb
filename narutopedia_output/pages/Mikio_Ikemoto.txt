Masashi Kishimoto
's third assistant during his fifteen years of working on the
Naruto
 manga. In an assistant spotlight included with
volume 6
 of the manga, Kishimoto listed Ikemoto's duties as: "works as a 'mob', drawing crowds and background figures, adding the white to speed lines, highlights, and characters' eyes, and whiting out any art that goes out of the panel and into the gutter, as well as putting stars in the night sky, and adding in half-tones."

In a 2016 interview published in
Weekly Shōnen Jump
, Kishimoto revealed that Ikemoto also contributed to character designs for the series, notably designing many of the background characters, as well as
Haku
,
Zabuza Momochi
, and
Hiruzen Sarutobi
's battle attire.

Ikemoto illustrated the monthly
Boruto
 manga series, written by
Ukyō Kodachi
 and supervised by Kishimoto. Following Kodachi's leave, Ikemoto took over as the author of this manga and its sequel,
Boruto: Two Blue Vortex
