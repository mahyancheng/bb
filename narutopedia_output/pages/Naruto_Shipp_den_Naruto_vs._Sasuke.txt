Naruto Shippūden: Naruto vs. Sasuke
 is the sixth instalment of the
Ninja Council
 series
.

Gameplay

The game follows the
Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission
.

It incorporates several tag-team specials. The character's sprites are smaller, allowing more action on-screen. Most of the special moves no longer use touch screen in order to be performed. Touch screen controls perform certain techniques. New characters include
Sasuke
 and
Sai
. The online play has been removed, although there is a High Score mode available. There are also side-
missions
 which can be completed to unlock more characters.

The game continues where
Ninja Council 4
 left off.
