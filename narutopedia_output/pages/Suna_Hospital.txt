The
Suna Hospital
 (
砂病院
,
Suna Byōin
,
literally meaning:
 Sand Hospital) is a large spherical building located in the middle of
Sunagakure
 that bears the kanji for "doctor". The building houses a small clinic, which is used to perform check ups and examine patients. The hospital houses a large operation room which serve to allow
medical-nin
 to perform surgery on the critically injured. The medical-nin also have access to a large
green room
, which contains a number of medical herbs that would normally not be capable of growing in the hot, desert climate.

History

At some point in time, due to the
Land of Wind
's
daimyō
 cutting down Sunagakure's military power, the
Fourth Kazekage
 had
Chiyo
 seal the
Shukaku
 inside
Gaara
 becoming Suna's ultimate weapon. As a result of his actions, his wife,
Karura
, died in the hospital's clinic from childbirth. Later on
Kankurō
 would be taken to the clinic for treatment after failing to rescue Gaara who was captured by
Akatsuki
. Due to the complexity of
Sasori
's
poison
, none of the medical-nin present could find a cure, until
Sakura Haruno
 came to guide them in saving Kankurō.
