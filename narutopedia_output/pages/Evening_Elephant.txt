The
Evening Elephant
 is a high-level,
forbidden
 taijutsu that can be performed by those who have opened all
Eight Gates
.

Usage

This technique is a continuous assault of five punches, with each "foot" (
足
,
soku
) — as they are referred to — being performed faster than the one before. Each "foot" creates a cannon of pressurised air bearing the appearance of an
elephant
's leg, causing devastating damage to the opponent. The first punch alone was capable of tunnelling a massive and deep hole in the ground, and the final punch proved strong enough to shatter a
Truth-Seeking Ball
 defence.
 The strength of several of these punches was enough to temporarily immobilise
Madara Uchiha
 as the
Ten-Tails
'
jinchūriki
.
