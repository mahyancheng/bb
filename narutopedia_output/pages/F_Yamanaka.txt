This article is about the Root member. For the jinchūriki, see
Fū
.

Fū Yamanaka
 (
山中フー
,
Yamanaka Fū
,
Viz:
 Foo) was a
shinobi
 from
Konohagakure
's
Yamanaka clan
, as well as a high-ranking shinobi of the disbanded
Anbu
 faction
Root
.

Background






Fū as a child.



In the anime, Fū was among many promising young children from various clans of Konohagakure that was personally selected and recruited by
Danzō Shimura
 to join Root, much to the dismay of
Inoichi Yamanaka
. His training was directly under Danzō's supervision.

Later, already well-adjusted to the workings of Root, he was paired up with the newly recruited
Torune
. Despite some mild mocking on Fū's part, he was tasked with instructing Torune with the workings of Root. Ultimately, the two formed a strong and long-standing friendship.

Personality

Like all other members of the Anbu faction, Root, Fū lacks a personality due to the gruesome training regime
Danzō
 had them undergo at a young age. As such, he acts merely as a tool that carries out Danzō's orders. The only discernible trait that he and the other members have shown is fierce loyalty towards Danzō. As such, he was willing to face
Tobi
 with Torune and Danzō without fear or losing his temper, or even take his own eye out, while possessing
Ao
's body, calling it a "small price to pay" in order to fulfil Danzō's orders.
 In the anime, as a child, he was somewhat cocky and more cheerful. Despite the teachings of Root, Fū genuinely viewed Torune as a trusted friend.

Appearance






Fū's full appearance.



When first introduced, Fū's appearance was that of a regular Konoha Anbu, with a white cloak and mask. When he removed the mask, it was revealed that he was a young man with auburn coloured hair and amber eyes. He wore a short, black jacket with red straps on the shoulders like all members of Root which most likely shows allegiance to the organisation. He also wore a red short kimono under the jacket with a black sash, a pair of black gloves, dark-coloured pants, and regular shinobi sandals.

As a child in Root, he wore a light brown short kimono with a black sash, grey pants, and shinobi sandals. Fū also wore black wristbands on his wrists.

Abilities

Danzō stated that he and Torune were two of the most-skilled ninja in Root.
 Fū was a skilled
sensor
, able to detect that he, Torune and Danzō were still being pursued by Ao.
 He could instantly sense when Tobi
emerged
 behind him and act immediately.
 In the anime, Fū proved to be skilled in
taijutsu
 as a child, able to skilfully deflect a young Torune's attacks without being infected by his
rinkaichū
.
 As an
Anbu
, Fū was also versed in
kenjutsu
, wielding a
tantō
 to deliver
quick slashes
.

Ninjutsu

Yamanaka Clan Techniques






Fū using the Mind Body Switch Technique.



Fū was skilled in the use of the Yamanaka clan's various techniques. Aside from his use of the clan's
Mind Body Switch Technique
, Fū can employ his considerable trap-making skills to use a
cursed seal variant
 which allows him to transfer his consciousness into a scarecrow-like puppet with
kama
 and
kuwa
 for limbs that he can then freely use to attack his target. When the puppet either receives or deals damage to/from the opponent, it automatically activated the cursed seal, switching the user's consciousness into the opponent's mind, while the latter's will be switched into the now-immobile puppet.

Part II

Five Kage Summit

Main article:
Five Kage Summit






The Kage's bodyguards on the offensive.



Danzō
 selected Fū and Torune to escort him to the
Kage Summit
 in the
Land of Iron
. While on route there, they were ambushed by the
Prajñā Group
, but Fū and Torune stood down upon Danzō's orders as their leader wanted to exercise his skills. Once they arrived and the meeting began, Fū and his partner came to Danzō's defence during the
Fourth Raikage
's outburst and
Zetsu
's subsequent appearance. Zetsu informed them of
Sasuke Uchiha
's presence in the Land of Iron, and Fū alongside Torune tried to go and eliminate him but were unable to leave as Danzō, who had attempted to
control

Mifune
 was put under surveillance. Fū later alerted Danzō when Sasuke's
sensor
 located them and subsequently fled with Danzō when Sasuke arrived at their location, but were pursued by
Ao
. At some point, Zetsu's
Spore Technique
 activated while they fled, but they manage to free themselves from the spore-induced clones.






Fū sets a trap for Ao.



After alerting Danzō that they were being followed by Ao, he was instructed by him to stop him, and either retrieve or destroy the
Byakugan
 he possessed. Fū laid several traps, including a
cursed ragdoll
, which attacked Ao, forcing the Kiri-nin to retaliate. This activated the curse and Ao became trapped in the puppet while Fū took control of Ao's body.
 However, in his attempt to remove the eye, Ao's
seal
 decals were activated, and covered the eye. After trying to remove the tags with a kunai, Fū sensed the
Fifth Mizukage
 and
Chōjūrō
 coming and proceeded to bind Ao's hands and tie a
kama
 to a tree branch, telling Ao that he was going to decapitate him so that he could simply take his head. He then jumped down towards the kama, but the Mizukage arrived in time to catch him. Acting as Ao, Fū explained that his body was being controlled, but apologised to her and Chōjūrō for worrying them and asks her to untie his hands. The Mizukage prepared to do so, while also offering to remove the seal from the Byakugan, to which Fū agreed, planning to crush Ao's eye as soon as this was done. However, the Mizukage left his hands bound, and asks Chōjūrō to lend her the
Hiramekarei
, explaining that the real Ao would have never apologised to Chōjūrō in such a manner, and that Ao also knew full-well that even she wasn't able to remove the seal over his eye. Fū then insulted the Mizukage for seeing through his deception before leaving Ao's body.






Fū and Torune fighting Tobi.



Returning to his body, Fū apologises as the mission ended in failure. Arriving at the
Samurai Bridge
, the group is ambushed by
Tobi
. While Danzō prepared for battle, he has Fū and Torune distract Tobi to buy him enough time to undo his
Sealing Arm Braces
. As Torune attacks Tobi, Fū sneaks behind Tobi and tries to use the
Mind Body Switch Technique
 on him, but fails to do so, as Tobi
phases
 through a pillar. Suddenly, Tobi appears behind Fū, who quickly reacts and slashes at him with his tantō, only for the attack to phase through Tobi. Tobi grabs Fū and attempts to hit him, but Torune throws a
kunai
 at him, forcing Tobi to release Fū and go intangible. Fū tries to bait Tobi into attacking him so that Torune can take the opportunity to infect him with his
rinkaichū
. Fū attacks Tobi, but slips pass him, and Tobi pretends to counter-attack. Torune then runs to hit Tobi, but, as part of his plan, Tobi goes intangible, causing Torune to hit Fū instead. Clutching his arm in pain, Torune extracts the bugs, and cures Fū. Before they could battle further, Tobi quickly transports both of them to
another dimension
.

Fū being sacrificed in order to reincarnate Torune.



To alleviate some of his unease surrounding
Kabuto Yakushi
's motives, Tobi demanded that he demonstrate the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 technique to him. Lacking the necessary sacrifices however, Tobi released the captive Fū, and Torune. Both
mentally
, and physically restrained, Torune was killed by Tobi, who then ordered that Fū be used to reincarnate the former. Obliging, Kabuto began the ritual whilst Fū remained motionless at the very centre of the ritual's seal. As ash and dirt begin to surround him, he cried out before both his body and soul are replaced by those of Torune.

Creation and Conception

Wanting a straight-laced, no-nonsense character,
Kishimoto
 noted that it took some time to harden Fū's expression to what it is now. Because he is expressionless, the air of danger around him is even further accentuated. To this effect, Kishimoto noted that he then gave Fū powerful insight to bring out an air of deterrence. Earlier on in the conception stages, Kishimoto had Fū carry his mask strapped to his waist.

Trivia

Studio Pierrot's Settei sheets of Fū show that he was 152 cm tall when he was first partnered with Torune.
