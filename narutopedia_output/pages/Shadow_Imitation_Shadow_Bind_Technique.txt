The
Shadow Imitation Shadow Bind Technique
 is one of the
hijutsu
 utilised by members of the
Nara clan
.

The Nara attaches their shadow to a "host's" own without restricting their movements, or forcing them to mimic their own movement. This allows the host to move freely all the while the Nara's shadow is still attached to their own. Through the shadow, the Nara is able to sense when their combined shadow comes into contact with the target's, basically using the latter's own shadow as an intermediary to link up other shadows in proximity, and they can then bind them with the
Shadow Imitation Technique
.

This technique allows for the Nara to bind multiple targets on a battlefield all while not directly engaging in combat, adding an element of surprise to their companion's attacks.
