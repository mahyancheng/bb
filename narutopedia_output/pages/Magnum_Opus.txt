This
Scientific Ninja Tool
 is a storage device that contains a record of every
ninjutsu
 in the
shinobi
 world including
hiden
 and
kekkei genkai
 in the form of data. Due to this, it's considered valuable enough to sell for a fortune. It appears to be a prototype or a variation of the
Shinobi Gauntlet
.

The value of this device was such that the
Byakuya Gang
 devised a complex plan to distract the military forces of
Konohagakure
 by inducing civilians into protests against the
Kaminarimon Company
, while the gang went to attack the vulnerable
Ninjutsu Research Centre
 to take the Magnum Opus.
Gekkō
, having abandoned and betrayed the rest of the Byakuya Gang so he could keep the profits for himself, nearly escaped with the device with the intention of selling it so he could retire in luxury, but he was caught by the
Seventh Hokage
, and the tool was returned to
Katasuke Tōno
.
