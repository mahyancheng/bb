Lyrics

Rōmaji

Fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki

Muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo

Sotto nusumi mita no

Kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni

Kyou mitai na hi niwa kitto

Mata omoidashite shimau yo

Mou wasureyou kimi no koto zenbu

Konna ni mo kanashikute

Doushite deatte shimattan darou

Me wo tojireba

Ima mo kimi ga soko ni iru you de

Kanji

ふいにあがった花火を二人で見上げた時

夢中で見てる君の顔を

そっと盗み見たの

君のこと嫌いになれたらいいのに

今日みたいな日にはきっと

また思い出してしまうよ

もう忘れよう 君のこと全部

こんなにも悲しくて

どうして出会ってしまったんだろ

目を閉じれば

今も君がそこにいるようで

Rōmaji (Full Version)

Afureru hito de nigiwau hachigatsu matsu no omatsuri

Yukata wo kite geta mo haite karankoron oto o tateru

Fui ni agatta hanabi wo futari de miageta toki

Muchuu de miteru kimi no kao wo

Sotto nusumi mita no

Kimi no koto kirai ni naretara ii noni

Kyou mitai na hi niha kitto

Mata omoidashite shimau yo

Koonna kimochi shiranakya yokatta

Mou nidoto aeru koto mo nai noni

Aitai aitainda

Ima demo omou kimi go ita ano natsu no hi wo

Sukoshi tsukarete futari michibata ni koshikaketara

Tooku kikoeru ohayashi no ne

Hyururira nari hibiku

Yozora ni saita ookina ookina nishiki kamuro

Mou sukoshi de natsu ga owaru

Futto setsunakunnaru

Sakasama no HAATO ga uchi agatteta

Ahaha tte warai atte

Suki da yo tte

KISU wo shita

Mou wasureyou kimi no koto zenbu

Konna ni mo kanashikute

Doushite deatte shimattan darou

Me wo tojireba

Ima mo kimi ga soko ni iru you de

Amai toiki

Binetsu wo obiru watashi ha kimi ni koishita

Sono koe ni sono hitomi ni

Kidukeba toki ha sugi satteku noni

Mada kimi no omokage wo sagashite

Hitori kiri de miageru hanabi ni

Kokoro ga chikuri toshite

Mou sugu tsugi no kisetsu ga

Yatte kuru yo

Kimi to miteta utakata hanabi

Ima demo omou ano natsu no hi wo

English

The festival at the end of August flooded with people

wearing yukata and geta,*

making sounds of click-clack ring.

As the fireworks suddenly went off, we looked up,

and I stole a glance at your enraptured face.

I wish I could hate you.

But during days like today, I will surely

once again remember these memories.

I wish I never knew these feelings.

Yet even though we cannot meet again,

I want to see you. I want to see you.

Even now, I think of the summer days when you were here.

As we sat and rested on the roadside,

we could hear the sound of the ohayashi* far away,

the fluttering echo.

Giant brocade crowns bloom in the night sky.

As summer ends soon,

I suddenly feel sad.

My upside down heart jumped up

as we both laughed “ahaha.”

“I love you.”

And we kissed.

I want to forget everything about you.

As it is, I’m’ still sad.

Why did I ever meet you?

If I close my eyes,

I can feel like you are there even now.

With a sweet sigh,

I feverishly fell in love with you-

That voice, those eyes-

Even though when I realised it, the time had already passed,

I still search for your face.

As I look up at the fireworks by myself,

my heart prickles in pain.

Soon, the next season

will be here.

The ephemeral fireworks I watched with you-

Even now, I think of that summer day.

omake

Bicycle
" in which
