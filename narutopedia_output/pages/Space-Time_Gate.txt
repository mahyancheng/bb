The
Space-Time Gate
 is a
Scientific Ninja Tool
, created by Amado, in order for
Kara
's members to instantaneously travel to and from their
main hideout
  and in between various locations. They are also able to use this gate to transport large objects. When in use, the gate violently surges with electricity.

In the anime, after
Boro
's death,
Jigen
 ordered
Delta
 to destroy the base of the
Ōtsutsuki Cult
, alongside the gate there to ensure no one could use it.

After
Isshiki
's demise,
Code
 disabled or damaged all working gates to prevent anyone from using them to access the organisation's dimension.
