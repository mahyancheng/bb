"
Power of the Five Kage
" (
五影の実力
,
Gokage no Chikara
) is episode 204 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

At the decimated
Valley of Clouds and Lightning
,
Killer B
 emerges from the watery depths and tells the
Eight-Tails
 about his plan to learn enka from
Sabu
, leader of the enka ninja. The Eight-Tails asks why Killer B brought forth his power when he could already had the upper hand, while Killer B merely remarks that
Sasuke
 of the
Sharingan
 is one of the toughest foes he's ever fought. Meanwhile,
Kakashi
 asks
Naruto
 and
Yamato
 not to reveal the truth about
Itachi
 to anyone in the event that it was nothing but a lie.

Back at the
Five Kage Summit
, Sasuke destroys the pillars, causing the roof to collapse. Using his
Susanoo
, he saves himself and
Karin
, whom he only spared so that she could lead him to
Danzō
.
Gaara
 shields himself, his siblings and
Darui
 while the
Fourth Raikage
 uses his massive strength to punch his way out of the rubble.
Suigetsu
 and
Jūgo
 survive as well, with the latter using his
Cellular Regeneration Absorption
 to escape from the brink of death. Karin leads Sasuke to the conference room, where Sasuke is engaged in combat with
Mifune
. During the struggle, Danzō,
Fū
 and
Torune
 escape.

The
Fifth Mizukage
 uses her
Lava Release: Melting Apparition Technique
 and repels Sasuke along with his Susanoo out of the room. She reveals that she possesses two
kekkei genkai
 —
Lava Release
 and
Boil Release
. Using her
Boil Release: Skilled Mist Technique
 to create corrosive acid, she dissolves the
chakra
 surrounding Sasuke's Susanoo and prepares to kill him, as the latter does not have any chakra left to defend himself. However, she is suddenly restrained by
White Zetsu
's
Spore Technique
. Using the spores, White Zetsu absorbs some chakra from the Fifth Mizukage, the
Third Tsuchikage
,
Chōjūrō
 and
Akatsuchi
, passing them on to Sasuke. As Sasuke storms into the
kage
 conference room, he is trapped by the
Tsuchikage
's
Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique
, which seemingly incinerates him into mere particles. The Tsuchikage smirks and tells Karin that she is next while the
Raikage
, who had just stormed into the room, berates him for stealing his kill. At that moment,
Tobi

warps
 into the room carrying the unconscious Sasuke, announcing himself as
Madara Uchiha
 and asks them if they would like to hear about his
Eye of the Moon Plan
.
