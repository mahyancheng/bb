Pain to the World
" (
世界に痛みを
,
Sekai ni Itami o
) is episode 162 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Tsume Inuzuka
 and her dog
Kuromaru
, along with her son
Kiba
 and his dog
Akamaru
, attempt to attack the
Preta Path
 with their
Fang Passing Fang
. The Preta Path uses the body of the
first Animal Path
 to shield the attack while he flees. At the same time,
Shino
,
his father
, and
another member
 of his
clan
 engage in combat against
Konan
, who uses
paper clones
 rigger with
explosive tags
 in an attempt to kill them. In the meantime,
Pain
's
Deva Path
 arrives on the roof of the
Hokage
's office in order to speak with
Tsunade
.

Tsunade recognises the Deva Path as Yahiko, one of the
Ame Orphans
 she had met long ago, and Pain is amused that she remembers him. After expressing their conflicting views on peace, Pain is visibly angered by Tsunade's refusal to surrender the
Nine-Tails
 and accept
Akatsuki
's offer to surrender. Elsewhere,
Ino
,
Inoichi
 and
Shizune
 are uncovering the truth behind the
Six Paths of Pain
 when the
Human Path
 arrives and kills Shizune by
absorbing
 her soul, although he manages to
extract information
 from her mind and discovers that
Naruto
 is at
Mount Myōboku
. Having discovered Naruto's location, the second
Animal Path

summons
 Konan and five Paths (save the Deva Path) to the forest outside the village.

At Mount Myōboku,
Gamatama
 informs Naruto and
Fukasaku
 that
Kōsuke
, the messenger toad they left at Konoha, is deceased, since his name has disappeared from the toad register. Fearing that the
Akatsuki
 are attacking Konoha, Fukasaku tells Naruto to get ready to defend the village as he tasks
Gamaden
 to use the Distant Body Water portal to transport himself immediately to Konoha, where he is to instruct
Shima
 to
summon
 the forces from Mount Myōboku.

In Konoha, Tsunade angers Pain when the former claims that while Konoha's actions in the past may not have been just, they have already experienced pain. Declaring that
Konoha

shall know pain
 for what they did to Yahiko, he notifies Konan that he is going to use
that technique
, and proceeds to shut down the other five bodies as his Deva Path performs a large-scale
Shinra Tensei
, reducing the village to a massive crater.
Sakura
 is saved from the blast by
Katsuyu
 and sheds tears as she notices the ruins around her, crying out for Naruto to come and save them. Right on cue, Naruto arrives in
Sage Mode
, along with Fukasaku,
Gamakichi
,
Gamabunta
,
Gamahiro
 and
Gamaken
.
