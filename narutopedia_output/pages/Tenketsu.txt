Multiple tenketsu.



Tenketsu
 (
点穴
,
English TV:
 Chakra Points,
literally meaning:

pressure point
) are nodes from which
chakra
 can be released. The human body has 361 tenketsu, each of which is located along the
chakra pathway system
. Most
ninja
, even experienced
jōnin
, are only able to release chakra from the tenketsu on their hands or feet in order to perform
jutsu
.
 Members of the
Hyūga clan
 are uniquely able to expel chakra from any or all of their tenketsu, and have created jutsu such as the
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
 to specifically take advantage of that.

Tenketsu are the size of the tip of a needle, too small for even the
Sharingan
 to see.
 Only the
Byakugan
 and
Jōgan
 are able to see another person's tenketsu, enabling a Byakugan-user to attack the tenketsu directly in order to block them, disrupting the flow of chakra and preventing their opponent from using chakra;
 the
Gentle Fist
 style of combat is focused around doing this.

Trivia

Tenketsu are similar to the
Touch of Death
, a fictional ability to kill a person by merely hitting a single point on the body.

Despite it being stated that the Sharingan cannot target the tenketsu, in
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: Bonds
,
Sasuke
 was able to do so to disrupt
Shinnō
's tenketsu with his
Chidori Senbon
.
