Akagi Gang
.

Appearance

Senta has short spiky brown hair and black eyes. He keeps two pieces of his hair longer in the front to frame his face. He wore a dark-coloured T-shirt under his greenish-coloured vest. He had a sword on his left upper thigh. He has a greenish-coloured gauze wrapped around his head tied on the right side. He also wore long lower arm sleeves that were black in colour.

Personality

Senta is a loyal person to his gang, having spent three years trying to fulfill the leader's order, although this, apparently, is partly due to some fear for his family. He is a little cowardly, but at the same time he is ready to do anything to achieve his goal.

He carried a
sword

Part I

Search for Tsunade






Senta and Bunzo beg Naruto for help.



He was sent with his partner,
Bunzō
, to collect money that
Tsunade
 owes to their boss. To blackmail her, they steal the
First Hokage's Necklace
. They believed that the necklace still belonged to Tsunade. However, it really belonged to
Naruto Uzumaki
, who fought them to get the necklace back. Afterwards, they explain their position: Either they get the money back or they have to keep trying to get it back without getting to go home and see their families. Naruto then agreed to help collect on Tsunade's debt. Ironically, they later find out Tsunade had paid their boss back his money when she and
Shizune
 had visited their village a year before.
