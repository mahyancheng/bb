At night,

Momoshiki

Isshiki
's defeat while playing a video game. During a Five
Kage

Shikamaru
 explains they've discovered destroyed
Space-Time Gates
 in several locations, which they believe would be access points to
Kara
's headquarters in
another dimension
.
Naruto
 also raises his concern of no longer being able to investigate the dimension is search of
Kara's Ten-Tails
, but believes it won't pose a threat soon, as the enemy no longer has a suitable sacrifice to cultivate a
God Tree
. They discuss
Code
's goals and motives, and agree to put the highest priority on finding him. The other Kage express some apprehension on the fact most of the intel they have comes from
Amado
. Naruto confesses to not fully trusting him, but finds him reliable enough due to his contributions against Isshiki. The Kage ask Naruto what he'll do if Boruto becomes a threat due to his
Kāma
, and
Gaara
 points out that with
Kurama
's loss, Naruto might not be strong enough to take down another
Ōtsutsuki
, so he might need to take action before Boruto gets taken over again.

Himawari
 is saddened by
Kawaki
 no longer being able to use Naruto's prosthetic.
Sumire
 visits Kawaki, and takes him to have his arm restored by Amado.
Katasuke
 is impressed by it. Kawaki advises them to beware of Amado.
Mitsuki
 notices Boruto's dejected attitude. Katasuke informs Naruto of the acceleration of Boruto's Kāma progression. Naruto wishes to inform Boruto himself. Amado asks Katasuke on the progress of him becoming a member of the
Scientific Ninja Weapons Team
.
Sarada
 finds Mitsuki by himself, and he tells her that Boruto is staying awake out of fear of Momoshiki taking him over. Naruto and
Sasuke
 discuss Boruto's Kāma, and Sasuke reveals he promised Boruto he'd take him out if he became a threat. Naruto informs Boruto of his predicament, and comforts him. Boruto can no longer stay awake and falls asleep. Amado approaches Naruto, and offers him a drug he developed to weaken the
Byakugan
, that might help in preventing Boruto's Ōtsutsuki progression. He explains that he microdosed Kawaki with it for a long time, so
Jigen
 wouldn't notice, which is why Kawaki's progression took longer. Amado also points out that since Boruto has Byakugan potential, he might experience side effects that Kawaki didn't. He admits that he was concerned about Naruto not being able to take action like before, but also reveals he knows what it is like not wanting to lose a child, having had a daughter who died twelve years prior. Naruto gives Boruto the medication, who begins taking it immediately. Mitsuki and Sarada notice the change in Boruto's attitude, and wonder if they'll be able take missions again. Amado is accepted as part of the Scientific Ninja Weapons Team, and gives data for Sumire to compile. Kawaki returns the prosthetic to Naruto, who asks if he wants to become a
genin
. Kawaki says he'll think about it. Naruto tells Shikamaru he wants to host another
Chūnin Exam
, to make up for the one that Momoshiki's attack sidelined.
