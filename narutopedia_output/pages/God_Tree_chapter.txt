"
God Tree
" (
神樹
,
Shinju
) is chapter 646 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Having manifested the
Ten-Tails
, whose stomach begins to open up,
Obito
 mulls over his next step before removing the
barrier
, as the beast transforms into an enormous tree. The tree stretches its roots and grabs hold of the shinobi on the battlefield, absorbing their chakra cloaks and their own chakra, leaving them emaciated, and causing wide-spread  panic at the predicament. As
Gyūki
 confirmed that this was the last and true form of the beast: the "
God Tree
",
Madara
 and
Hashirama
 continue their battle where the
Uchiha
 reveals the history of
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
, the God Tree and the forbidden fruit that it bore once in a millennium, and how chakra became a weapon for man to use as a result of Kaguya consuming the fruit and giving birth to a
son
, who would become known as the Sage of Six Paths as written on the
Naka Shrine
 tablet. He also noted that once the flower bloomed, the eye within it would be reflected onto the moon, casting the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
, and that the one who would complete the plan was he himself. Meanwhile, as
Naruto
 tries to escape the clutches of the tree to very little avail,
Tobirama

slices
 through the branches, but they start to regenerate too quickly for himself, or a chakra depleted Minato to
rescue
 him.
 With Naruto's situation getting dire as both his
Tailed Beast Mode
 mantle and
Sage Mode
 markings disappear,
Hiruzen
 arrives in the nick of time and, after apologising for his late arrival, destroys the branches with his
adamantine staff
 and retreats with Naruto, allowing Tobirama to teleport them all to where
Sasuke
 and
Jūgo
 were surveying the occurrence. Slightly recovering, Naruto looks around in anguish at his fallen comrades, while Obito tells them all to simply give in, and that their suffering would end soon as the flower atop the tree begins to slowly open.

Trivia

In one panel,
B
's
Iron Armour Seal
 appears on both of his shoulders. Oddly, this was not corrected in the tankōbon version.
