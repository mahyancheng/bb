A
taijutsu
 technique that allows the user to disable an opponent by performing a two-fingered thrust at the opponent's
tenketsu
. By doing so, the user can manipulate the flow of
chakra
 within their opponent, similar the the Gentle Fist fighting style. Shira can unblock his opponents' tenketsu, with a single impact with his fist.

While seemingly not hampering the opponent in any other way, it seems to prevent the opponent from initiating the surge of chakra when the
Eight Gates
 are opened.

Trivia

Accurately targeting the tenketsu is normally a near-impossible feat for one without the
Byakugan
. This shows very advanced aim and physiological knowledge on Shira's part.
