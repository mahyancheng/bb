 (
アカボシ
) is a member of the
Magaki Group
, aiming to steal the
Tsuchigumo clan
's
kinjutsu
.

Personality

Akaboshi is portrayed as a calm, serious, and clear-headed individual. The way he orders the rest of the Magaki suggests that he is the leader or second-in-command of the team when
Shiranami
 is not present. He also is a capable analyst as shown when he ordered his team to retreat when faced with Utakata's Six-Tails' chakra.

Appearance

Akaboshi had short, dark hair with sideburns, with a small strand of hair sticking out near his forehead. He had small, black eyes.

Abilities






Akaboshi uses Lightning Release with the aid of his comrades.



Being a part of the Magaki Group, he specialises in
cooperative techniques
 in which he is the one usually launching the jutsu while the rest of his team
transfer
 their chakra to him. He can
see and shatter
 barriers or create a
pyramid shaped barrier
, which explodes after some time, injuring or even killing the ones trapped in it. He can also create a barrier made of
light purple chakra
 that can paralyse and drain an opponent's chakra which
varies
 in strength. If needed, Akaboshi and his teammates can bind an opponent with a
black rope
. Offensively, he can create a
large shard
 that breaks up into smaller shards to impale the opponent, or utilising the
lightning
 nature, he can
slam the ground
 with his hands and cause lightning to travel through the ground to underneath the opponent. With his teammates he can do a
combination transformation
.

Part II

Six-Tails Unleashed

Akaboshi and his group headed to
Mount Katsuragi
 to search for the Tsuchigumo clan's kinjutsu. He was able to destroy the barrier within the mountain with the help of his group. They ran into
Tonbee
, whom Akaboshi and his group defeated quickly. Akaboshi and the others discover that
Hotaru
 has the jutsu and begin searching for her.






Akaboshi and his team use the Hurricane Thunderclap.



Later, Akaboshi and his comrades are seen receiving new orders from a mysterious man. After meeting with their leader, the four-man team encountered
Utakata
, who single-handedly bested the group until they caught him in their
barrier
 technique.

After this, the group headed to the Tsuchigumo Village, where they ambushed Hotaru with the help of the villagers in the hopes of getting the kinjutsu. However, the scroll that
Nangō
 hands him turns out to be a rigged trap, which explodes, allowing Hotaru to escape. Akaboshi and his team pursue Hotaru, and, just after catching her, are interrupted by Utakata, who claims to have business of his own with Hotaru.

After Utakata escaped with Hotaru, Akaboshi and his squad were confronted by their leader, who showed them that Utakata was a
missing-nin
 from
Kirigakure
 with a bounty of 50 million ryō. Akaboshi asked their leader what they should do, to which he began to muse about.






Akaboshi and his team-mates ambush Naruto.



The next day, after
Naruto Uzumaki
 found
Shiranami
, the Magaki leader, whom Naruto thought was an ally, Akaboshi and his comrades ensnared Naruto with
Infinite Embrace
. While Chūshin tortured Naruto, Akaboshi stopped Benten from revealing too much of their plan. Angered at being deceived, Naruto's Nine-Tails chakra activated and broke the jutsu. Telling his team to stand their ground, albeit slightly frightened that Naruto broke the barrier, Akaboshi and the others used
a stronger barrier
 to crush Naruto. Despite this, Naruto was able to get back on his feet. Suddenly, Utakata appeared and got the bandits away from Naruto with
Acid Permeation
. He angrily demanded that the Magaki tell him where they took Hotaru, intimidating them with his Six-Tails chakra. Sensing danger, Akaboshi ordered his team to retreat and join Shiranami in the Tsuchigumo village.

That evening, after Naruto and Utakata returned to the village, it was revealed that all the villagers had been hypnotised to fight the Konoha forces. Akaboshi ordered the villagers to kill the
jinchūriki
. Before any further action could be taken, the rest of
Team Yamato
 arrived in search of Hotaru, with Yamato and Sai cutting off the villagers. Akaboshi used his lightning technique to free the corrupted townspeople and he and the rest of the Magaki engaged Konoha in battle. He swore after Chūshin attempted to attack with his shuriken, only to have Yamato block it with his Wood Release. Eventually, all four of the Magaki were defeated by Team Yamato.
