Darui
 (
ダルイ
) is a shinobi of
Kumogakure
 and the right-hand-man of the
Fourth Raikage
,
 whom he later succeeds as the
Fifth
Raikage
 (
五代目雷影
,
Godaime Raikage
,
literally meaning:
 Fifth Lightning Shadow).

Background

Darui was once a student of the
Third Raikage
. During his training, Darui learned, among other things, the Raikage's unique
black lightning
 technique.
 Along with
C
, he also served as the Third Raikage's support.

In the anime, when
Konohagakure
 and
Sunagakure
 invited other villages to an unscheduled
joint

Chūnin Exams
, the Fourth Raikage was furious at this, taking it as an underhanded scheme to attack Kumogakure. While A flatly told his men to reject
Tsunade
's offer, Darui informed A that he already informed
Killer B
 of this. A quickly instructed Darui and
C
 to prevent B, who was already on his way to leave for the exams, from attending.

Personality

Darui is an easy-going and mellow individual as seen when the Fourth Raikage's over-the-top exit through a window, he tells
C
 that he will simply use the door like normal people do. His personality is also evident through his lazy and languid way of speaking, often times referring to things or events as being "dull" (
だるい
,
darui
) — a pun on his name. While having a laid-back demeanour however, Darui isn't lazy, leaping to the Raikage's defence when the bodyguards of the other Kage reacted to the Raikage destroying the desk he was sitting at.
 Darui is a very apologetic individual, and will even apologise for other people's actions — a trait he stated that he hadn't noticed himself; this attribute leads him to saying "sorry" (
すみません
,
sumimasen
) just as much as the word "dull". He also possesses a strong loyalty to the Fourth Raikage whom he often addresses as "boss" (
ボス
,
bosu
), rather than adding the suffix "sama" to his title as others do. The Fourth in turn, considers Darui his "second right hand",
 and because of this, Darui will just as quickly verbally defend the Fourth as he would physically. Because of this trust, Darui was put in charge of the
First Division
 as well.
 Darui is also quite understanding. When
Naruto
 was late to the five Kage meeting, he quickly defended Naruto by saying that the life of a Kage as well as a father and husband is a busy one. Despite this, Darui still seems to retain his laid back attitude as he sat in a casual and laid back manner during the Kage meeting.

Appearance






Darui in Part II.



Darui is a fairly tall, dark-skinned man with a slightly bulbous nose, black eyes that usually look bored, and shaggy, white hair which covers his left eye. He wears a high-collared, sleeveless uniform with loose fitting pants, bandages on his wrists and the one-strap-over-one-shoulder
flak jacket
 of a Kumogakure shinobi.

Darui also has stylised characters for
water
 (
水
) and
lightning
 (
雷
)
tattooed
 on his right and left shoulders respectively, denoting his chakra's nature affinities,
Water Release
 and
Lightning Release
, as well as the fact that he has a kekkei genkai, the
Storm Release
.
 The tattoo on his left arm also signifies that he has inherited the Third Raikage's
black lightning
. He carries a broad, foldable,
cleaver
-
like

sword
, strapped to his back, when outside the village.

Years after the Fourth Shinobi World War and becoming Raikage, Darui became noticeably taller and muscular. He also grew a small moustache, and gained creases at the corner of his mouth, which is similar to his predecessor. While his attire was mostly unchanged, he began wearing a hood in place of the high-collar he wore before.

Abilities






Darui simultaneously using two chakra natures.



Darui is a highly skilled and capable shinobi: being chosen as one of the Fourth Raikage's bodyguards and his right-hand man, as well as be placed as leader of the
First Division
 of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. His prowess ultimately allowed him to defeat the
Gold and Silver Brothers
, who wielded the
Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths
, nearly single-handedly.
 Years later, Darui gained a great increase in skill, which enabled him to become the Fifth Raikage.

Physical and Chakra Prowess

Darui has shown impressive speed, being able to coordinate a combined assault on Taka alongside the
lightning-enhanced
 Fourth Raikage, as well as protect C from a sneak attack by Suigetsu.
 By the time he had became Raikage, his taijutsu skills were compared to those of Naruto and
Sasuke
 by
Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki
.
 Darui also possesses considerable chakra reserves and stamina, as he did not die of exhaustion after using
three

of

the

Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths
 and still had enough chakra to continue fighting effectively.

Ninjutsu

Nature Transformation






Darui using his Storm Release: Laser Circus.



Darui is proficient in
wind
,

water
 and
lightning

nature transformations
. He is able to effectively catch an enemy in a
water wall
 and
channel lightning
 through it to electrocute them.
 Darui can also use Lightning Release to
enhance
 his weapons, giving it enough power to cut through a
metal blade
.
 By combining his water and lightning-natures, he can utilise
Storm Release
, allowing him to fire
beams of light
 that he can freely guide like missiles.






Darui generating black lightning.



Darui can use black lightning — a special form of lightning passed down solely to him by his teacher, the Third Raikage,
 making his lightning techniques even more powerful.
 With the black lightning, he can use techniques such as the
Lightning Release: Black Panther
 to immobilise or kill several enemies. In the anime, he can even increase the
power and effectiveness
 of the technique by using a
shadow clone
.

Kenjutsu

Usually, Darui wields a
broad and fairly long sword
 that is peculiar in comparison to others swords in that it folds in two to be sheathed and unfolds when in use. He has exceptional skills in
kenjutsu
, able to clash with Suigetsu's
Kubikiribōchō
 and defeat him by pinning him to a wall with his lightning-imbued sword. He could also literally disarm
Ginkaku
 and
Kinkaku
 during their battle,
 and knock Ginkaku into Kinkaku's
Kōkinjō
 while quickly seizing the
Shichiseiken
 and
Benihisago
.
 After becoming Raikage, his kenjutsu skills are capable of pressuring
Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki
 and have him on the defensive.

Part II

Five Kage Summit

Main article:
Five Kage Summit






The Kage's bodyguards on the offensive.



Darui and C were chosen to escort the Fourth Raikage to the
Kage Summit
 in the
Land of Iron
. Shortly after they had arrived and the meeting began, Darui and C had to rush to the Raikage's defence following his outburst and subsequent destruction of the table he was seated at, standing between the Raikage and the other Kage's bodyguards whom had interpreted this as an aggressive action towards their own respective leaders. Signalled to stand down, they each returned to their posts and things settled down, only to again come to the Raikage's side when
White Zetsu
 appeared later during the meeting. White Zetsu revealed that Sasuke Uchiha,
Killer B
's captor, was nearby, so Darui and C accompanied the Raikage to track Sasuke down. When the Raikage broke down a wall to leave, Darui emphatically apologised for both it and the table before departing.






Darui clashing with Suigetsu.



When they located Sasuke and his
team
,
Suigetsu
 immediately charged at C when the battle got underway. Darui however, intercepted his attack and the two men exchanged blows with their respective swords. Darui was ultimately victorious, as he imbued his sword with
lightning
-natured chakra and pinned Suigetsu to a wall. He then tended to C — who had been knocked unconscious by Sasuke's
genjutsu
 — and they both looked upon the Raikage as he grew increasingly enraged and reckless during his fight with Sasuke. The
Sunagakure

delegation
 soon arrived to provide assistance, and Darui joined forces with them while C healed the Raikage, and bombarded Sasuke with a devastating attack.
 Using
Susanoo
, Sasuke survived their assault and destroyed the pillars that supported the building, causing the roof to collapse in on them; Darui was protected from the falling debris by the
Fifth Kazekage
's
sand
. With Sasuke's escape and everyone unharmed, Darui and C returned to the Summit hall, where
Tobi
 explained his
Eye of the Moon Plan
 to them. As part of his explanation he revealed that B only pretended to be captured, leading Darui to state that this revelation did not surprise him at all.

After the formation of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, Darui joined the Raikage in searching for B. They were drawn to the site of his battle with
Kisame Hoshigaki
 and arrived just in time for Darui to stop Kisame's attempt to cut off B's legs: breaking the
blade
 with a lightning-infused
shuriken
. When the so-called
"Kisame"
 was eliminated, they all returned to Kumogakure. Despite Darui's desire to rest,
Mabui‎
 requested a full debriefing of what had happened since they left. Darui later attended a war council meeting convened by the Raikage.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Main article:
Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Darui was placed in charge of the
First Division
 of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. He and his platoon mobilised alongside the others but soon break off and headed for the coast of the
Land of Lightning
 to defend against an approaching portion of the
Akatsuki
 forces. Before the opposing army made landfall, Darui launched the first attack, using his
Lightning Release: Black Panther
 technique to electrocute dozens of
White Zetsu Army
 clones as they marched through the sea towards land. Darui confronted the
reincarnated

Gold and Silver Brothers
 where he apologised to them for needing to defeat them and tarnish their reputations even further.






Darui severs Kinkaku's arm.



As the battle ensued, he is joined by
Samui
 and
Atsui
 as the two brothers revealed their weapons of choice: the
Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths
. During the battle, few White Zetsu clones tried to ambush them, but they are easily defeated by Atsui's
attack
. Darui tried to stop Atsui before he rushed off to face
Kinkaku
 and
Ginkaku
 and looked on as both Atsui and Samui were hit with the
Kōkinjō
 and had their
"word souls
" (
言霊
,
kotodama
) severed later horrified when Atsui was sucked into the
Benihisago
 and Samui is taken hostage. Apologising to Samui for what he was about to do, he severed Kinkaku's arm and used his
Storm Release: Laser Circus
 attack hitting both Kinkaku and Ginkaku — who are shocked to see that the missiles from the attack were guided. This assault ended somewhat in defeat as Samui is absorbed into the Benihisago and Darui was hit with the Kōkinjō and his word soul severed with the
Shichiseiken
.






Darui surprises Ginkaku after escaping the gourd.



Having gained a good idea of how the tools worked by watching what happened to Atsui and Samui, Darui knew he could avoid being caught in the Benihisago by not saying his most-said word: "dull" (
だるい
,
darui
). However, he inadvertently uttered the word when he admonished the brothers and stated, "Ore wa Bosu no migiude
da. Rui
jihin janē! (
「オレはボスの右腕だ。類似品じゃねェ!」
,
I'm the Boss' right arm. I'm no imitation!
)". As he is sucked in, he started apologising to every-one saying "sorry" (
すみません
,
sumimasen
) three times, making that his most-said word and thus stopping the suction. After his escape, Darui launched an attack immediately with his sword and was able to knock Ginkaku into the Kōkinjō and commandeered both the Shichiseiken and the Benihisago. After looking at his changed most-said word, he realised that he was very apologetic by nature and stated that he'd accept that. He then launched a new tactic and distracted Kinkaku by throwing his
sword
 at him and then followed up with his Laser Circus technique again which buffeted Kinkaku, giving him a chance to sever Ginkaku's word soul with the Shichiseiken.






Darui sealing Ginkaku in the Benihisago.



Ginkaku then said his most used word, "Kinkaku" (
キンカク
) in pleading for his brother to help him, and got sealed inside the Benihisago. As he began to suffer from the massive chakra drain of the Treasured Tools, Darui witnessed Kinkaku turn into his
six-tailed, Version 2 form
 and rampaged on the battlefield. To stop Kinkaku, headquarters
sent
 Darui the
Kohaku no Jōhei
 and
Team 10
 to provide support for him. While
Shikamaru
 and
Chōji
 distracted Kinkaku,
Ino
 used her
Mind Body Switch Technique
 to take possession of Kinkaku's body.






Darui sealing Kinkaku in the Kohaku no Jōhei.



Darui then called out to Kinkaku and Ino forced Kinkaku to respond, activating the Kohaku no Jōhei and sucking Kinkaku in. As Kinkaku was sealed he wondered how he, and his sibling could've been defeated by "
copper
" pieces, and Darui responded stating that when you have a bunch of copper coins, together they can be worth just as much as a gold coin. With the
Kōkinjō
 getting sealed along with Kinkaku, Darui had no way to use the Benihisago but nevertheless hung onto it, hoping to find a way to free Samui and Atsui. In the meantime, he helped subdue the reincarnated
Kakuzu
 and by nightfall, Kakuzu and the rest of Akatsuki's forces had been dealt with. Before they could claim victory however, Tobi appeared on the battlefield with the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
. While the statue wreaked havoc, Tobi confronted Darui and tried to take the Benihisago and the Kohaku no Jōhei. Fearing Tobi's intentions, Darui and Shikamaru tried to stop him, only to be attacked by the statue. They are saved by Chōji and
Kitsuchi
 respectively but this allowed Tobi to escape with the tools. With this, they start retreating as night began to fall.

The next morning, Darui and the other shinobi were made to stand apart inside circles until
Naruto
 could arrive on the battlefield and weed out the
impostor
 shinobi which had taken the form of their comrades during the night and was wreaking havoc and confusion on the allied shinobi. Darui later expressed his disbelief that the Raikage had actually agreed to let the
jinchūriki
 out of confinement upon hearing that Naruto was headed to the battlefield.

Darui and the Allied Shinobi Force confront the Ten-Tails.



Upon arriving on the battlefield where they were, Darui announced that the remainder of his division had arrived. With this, he and the other members of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 stood to face their opposition. Following the strategy relayed to them by
Shikaku
, Darui and C, along with several other Kumo-nin, begin the assault. With C and others amongst their ranks blinding the enemy with the
Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar
 technique, Darui and several other Storm Release bearers, used the
Storm Release: Laser Circus
 technique to aim for the beast's eye. Backed up by the
medic-nin
 Sakura, Darui attempted to attack Obito Uchiha with a Storm Release attack but is quickly repulsed by the now fully-matured Ten-Tails who had escaped the hole which it had seemingly been trapped in.

Darui later cautioned the other shinobi not to act rashly who wanted to go to the front to fight alongside the Hokage. This was seconded by
Hashirama Senju
 who told them not to act carelessly. Darui would later assist the other shinobi battling
Tobi
. When tremors were felt around the battlefield, Darui informed everyone to brace for impact from the meteorite. He later fell victim to the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 along with the others.

Darui informs A of many Kumo shinobi missing and a Kirigakure ship that recently arrived at the border is missing its occupants. As A sends word to Konohagakure, Darui suggests they have B help with the investigation but A refused.

When Sasuke finds and delivers the missing Kumo shinobi to their village, Darui, despite his mixed feelings for Sasuke, thanks him for his help.

In the anime, instead of Sasuke delivering the shinobi to Kumo, Darui instead joined the Fourth Raikage and C travel to the
Coliseum
 personally, where they not only announced their intentions to safeguard all of the shinobi Sasuke had just freed, but also arrested all of the spectators and patrons for the illegal gambling they were conducting. Despite many attempting to escape, the Kumo-nin surrounded the arena's doors and successfully arrested all of the spectators and patrons except for
En Oyashiro
, who managed to quietly escape.

Darui attends the Five Kage Summit in Konoha.



Upon becoming the Fifth Raikage, Darui attended a meeting in
Konohagakure
 with the four other Kage, where Sasuke came forth to reveal evidence of a new White Zetsu Army being formed and a potential threat even greater than Kaguya. Ultimately, it was agreed to keep all this a secret from the public and to allow Sasuke to continue his research and investigate his sources further.

Fifteen years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Darui attended the Five Kage Summit in Konoha accompanied by his bodyguard
Omoi
. When the Tsuchikage and Mizukage commented on the Hokage's late arrival, Darui asked for them to forgive him as they were all very busy.

Momoshiki
 and
Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki
 attack. After Naruto is kidnapped and taken to
another dimension
, Darui and the three other Kage joined Sasuke on his rescue mission, stating that if they ignored the Hokage's plight, the Kage would not only tarnish their reputations but their friendship.

During the battle, Darui fought Momoshiki and clashed with him several times. Once Momoshiki turns Kinshiki into a chakra fruit and absorbs him, Darui,
Kurotsuchi
 and
Chōjūrō
 get overpowered, leaving Naruto and Sasuke fight him. Momoshiki ends up restraining the Kage and Sasuke with the
Shadow Imitation Technique
, and before he could finish them off,
Boruto Uzumaki
 intervenes and strikes him with his

Code's Assault Arc

Following the defeat of
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
, Naruto had a Kage Summit set up via video. The other Kage were caught up on the newest developments. They speculated that Code, as a devout follower of Isshiki, would seek to kill all those responsible for killing Isshiki, and completing the growth of the Ten-Tails. As everyone was concerned to hear about a new Ten-Tails, Darui voiced his concerns about
Amado
, the defector from Kara. Naruto admitted he still didn't fully trust Amado, but was willing to give him a chance based on his contributions up to that point. They asked what Naruto would do with his son if Momoshiki took over Boruto completely through the
Kāma
. Naruto swore he would handle the matter as it was needed to be done.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations
, Darui is a support-only character.

Creation and Conception

With Darui's design,
Kishimoto
 noted that he wanted to immediately convey a sense of sluggishness. His collar is worn upturned for a sense of stylishness, and the two tattoos on his shoulders are there as challenges to his opponents, as well as to signify that he possesses a kekkei genkai.

Trivia

"Darui" (
怠い
) is Japanese for "sluggish" or "dull", referring to his lazy, languid way of speaking.

A running gag with Darui is that every time A destroys a wall when leaving a room, Darui apologises for A and tries to use the door while C thinks they should just use the hole in the wall as well.

Darui is the only person to become Raikage who isn't named "A".

However, he is referred to as "A" in
Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
 in his New Era costume, suggesting it is a name taken on.

While Darui finds most things to be "dull", he is generally enthused by his unique hairstyle.

Quotes

(To the
Gold and Silver Brothers
) "
It kills me to do this to such great men. Some of that Silver and Gold plating may start to flake off a little when my Storm Release hits you! Even if it's a little dull!
"

(To
Ginkaku
)
"I'm the Boss' right arm. I'm no imitation!"
 (
「オレはボスの右腕だ。類似品じゃねェ!」
,
"Ore wa Bosu no migiude da. Rui jihin janē!"
)

(To
Kinkaku
) "
It's true that words can be used as tools, to lie and deceive. But when it really counts… (pointing to heart) — they're also the only way to tell the truth about how you feel right
here
.
"

(To Kinkaku upon defeating him.) "
Silver and gold may shine more brightly than copper, and are more valuable because of it. But if you gather enough copper together, it's worth just as much as that one gold coin. You acted like you were solid gold, but I guess it was all a front… that's why we won! Sorry we had to strip off that gold plating.
"
