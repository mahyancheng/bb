A
taijutsu
 breathing method that
Shira
 invented by gathering up large amounts of oxygen to increase his lung capacity fourfold, he is granted strength similar to the

The

 (

The
second activation
 (

daini kassei
) causes his body to expand slightly, his muscles becoming distinctly more prominent.

The
third activation
 (
第三活性
,
daisan kassei
