In order to enter the
Uchiha
's secret meeting place under the
Naka Shrine
, one must perform a specific technique, akin to a password. Performing the technique moves a slab of rock which has the
Sharingan
 wrapped in sealing formulae in the centre, revealing stairs to the meeting place. Despite the destruction of the Naka Shrine, the rock still guards the secret entrance.
