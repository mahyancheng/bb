The user has a large amount of their
kikaichū
 spread out over a wide area around themselves, having them emit a small amount of the chakra they usually feed on to confuse
sensor-type
 shinobi. As the insects' irregular distribution and grouping together result in the creation of numerous chakra signals, it makes it more difficult to distinguish the user's actual location.

Trivia

The name of this technique is another case of an English word being given kanji, similar to many techniques used by
Kumogakure
 shinobi.

"Mingu" (
民具
,
literally meaning:
 folk tools) — as used in the name of this technique — are common, everyday items that have become so symbolic of the traditional Japanese way of life, that they are now regarded as a kind of folk art.
