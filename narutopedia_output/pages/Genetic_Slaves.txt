"
Genetic Slaves
" (

,
Idenshi no Dorei
) is chapter 700+7 of the
Naruto Gaiden
 mini-series.

Summary

Shin
 assures
Sakura
 that as his "children" are actually
his clones
, they're expendable. Sakura disapproves of this, comparing him to
Orochimaru
, prompting Shin to divulge his former role a test subject for Orochimaru's cloning experiments.
Naruto
 fails to
sense
 Sakura's
chakra
 and discusses with
Sasuke
 the possibility of Shin being connected with Orochimaru due to the similarities between his
Sharingan
-filled arm and
Danzō
's.
 They decide to pay Orochimaru a visit and take
Sarada
 and
Chōchō
 with them, so they're better protected. Chōchō tries to dispel the heavy atmosphere by offering chips. Shin explains to Sakura his philosophy about life, death and evolution, which she criticises. Naruto and Sasuke meet up with
Yamato
 outside of Orochimaru's hideout, who stays outside in order to pursue Orochimaru should something go wrong. Sasuke leads the way inside, and the group encounters
Jūgo
 and
Suigetsu
, who Sarada recognises from her father's photo. They're all joined by Orochimaru. Sasuke questions him about Shin, and Orochimaru tells him of Shin's admiration of Itachi, as well as his usefulness as a cloning test subject. On a way to another room, Sarada pulls Suigetsu aside and asks him about
Karin
, learning she's in another hideout. Naruto notices their absence. Surprised about Sarada's predicament, Suigetsu aids her in running a DNA test with a sample retrieved from Karin's belongings and a cheek swab from Sarada. The test is a match, and Suigetsu declares Karin to be Sarada's mother. Naruto listens from around the wall. Suigetsu leaves as Sarada begins crying and is berated by Naruto on his way out. Naruto approaches Sarada, telling her they have to rescue Sakura, but she snaps at him with her Sharingan activated, accusing him and everyone else of lying to her her entire life, as well as denouncing any relation to Sakura.
