Hyōi Yorishiro
 (
依代ヒヨウイ
,
Yorishiro Hyōi
) is a infamous thief listed in the
Bingo Book
. He would regularly infiltrate villages and steal their valuables or information to sell to others.

Personality

As a longstanding thief, Hyōi is immoral by nature. He cares not how his actions can affect others, only on the prize and how he will prosper from it. He is also very arrogant, constantly assuming that he will not be caught and as such gets careless.

Appearance

Hyōi is a man of below-average height with fair skin and a skinny build. He has brown eyes, no eyebrows, and brown hair styled as a high pompadour with a streak of red going down the centre. He wears a simple grey vest and pants with white straps around his midsection.

Abilities

Hyōi excels in infiltration, enough to earn a spot in the Bingo Books. His signature skill is to
disguise his chakra
 to perfectly imitate another person. It is effective enough to fool an advanced
Sensing Barrier
. Combining it with the
Transformation Technique
, he can effectively move about places unnoticed.

New Era

Hyōi's string of thefts eventually brought him to
Konohagakure
, where he impersonated a local worker. As he casually began collecting goods, he was found out by
Inojin Yamanaka
, who detected a small fluctuation in Hyōi's disguised chakra. Hyōi was swiftly subdued by Inojin and his friends, prompting the
Konoha Barrier Team
 to begin researching and developing in filters for their security system to detect such disguises.
