The
Self-Repairing Barrier
 is a Cooperation Ninjutsu that by linking
chakra
 from a
team of ninja
, will create a barrier which if damaged, will constantly repair itself with said chakra that emanates from their bodies. The barrier also prevents those outside of it from
sensing
 anything inside it through traditional methods.

The users can erect as much as 36 barriers, with the highest number being able to stop and contain any individual
jinchūriki
. It proved to be strong enough to take a direct
Tailed Beast Ball
 from
Killer B
, with only nine of the thirty-six barriers shattering. However,
Naruto Uzumaki
 transformed into his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 and forced the Tailed Beast Ball to push the rest of the way through with B following, showing it could not withstand the assault of two jinchūriki.

Trivia

The technique required the combined chakra of six individuals.
