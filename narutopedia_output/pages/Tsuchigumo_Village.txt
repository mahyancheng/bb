The
Tsuchigumo village
 is the village of the
Tsuchigumo clan
. It is led by the
Tsuchigumo chief
. This village is composed of the members of the Tsuchigumo clan who refused to follow
En no Gyōja
 to
Mount Katsuragi
, and consequently denied the Tsuchigumo clan
kinjutsu
. They were made into pawns by the
Magaki Group
, who sought the kinjutsu.

Part II

Six-Tails Unleashed

When
Team Yamato
 brought
Hotaru
 back to the Tsuchigumo village, the people of the village weren't pleased to see her again. The chief approached them seemingly happy to see Hotaru's return to the village. As Team Yamato left, he takes Hotaru to a room to rest, only to lock her in there with the
Magaki Group
 who was after the
Tsuchigumo clan kinjutsu
. After Hotaru escaped the ninja bandits and they followed her,
Naruto
 returned to the village and asked the chief what happened. He told Naruto that the village had yet to begin their search for Hotaru, so Naruto and his team went to search for her.

They later appeared as a mind-controlled horde, used by the Magaki group against
Sakura
,
Sai
,
Yamato
, Naruto and
Utakata
. After the Magaki group's defeat, the Tsuchigumo village was freed from their control and the chief stated that he and the villagers would accept Hotaru with the kinjutsu gone.
