Summary

Opening his eyes,
Naruto
 is greeted by an unfamiliar person floating above him. Initially believing that he was dead, Naruto soon becomes preoccupied with leaving in order to re-enter the battle. Adding further to his confusion, the young man is unable to comprehend what the stranger is trying to say to him. As a result the latter constantly changes his dialect before finally speaking in a manner that Naruto can understand. With this, the elder reveals himself as none other than the Sage of Six Paths:
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
.
 Awed but still confused, Naruto listens intently as the Sage regaled the story of how his mother
Kaguya
 had consumed the fruit of the Shinju, how he and his brother had fought the beast to redeem their mother, and how he eventually
split up
 that power. He went on to tell Naruto of how he came to father two children of his own: his first born
Indra Ōtsutsuki
 who was hailed as a solitary genius, and
Asura Ōtsutsuki
 who was initially discarded as no good. Because of this Asura came to rely upon the power of cooperation from others to achieve anything before finally coming into his own power through gruelling hard work. Reconciling with his youngest son's ideals, the Sage left Asura to inherit the world to make it a better place. The Sage explained that like himself, his sons' chakra had transmigrated through time and had constantly been reincarnated into new hosts — most recently with Asura inhabiting Naruto.
