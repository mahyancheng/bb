"
Assault on the Leaf Village!
" (
木ノ葉襲撃!
,
Konoha Shūgeki!
) is episode 157 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Pain
 begins his invasion on
Konohagakure
, killing the border
shinobi
 without difficulty. He assigns the
Asura Path
,
Animal Path
 and the
Preta Path
 to the assault team while the
Naraka Path
,
Deva Path
 and
Human Path
, along with
Konan
, are ordered to search for
Naruto Uzumaki
. Using his
Rinnegan
, Pain senses the
barrier
 shielding the village, Pain tricks the
Konoha Barrier Team
 into expecting only one intruder when he has the Animal Path enter the barrier through the air, only for the Animal Path to summon the other five once inside the village.

Back at
Mount Myōboku
,
Shima
 heads to Konoha in order to procure ingredients for dinner while
Fukasaku
 divulges the downsides of
Sage Mode
 to Naruto. He explains that the user must stand still and focus in order to enter Sage Mode, and Naruto dismisses the
senjutsu
 training as a waste of time. However, Fukasaku reveals that during Jiraiya's
fight with Pain
, Jiraiya summoned him and Shima so that they could sit still on his shoulder and gather the
natural energy
 needed while Jiraiya fought, and that Naruto could do the same thing if he needs to use Sage Mode in battle.

Meanwhile,
Inoichi
 performs a
mind-reading technique
 on
Yūdachi
, an
Ame
-nin captured by
Jiraiya
. After some arduousness, Inoichi succeeds in getting through the
mind blocks
; however, his daughter
Ino
 rushes in to alert the
Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force
 that Konoha is under attack. Back at the hospital, Shizune and her team are performing an autopsy on the previous Animal Path corpse, and she discovers that the rods pierced in the Animal Path's body are
chakra receivers
 that are currently gathering
chakra
. After the
explosion
 that occurred,
Sakura
 encounters a
Giant Centipede
 summoned by the new Animal Path and defeats it with a single blow, saving a woman and her grandchild.
Iruka
 tells Sakura to head to the
Konoha Hospital
 as the other
chūnin
 attempt to protect their village.

In her office,
Tsunade
 is told by the
Konoha Barrier Team
 that they only detected one intruder, although there are many more currently assaulting the village. One of the
Anbu
 members notifies her that the intruders are wearing black robes with red clouds; realising that the
Akatsuki
 have finally come for them, and remembering Fukasaku's remarks about Naruto being the
Child of the Prophecy
, Tsunade orders them to retrieve Naruto.

Trivia

When Shikamaru tells
Shiho
 about members of Akatsuki who are immortal, Hidan's
forehead protector
 is mistakenly depicted with a symbol of
Amegakure
 rather than
Yugakure
.
