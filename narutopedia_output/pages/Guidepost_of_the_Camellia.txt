Guidepost of the Camellia
" (
椿の道標
,
Tsubaki no Michishirube
) is episode 108 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

After
Yūkimaru
 reveals to the
Orochimaru Search Team
 that
Naruto
 and
Guren
 are trapped inside the
Three-Tailed Turtle
 and that he knows how to find the
tailed beast
,
Kakashi
 orders
Lee
,
Tenten
,
Kiba
 and
Akamaru
 to deal with
Team Guren
 while the others try to locate the beast and rescue Naruto.

Inside the beast, Naruto's
shadow clones
 are taken out by the
Three-Tails mini clones
. Naruto tells Guren to save herself while he attempts to fight off a big turtle clone, only for Guren to block an attack towards Naruto with her
Crystal Release: Jade Crystal Blade
. Finding a hole above them, Naruto picks up an embarrassed Guren and uses two
shadow clones
 to propel them upwards. Guren asks Naruto why he saved her life and he retorts that he didn't have to, the same way that she didn't have to save him. Noticing her wound, he tells her to stay put as he attempts to find a way out, only to wander into an
Illusionary Mist
 emitted by the Three-Tails. Within the mist, he sees an illusion of
Sasuke
, who proceeds to slash at him with his
sword
. As Naruto cries out for "Sasuke" to stop, Guren decides to interfere by jumping into the mist, where she confronts an illusion of
Yūkimaru's mother
, where she begs her for forgiveness and promises to atone for her sin by protecting Yūkimaru with her life. Having conquered her fear, the effect of the mist wears off on her as she locates Naruto and slaps him, undoing the
genjutsu
. Hearing him cry out Sasuke's name, she asks him if he is referring to Sasuke Uchiha; Naruto is surprised that she knows of him and she replies that she had seen him with
Orochimaru
 many times. She is shocked when Naruto tells her that his goal is to rescue Sasuke from Orochimaru and begins to laugh as she recalls Sasuke's prowess and the idea of Naruto going up against him to rescue him.

Meanwhile, the
cursed seal
 enhanced members of Team Guren engage against Lee, Tenten, Kiba and Akamaru. On the surface of the lake, Yūkimaru has
Sai
 drop camellias into the lake while Kakashi and
Yamato
 use their
Lightning Cutter
 and
Wood Release
 to puncture a hole into the Three-Tails' barrier. This creates a hole inside the turtle, where both Naruto and Guren see the camellias floating, realising that Yūkimaru is showing them a way out. Before they escape, Guren tells Naruto that it was she who killed Yūkimaru's mother, under Orochimaru's orders, and that she would die saving Naruto so that he may protect Yūkimaru. Knowing that Guren is a changed person, he picks up Guren and heads towards the hole, using his
Rasengan
 to blast it open.
