Trivia

Naruto
 episodes 210–220 English airdates refer to their broadcast on
YTV
 in Canada due to the anime's cancellation by
Cartoon Network
 in the United States. To date, these episodes remain unaired on U.S. television.

Naruto: Shippūden
 episodes 339–500 weren't broadcasted in the United States, so English airdates for those episodes refer to availability as DVD releases.

Episodes 99–166 English airdates also refer to their DVD releases, due to the lengthy time gap between their availability and their first streaming broadcast on
Neon Alley
.

In 5 years later, the English airdates finally began broadcast aired on
Adult Swim
 in the United States on 339 episodes, were the Neon Alley English airdates ended on March 25, 2016 and streaming shut down before on May 4, 2016.

Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 episodes 1–52 English airdates refer to their broadcast on
Adult Swim
 in the United States. Since the series was removed from rotation after the 52nd episode, subsequent episodes will refer to availability as DVD releases.
