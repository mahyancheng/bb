Synopsis

Hana
 announces a practical training session for the class for the next day, and sorts the students into teams of three.
Himawari
 is placed with
Kae
 and
Sōsha
,
Kawaki
 with
Harika
 and
Soul
. Hana wants them to strengthen their team-work. On their way home, Himawari discusses Kawaki's
mission
 with him, assuring him she'll look after Kae during the exercise. Kawaki doesn't fist bump her, and instead warns her not to let Kae find out about his mission. The next day, Sōsha and Himawari pick Kae to be team leader. Harika and Soul pick Kawaki as leader over being older. Hana says the best team will get a gift from her.
Konashi
 tries talking to Kae, but changes his mind.
Eiki
 and
Osuka
 get into a rivalry over whose team is stronger. Hana warns everyone not to go too deep into the forest. The first is a
Tree Climbing Practice
 relay race. Kawaki's focus on protecting Kae distracts him from performing for his team, who complain about it to him. Eiki's team with
Suzu
 and
Neon
 performs the best in this test. Kawaki also gets distracted during a
shurikenjutsu
 test, Himawari's team placing first. They stop to make lunch. Instead of using sticks to make fire,
Kande
 uses
Lightning Release
, impressing his team-mates.
 Hana gives them ingredients and a curry recipe to follow. Himawari has to pull Kawaki aside to explain Eiki has a crush on Kae when he misunderstands Sōsha's gossip. Harika pulls Kawaki back towards their team with her
kikaichū
. Konashi continues to lurk around Kae. Soul and Harika complain about Kawaki not contributing, so Harika takes over as leader. They hand his curry, and tell him to focus on the afternoon tests. While cleaning up, Kae splits off from the group, so Himawari asks for Kawaki's help.
Mimi
 gives Himawari directions she saw Kae take, and reminds her of Hana's warning about going deep into the forest. Kawaki finds Konashi blaming himself for something relating to Kae. Kae waits by a big tree, with a noting asking her to meet her for advice. Himawari finds her, but she's not the one who asked Kae to meet. Konashi was the one who asked her to meet, but fled when coming across a flame bear. He wanted to ask her opinion on his sweets for an upcoming competition, his family owning a sweets shop for generations, but was too shy to ask in front of everyone. Himawari and Kae run from the bear, and Hana acts as a decoy for them to escape,
distracting
 the bear and attacking it with her
Wind Release
. Kawaki and Konashi finds Himawari and Kae, who inform them that Hana is fighting the bear. The bear's flames overcome Hana's Wind Release, and Kawaki arrives in time to kick the bear off of her, defeating it with one punch. He admonishes Hana for being unable to defeat the bear, and Konashi becomes star-struck by Kawaki, inspirited not to be embarrassed anymore. Meeting up with Kae's team, Konashi apologises for not showing up, and asks about his sweets. Kae gives them a positive critique. Soul and Harika overhear that Kawaki faced something head-on, and criticise him for always bailing on them. During the afternoon tests, Kawaki outperforms everyone else, changing his team-mates opinion of him. At the end of the day, Kae's team is the one with most points. Himawari is sad she didn't make a good team with Kawaki, but he concedes she did protect Kae. He instead complains about Hana. Konashi begins looking up to Kawaki.
