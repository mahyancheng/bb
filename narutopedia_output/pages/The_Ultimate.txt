"
The Ultimate
" (
極めし者
,
Kiwameshi Mono
) is episode 401 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Shira
 accepts
Lee
's offer to fight him one on one. The two begin their battle, and as they exchange fierce attacks, both seem to be equally on par with one another. Observing the battle,
Neji
 notes that Lee will sustain more damage due to Shira having a much superior physique. Eventually noticing that he is at a disadvantage, Lee attempts to open the
Eight Gates
, but finds that he cannot; Shira having blocked his
tenketsu
, therefore stopping his
chakra
 flow.
 Shira then resorts to
attacking silently
, further putting the pressure on Lee. Remembering one of his training sessions with
Guy
, Lee is able to predict and counter Shira's moves. His tenketsu is ultimately released by Shira, and thus, Lee is able to open the Eight Gates once more. Shira activates the
Seven Heavens Breathing Method
, his own self-made equivalent of the Eight Gates, enhancing his lung capacity and his attacks to another level. Though both now seem evenly matched, Lee soon gains the upper hand after activating the Fifth Gate of Limit. Ultimately, this clash culminates in Lee's victory. Elsewhere,
Gaara
 is informed by his subjects that
Kegon
 and
Yōrō
 are actually
jōnin
 in disguise. Gaara orders them not to tell anyone else about this and begins to spy on
Team Fū
, using his
Third Eye
. However, to his shock,
Fū
 quickly found his sand eye, forcing him to cancel the technique. Gaara then realised the
truth
 about the kunoichi.
