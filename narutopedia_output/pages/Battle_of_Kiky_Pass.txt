The Battle of Kikyō Pass with the falsely claimed only survivor: Kabuto Yakushi.



The
Battle of
Kikyō Pass
 (
桔梗峠の戦い
,
Kikyō Tōge no Tatakai
) was a battle between
Konohagakure
 shinobi and an unknown group. The battle took place at the end of the
Third Shinobi World War
.
 In the aftermath of the battle, it is said that a captain of the
Medic Corps
,
Nonō Yakushi
, found a single survivor from amongst the dead enemies: a young
Kabuto
, and taught him basic
medical ninjutsu
. However, this story was actually fabricated by
Orochimaru
.

This battle was first mentioned by
Anko Mitarashi
 before the preliminaries of the Third Exam in the
Chūnin Exams
, just after Kabuto announced that he would not battle.
