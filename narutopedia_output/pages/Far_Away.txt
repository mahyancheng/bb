Lyrics

Rōmaji

Fumikomu ze akuseru

Kakehiki wa naisa, sōdayo

Yoru wo nukeru

Nejikomu-sa saigo ni

Sashihiki zero-sa, sōdayo

Hibi wo kezuru

Kokoro wo sotto hiraite

Gyutto hikiyosetara

Todoku yo kitto

Tsutau yo motto-sa

Iki isoide shiboritotte

Motsureru ashi dakedo mae yori zutto sō, tōku e

Ubaitotte tsukandatte

Kimi janainara

Imi wa nai no sa

Dakara

Haruka kanata

Kanji

踏み込むぜアクセル

駆け引きは無いさ、そうだよ

夜をぬける

ねじ込むさ最後に

差し引きゼロさ、そうだよ

日々を削る

心をそっと開いて

ぎゅっと引き寄せたら

届くよきっと

伝うよもっとさ・

生き急いで搾り取って

縺れる足だけど前よりずっとそう、遠くへ

奪い取って掴んだって

君じゃないなら

意味は無いのさ

だからもっと…遥か彼方

English

Step on the gas!

There will be no need to bargain

Go through night

Screw it, ultimately

There's nothing left, it seems

To pare down the days

Gently open your heart

If you tightly draw it close

You will surely get there

You will go farther!

Living fast, taking advantage

Feet are stuck but all along it's been that way, by far

Plundering, seizing

If you're not there

There will be no meaning

So truly far away

English (Full Version)

Step on the accelerator!

There's no bargaining, it seems

To escape the night

Screw it, ultimately

There's nothing left, it seems

To pare down the days

Gently open your heart

If you tightly draw it close

You will surely get there

You will go farther!

Living fast, taking advantage

Feet are stuck but all along it's been that way, by far

Plundering, seizing

If you're not there

There will be no meaning

So further and further away

Step on the accelerator!

There's no bargaining, it seems

To escape the night

Screw it, ultimately

There's nothing left, it seems

To pare down the days

Gently open your heart

If you tightly draw it close

You will surely get there

You will go farther!

Living fast, taking advantage

Feet are stuck but all along it's been that way, by far

Plundering, seizing

If you're not there

There will be no meaning

So truly far away

Your world is accustomed to being a lie

Painting in white...

Trivia

In one part of the song where the main teams of Konoha appear,
Team Guy
 appears twice.

In the opening, Lee and Hinata were shown fighting members of
Team Oboro
, though the two never engaged any of them in battle.

Initially, this episode depicts Sakura with long hair, aside from her shot with Ino and the two final group shots. However, after she cuts her hair within the series, her hair is consistently short.

Being used for 28 episodes, this is the longest opening used for
Naruto
.
