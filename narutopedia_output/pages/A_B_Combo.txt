The
A–B Combo
 (
エービーコンビ
,
Ē Bī Konbi
), renowned as the
Strongest Tag-Team
 (
最強タッグ
,
Saikyō Taggu
),
 is a sibling team from
Kumogakure
. It consists of
A
 — the son of the
Third Raikage
 — and
Killer B
 who is recognised as A's brother, after he successfully beheaded a training dummy during a selection process.

Their signature technique, the
Lightning Release: Double Lariat
, is well known and feared greatly outside of Kumogakure.
 The two brothers spent many years perfecting their technique and even perfected it to the point where A and B could use this technique clad in
Lightning Release Chakra Mode
 and the
tailed beast cloak
 respectively to increase the technique's already devastating effects.
 This team was effectively disbanded after the Third died and A took up office as the Fourth
Raikage
, confining his brother to the village out of fear of losing him as well.

At some point in their early history, the duo was tasked with retrieving an unknown
