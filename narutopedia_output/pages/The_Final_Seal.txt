 manga.

Summary

The
First Hokage
 and the
Second Hokage
 attack
Sarutobi
's
shadow clones
, but the clones still manage to catch each of the former Hokage. The
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
 grabs the Hokage's souls, breaking all of the jutsu in play and allowing them a brief return to their senses. Sarutobi apologises to both for what he is about to do and then seals away their souls with the move also revealing the dead bodies of
Kin Tsuchi
 and
Zaku Abumi
, both of whom were used as sacrifices to summon the two Hokage. Angry that
Orochimaru
 could make such casual use of others' lives, the real Sarutobi tries to do the same to him. Sensing what is happening, Orochimaru summons his
Kusanagi
 back to him, which
Enma
 tries to stop.
