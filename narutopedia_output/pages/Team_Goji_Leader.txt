This
shinobi
 is a
genin
 from
Sunagakure
.

Personality

He is a proud individual, as is evident from the fact that he doesn't like the idea of being ordered around by Shira. He refuses to accept hand-outs. At the same time, he is willing to admit defeat gracefully and push on soon afterwards to accomplish his goals. He is also very sensible and soberly evaluates his chances, realising that even six against six stronger opponents they cannot cope. He does not have good feelings for
Gaara
 and once again reminds
Shira
 of the events that happened because of him, believing that people do not change.

Appearance

He is a very large and muscular guy with a bald head and black eyes. His head is covered with a turban, and the lower part of his face is covered with a special mask in the form of dinosaur teeth. His head and shoulders are covered with purple tattoos in the form of thick lines with a sharp end. He always walks with a naked torso, but he has a dark short poncho on his shoulders, gloves with blades on his hands, and he also wears pants with a belt on which hangs bags of weapons and a pair of simple sandals in conjunction with ankle bandages.

Abilities

He possesses good leadership skills, being able to command not only his team, but also a team of comrades, leading a total of five people. They unquestioningly carried out his commands, whether it was an order to leave the battlefield, or give their scroll to an opponent. He is discerning and evaluates the opponent's skills to put pressure on his weaknesses, as he did with Rock Lee. He also showed some skill in tactics, setting up traps with many
Explosive Tags
, which created an explosion so powerful that huge crevices were formed through which Rock Lee could only cross using
Eight Gates
.

Ninjutsu






The shinobi using Wind Release.



He has a knowledge of
ninjutsu
, being able to use
Wind Release
 and
Yin Release
. Combining them, he creates a dome-shaped sandstorm which surrounds the opponent and hinders it from escaping. During the technique's execution, the used
sand
 particles collide against each other, thus creating electro-magnetic waves which place the trapped person under never-ending
genjutsu
 in the form of characterless beings attacking with
kunai
. While the target is busy fending these illusions off, it is vulnerable for attacks from the outside, what his teammates used and
fired water shells
 at the victim.

Weapons

His main weapon is gloves, each with two blades. With their power, he fights in close combat, trying to cut the enemy. In addition, he is good at dealing with kunai, accurately hitting the Shira, and also tried to kill Rock Lee with their help. Also, in his own words, he uses a lot of Explosive Tags.

Interlude

In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths






The Genin begin fighting in the cafeteria.



He, alongside his team, participated in the joint
Chūnin Exams
. He and his team were one of the few who managed to qualify for the second round. The next day, the second exam proctor —
Temari
, announced the start of the second round taken place within
Demon Desert
.
 Following a plan set by
Shira
, Goji's team evaded
Team Guy
 while Shira's team set a trap for the Konoha-nin. After seemingly removing the Konoha-nin from the exam, Shira's team regrouped with the other Suna-nin with plans to make sure all the Suna-nin teams advanced to the next round. However, he and his team refused to work alongside Shira anymore. He and the other Suna-nin then attacked Shira's team to take his scroll. As Shira's team was pinned down, Team Guy appeared and drove he and the other Suna attackers away.






The shinobi gives Shira his Heaven scroll.



Despite setting a large trap to keep enemies from following them, Team Goji Leader and the others were soon pursued by
Rock Lee
. As the team quickly recognised him as a taijutsu specialist like Shira, they kept him at bay with genjutsu before attacking him from afar. Soon afterwards, Lee's teammates and Shira's team arrived to save him. After the Goji and the other Suna-nin were defeated, Shira surprisingly asked Lee's team to spare them. The Suna-nin were all shocked at how quick to forgive Shira was. As Shira explained that he admires Gaara so much for changing his life through perseverance and intends to do the same, Shira offered his exam scroll on the grounds that he was defeated before. Team Goji however declined, instead giving Shira and Team Guy their respective scrolls as they lost this fight. Noting their own pride, they were still determined to pass the exam by getting a new heaven and earth scroll from other teams before leaving.

Trivia

Studio Pierrot's settei sheets show that the tattoos on the back of his head are depicted in the form of stripes, which was specially made to look like a
Velociraptor
, and the dinosaur teeth mask was made like the teeth of the
Tarbosaurus
.

It is also known from there that his tattoos were made with elite body paint from the Rumi store.
