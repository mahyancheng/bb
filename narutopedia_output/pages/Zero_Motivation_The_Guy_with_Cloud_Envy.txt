"
Zero Motivation: The Guy with Cloud Envy!
" (
雲はいいなあ…やる気ゼロの男
,
Kumo wa ī nā… Yaru ki Zero no Otoko
) is episode 64 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Though initially unwilling,
Shikamaru
 fights
Temari
 because he refuses to lose to a girl. Shikamaru quickly studies the arena and its elements and comes up with a plan. Despite this, Temari has seen his
Shadow Imitation Technique
 in action and knows how it works. She appears to evade Shikamaru's creativity and adapt to his tactics, however he’d been luring her to the tunnel
Naruto
 created in the previous match. Shikamaru catches her in his trap through use of the tunnel by sending his shadow through it.  Although having clearly won, he forfeits at the last second, claiming to have exerted too much chakra in capturing Temari to continue the match, also adding that if he continued, it would just mean more work.
