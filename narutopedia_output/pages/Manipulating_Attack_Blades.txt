This technique allows the user to control multiple
kunai
 - or a similar weapon - at once. By releasing
chakra
 from the hand over an area, the user can freely manipulate any kunai within that area. This allows the user to either attack opponents from their blindside or surround them with kunai, preventing them from escaping.
 If the
Puppet Technique
's chakra threads are attached to the manipulated kunai, the chakra threads can then be transferred to the kunai's target upon contact, giving users an easy (and potentially unnoticed) way of manipulating opponents outside their range.

In
Gaara Hiden
,
Amagi
 throws a volley of projectiles and then, as they near their target, uses chakra threads to manipulate them, steering the projectiles around the target's defenses and grouping them together for a more focused attack.
