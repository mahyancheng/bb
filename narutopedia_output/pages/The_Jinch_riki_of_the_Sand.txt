"
The Jinchūriki of the Sand
" (
砂の人柱力
,
Suna no Jinchūriki
) is episode 4 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Deidara
, riding on his large bird clay, decides to attack
Gaara
 from a distance. Gaara, however, is able to transform the sand into
pseudo-Shukaku arms
 in order to perform long range attacks. As Deidara gets higher up into the air, Gaara uses his sand to create a platform in mid-air. The
shinobi
 of
Sunagakure
, including Gaara's brother
Kankurō
, are on the ground witnessing the aerial battle. Deidara resorts to using his
explosive clay
 to target Gaara, only for Gaara to absorb the damage with his sand and then have his sand reform. Deidara then resorts to using a much more powerful variant of his C1. Gaara is able to encase himself in a
sand cocoon
, while using his
Third Eye
 to maintain his vision. At the same time, he manages to trap Deidara with his
Sand Binding Prison
 technique, which manifests
Shukaku
's arms to imprison his opponent(s).

In
Konoha
,
Naruto
 and
Sakura
 are still attempting to
take the bells
 from
Kakashi
. Kakashi manages to predict their moves using his
Sharingan
 and performs hand signs at a speed no human eye can follow, using
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
, followed with
Earth Release: Double Suicide Decapitation Technique
 and finishing with
Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique
. Unable to land a hit on Kakashi, Naruto and Sakura have no choice but to retreat and devise a new strategy. Kakashi also retreats, remarking how his Sharingan is exhausted by Naruto and Sakura's efforts. He contemplates taking the time to finish his
Icha Icha
 book, but remembers that Naruto and Sakura are too tough for him to fight while simultaneously reading.

Naruto remarks how Kakashi's intelligence exceeds
Shikamaru
's, how his sense of smell is greater than
Kiba
's, how his
taijutsu
 surpasses that of
Rock Lee
's and how his Sharingan is more powerful than
Sasuke
's. Nonetheless, Sakura states that a great ninja like him must have some sort of a weakness. After deliberating on the thought, Naruto discovers Kakashi's weakness and shares it with Sakura. The pair then track down Kakashi and launch a frontal attack. As they rush towards him, Naruto begins to spoil the ending of
Jiraiya
's book. Not wanting to hear spoilers, Kakashi covers his ears, but realises his Sharingan can still read Naruto's lips. Exclaiming at Naruto to stop, Kakashi closes his eyes as well, and Naruto and Sakura take the opportunity to take the bells from him, successfully passing the test.
