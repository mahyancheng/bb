Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Mitsuki
 carries the injured
Boruto
 and
Sarada
, and passes out just after arriving at
Yubina
's clinic. Some time later,
Konohamaru
 and
Mugino
 arrive back at
Konoha
, carrying Boruto and Sarada, who could only get first aid at Yubina's. They're handed over to
Sakura
, who treats them with
Shizune
's help.
Hinata
 and
Himawari
 are concerned about Boruto, but
Naruto
 assures them he'll be ok as Sakura is treating him. Konohamaru blames himself for their injuries as he was part of the mission. He confirms he left Mitsuki under
Orochimaru
's care, as his situation was beyond Yubina's ability to help.
Log
 notices Orochimaru's concern for Mitsuki, who claims to be concerned for Mitsuki as a sample. Konohamaru,
Sai
,
Shikamaru
,
Sasuke
, and Naruto confer, and review what they know about
Victor
 and
Deepa
. Konohamaru wants to investigate Victor's company, but the
Land of Valleys
 is an independent nation, so they can't force the issue. Shikamaru has a contact with influence in the country, but it will take three days for arrangements to be made. Victor handles the
Hashirama
 Cell with care, concerned they might never have another chance if they mishandle this one. Deepa mentions a previous plan that didn't work, which led them to their current situation. Deepa and Victor argue about their roles in
Kara
. Victor dispatches Deepa to retrieve another item. Boruto wakes up and Shizune tells him what happened. He asks for Mitsuki, and she explains he's with Orochimaru.
 Sakura examines Sarada, and is grateful for Yubina's work on her. Boruto and Sarada wait for tests, and brood over how their jutsu were useless against Deepa. Shizune shares her concerns about Boruto and Sarada with Sakura.
Team 5
 visits Boruto and
Team 15
 visits Sarada. Shikamaru manages to get permission for Konohamaru to observe Victor's company. An old lady who owns a pet shop foretells the death of a close friend to Mugino. Teams 5 and 15 discuss Boruto and Sarada, finding their cheerful attitude forced, and grow concerned about them. They visit the hospital again, but Boruto and Sarada left on their own. They believe they want to avenge Mitsuki. Mugino gets permission to join Konohamaru in his mission. Konohamaru wants to leave without telling Boruto and Sarada, but they arrive. The jōnin believe they want to join them, but instead they just want to inform them they want to train to get stronger. Boruto wanted to train with Sasuke, but Sarada is already training with him. He doesn't want to ask his father, who is working hard on Kara intel, so Sasuke directs him to
Kakashi
, as he's the only other person in the village who can use the
Rasengan
.
