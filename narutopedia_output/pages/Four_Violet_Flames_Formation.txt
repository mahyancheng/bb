A team of four stands in a square formation and then performs this technique, erecting a solid
barrier
 between them. The barrier is made of purple flames, which will instantly engulf those who come into contact with it, thus preventing anyone from entering or leaving the area. Because the barrier relies on all four users to maintain, attacking any one of them can bring down the barrier. To prevent this from happening, members of the
Sound Four
 extend secondary barriers around themselves, making breaking out even more difficult.
 When used by members of the
First Division
, the users position themselves outside the barrier rather than inside, at least ensuring their captive cannot harm them.

Trivia

According to
Dan Katō
, the barrier is the best way to stop him from using the
Spirit Transformation Technique
.
