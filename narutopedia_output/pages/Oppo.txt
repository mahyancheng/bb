) is an underling of
Aniki
.

Background

Oppo and
Teru
 failed to pass the exams at the academy and become
genin
. They went to different jobs, but each time they were fired, and in the end, when they had absolutely nothing to eat, they joined Aniki.

Personality






Oppo and Teru find out that Himawari is the Hokage's daughter.



Oppo is a rather weak person, obeying Aniki because he took him under his wing, despite being constantly belittled by him, and considers himself a failure. He was scared of retribution when he realised he had also kidnapped the Hokage's daughter. Despite turning to crime, he has no stomach for harsher violence or deception, readily giving information about Aniki in conversation with a supposed hostage. After being arrested, he seemed willing to try turning over a new leaf.

Appearance

Oppo is a short guy with grey eyes, fleshy lips, and short dark hair. He wears a blue hooded suit, black gloves, and sandals.

Abilities

Oppo failed his Academy exams, indicating a lack of mastery over basic shinobi skills. However, he was able to swiftly stalk and discreetly kidnap Osuka and Himawari before anyone else could notice, and move around the city with them undetected.

Kawaki & Himawari Academy Arc






Oppo and Teru sort out their differences.



Oppo and Teru stalked Osuka Kamakura from afar, and kidnapped her and Himawari Uzumaki when they left the Academy together. At an abandoned warehouse, they waited for Aniki to arrive, arguing about how Himawari's presence complicated their plans. When he did, Aniki punished them from deviating from the plan. They later talked to Osuka and Himawari about their situation, until Aniki warned them not to volunteer any more information. When they dozed off, Himawari and Osuka freed themselves, and Osuka tied up their feet. When they wake up during a struggle between Aniki and Himawari, they fail to talk him down. After Kawaki defeated Aniki and they were all arrested, Himawari checked in on them, and they promised to start over after serving their sentence.
