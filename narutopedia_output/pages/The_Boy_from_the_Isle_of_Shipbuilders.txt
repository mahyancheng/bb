Land of Water

Isari
 recalls that Kagura was the warden of Araumi's prison, and fighting a Konoha shinobi during the breakout. Araumi and Isari both tell Tenma not to worry, as the fortress did its purpose, and was just a tool, all that matters is defeating their enemies at the end. Kajiki determines what needs to be fixed and updated in the stolen Funato ship, and Denki requests learning more about the engine if something happens again. Boruto returns Ikada's idea notebook when he drops it. The overhear the other craftsmen discussing the Funato, some of them understanding their reservations about the daimyō, and sharing rumours that the Shinonome 1 would case trouble for fishermen by messing with the currents.

Buntan
 complains about their situation. Kawaki is bothered by Mitsuki following him. Kajiki chides Ikada for letting an important engine part to go out of stock, and is unwilling to let him go get more because of Funato activity. Boruto offers to guard Funato while he retrieves the missing part. Kajiki allows it, so Ikada and Boruto depart on a small ship made by Ikada. It's the first ship he's made, his dream being to travel the world in a ship of his making. They continue on their way to the island with the engine part factory.
