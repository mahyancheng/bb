Reception

This game received mixed reviews. Gamespot exclaimed that while it had tons of things to unlock and many characters to play as, it just didn't have the fun of a true Naruto game. The website rated this game with a 5.5/10. IGN reviewed it as an average game with lots of unlockables, but limited gameplay. Its final rating was a 6/10.

Trivia

Three of the
Six Paths of Pain
 are playable while the other three can be used as supporting characters.

Naruto
's house is a restored feature from the previous
Ultimate Ninja games
.

This is the first
Ultimate Ninja
 game
 to feature up to 4 player battles.

The combinations can be 1p vs 1p , 1p vs 2p , 1p vs 3p , and 2p vs 2p.

A special game only arc is included between the "
Hidan and Kakuzu
" and "The Formation of Hebi" arcs. It revolves around Naruto trying to stop a man named
Shinga
 from using a forbidden seed, called the "
Demon Shinki
".

Although Kabuto and Kabuto with Orochimaru's remains are the same, they're featured as two different people.

This is the last
Ultimate Ninja
 game
 to feature the classic 2D-based gameplay from the
first
Ultimate Ninja
.
