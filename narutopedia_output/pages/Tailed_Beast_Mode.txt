"
Tailed Beast Mode!!
" (
尾獣モード!!
,
Bijū Mōdo!!
) is chapter 571 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

With the gates opened,
Naruto
 assumes a
new form
. With no time to waste as the opposing tailed beasts prepare to attack
Guy
 and
Kakashi
 with their
Tailed Beast Balls
, Naruto intervenes and deflects the attacks with such speed that Kakashi mistakes him for his own former
teacher
. As the beasts rally again and prepare to attack the shinobi, Naruto transforms into Kurama — seemingly "absorbing" Guy and Kakashi into the beast's chakra for safe-keeping. After creating a clone and being told by Kurama that he probably had only five minutes in the form because it was his first transformation into the beast, Naruto tells him that five minutes was plenty of time. With this, he attacks the
Seven-Tails
 mid-air, intending to pile-drive the beast into the
Three-Tails
 but the giant turtle rolls out of the way. Before he can attack once again, the
Six-Tails
 swallows the beast's hand, immobilising him and allowing the Three-Tails to attack. The Three-Tails' attack is stopped by the
Eight-Tails
 however. Wasting no time as the
Two-Tails
 now prepared to attack, Naruto swings the Six-Tails into the Two-Tails as
B
 deals with the
Five-Tails
. The clone — who had entered
Sage Mode
 — reports that he had located all the chakra receivers on the other beasts' bodies. Naruto then watches on as the other tailed beasts prepare a collaborative Tailed Beast Ball, subsequently preparing one of his own along with Kurama, intending to cancel out the force of the attack.

Trivia

While observing the full Nine-Tailed transformed Naruto's battle with the tailed beasts, Guy makes a reference of the film
Destroy All Monsters
 of the legendary
kaijū
 film franchise,
Godzilla
.
