 Risking Everything…!!) is chapter 169 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Having inflicted a fatal injury upon
Tsunade
,
Orochimaru
 asks why she would give her life to protect
Naruto
. Tsunade, shaking at the sight of her own blood, responds that it was to protect
Konoha
, as Naruto will someday be its
Hokage
. Orochimaru scoffs at the title, saying that Hokage is for fools who want to die. Reminded of what she said to Naruto a week earlier, Tsunade tells him that she will now be one of those fools, accepting the position of Fifth Hokage for herself. Orochimaru delivers a finishing blow and then tries to do the same to Naruto, but Tsunade again blocks the attack. She overcomes her fear of blood and counterattacks, throwing him back and healing her injuries with
Creation Rebirth
. With the battle escalating, the
Sannin
 each perform their largest summon.
