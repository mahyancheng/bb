Kūi Dōtonbori
 (
道噸堀クーイ
,
Dōtonbori Kūi
), also known as the "Sweeper of the Pot Bottoms", is a competitive eater and a member of
Exploding-Till-You-Eat
.

Background

Kūi and his son,
Daore
, travel the land taking part in food competitions wherever they may occur. Kūi has competed against
Chōji Akimichi
 during several prior contests and has lost to Chōji each time. For this reason, he considers Chōji his rival.

Appearance

Kūi is described as a muscular man who is just as tall as his son is fat, which is to say he is very tall. He does not wear a shirt in the novel.

Kūi and Daore participate in
Konohagakure
's annual food eating competition. Because this year's contest falls on
Parent and Child Day
, only parents and their children can enter. Kūi does not believe any of the other competitors pose a challenge to him, describing them all as "small builds, small appetites". The one exception is Chōji Akimichi, who Kūi looks forward to competing against again. When Chōji can't remember ever having met Kūi before, Kūi is insulted and vows to defeat him.

Kūi and Daore end up being one of three parent-and-child teams to make it to the final round. Of the three teams,
Shikamaru
 and
Shikadai Nara
 end up being disqualified for vomiting, Daore faints from eating too much, and Chōji loses consciousness because some lettuce from the previous round gets caught in his throat. Kūi ridicules all of them for being weak. Believing his victory is guaranteed, Kūi starts eating the final round's food: dumplings from
Ankorodō
. Due to
interference
 from Ankorodō's owner, the dumplings cause Kūi to vomit. Chōji and his daughter,
Chōchō Akimichi
, end up being declared the victors.

In the anime, the two instead are in league with the Ankorodō's owner, and she rigged the competition in favour of the Dōtonbori, ensuring their Lightning Burgers are not spicy, and their dumpling bowls are shallower than the Akimichi's. However,
Boruto Uzumaki
 caught on, and switched the rigged dumpling bowls to the regular ones, and ultimately, when the Ankorodō owner was exposed for her cheat, the three were scolded by
Shikamaru Nara
.

Some time later, Kūi and his son went to a flea market in Konohagakure to look for new clothing. They ironically found what they were looking for from their hated rivals in Chōji and Chōchō. While they were infuriated that the Akimichi didn't recognise them, they still decided to buy from the father and daughter.

Trivia

His given name of Kūi references
kuidaore
, "eat 'til you drop", while his surname could reference the
Osaka district
 associated with that phrase.
