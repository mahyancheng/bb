 technique appears to be initiated remotely upon placing the target in contact with a physical object such as a kunai or even a small toad, and can cause the target to spontaneously burst into flames. Regarded as the "Flames of Purgatory" (

,
Rengoku no Honō
),
 they are said to be inextinguishable by wind or rain, and burn so quickly that regenerative techniques cannot keep up with them, leaving the victim's body completely charred in mere moments. The flames can, however, be absorbed and sealed away.

Influence

The jutsu is named after and inspired by the True Samādhi Fire (Chinese: 三昧眞火,
Sānmèi Zhēnhuǒ
) featured in the Chinese classical novel
Journey to the West
. In the novel, the character
Red Boy
 (Chinese: 紅孩兒,
Hóng hái'ér
) developed the ability to create True Samādhi Fire after 300 years of self-cultivation on the Flaming Mountains. This magical fire proved inextinguishable, with heavy rainfall summoned by the Dragon Kings only intensifying Red Boy's blaze, as if the water were oil. Even the Monkey King was almost burned to death by the True Samādhi Fire.
