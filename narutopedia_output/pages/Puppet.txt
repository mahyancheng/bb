Kankurō with his three puppets.



Puppets
 (
傀儡
,
Kugutsu
) are used as weapons by
puppeteers
. They are most often humanoid-looking creations, but depending on the creator, they can resemble anything. They are fashioned in a manner that uses every part as a weapon, giving the puppeteer a myriad of ways to manipulate it. Puppets are long-ranged type weapons that can be used offensively, defensively or for supplementary reasons, and are controlled via
Chakra Threads
. Because of their design, the weak point of any puppet is its joints: if these are blocked by any material, such as
Iron Sand
, the puppet is rendered incapable of movement, and the joints themselves are more frail than a puppet's otherwise sturdiness.

There are two types of puppets: ones made from material such as wood, and
Human Puppets
. Famed puppeteer
Sasori of the Red Sand
 was the inventor of human puppets and also created a puppet which he wore like armour, bypassing the usual disadvantage that puppeteers had of being weak in close-ranged combat. Puppets are often sealed within
scrolls
 using
fūinjutsu
 for ease of transport.

Hundred Puppet Army

The
One Hundred Puppets

Sasori
 are said to be able to take down an entire country. Due to Sasori converting himself into a puppet, he has a special mechanism that allows him to control one hundred puppets. Though they lack teamwork, they use sheer attrition to wear down the opposition.

Autonomous Puppets








Main article:
Autonomous Puppet

Autonomous puppets
, or automatons, are puppets capable of operating independent of constant control by a puppeteer. The earliest puppets were developed by the Ōtsutsuki Clan. Humanity later built their own through
scientific ninja tools
, which can be outfitted with Scroll Cartridges to use techniques. These are used by
Kara
 and
Kirigakure
.

Other puppets and uses

In the
first OVA
, a group of automatic puppets appeared in
Akagahara
.

In the
Mizuki Tracking Mission
,
Mizuki
 used a simple puppet in his likeness equipped with a sword.

The
three Ryūdōin brothers
 used a type of
wooden doll
 training posts as puppets. While most were controlled by a tag on the back of their head, some were controlled by the
Puppet Technique
. Puppets almost identical to these appeared in a Shippūden filler episode being used as a defence measure for
Iō
's weapon lab.

Young Sunagakure puppeteers use simple toy snake puppets for amusement. The mechanics behind the toy was likened to the
Garian Sword
 by Kankurō.

Sasori claims his collection contains 298 puppets.

During their battle with Sasori, Chiyo used
Sakura
 as a puppet
by connecting chakra threads to her and controlling her like a puppet.

Puppet parts can be used to convert or replace human limbs. In the anime, it was revealed that Sasori was the one who developed this method, having installed a new right puppet arm into his friend
Komushi
.
 Chiyo later converted her right arm into that of a puppet's, which also includes a
Mechanical Light Shield Block
. Sasori eventually took this to another level by converting his entire body, minus his core of living flesh, into a puppet.

The
Asura Path
 was a puppeteer in life, according to the anime, using an infant-like puppet which had 4 to 6 arms and the ability to spin rapidly, as well as emit deceptive, infant-like noises.

Fū Yamanaka
 uses a simple straw puppet in his
Mind Puppet Switch Cursed Seal Technique
.

During the fight of the two surprise divisions, Sasori used
Muta Aburame
,
Shin
,
Tokuma Hyūga
 and
Ranka
 as puppets.

In the
Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown
, an allied ninja uses five puppets dressed up as
daimyō
 to deceive potential enemies and capture them with nets fired from the back.

In the anime, Sasori's childhood friend
Komushi
 was turned into a
human puppet
 after his death.

In the
Paradise Life on a Boat
,
Kokuyō
 used large Mecha-like puppets as distractions for his
Hundred Puppet Soul Binding
 technique. Of the two seen, the first had an open cockpit which he sat in and controlled it from, while the second was a massive purple machine which he hid underground and used to grab
Shizuka
.

In the
Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha
,
Korobi
 and
Yaoki
 use a
pair of small puppets
 with rounded heads that sprayed water.

During the
joint Chūnin Exam
,
Saya
 uses a small child-like puppet, wearing a red-and-pink kimono held together by a blue sash. The puppet is mainly used for acquiring hair for the
Puppet Imitation Technique
, but can also be used more offensively, with kunai emerging from the sleeves.

In the first
Naruto: Shippūden
 movie,
Setsuna
 made use of a puppet to take his place so that the Konoha ninja didn't realise he had left.

In the
fourth
Naruto Shippūden
 movie
,
Mukade
 in human form made use of different
special puppets
 with owl heads, some having the Ryūmyaku chakra:

Speed Puppet:
 A puppet with rotating and extendible arms and piercing eyes, and hiding nine swords in its belly. Once destroyed,
explosive tags
 attached inside of its body explodes to cause damage.

Golem Puppet:
 A puppet using the Ryūmyaku chakra, allowing it to fly, shoot a mini beam of Ryūmyaku chakra through its mouth and throw kunai from its belt and connected with
Ryūmyaku chakra threads
. There are three different variants:

One having three large, rotating claws on each arm.

Another having a Ryūmyaku chakra cannon in its right arm (could shoot a great beam or balls of Ryūmyaku chakra).

The last having a double mass in its right arm.

Guardian Puppet:
 A puppet which can shoot several kunai from its chest, having a hidden blade in its right arm and a slow speed but a considerable force. Once the target is surrounded by several of them, the puppeteer can lock his target by merging several Guardian Puppets to create a prison and a giant version.

Giant Guardian Puppet:
 A giant puppet created by merging several Guardian Puppets. If a target is trapped inside the puppet, the puppet absorbs his chakra.

Many basic puppets with no weapons or defensive means, meant to mimic and replace the citizens of
Rōran
 and Queen
Sāra
.

Mukade also converted his own body into a spider-like puppet, convert his frontal forelegs into scythes, launch a segmented tongue with a drill tip, and can merge with the pieces of the Guardian Puppets to increase his size. He can also absorb all of them to create a gigantic puppet of a centipede, with many retractable blades within the segments, being able to both devour and expel chakra via his mouth, and his own body hidden within the left side of its chest.

Tenten
 uses puppets that are twice the size of a normal person and are equipped with
Handheld Kunai Launchers
.

Shinki
 uses what appears to be a puppet shaped like a skeleton, with a matching dark cloak, two horns and yellow eyes. Additionally, half of its body is white and the other is black.

In
chapter 19
 of
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
, "'Autonomous' Puppets" (
「自律型」の傀儡
,
"Jiritsu-gata" no Kugutsu
) appear. They make use of
scientific ninja weapons
 to attack using elemental
ninjutsu
.

In the anime,
Araya
 uses a puppet in the image of himself and controls it from afar during the battles, so the puppet can act as his stand-in unnoticed.

In the game
Naruto: Uzumaki Chronicles 2
, the
Shirogane clan
 is a puppet-using shinobi clan. Different puppets can be encountered in the game:

Puppet Walker

 A simple
B-Rank
 puppet with razor-like claws. It has the "cut" (
斬
) kanji in its chest, and "self" (
自
) in its neck.

Kamikaze Puppet
:
 A suicidal
A-rank
 puppet that can self destruct. It has a 自 on its neck.

Mecha Puppet

A-rank
 puppet that fires small electric orbs from its arms. It has the "shoot" (
射
) kanji in its chest, and 自 on its nose.

Insect Queen Bee Drone Puppet
:
 An
A-rank
 Bee-like puppet that can use electrical attacks. It can also produce smaller "drones" from within its carapace. It has the "thunder" (

A-rank
 puppets that use elemental attacks. The
Red Elemental Puppet

Blue Elemental Puppet
 uses water attacks, with a "water" (
水
) kanji on its left arm.

Lizard Puppet
:
 An
S-rank
 puppet. It is similar to Sanshōuo as it is based on a lizard. It can breathe fire, stick to vertical surfaces, and spin itself rapidly in midair for a strong rolling tackle. Its use was supposedly exclusive only for the top-ranking members of the Shirogane.

Master Puppet
:
 The
S-rank
 most powerful puppet from the Shirogane clan. It is a six-armed, four-faced puppet seemingly inspired by the Asura. It has many fearsome abilities, such as elemental attacks and regeneration.

Barrier Puppets

B-rank
 puppets that protect
Menō
 and
Gandō
 with a light purplish gas-tagged barrier.

Vampire Puppet
 is encountered in a B-Rank and later in an A-Rank mission. Like the
Master Puppet
 of the Shirogane clan, this puppet seems to have a will of its own and attacks and feasts on the blood of women. It later sets its sights on tomato juice, stealing it from peddlers. After its second defeat it is sent to work at a place called "Tomato Land" where tomato juice is produced. It became happy there, earning tomato juice instead of money.
