"
Inari's Courage Put to the Test
" (
イナリ、試される勇気
,
Inari, Tamesareru Yūki
) is episode 180 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

The villagers of
Konoha
 begin their rebuilding process, with
Yamato
 significantly expediting the restoration with his
Wood Release: Serial Pillar Houses Technique
.
Naruto
 asks
Sakura
 whether
Tsunade
 would be alright, and Sakura consoles him, although she privately muses that she is the one who needs consoling. At that moment, the two are interrupted from their thoughts by old friends
Inari
 and
Tazuna
, who have come from the
Land of Waves
 to help rebuild Konoha. Inari remarks that Sakura has grown to be beautiful while reminiscing, along with Naruto, about the last time they met.

After
leaving
 the Land of Waves following the completion of their mission, Naruto realised that he he had lost his coupon for a free bowl of ramen at
Ichiraku's
 and that he must have left it at Tazuna's house. As he rushed back to the village,
Kakashi
 told
Sasuke
 to bring him back as he and
Sakura
 returned to Konoha. Meanwhile, Tazuna found the coupon and handed it over to Inari, who recognised it as Naruto's. Inari then set off to return the coupon to Naruto, only to be ambushed by
Akane
, Yamabuki and their friend, who proceeded to bully Inari for acting stuck up after defeating
Gatō
 as
Team 7
 was no longer there to protect him. However, they had been overheard by
Zōri
 and
Waraji
, two of Gatō's former henchmen, who had waited for Team 7 to leave so that they could continue their operations, and proceeded to kidnap the boys. At their hideout, Inari had helped his fellow peers escape and risked his own life so that they could return to the village. In the meantime, Naruto had run into Tazuna, who had told him that Inari had gone to return the coupon. Naruto found his coupon on the ground near the wood as Sasuke noticed that there tell-tale signs of a struggle. Naruto recognised the slash marks in the trees as the work of two thugs he had
defeated
 earlier.

As the thugs cornered Inari, the boy jumped into the rapid river, only to be saved by Naruto, who had told him that the friends he helped escape had alerted him of the situation. Naruto then used his
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 to fight the thugs, with Sasuke helping defeat them using his
Fūma Shuriken
 paired with his
Shadow Shuriken Technique
. As Tazuna and the other villagers showed up, the thugs gave up and were restrained; Inari thanked Naruto and the two cried tears of happiness, with Naruto crying even more when he realised he had lost his coupon once more.

Having finished their stroll down memory lane, Inari tells Naruto and Sakura that Akane and his friends are now carpenters just like him while Tazuna states that the Land of Waves would not have prospered if it wasn't for Naruto. As gratitude, Inari tells Naruto that the first thing he would build is a new Ramen Ichiraku just for Naruto, as Naruto had promised long ago that he would treat Inari to a bowl if Inari ever visited Konoha.
