"
The Quadruplets' Duty
" (
四つ子の使命
,
Yotsugo no Shimei
) is episode 165 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

The
Konoha
 shinobi resume their pursuit, and worry about the lengths the Haze shinobi will go to complete their mission. As
Deepa
 also resumes his pursuit,
Omoi
 passes out trying to reach his team-mates.
Asaka
 and
Hiruga
 discuss their past, their brothers, and their debt to the
Land of Haze
 for taking them in as orphans. Asaka notices the Konoha shinobi approaching, so they prepare for it. The Konoha shinobi strike first, but only hit clones, which obscure their sight upon destruction. They dodge explosive tag kunai, stepping on tar-like sludge on the ground. Hiruga appears, already activating
another jutsu
. The sludge restricts their movement, stopping them from forming hand seals. Asaka leaves with the
Hashirama
 Cell. Everything in the range of the sludge begins to sink into it.
Sarada
 notices that the closer things are to Hiruga, the faster they sink, and
Mitsuki
 determines Hiruga will also perish. They question his willingness to sacrifice his life, but he retorts he's saving one. Hiruga thinks back about his brothers, and how
Yoruga
 sacrificed his life so they could
infiltrate
 Fushū Castle.
Boruto
 questions the orders the quadruplets received, but Hiruga tells them how they were taken in, calling Boruto out for not knowing what it's like to starve, having lived in a great nation.
Mugino
 determines that as Hiruga is the one sinking the fastest, if he dies, the jutsu will give out.
 They realise Hiruga is just buying time for Asaka to cross into the Land of Haze. Hiruga's jutsu begins to break, and Boruto tries saving him. Hiruga and Boruto both accuse the other of making assumptions about them. Omoi arrives, and informs them all of Deepa killing his subordinates, and they realise he will intersect with Asaka. Boruto convinces Hiruga to check on Asaka himself, so he releases the jutsu. Hiruga rushes to Asaka, with the Konoha shinobi right behind him. Omoi stays behind after warning Mugino and
Konohamaru
 of Deepa's abilities. Deepa arrives at the border of the Land of Haze.

Trivia

In the official subtitles, there's a translation mistake. When Asaka and Hiruga discuss their past, the subtitles mistakenly have the
Land of Silence
 as the place that took them in instead of the Land of Haze.
