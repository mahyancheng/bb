The user creates a giant, boar-shaped, earthen lid high in the air that falls on the target, trapping them.

Trivia

The Japanese word for lid (
蓋
,
futa
) is pronounced almost the same as the Japanese word for pig (
豚
,
buta
). After certain sounds, the f-sound becomes a b-sound, as is the cases in the name of this technique, making the two homophones. The lid created with this technique is shaped like a pig or a boar, making the name a pun.
