A barrier ninjutsu that involves the usage of several
sealing tags
 being concealed beneath the surface. Once anybody steps onto the area, the tag will activate, releasing several thin threads that wrap around the target and restrain them. Due to the fact that the tag contains sealing formulas on its surface, it proved to be very useful when dealing with
reincarnated
 shinobi.
