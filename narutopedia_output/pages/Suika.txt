This article is about the missing-nin. For the Konohagakure citizen, see
Suika Kannonji
.

Suika
 (
スイカ
) was a
jōnin
 of
Takigakure
 who defected and became a bandit.

Personality

Suika was a very apathetic individual showing little or no interest in the fact that he was being pursued or even his pursuers. He had also displayed a brutal side, willing to kill the young shinobi after they tracked him down.

Appearance

Suika had a head of short green hair, black, heavy-lidded eyes and no eyebrows. He wore a sleeveless black shirt, an obi around his waist, a pair of pants, sandals and a sleeveless, high-collared, blue and orange jacket. He also wore bandages around his wrists and ankles.

Abilities

As a jōnin, Suika was skilled in a variety of areas. He proved to have sharp enough senses to discern that he was being followed and was capable of swiftly laying strategies to catch his opponents off-guard. He showed fairly large reserves of chakra, able to use a large number of ninjutsu in quick succession. During his first confrontation with
Team 8
, he demonstrated noticeable skill in taijutsu, able to fight off
Hinata Hyūga
 and
Kiba Inuzuka
, who are both taijutsu specialists.

Ninjutsu

Similar to
Kidōmaru
, much of his fighting style also revolved around the use of
spiders
 and webbing. Suika is able to
summon
 a large army of spiders to assist him. Using his summons as mediums, Suika was capable of manipulating their
webs
 for offensive or defensive purposes. Suika was very proficient with
Fire Release
 techniques and has shown a wide arsenal of techniques such as the
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
 and the
Fire Release: Flame Whirlwind
.

Part II

Paradise Life on a Boat

After being pursued, Suika confronted
Team Kurenai
 easily dispatching the young
genin
. To add insult to injury, he mocked
Shino
 for his inept skills in
taijutsu
 and his use of
insects
. He was later tracked down and pursued by
Hinata
,
Kiba
, and
Akamaru
. Engaging them once more, he attacked them with the
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
, which they narrowly dodge. Giving them no time to relax, he surrounded them with his
Fire Release: Crimson Earth Spider
 technique, forcing them upwards into the webs that he had his spiders spin.

Attacking them with his
Net-Shaped Prison
 technique initially and then the
Fire Release: Flame Whirlwind
 technique, they are however saved by Shino who makes a last-minute entrance into the fray. Suika eventually captured the three of them using his Net-Shaped Prison technique and then engaged Shino directly. He was however shocked and eventually overpowered by Shino's newly improved taijutsu skills. Suika was knocked into his own net by Shino, giving Hinata along with Kiba and Akamaru enough time to attack him as well, defeating him and knocking him unconscious.
