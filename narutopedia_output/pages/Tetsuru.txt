Itachi Pursuit Mission

After being approached by
Suigetsu Hōzuki
, he questions him if whether or not the rumours that they were hearing of Orochimaru's demise at the hands of
Sasuke Uchiha
 were true. After Suigetsu confirms this, he asks of their own fate and upon being told that they were to be set free, could hardly believe it. However Suigetsu gave them their freedom on the condition that he and the others spread word of Orochimaru's defeat to which he eagerly agrees.
