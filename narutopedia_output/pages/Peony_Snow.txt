Kurenai attacks her opponent first by lowering her stance and then spinning into the opponent to deal a knee strike, followed with a kick that pushes the opponent backwards, where she then grabs the opponent, lifting them into the air. She finally delivers a barrage of several kicks to their stomache, kicking them into the ground.
