Three
Icha Icha
 novels.



Icha Icha
 (
イチャイチャ
,
English TV:
 Make Out) is a series of adult novels written by
Jiraiya
 after the commercial failure of
The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi
.
 The
Icha Icha
 novels are based on Jiraiya's experiences in love, particularly his rejections by
Tsunade
.
 When he's working on a new novel, he gathers "research" by peeping on women while they bathe.
 Teenagers are often curious about the books' contents, prompting their parents and other adults to go to great lengths to keep the books away from them.

Icha Icha
 is wildly popular, giving Jiraiya's checkbook a balance that is "filled with zeroes".

Kakashi Hatake
 is a particular fan of the series; he enjoys reading the books even while in the middle of conversations.
 By the time of
Kakashi Retsuden
, Kakashi's picture and recommendation start to be printed on the books' cover.

Known Books

Icha Icha Paradise
 (
イチャイチャパラダイス
,
Icha Icha Paradaisu
,
English TV:
 Make-Out Paradise) is the first in the series, written in three parts. Its plot is summarised as: "The main character and heroine, both new to love, begin dating, and their eyes gradually open to grown-up love."
 In
Gaara Hiden
,
Gaara
 reads
Paradise
 in an effort to learn more about relationships, but it only ends up making him more confused.
Paradise
 eventually receives a film adaptation;
 in
Konoha Shinden
, it was filmed in a town in the
Land of Fire
, near the border with the
Land of Hot Water
. When
Mirai Sarutobi
 asks
Might Guy
 what the film is about, he becomes uncomfortable and abruptly changes the subject. In
Kakashi Retsuden
, the
Seventh Hokage
 gifts a copy of
All Ages Version: New Icha Icha Paradise
 (
全年齢版　新装イチャイチャパラダイス
,
Zen nenrei-ban Shinsō Icha Icha Paradaisu
) to King
Nanara
.

Icha Icha Violence
 (
イチャイチャバイオレンス
,
Icha Icha Baiorensu
,
English TV:
 Make-Out Violence) is the second book in the series.
Ebisu
 enjoyed
Violence
 more than
Paradise
, remarking that, "I have never seen the bonds between a man and a woman painted so stirringly."
 In
Naruto
 episode 101
,
Violence
 also receives a film adaptation.

Icha Icha Innocence
 (
イチャイチャイノセンス
,
Icha Icha Inosensu
) is the follow-up to
Violence
. When asked about it during an interview, Jiraiya says that he's still in the research phase of writing it, but that it will be about pure love.

Icha Icha Tactics
 (
イチャイチャタクティクス
,
Icha Icha Takutikusu
,
English TV:
 Make-Out Tactics) is the first book to be published after a three year hiatus.
Naruto Uzumaki
 gives Kakashi an advance copy, which he describes as "totally boring"; Jiraiya feels that Naruto is simply too young to appreciate it.
 In the anime,
Tactics
 is split into several volumes, of which the fifth is so intense that readers tend to pass out by the end. For this reason, the fifth volume was removed after the first edition; Kakashi, who never read the first edition before, is convinced to help
Yubeshi
 in exchange for a copy.

 Prior to his death, Jiraiya uses
Tactics
 as the key for a secret message about
Pain
's identity. In order to decode the message, Kakashi is forced to read passages aloud; Kakashi is embarrassed to do so, and
Shikamaru Nara
 is embarrassed to listen.
 In
Naruto Shinden: Parent and Child Day
, Kakashi encourages
Sasuke Uchiha
 to imitate scenes from
Tactics
 to help him become closer with his daughter,
Sarada
. Like the character in the book, Sasuke calls Sarada his "cute peanut" and tries putting his cloak on her as a sign of his love, but Sarada becomes so embarrassed that she storms off. Afterwards, Kakashi observes that the book wouldn't work on somebody Sarada's age since its depictions have become so out-of-date.

Icha Icha Data Book
 (
イチャイチャData Book
) is a databook on the
Icha Icha
 franchise. Its exact contents are unknown. It appears to be fairly rare, as
Kakashi
 could only get a copy through
Jiraiya
 personally.
