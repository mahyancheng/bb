"
Gaara's Bond
" (
我愛羅『絆』
,
Gaara "Kizuna"
) is episode 182 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Gaara
 consults with
Kankurō
 and
Temari
 about
Konoha
's
destruction
 and whether they would be able to recover from the attack, especially with their
Hokage
 being out of commission. Gaara tells them that Konoha would be alright as long as they had
Naruto
, prompting him to reminisce on the past.

Sometime after the
Konoha Crush
, when
Suna
 decided to reaffirm their alliance with Konoha, the two nations decided to each send a
shinobi
 squad to deal with bandits by their border.
Team 7
 had been assigned on Konoha's behalf while Suna dispatched Gaara, who had volunteered to join the forces in an effort to change his path, along with
Korobi
 and
Yaoki
, who were terrified of their squad leader since he possessed
Shukaku
 within him. Team 7 was shocked to see that they were to work alongside with Gaara and that he had seemingly mellowed out, with
Sakura
 remembering when Gaara
tried to kill her
.

Before the two teams split up in their different directions, Gaara had notified
Kakashi
 that the
Suna Council
 had deployed their
Anbu
 members to kill him during their mission. The Anbu managed to locate Gaara and trap him using their
Water-Firing Puppets
 and nullifying most of his sand with the
Puppet Water Release: Dance of Mystic Rain
 technique. Gaara warned Korobi and Yaoki to run away, and the two realised that Gaara had been looking out for them, and was not the monster that Suna believed him to be. Naruto, who had punched the Anbu earlier and tried to locate Gaara, berated the two for abandoning their friend. Naruto fought the Anbu using his
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 while Korobi and Yaoki returned to help their friend, shocking Gaara. Gaara then proceeded to knock out the remaining Anbu members with his
Sand Bullet
.

As Kakashi arrived, Gaara told him and Naruto to let the Anbu be because they were his people, despite what they thought of him. The team then continued on their mission and successfully defeated the bandits. When the teams parted their ways, Korobi and Yaoki reaffirmed the fact that they viewed Gaara as their friend and Gaara smiled, finally having formed a bond with his people.

After forming bonds with all of Suna's citizens and proving that he was more than just a monster, Gaara became the
Kazekage
. Crediting Naruto for his life changes, Gaara reminds his siblings that so long as Konoha had Naruto, they would prosper.

Trivia

In this episode,
Naruto
 seems irritated to be around
Gaara
 and berates his personality, despite Naruto and Gaara forming a shared bond between them
after their fight
.

There is a plot hole with the episode flashbacks:

Kakashi
,
Sasuke
 and Naruto are shown to be deployed on a mission sometime right after the
Konoha Crush
; However,
Itachi
 and
Kisame

returned
 to
Konoha
 the day after the Konoha Crush and Kakashi
fought
 the two, only to end up in a coma. The next day, Sasuke located Itachi and
tried to fight
 too, ending up in a comatose state as well. Meanwhile, Naruto had joined
Jiraiya
 on his
search for Tsunade
. By the time
Tsunade
 had returned to the village as its new
Hokage
, Sasuke and Kakashi awoke from their coma and Sasuke
fought Naruto
, shortly before
defecting
 from Konoha. With Naruto, Sasuke,
Sakura
 and Gaara being weakened from their fight, and Suna not being Konoha's ally until a short time later, it would have been impossible for the two nations to have an allied mission less than 24 hours after the Konoha Crush.
