This technique is used by
Shima
 and
Fukasaku
 to fuse with
Jiraiya
. It maximises the sage
chakra
 for the person they are fused to and allows them to access
Sage Mode
. This also allows Fukasaku and Shima to continuously gather
natural energy
 for Jiraiya, as he cannot do so himself while on the move, thus eliminating the weakness of exhausting all of his natural energy in battle. Fukasaku and Shima were not able to fuse with
Naruto Uzumaki
 because
Kurama
 rejected them.

Trivia

The name of this technique is a pun. Ryōsei (
両生
) is the Japanese word for "
amphibian
", but the kanji literally mean "
both lives
" or "
two lives
", referring to how this technique fuses two living beings.
