. They were eventually tracked down, first by
Itachi Uchiha
 and
Kisame Hoshigaki
, who were planning on capturing Naruto, and later by
Sasuke Uchiha
, who wanted to fight his brother Itachi and save Naruto. In the subsequent fights, parts of the inn Naruto and Jiraiya were staying at were destroyed, first by Sasuke's
Chidori
 and after that by Itachi's
Amaterasu
