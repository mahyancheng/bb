" (

,
Iryō Ninja no Deshi
) is episode 11 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Chiyo
's assault on
Kakashi
 is blocked by
Naruto
, who
summons two shadow clones
 to aid him. Chiyo manages to get rid of one, and blocks the attacks of the other shadow clone and Naruto himself, impressing Naruto. She gets ready to attack once more, but she is stopped by
Ebizō
, her brother, who reminds her that the
White Fang of Konoha
 had died years ago. Chiyo laughs it off, and leaves the room with the others at
Sakura
's insistence, who is getting ready to heal
Kankurō
. Outside, Naruto asks Kakashi who the White Fang of Konoha is, and Kakashi replies that it was his father, to the shock of both Chiyo and Ebizō, the latter realising the reason behind their physical similarities. Inside the room, Sakura manages to use her
Delicate Illness Extraction Technique
 to extract most of the poison from Kankurō's body, saving his life. She manages to use whatever medicinal herbs that
Sunagakure
 has in stock to create three
antidotes
. Sakura's medicinal work prompts Chiyo to tell Sakura that she reminds her of
Tsunade
, and Sakura states that Tsunade is her teacher. Ebizō then reminds Chiyo that the river of time has been flowing by them, hence the White Fang's son and Tsunade's pupil.

Takamaru
 returns to Suna with a message from Tsunade, and
Baki
 passes the message to Kakashi. Kakashi tells Naruto that
Team Guy
 has been sent as backup, and Naruto is excited to see
Lee
 and
Neji
, the latter of whom has become a
Jōnin
. Naruto decides to head off to find the
Akatsuki
 right away, but is put in place by Kakashi, who adds that Naruto does not even know where they are. After Baki tells Kakashi that they have lost track of the Akatsuki, Kakashi asks Baki to bring him to where Kankurō was found, in order to track their scent. Kankurō, who has regained consciousness, notifies Kakashi that he managed to obtain a shred of
Sasori
's clothing that he could use to track him. Kakashi
summons his ninja hounds
, and Naruto is elated to reunite with
Pakkun
. Kakashi cuts their reunion short and sends his hounds towards Sasori's scent. Naruto is ecstatic to follow them, but Baki offers them a night's rest due to their long journey, and Kakashi accepts the offer. Kankurō is surprised to see Naruto, and
Temari
 tells him that Naruto came to help them. He remembers how Gaara used to be cold and vicious, even threating to murder Kankurō for getting in his way, to becoming a considerate and caring brother and
Kazekage
, all due to Naruto. Kankurō asks Naruto to save his little brother, and Naruto states that he will, adding that one day he will be
Hokage
.
