"
Target: Locked On
" (
標的捕捉
,
Tāgetto Rokkuon
) is episode 83 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Tsunade
 informs
Sakura
 that
Kakashi
 has assumed leadership of
Team Asuma
 temporarily for their
mission to apprehend the Akatsuki
. Sakura proposes
Team 7
 as the most suitable backup for Team 10 but is given a condition: they will be deployed only if
Naruto
 masters his
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
 technique within the next 24 hours. Faced with the ultimatum, Sakura relays Tsunade's message to Naruto and
Yamato
.

Meanwhile,
Shikamaru
 adjusts his battle plan to incorporate Kakashi's presence, impressing Kakashi with his quick revisions. Utilising her
Mind Body Switch Technique
,
Ino
 takes control of a nearby bird's body and locates
Hidan
 and
Kakuzu
, revealing their approximate distance. The
Akatsuki
 duo senses the intrusion, prompting Ino to cancel the technique. She alerts the team to the Akatsuki members' location, and they decide to initiate their plan for vengeance.

Shikamaru employs his
Shadow Imitation Technique
 to approach them from behind stealthily. Despite Hidan and Kakuzu noticing the shadow and evading it, Shikamaru throws two
kunai
 with
explosive tags
, catching them in the blast. Although surviving, Hidan and Kakuzu are momentarily immobilised. Shikamaru, adding a clever twist, hurls
Asuma
's
chakra blades
 at their shadows, freezing them in place. Puzzled, Hidan questions how they got trapped without the shadow touching them. Shikamaru explains his strategy, revealing that he imbued the blades with his chakra, granting them the properties of his shadow techniques.

Employing his
Shadow Gathering Technique
, Shikamaru uses his shadows to withdraw the chakra blade from Hidan's shadow while connecting it to his own Shadow Imitation. Taking control of Hidan, Shikamaru has him wield the
Triple-Bladed Scythe
 and charge at Kakuzu with the intent to kill. However, Kakuzu, with an underground arm, frees himself from the chakra blade and evades Hidan's attack. Shikamaru, acknowledging his oversight, instructs
Chōji
, who is observing alongside Ino and Kakashi, to strike Kakuzu from above with his
Spiked Human Bullet Tank
 technique."

Trivia

This episode features an animation error: during the scene where Shikamaru ensnares Hidan and Kakuzu in the trap, Kakuzu's crossed-out
Takigakure
 symbol on his
forehead protector
 is missing when the camera shows him looking down.

In the English dub, there is a dubbing error. While Shikamaru discusses the plan with Team Asuma, he states that Hidan and Kakuzu are going after "the
jinchūriki
 within Naruto" instead of "the
tailed beast
 within Naruto".

Furthermore, after
Matatabi
's extraction,
the Akatsuki leader
 mentions there are four more tailed beasts left, as
Isobu
 has not been captured yet. This deviation from the manga is attributed to an anime-only arc that aired shortly after this episode. In the manga, Isobu was sealed immediately before Matatabi. The implication is that the anime-only arc featuring
Utakata
 was not yet planned, as
Saiken
 was not considered one of the tailed beasts that were unaccounted for.
