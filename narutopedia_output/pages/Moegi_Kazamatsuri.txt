Moegi Kazamatsuri
 (
風祭モエギ
,
Kazamatsuri Moegi
) is a
kunoichi
 of
Konohagakure
.

Personality

She is quite optimistic, free spirited and very confident. She has been described as being spoiled and determined.
 In Part II, she has become a lot more like Sakura, shown most prominently when
Konohamaru Sarutobi
 performed his
Sexy: Girl on Girl Technique
. While
Sakura Haruno
 became infuriated, before she had the chance, Moegi punched him saying that it was ridiculous to create a technique as useless as that, more so than performing it in front of a woman.
 She frequently has to correct Konohamaru for his perverted behaviour, though she genuinely cares for him. During
Pain's assault
 on Konoha, she showed the utmost bravery, seen when she saved
a boy
, and even willingly threw herself between him and
Pain
's summon.

In her adulthood, Moegi has become quite strict, becoming easily angered by her
team
's childish antics or if they step out of line, such as when they willingly abandoned their mission to capture
Team Konohamaru
 and instead joined them in searching for the missing
Mitsuki
. She also often teases her former teammate Konohamaru by constantly taunting him about his brother-like relationship with his subordinate
Boruto Uzumaki
, and how the younger Uzumaki often disobeys him due to their more familiar relationship.

Given the way the
Human God Tree

Matsuri
, who was created from her charka and emotions, acted shy and emotional around Konohamaru, even hesitating to devour him and becoming irritated that he was thinking about Moegi instead of her, it is implied that Moegi developed romantic feelings for Konohamaru and was jealous of him around other women.

Appearance

Moegi as a genin.
Moegi as a jōnin.
1/2

In Part I, Moegi, like the rest of the members of the
Konohamaru Ninja Squad
, wore goggles just like Naruto did when he was an academy student. She has orange hair tied up, with red elastics, into two very large pigtails. She also has a perpetual blush. In Part I, she wears a red tank-top over a pink t-shirt layered at the bottom; her pants are grey and she wears the traditional ninja sandals. In Part II, she still has her pigtails but wears a Konohagakure forehead protector. Her outfit is a sleeveless purple vest over a violet t-shirt. Moegi also has on a layered skirt with mid thigh boots.

In adulthood, Moegi wears her large pigtails hanging down. She has bangs that come down to frame her face and also outgrew her perpetual blush. She wears a sleeveless pink shirt with a red ribbon on her neck. She also has a black bracelet on her left wrist and small ring earrings. As an active jōnin, Moegi wears a dark sleeveless jumpsuit that comes down to the knees and a light vest over. She also uses her Konoha forehead protector around her neck, a dark bracelet on each wrist and high-heeled sandals. Her eyes also appear more purple in colour.

Abilities

As a
genin
, she was strong enough to punch Konohamaru several metres away and was fast enough to save Sōta from one of Pain's
giant centipedes
, despite being much further away from him than the summoning was.
 As an adult she had advanced to the rank of
jōnin
, being capable of easily evading and countering
Sarada Uchiha
 while using her
Sharingan
.

Ninjutsu

While of no practical use, as an Academy student, Moegi could perform a
cooperative version
 of the
Sexy Technique
 alongside Konohamaru and
Udon
.
 As an adult, she developed a more efficient array of skills. She possessed
sensory abilities
 and can use the Penetration Technique (
看破の術
,
Kanpa no Jutsu
).

Nature Transformation






Moegi using Water Release.



By adulthood, Moegi is capable of utilising both
Earth
 and
Water Release

nature transformations
. With the former, she can create a
strong defensive wall
 to stop an avalanche of rocks from afar,
 and with the latter, she can unleash a
barrage of water bullets
.
 Through means that have yet to be revealed, Moegi is capable of combining the Earth and Water elements to utilise the
Wood Release
 to perform the Wood Release: Verdure Technique (
木遁・緑色の術
,
Mokuton: Ryokushoku no Jutsu
) and Wood Release: Vegetation Barrier (
木遁・草木結界
,
Mokuton: Sōmoku Kekkai
).

After the assailant escaped, Konohamaru and Moegi investigated events, determining that either the assailant thoroughly researched the place from how seamlessly he got through security or he had an inside informant.

Later, the masked attacker managed to capture Tomaru. A ransom was left that demanded 20 million ryō and for Ashina to be the one to deliver it. During the exchange, as Konohamaru already captured the attacker and disguised himself as the Ame-nin, Ashina was revealed to be the mastermind behind the assaults as she desperately wanted to rekindle her fame as an actress. In a last blind effort to keep her fame by burying the truth, she attempted to blow up the area. While Konohomaru stopped her from using them, the explosive tags went off, causing a landslide, which Moegi saved the bystanders from with an Earth-Style Wall. Soon afterwards Ashina was arrested.

In the anime, when Chōchō tried asking Moegi why all the jōnin of the village were gathering, she brushed the question off. After Mitsuki's apparent betrayal of Konohagakure, the village was put on lockdown. Despite this, Boruto and Sarada decided to sneak out to find Mitsuki. Team 10 was assigned to find and bring back the two genin. The following day, they managed to intercept them. As the two refused to come back peacefully, they created a distraction and then attempted a decoy with Boruto's shadow clones. This succeeded in splitting up Team Moegi between the jōnin and her students. Moegi quickly subdued her targets, which were the decoy shadow clones. On the way back to her team, she was intercepted by a
cloaked assailant
. As she continued battling him, he suddenly retreated. Moegi quickly realised that he was a diversion. When reaching her students' last location, she found a note simply saying "Sorry". Realising that her students decided to help Boruto and Sarada, Moegi was left fuming.

She returned to the village to report. After noting what her students did, Shikamaru deduced that like him, Shikadai realised that something about Mitsuki's apparent betrayal didn't make sense and wished to learn the truth. Later, suspecting that the attacks would make another attempt to kill the recovering guards to cover their tracks, Moegi disguised herself as one. The suspicions proved correct as a brainwashed
Yurito
 tried to
poison
 her. Despite Moegi and Sakura cornering him, he used the poison as a smokescreen to escape.
