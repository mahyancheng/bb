Itachi activates his
Mangekyō Sharingan
, and uses
Tsukuyomi
 on the opponent. The illusion is similar to his original Tsukuyomi genjutsu, as he attacks with his clones, the pinned down opponent which he mentions is going to be for about three days, while it actually lasts for a few seconds in reality.
