This article is about information on the character. For information on the ability, see
Human Path
.

This man was a
shinobi
 of
Takigakure
. Following his death, he became the
Human Path
 of the
Six Paths of Pain
.

Background

On the verge of the
Second Shinobi World War
, he encountered
Jiraiya
 during his journey to find his
disciple
. After dying years later, his corpse was used by
Nagato
 to channel the power of the Human Path in his Six Paths of Pain.

Personality

In the anime, he was a level-headed ninja who believed that all he could do to try and achieve peace was to teach the next generation to survive the battles with other ninja until it came.

Appearance






The Human Path's full appearance.



He was an extremely tall, slender man with long, pale-blue hair that parted at his shoulders, green eyes and a pale complexion. He wore a blue suit underneath a dark-blue Takigakure
flak jacket
 and his village's
forehead protector
.

When his corpse was used as the Human Path, like all of the Six Paths, his long hair was dyed orange and had multiple piercings, including a diagonal bar through its nose, two circular studs in a vertical row on each of its cheeks, two studs placed horizontally on its chin, and a stud on each of its shoulders near its neck. The diagonal nose piercing makes it the only Pain with asymmetrical facial piercings. As a mark of Nagato's control, the
Rinnegan
 appeared in its eyes. Additionally, owing to the man’s height when alive, this body was the tallest of the Six Paths.

Legacy






The Human Path destroyed.



As part of the Six Paths of Pain, the Human Path is used for a number of different purposes over the years: all six Paths are used to overthrow and kill
Hanzō
; when Jiraiya infiltrates
Amegakure
 in order to find out more about
Akatsuki
, the Human Path fights him and ultimately contributes to his death; in the anime, the Human Path assists in the capture of the
Six-Tails
; it participates during
Pain's Assault
, and like the other Paths it is defeated by
Naruto Uzumaki
.
