Chiriku
 (
地陸
) was a
ninja monk
 from the
Fire Temple
. He was also one of the
Twelve Guardian Ninja
 guards for the
Land of Fire
's
daimyō
.

Background






Chiriku and Asuma as part of the Twelve Guardian Ninja.



He was once part of the Twelve Guardian Ninja, indicated by the sash on his waist, at which time he developed a strong friendship with
Asuma Sarutobi
. During this time, some underground organisation put a 30 million
ryō
 bounty on his head.

When six of the members tried a coup d'etat, he fought against them along with the other five members of their group. Chiriku, Asuma, and
Kazuma
 were the only survivors of the fight. Following the group's destruction, he became head monk at the
Fire Temple
, an elite monastery that is home to monks with special abilities. In the anime, it is revealed that Chiriku was once a student of
Chūkaku
. He apparently surpassed his master at some point.

Personality

Chiriku was a seemingly calm and composed individual described as being unaffected — hardly letting anything phase him. Despite this, Chiriku was a righteous man that when angered, would display it greatly. He was also described as being a sincere individual.

Appearance

Chiriku was a bald man with dark eyes, and very thick eyebrows. He wore the standard attire of the ninja monk along with the sash worn by members of the Twelve Guardian Ninja group and went barefoot.

Abilities






Chiriku using Welcoming Approach: Thousand-Armed Murder.



Chiriku was a highly capable fighter, having been a member of the
Twelve Guardian Ninja
, earning a bounty of 30,000,000
ryō
 in the underground black market. As the head of the Fire Temple, Chiriku was well-versed in all of the Fire Temple's secret teachings. Likewise, he was a master of the Fire Temple's secret taijutsu style, able to compete defend and counter
Hidan
 and
Kakuzu
's simultaneous assault for a period. In the anime, his abilities were great enough that
Kabuto Yakushi
 wanted to
reincarnate
 him for use in the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

Ninjutsu

Having studied under and surpassing his master,
Chūkaku
, Chiriku had advanced knowledge of chakra and sealing formulas.
  Chiriku was proficient in
barrier ninjutsu
, able to create a
powerful barrier
 around the Fire Temple to protect it from intruders. He achieved mastery for the Fire Temple's ultimate technique, the
Welcoming Approach: Thousand-Armed Murder
. He also seemed to be skilled with
fūinjutsu
, as seen when he and several other monks attempted to
suppress
 Sora's demon chakra.

In the anime, when it was discovered that the graves of his fallen allies were robbed, Chiriku contacted
Konohagakure
 for help. It was also revealed that since the failed coup d'etat, Chiriku had been looking after and training Kazuma's only child,
Sora
. Ashamed of Kazuma's decision to join the coup d'etat, Chiriku chose to never tell Sora the truth. Despite how the rest of the Fire Temple felt and treated Sora, Chiriku was sympathetic to Sora's hardship and did what he could to keep his morale up, yet at the same time keep him in line.

After an attempt to retrieve the stolen corpses failed and it became clear that Sora's
demonic
 side was becoming more uncontrollable, Chiriku decided to have Sora join
Team Yamato
 return to Konoha under the guise of filling in for the injured
Sai
, where in truth it was for Sora to be better watched after.

black market exchange point
 to get the bounty for his body.

Trivia

Chiriku's name comes from
chi
 meaning "earth", and
riku
 meaning "land".

According to the databook:

Chiriku wished to fight
Asuma Sarutobi
.

In
Naruto: Shippūden
 episode 76
, when Kakuzu and Hidan arrive at the bounty station and the
bounty exchange master
 flips through his bingo book, Chiriku is listed as being 5'11" and having an AB blood type, which conflicts with his databook profile.

Chiriku's face appeared on a lantern in the ending
omake
 of
Naruto: Shippūden
 episode 129
.

In the anime,
Kabuto Yakushi
 wished to reincarnate Chiriku. However, he ultimately failed.
