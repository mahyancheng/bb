The
Shiin Clan
 was a small
shinobi
 clan from the
Land of the Rice Fields
,
 where
Orochimaru
 established the
Land of Sound
. Despite their size, they were famous in the country due to their high ideals and determination. After
Otogakure
 was founded, all the skilled members joined Otogakure, and when the country's
daimyō
 stopped hiring them, their leader
Shiin
 set his eyes on a goldmine near the country's border, as a way to support his clan.
 He and the clan members were met with resistance at the village, and thus, they attacked and killed a majority of them.
Menma
 panicked and tried to escape, but ended up falling off a cliff and losing his memory. He was later
saved
 by
Naruto
.

Later, during their final attack on the village, the members were all defeated.

The clan has a
hiden
 technique that allows them to
erase another individual's memories
.

The members also have a special tattoo on the right upper arm, with the appearance of a purple band circling the arm three times. This tattoo is only visible when the wearer was perspiring.
