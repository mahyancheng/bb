Kabuto first summons three corpses in his image from his
scroll
. The first corpse goes underground, appears behind and kicks the opponent towards the other corpses, who also attack the opponent with their chakra scalpels. Kabuto then launches the final attack at the opponent, cleaving their throat with his chakra scalpel and making a wall of
chakra
 erupt from underneath which cuts the opponent's body again.
