Trivia





The first and last pages of the
Naruto
 series as they originally appeared in
Weekly Shōnen Jump
.



This chapter acts as an epilogue for the series, taking place long after the events depicted in chapter
699
 and
The Last: Naruto the Movie
, which is officially classified as chapter 699.5.

Unique to all other chapters in the series, this chapter was originally released in colour as opposed to black-and-white. Artra Entertainment, the studio responsible for colourising the
Naruto: Colour Edition
 digital re-release, provided support to help meet the deadline. The tankōbon version of this chapter was released in black-and-white, thought it was later released in full colour in both the
Zai no Sho
 guidebook and the digital
Colour Edition
 of Volume 72.

The final page of the chapter mirrors the first page of the series, with the first telling the story of how
Kurama
 became sealed into Naruto and the latter telling the story of Naruto's life and how he became the Seventh
Hokage
.

On Naruto's face on the Hokage Rock, Boruto paints the
Straw Hat Pirates
'
jolly roger
, a reference to the
Weekly Shōnen Jump
 manga
One Piece
 by rival mangaka and friend
Eiichiro Oda
. In return, the
cover art
 of
One Piece'
s
chapter 766
 references
Naruto
, and in the week's author comments section, Oda thanks Kishimoto for being his friend and rival.

The other authors for the
Weekly Shōnen Jump
 series also say their farewell words to
Kishimoto
 for finishing his work in their weekly comments.
