Synopsis

Kawaki
 thinks about how the assassination plot played out. He accompanies
Himawari
 to the
Academy
, despite being taken off his mission to protect
Kae
.
Hana
 also returns, and discusses the attack with
Anko
 and
Shino
, having learned Kae might have been the target.
Osuka
 coordinates the class in welcoming Hana back. Kawaki messes up the release of flower petals for a surprise, Hana thanks them for caring about her and apologises for her shortcomings as their teacher. At the end of the day, Hana recalls what Shino and Anko told her of the assassination plot against Kae, and checking on the places she was during the festival, feels guilty about never perceiving the danger. She struggles to remember what she was doing and how she got caught in the blast. Kawaki arrives, and Hana recovers memories of fighting him and being the assassin after Kae. She excuses herself, and recovers more memories of fighting Kawaki. Hana rummages through her apartment, and discovers a hidden room with the assassin's belongings. Realising the truth, she decides to turn herself in, but her alter, speaking to her through her reflection won't allow it.
 Hana's alter recalls her that she is a
Land of Bamboo
 orphan raised by
its minister
 as a personal assassin, the one remaining of a group of around 50, having had to kill her friends in the training process. Her desire to survive clashed so much with her desire against killing that her mind split. As the survivor, she was assigned the mission by the Bamboo minister, who has sent agents like her to various countries, her desire to be a teacher actually an order by the minister her alter caused her to want. Hana's alter was responsible for the kidnapping, wanting to gauge Kawaki's strength. She used an associate's corpse to fake the assassin being killed during the attack. After all her trouble, Hana's alter won't let her turn herself in now that the matter is considered closed, and she is firmly established as a teacher who cares deeply about her students. Hana's alter takes over, and she wakes up. Himawari calls Kawaki for dinner, and he reveals his intent to keep investigating, finding it strange that the assassin had set up the
explosive tags
 on themselves, anticipating defeat, when having fought them, Kawaki found them incredibly skilled. At class the next day, Hana's alter passes as her, discreetly discarding the petals her student's gave her alongside a butterfly that flew by her. Kawaki notices it. Hana stops her alter from attacking Kae, who is being accompanied home by Kawaki and Himawari. Hana's alter berates her. At Kae's home, Kawaki investigates where the assassin broke through, before being called for tea and cookies.
