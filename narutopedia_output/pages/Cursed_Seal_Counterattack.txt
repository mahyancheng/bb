Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

The
Orochimaru Search Team
 is unable to locate
Naruto
 or
Guren
 by the lake, worrying
Yūkimaru
. He goes off with
Sai
 as
Kakashi
,
Shino
 and
Yamato
 prepare to deal with the
Three-Tailed Turtle
, whom they have just awoken.
Shizune
,
Ino
,
Sakura
 and
Hinata
 stand behind them and erect the
Four-Corner Sealing Barrier
 in an attempt to seal away the
tailed beast
 once more.
Team Guren
, with enhanced strength due to their
cursed seals
, make quick work of
Lee
,
Tenten
,
Kiba
 and
Akamaru
 and move on to deal with Sai. Sai ends up losing the fight, although he is able to use his
Super Beast Imitating Drawing
 technique to transmit a warning to Kakashi.

After defeating Sai and retrieving Yūkimaru, the team brings him to
Rinji
 and state that they have no need to follow him anymore and that they are going off on their own. However, they soon succumb to the after effects of the cursed seal and are forced to beg Rinji for
Kabuto
's pills, which would counteract those effects. After pledging their loyalty to
Orochimaru
, they head off to deal with the
Konoha

shinobi
 as Rinji pressures Yūkimaru into using his
Three-Tails Chakra: Release
 once more.

Sensing their enemies, Yamato uses his
Wood Release: World of Trees Wall
 to protect the sealing team while simultaneously dealing with
Kihō
, who launches a
Smoke Dragon
 towards him, engulfing him in smoke. Kakashi deals with
Kigiri
, who tricks him using a
Smoke Clone
 and then creates
multiple smoke clones
 to aid in their fight; Shino has his
bugs
 attack
Nurari
, only for Nurari to slip the bugs off and use his
Viscous Water Mass
 attack against Shino. Elsewhere, as Akamaru manages to locate Sai, Naruto and Guren regain consciousness and realise that they have escaped from the belly of the beast. However, they spot a beam of chakra hitting the sky and realise that Yūkimaru is using his power once more.
