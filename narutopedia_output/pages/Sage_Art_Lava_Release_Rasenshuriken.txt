A powerful technique whereby Naruto, after accessing
Son Gokū
's
power
, creates a
Rasenshuriken
 with a lava-infused nucleus, the heat of which causes the blades themselves to emit steam. The technique is strong enough to destroy a target's legs, and when expanded, it was powerful enough to bisect the
Ten-Tails
' tree form completely.
