 Bet Ya Never Seen This) is chapter 682 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Free from
Kaguya
 and
Black Zetsu
,
Naruto
 tells
Sasuke
 that he plans to use a special technique that he was practising in secret, more so than the
Rasengan
, and could distract her long enough for them to use the sealing technique.
 Meanwhile, as Naruto's clone,
Kakashi
 and
Sakura
 watch on from far away, Kakashi contemplates on the mechanics of Kaguya's power to
shift

dimensions
 almost instantaneously and Naruto uses his
new power
 to revive
Obito
. Putting their plan into action, Sasuke uses
Amaterasu
 to engulf Kaguya, as she merely brushes off the attack, Naruto jumps in front of her and uses his
new technique
, much to everyone's shock and bafflement. But, much to their surprise, Naruto managed to punch Kaguya and Sasuke uses his
teleportation ability
 to transport himself and Naruto near her, but just as they were about to seal her, Kaguya encased all three of them inside a giant block of ice. With Kaguya now shifting everyone into a vast frozen mountainside, she
escapes
 the ice and prepares to use Black Zetsu to once again drain Naruto and Sasuke's
chakra
. Kakashi, meanwhile theorises that Kaguya's power to shift dimensions works the same way as
genjutsu
, except it is reality. As Sasuke uses
Kagutsuchi
 to free himself and Naruto from the ice, Black Zetsu recommends fighting them one at a time. Following his advice, Kaguya suddenly grabs Sasuke and throws him into a desert dimension.
