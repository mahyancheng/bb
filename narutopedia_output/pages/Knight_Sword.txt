's personal
sword

. However, the sword's blade can extend, thus becoming a full-length broadsword. Other than using the sword as-is, Temujin can channel
gelel energy
 into the sword, drastically increasing his attack range and allowing him to perform various techniques with it, such as
Raging Thunder
. Temujin can also convert the Gelel energy into a beam of light, sending a signal to
