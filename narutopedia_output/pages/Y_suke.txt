Yūsuke
 (
ユウスケ
) is a fisherman in the
Land of Fire
.

Background

When he was a child, he and his
father
 tried to catch a
giant summoned marlin
, they failed, resulting in his father's death. Yūsuke became determined to avenge his father by catching the marlin.

Part II

Paradise Life on a Boat

When
Aoba
 and
Guy
 were beaten by a summoned marlin (a victim of the
Third Great Shinobi War
), Yūsuke tried to beat it, only to be saved by
Naruto
. He said because of the summon, fishermen were scared to catch fish and thus were unable to venture into the sea. He wanted to have a sturdier boat, an internal combustion engine and a fishing rod with which he could catch the marlin.

The following day, using his sturdy fishing rod and boat, created by
Yamato
 using
Wood Release
, and the boat being powered by Guy using the
Eight Gates
, Yūsuke managed to catch the marlin, but allowed Naruto, Guy, Aoba and Yamato to return it to its birthplace. The next morning, the four ninja prepared themselves for their departure, and went to sea. Yūsuke waves goodbye to Naruto as the ninja set sail.

Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison
