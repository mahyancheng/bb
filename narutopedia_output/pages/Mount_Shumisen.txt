Mount Shumisen.



Mount Shumisen
 (
須弥山
,
Shumisen-zan
,
literally meaning:
 Mountain that Pervades Necessarily) was where
Hiruko
 set up his base of operation in the
third Shippūden movie
. On the way there, there are four gates, the first three guarded by one of
Hiruko's subordinates
. On top of the mountain was Hiruko's fortress, where he had all his
Kekkei Genkai
-carrying victims crucified.

Mount Shumisen is one of the three requirements for Hiruko's
Chimera Technique
 to completely absorb all five of Hiruko's victims, "earth", and the mountain being close to the solar eclipse, which is another requirement, "heaven". The five human sacrifices, "human", would allow Hiruko to become immortal and perfect. When
Naruto Uzumaki
 prevented Hiruko from completing the ritual of absorbing
Kakashi Hatake
 (which inadvertently saved Hiruko from Kakashi's
time-triggered

Kamui
), Hiruko released a massive wave of chakra to destroy his own fortress, and their ensuing battle, alongside that of Hiruko's fused subordinates against
Konoha 11
, caused much of the mountain to be blown apart.

Trivia

The name of the mountain is likely derived from
Mount Sumeru or Shumi-sen
 (
須弥山 or しゅみせん
,
Chinese: Xumishan
), the mountain at the centre of the World in ancient Hindu-Buddhist cosmology. Its prominence is emphasised by some everlasting snow that seems to cover it and the Shitenno, the Four Heavenly Kings, that protect the four continents surrounding Mt. (Su) Meru.

Seeing how the mount itself is located in the middle of the continent (in the border of
Iwagakure
 and
Kusagakure
 and surrounded by four of
Five Great Shinobi Countries
), it may be based from the lore itself.

The Shitenno, the Four Heavenly Kings, that protect the four continents surrounding Mt. (Su) Meru also a reference about four gates which guarded by
 Hiruko
 and his subordinates which guarding four level of this mountain. Each person guarding a specific area respectively.
