"
Showdown: Gaara vs. Kimimaro
" (
最強対決!我愛羅VS君麻呂!!
,
Saikyō Taiketsu! Gaara tai Kimimaro!!
) is episode 126 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Gaara
 arrives just in time to save
Lee
's life. He mentions that Lee isn't as fast or agile as he was before, and remembers the injuries he inflicted on Lee during the
Chūnin Exams
. Not wanting Lee to get hurt, Gaara uses his sand to pull Lee back and tells him to sit the fight out. Gaara uses his sand to fight Kimimaro, which prompts Kimimaro to attempt to destroy Gaara's gourd, as he believes it is the only source of sand Gaara possesses. Gaara, however, uses the sand on the ground to restrain Kimimaro and then uses his
Sand Drizzle
 technique followed with a
Sand Binding Coffin
, although Kimimaro avoids being crushed to death due to his bone density. Gaara decides to use his
Sand Waterfall Funeral
 to attempt to crush Kimimaro again, though by activating his
cursed seal
, Kimimaro survives the attack. Calling upon a greater amount of Sand, Gaara uses his
Quicksand Waterfall Flow
 to create a sand tsunami and then uses his
Sand Waterfall Imperial Funeral
 technique that not only smothers Kimimaro, but levels the terrain as well. To both Gaara and Kimimaro's surprise, the latter survives the attack.

Gaara mentions to Lee that Kimimaro's eyes remind him of
Sasuke
's, claiming that their eyes belie the fact that both wish to find the purpose of their existence. Stuck within the sand, Kimimaro reminisces on how he was raised in the darkness, imprisoned in a cell because of his
kekkei genkai
, only being let out to fight. The clan's
patriarch
 used him as a weapon in an attempt to take down
Kirigakure
. Kimimaro was tasked with the sole objective of killing any ninja from Kirigakure, and encountered
Orochimaru
,
Zabuza
 and
Haku
, the latter two telling Kimimaro that they were not from Kiri in order to avoid a fight. After killing all of those in his way, Kimimaro discovered that the entire
Kaguya Clan
 has been slaughtered as well. Feeling lonely and without a purpose, Kimimaro wandered on his own until he was found by Orochimaru, who took him in. Kimimaro believes that his sole purpose in life is to protect Orochimaru and his goals, hence why he hasn't died yet. Going into the second state of his cursed seal, Kimimaro breaks free of the sand and lunges towards Gaara and Lee.

Meanwhile,
Naruto
 continues to chase Sasuke in an attempt to convince the former Leaf ninja to return to
Konoha
.
