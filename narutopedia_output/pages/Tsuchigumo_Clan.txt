The
Tsuchigumo Clan
 (
土蜘蛛一族
,
Tsuchigumo Ichizoku
) is a clan that formed a pact with the
Third Hokage
 during the
Third Shinobi World War
. The clan's leader at that time,
En no Gyōja
, developed a
technique
 that could wipe out an entire village. By terms of the pact with the Third Hokage, En no Gyōja declared the technique to be
forbidden
, in exchange for protection provided by
Konoha
 in times of need.





The Tsuchigumo clan's hidden village.



The clan has a small fort on
Mount Katsuragi
 that is surrounded by a barrier, and a field with many hidden traps. Additionally, they also have their own hidden village.

During the Third Shinobi World War the Tsuchigumo Clan was hailed as a powerful and proud clan, because they possessed the
powerful Tsuchigumo clan kinjutsu
. Using it, they were able to tilt the balance of the war.
  Although they were often targeted for that reason, leading to many clan members being killed and leaving only few remaining clan members who was capable of using the kinjutsu. After that the clan became weak and En no Gyōja and the village elder had disagreements over the clan's survival. This led to the clan splitting into two groups with one in the
Tsuchigumo Village
 and the other at Mount Katsuragi. Only few opted to follow En no Gyōja to Mount Katsuragi.
