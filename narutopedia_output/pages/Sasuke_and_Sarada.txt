 anime.

Synopsis

Shizune
 informs
Sakura
 that
Sarada
 went after
Naruto
 to meet
Sasuke
, a photo of
Taka
 having sparked her interest. Sakura had hoped that Sarada would not get caught up in Sasuke's conflicts. Meanwhile, at
Ridge Tower
, Sasuke reaches for Sarada, who calls him out as her father, stunning him. Naruto then arrives with
Chōchō
, and Sasuke asks him why he brought children with him. Chōchō wonders if Sasuke is the father she remembers. Sarada tells Sasuke she learned Naruto was meeting him and followed him to ask Sasuke if Sakura is her real mother. Sakura and Shizune discuss Sarada, and how certain things about her father were kept from her, like him being an enemy of
Konoha
 at one time. Shizune thinks Sakura should have more faith in Sarada.
 Sarada calls Sasuke out on never being around, and asks him about the woman with glasses in the photo. His unwillingness to give informative answers causes her to storm out. Sasuke and Naruto recall when Sasuke left the village to search for threats related to
Kaguya
, knowledge of which was deemed top secret. Shin's father proclaims the revival of
Akatsuki
 to
Shin and several Shin copies
. Chōchō offers Sasuke chips to share with Sarada, but Sasuke detects something. Shin and his father attack Naruto and Sarada, but Naruto easily parries their attack. Sasuke deflects the weapons Shin's father guides his way, and holds Sasuke's sword to let Shin attack him. Sasuke switches places with Shin, and attacks them both with
Fire Release
. Shin's father defends himself by putting Shin between himself and the fire. Shin's father also introduces himself as Shin Uchiha, who had come looking for Sarada. Naruto restrains both Shins with chakra arms, but while everyone is distracted, Shin's creature teleports both Shins away. The creature tries to take Sarada, but Sakura pushes her out of the way, and is teleported in her place. Sakura finds herself surrounded by other Shin in their base.

Trivia

When the original Shin is seen kneeling after falling to the ground, he is erroneously seen with two hands.
