The
Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths
 (
六道仙人の宝具
,
Rikudō Sennin no Hōgu
), also known as the
Six Paths Sacred Treasures
 (
六道の神器
,
Rikudō no Jingi
)
, are a set of powerful tools said to have once been wielded by the
Sage of Six Paths
 himself. They are considered the most powerful ninja tools, and it is said those who demonstrate their power surpass even the
Five Kage
.
 However, their usage consumes an enormous amount of
chakra
, so much so that a normal human could die if they used them.

Background





Kohaku no Jōhei, the fifth tool.



The five treasured tools have been handed down in
Kumogakure
 since ancient times.
 Eventually, they came into the possession of the
Gold and Silver Brothers
. As the siblings possessed immense chakra reserves and later became imbued with a small amount of the
Nine-Tails
' chakra, they were capable of wielding the treasures without fatal repercussions. Using these tools, the brothers were able to drive the
Second Hokage
 and
Second Raikage
 to the brink of death when they ambushed them at a peace ceremony.
 Of the five, Kumogakure only managed to retrieve the
Kohaku no Jōhei
 from the brothers,
 and the
Third Raikage
 later used it to seal the
Eight-Tails
 whenever it went on a rampage in the village.

Prior to the
Fourth Shinobi World War
,
Kabuto Yakushi

reincarnated
 the brothers, and they were once again given access to the remaining four treasured tools. During the war, they used the tools against
Darui
, who ultimately managed to seal them inside the
Benihisago
 and Kohaku no Jōhei.

Tenten
 later discovered the
Bashōsen
 and used it to destroy at least one of
Kakuzu
's
masks
.
 At the end of the war's first day,
Tobi
 appeared on the battlefield and took the tools containing the brothers in order to use the Nine-Tails' chakra inside them for his
Eye of the Moon Plan
,
 later feeding the tools to the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 to begin its transformation into the
Ten-Tails
.
 The two tools were later regurgitated by
Madara Uchiha
 after he became the Ten-Tails'
jinchūriki
, as he claimed they made him feel heavy; they landed on top of
Might Guy
 and
Rock Lee
.
 Tenten
sealed
 the two tools within a scroll, but was unable to use them against the enemy before being caught in the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
.
 At the war's conclusion, Darui managed to release the
two

shinobi
 the brothers had trapped inside the Benihisago.
 Years later, the Benihisago,
Kōkinjō
, and Bashōsen were proudly placed on display in Tenten's weapons shop.
