Naruto uses Wind Release: Rasengan, which, when used in tandem with his holding the
Dragon Blade
, enhances the technique, causing a dragon of wind to swirl around Naruto, damaging the surroundings around him.

This technique was unintentionally created when Naruto and his allies were trapped inside the collapsing
Mount Koryū
, causing him to use a Rasengan to try and break through the entrance. The Dragon Blade responded to its wielder's heightened emotions and lent him its power.
