Naruto's Fan Girls
 is a group of young kunoichi who not only idolise, but are also infatuated with
Naruto Uzumaki
. Two years after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Naruto also had acquired a ridiculously huge fan base among young women from the hidden villages throughout the world. Later, the
three

kunoichi
 from Konohagakure were among the guests in attendance at Naruto and
Hinata
's wedding, congratulating their hero.

Trivia

According to the
guidebook
, these three kunoichi from
Konohagakure
 like Naruto because he's the hero that ended the war and saved the world, and now that the war is over and things are peaceful, they would rather flirt with and chase after Naruto than focusing on their training or missions.

The girls make a small brief appearance in
Naruto Shippūden

episode 479
 among the crowd of people in front of Konoha's entrance wanting to see Naruto.
