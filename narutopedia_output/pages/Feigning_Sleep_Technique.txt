Gaara
 uses this technique to force himself to fall asleep. This causes him to surrender control to
Shukaku
, who is
sealed
 within him. While it is the dominant personality, Shukaku has complete access to its large
chakra
 reserves, which it uses according to its inherently destructive tendencies.
 Before using this technique, Gaara creates a full replica of Shukaku out of
sand
 for it to use.
 Gaara emerges from the replica's forehead in order to perform this technique, where his body remains even after he's asleep. This represents a vulnerability, as opponents can focus their attacks on Gaara with the goal of rousing him.
 If they do successfully wake Gaara, Shukaku's personality will be suppressed again.

Trivia

This technique also translates to something akin to "Tanuki Sleep Technique", or in some dubs "Playing Possum Jutsu". This is a reference to Shukaku being a
tanuki
.

In
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm
,
Naruto
 uses a similar technique while in a pyjama costume, causing him to fall asleep while his health bar recovers.
