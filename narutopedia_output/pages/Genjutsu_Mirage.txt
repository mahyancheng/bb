Kurenai stands up straight with her head bowed and her hands to her chest.  As she stomps on the ground, pink leaves surround her, and the area is enveloped in a pink mist. The opponent is confused as to where Kurenai went. Suddenly, the opponent is punched back and as the opponent is spinning backwards Kurenai appears in front of them and attacks the opponent in mid-air.
