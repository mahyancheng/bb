Daizen Matsushige
 (
松重ダイゼン
,
Matsushige Daizen
) is a former thief that had settled in
Konohagakure
 as a shopkeeper.

Background

Daizen had committed various thefts and murders during his time as a thief. He had once encountered a shinobi, the father of
Hibiki
 and
Kodama
, who he had killed, though not before the latter left a cross shaped scar on his chest. Daizen would later start a new life owning a grocery shop in Konoha.

Personality






Daizen shows a greedy nature.



A fugitive from justice, Daizen pretended to be a respectable person, doing business in the store and helping the local old ladies, earning their respect. He has also shown a fake love for cats, allegedly worrying about
Mikazuki
 running away from
Mitsuki
, but in reality throwing stones at them. Daizen is cruel and arrogant, willing to blame others for his crimes, stating that he "would not tolerate false accusations". He laughed at Hibiki and Kodama's accusations, and decided to become famous by killing them, earning praise for taking out criminals who had been attacking former shinobi.

Appearance

Daizen is a portly man of medium height with brown eyes, a large nose, and short, dishevelled hair that is shaved at the bottom of his head. When working in a shop, he wears a white shirt, black pants, plain sandals, and a green apron with a badge on the chest. In battles, Daizen prefers a blue suit with one large button on the jacket. He also has a cross-shaped scar on his chest, which he disguises.

Abilities

As a former shinobi, Daizen successfully stole and killed for many years, hiding his involvement by pretending to be a witness to his own crimes. He deduced that attacks on former shinobi were targeting him, and researched how they were attacked to prepare himself, successfully countering their sleeping gas, and tricking Hibiki and Kodama close enough to attack. He is good at close combat and fought with a kunai against two sword fighters.

Ninjutsu






Daizen use Wind Release.



Daizen is proficient in
Wind Release
 and his skill in this area has been noted by
Kōtarō Fūma
. He is able to create
wind blades
 with enough power to create a large gouge in a block of wood and leave wounds on Hibiki's face.

New Era

When Mitsuki had asked for the whereabouts of his missing cat, Daizen offered to let him know if he saw any similar looking cats. The next day, a customer talked to him about the attacks on ex-shinobi, also bringing up that Daizen was a shinobi as well. Daizen claimed it was only a desk job. Later, he found Mikazuki behind his shop and scared him off.






Daizen's disguise is revealed.



At night, as Daizen closed his shop, he was attacked by Hibiki and Kodama. However, he anticipated their ambush and fought back, thinking that by killing them he would be hailed as a hero. As Daizen was about to kill them, Mitsuki intercepted him. Daizen confirmed to
Team 7
 and Kōtarō Fūma that the duo were the attackers. Hibiki and Kodama accused him of being their father's killer and only wanted to see the scar on his chest. Daizen revealed to everyone no scar, though it is revealed as a ruse when Mikazuki scratched off prosthetics covering it. Though
Sarada Uchiha
 didn't think it was enough proof, Mitsuki believed their claims and pointed out the injury he inflicted on Hibiki, and Kōtarō suggested comparing it to the ones inflicted in the unsolved robberies and murders. Daizen attempted to flee but was
stopped
 by Mitsuki.
