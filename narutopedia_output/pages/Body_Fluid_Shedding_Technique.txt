A technique that allows
Kabuto
 to liquefy his body and the snakes he controls at will, which he created after examining and altering the
Hōzuki clan
's
Hydrification Technique
.

Usage

By partitioning parts of his body using his own bodily fluids, Kabuto is able to separate portions of himself in a manner reminiscent of a snake shedding its skin, similar to
another technique
, while leaving behind only trails of chakra-infused liquid. This allows him to escape from bindings and regenerate from attacks. Due to these resulting trails of fluid, Kabuto can inhibit
sensing techniques
 from detecting him, such as
dōjutsu
. He can also liquefy his insides to prevent himself from experiencing the harmful effects of
intense sound vibrations
.
