The cemetery.



The
Konoha Cemetery
 is where citizens of the
village
 are buried and is located at its outskirts.
 The cemetery has a sculpture at the front, representing the
Will of Fire
 of the village, and has the kanji for
Hokage
 (
火影
,
literally meaning:
 Fire Shadow) inscribed on its base.

When
Kakashi Hatake
 came to visit
Rin Nohara
's grave, he confided to the gravestone of
Kushina Uzumaki
's impending labour. This became instrumental to the
tragedy
 that would befall Konoha soon, as
Obito Uchiha
 returned to the village and overheard this confidential information while he went to visit Rin's grave as well. Before making use of this information, Obito contemptuously threw aside the flowers that Kakashi placed onto Rin's grave.

In the anime,
Academy students
 are shown performing cemetery maintenance, such as gravestone cleaning and replacement of flowers.

Kabuto Yakushi
, on the other hand, defiled the graves of several famous Konoha shinobi so that he could perform
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
.
