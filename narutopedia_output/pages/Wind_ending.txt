Lyrics

English

Cultivate your hunger before you idealise.

Motivate your anger to make them all realise.

Climbing the mountain, never coming down.

Break into the contents, never falling down.

My knee is still shaking, like I was twelve,

Sneaking out of the classroom, by the back door.

A man railed at me twice though, but I didn't care.

Waiting is wasting for people like me.

Don't try to live so wise.

Don't cry 'cause you're so right.

Don't dry with fakes or fears,

'Cause you will hate yourself in the end.

English (Full Version)

Cultivate your hunger, before you idealise.

Motivate your anger, to make them all realise.

Climbing the mountain, never coming down.

Break into the contents, never falling down.

My knee is still shaking like I was twelve,

Sneakin' out the classroom, by the back door.

A man railed at me twice, though but I didn't care.

Waiting is wasting, for people like me.

Don't try to live so wise,

Don't cry 'Cause you're so right.

Don't dry, with fakes or fears,

'Cause you will hate yourself in the end.

Don't try to live so wise,

Don't cry 'Cause you're so right.

Don't dry, with fakes or fears,

'Cause you will hate yourself in the end.

You say dreams are dreams.

I ain't gonna play the fool anymore.

You say cause I still got my soul,

Take your time baby.

The road needs slowin' down.

Reach yourself, before you gloom.

Reflections of fear make shadows of nothing.

-shadow of nothing-

You still are blind if you see winding road,

'Cause there's always a straight way to the point you see.

Don't try to live so wise,

Don't cry 'Cause you're so right.

Don't dry, with fakes or fears,

'Cause you will hate yourself in the end.

Don't try to live so wise,

Don't cry 'Cause you're so right.

Don't dry, with fakes or fears,

'Cause you will hate yourself in the end.

Don't try to live so wise,

Don't cry 'cause you're so right.

Don't dry, with fakes or fears,

'Cause you will hate yourself in the end.

'Cause you will hate yourself in the end.

'Cause you will hate yourself in the end.

'Cause you will hate yourself in the end.
