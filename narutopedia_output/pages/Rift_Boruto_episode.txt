 anime.

Synopsis

Funamushi
 receives reports that the bridges on their path have been brought down, and wonders if
Kirigakure
 learned of their plan.
Denki
 and
Iwabee
 watch from a distance and see that the
Funato
 have sent a scouting party through the forest, and rush to warn the village.
Boruto
 comments on how reliable the
swordsmen
 have been, and
Kagura
 says he's the one who taught him to trust like that.
Hebiichigo
 is cheerful about stopping Funamushi, but
Buntan
 asks about her attempt to kill Kagura. She confesses she isn't hopeful that they'll get an acquittal even if they survive, and doesn't wish to waste another chance, that being the reason they didn't join in
Shizuma
's escape. Hebiichigo believes that if they can slip away, they can rejoin Shizuma, but Buntan warns her she doesn't know anything about him, and not to trust the wrong person like she did. She reveals she planned the escape with Shizuma, where he told her he'd leave Hebiichigo and
Kyohō
 behind, and use
Hassaku
 and
Ichirōta
 as sacrificial pawns. When the plan happened, the prison's food was poisoned, affecting Buntan. Shizuma confessed this was part of the plan, and told her he loved her as he abandoned her.
 Hebiichigo asks why she waited all this time to tell her. Buntan says it was embarrassing, and that she didn't want Hebiichigo to be unable to forgive Shizuma like she is. Buntan plans to track Shizuma down and kill him after being released, but doesn't want to drag others into it. Kagura on the other hand hasn't abandoned them at any point, so she warns Hebiichigo she won't hold back if she tries killing him again. Hebiichigo doesn't want to die a pointless death. Denki and Iwabee arrive with word of the scouting party, which threatens to derail their plan to funnel the Funato through the ravine. They need to trick the scouting party that the village is harmless, so many of the villagers have to be evacuated.
Kawaki
 takes off his
forehead protector
 because of the heat, which is taken by one of the small children to play. Kagura releases the cursed seal on the swordsmen, explaining that if he dies in battle, the seal would have killed them as well. One of the children says the others went to the mountains, one of them with Kawaki's forehead protector. Kawaki wants to retrieve them, and Kagura joins him as he knows the terrain, also asking for Boruto and
Mitsuki
 to join them. They're able to get to them in time to hide from the Funato scouts. The scouts arrive at the village, claiming control over it, and ask about the bridges and barricades.
Metal Lee
 notices Hebiichigo disappeared. A baby cries, drawing the attention of the Funato, but Iwabee hides the house they're in with
Earth Release
, and the village head attributes the sound to cats that come for their fish. Metal finds Hebiichigo, who is pessimistic about the fight, and reveals she no longer has the cursed seal. He asks if she'll abandon Buntan and Kyohō, but she claims they're not her friends, and knocks him out. She can't bring herself to kill him, but thinks he'll die fighting the Funato either way. The scouts report back to Funamushi, who gives the order to go to the village. Metal gets back and informs everyone about Hebiichigo. Despite
Sarada
's reservations, Kagura allows Kyohō and Buntan to go after Hebiichigo.
