Mercenary ninja.



A
Mercenary ninja
 (
傭兵忍者
,
Yōhei Ninja
) is a skilled
ninja
 who is hired to fight for another country other than their own in exchange for money.

Before the founding of shinobi
villages
, the majority of the
clans
 in existence at that point were mercenary military forces for hire by whomever.
 After shinobi are united in villages, however, such mercenary ninjas fight not out of loyalty to their own country, which would classify them all as
missing-nin
.

Due to mercenaries not being bound to the laws of the legal shinobi system, it is a risk to employ their services as they may betray their clients, as Zabuza plotted to kill Gatō once he gets enough money, and
Hidari
 and
Ashimaru
 killing
Iori
 amid a mission for a bigger payoff. Inversely, clients may also betray the mercenaries to avoid paying any exorbitant prices as the legal system would not care about these renegades being betrayed, as Gatō betrayed Zabuza for that very reason.

Known Mercenaries

When
Zabuza Momochi
,
Haku
, and the
Demon Brothers
 defected from
Kirigakure
, they became mercenaries for hire, to acquire funding for a second attempt to assassinate the
Mizukage
. Their willingness to take missions from corrupt people led other followers like
Gengo
 to become disillusioned with Zabuza and left him.

Akatsuki
 is a mercenary group. Their mode of operation is to accept missions at a lower cost than the villages, which in turn will lead the villages to suffer a decline in financial support.

Deidara
 worked as an insurgent terrorist bomber after he defected from
Iwagakure
 and before his forced recruitment into Akatsuki, offering his services to various countries.

In the
third
Naruto
 movie
, the
Wandering Ninja Clan
 is a group of mercenaries of unknown origin hired by
Shabadaba
.

In the anime, the
Nokizaru Group
 is a mercenary ninja team.

In the anime,
Sadai
 is the leader of a group of mercenary missing-nin.

Kajūra
, a terrorist from
Ishigakure
, used to work for hire, until his arrest by the
Counter-Terrorism Division
.

Etoro Konjiki
 and
Metoro Konjiki
, twin brothers from
Ishigakure
, were in the same terrorist group as Kajūra and specialised in destroying buildings or merchant ships.

Hakubi Shin
 took on contract work from whomever would hire him after being expelled from
Konohagakure
 for stealing during his missions.

In the anime,
Hidari
 and
Ashimaru
 began to work as mercenaries when they lost their jobs as regular shinobi after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

Trivia

According to
Obito Uchiha
, back in the days before the hidden villages were created, if one side hired the
Senju clan
, the other would hire the
Uchiha clan
, and vice versa, as both were the strongest among all mercenary clans.

Despite some mercenary ninja being criminals, they have nevertheless been hired by even the likes of a
Kage
, as
Ōnoki
 of
Iwagakure
 has hired Akatsuki on many occasions in the past.

Although not ninja, other known mercenaries include:

Kusabi
 is one of the many mercenaries hired by
Gatō
 to take down the more expensive Zabuza, to save money.

Tatewaki
 was a former
samurai
 hired by the
Daimyō
 of
Land of This
 to guard and train
Shū
.

Sazanka
 was a renegade samurai hired by a group of bandits for protection against shinobi.

In
Naruto: Shippūden
 episode
233
, a group of mercenary ninja believed
Naruto Uzumaki
 to be a missing-nin and tried to capture him for a bounty they assumed was on his head.
