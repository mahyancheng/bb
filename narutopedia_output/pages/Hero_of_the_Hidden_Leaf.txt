"
Hero of the Hidden Leaf
" (
木ノ葉の英雄
,
Konoha no Eiyū
) is episode 175 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

In the afterlife,
Kakashi
 converses with his father,
Sakumo
, about how the latter chose to ignore the
shinobi rules
 and save the lives of his comrades, despite knowing he would be condemned for it. He reveals that he felt bitter after his father committed suicide as a result of it, but tells Sakumo that he forgives his father for his actions and is even proud for saving the lives of his friends. At that same moment,
Nagato
 uses his
Outer Path — Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 to resurrect those he had killed during his
attack
 on
Konoha
, and Kakashi's soul begins to return to the land of the living. As he begins to fade, his father tells him that he can finally move on in peace with his son's forgiveness and see his wife.

The citizens of Konoha are perplexed as they see their fallen comrades come back to life, while
Shikaku
 merely states that the event is proof that
Naruto
 had succeeded in his talk with Pain. Nagato's hair becomes white and recalls when
Jiraiya
 had saved the lives of the three
Ame Orphans
, taking care of them as he claimed it was the least he could do. Nagato tells Naruto that reviving the people he killed is the least he can do, and with his dying breath, places his faith in Naruto.
Konan
 uses her
Dance of the Shikigami
 ability to wrap the bodies of Nagato and the
Deva Path
, which she reveals is the corpse of their friend
Yahiko
. Konan tells Naruto that she is deserting the
Akatsuki
 and is returning to
Amegakure
 and that she, along with the village, are placing their hopes in Naruto as he now embodies both Nagato and Yahiko's dream. Producing a bouquet of roses, she hands it to him as she departs; Naruto places the bouquet, as well as Jiraiya's
novel
, at a make-shift memorial he makes for Jiraiya. As he begins to walk away, he nearly collapses, but is caught by Kakashi, who, along with the other villagers, had been debriefed on everything that had happened by
Katsuyu
, who had one of her bodies with Naruto the entire time. Kakashi thanks Naruto for his success and carries him back to the village, where Naruto is shocked to see all the citizens cheerfully welcoming him back.

Kakashi recalls how Naruto had
told him
 that his dream was to be
Hokage
 so the entire village would respect him and muses how Naruto has succeeded in doing so.
Sakura
 arrives and bops Naruto on the head, although she hugs him and thanks him.
Chōji
 and
Shikamaru
 marvel in surprise that Naruto had actually defeated the
Six Paths of Pain
 while
Ino
 murmurs that she may actually be attracted to Naruto now;
Kiba
 proudly declares to the villagers that Naruto was a classmate of his as
Shino
 states that Naruto has outclassed them all. Meanwhile,
Ebisu
 tells
Konohamaru
 and
Iruka
 that he had
once viewed
 Naruto as nothing more than a nuisance, an extension of the
Nine-Tailed Fox
, and thus had kept him at arm's length, and adds that the other
jōnin
 were against the
Third Hokage
's decision to accept Naruto as a
genin
. He recalls hearing how Naruto had
defeated

Zabuza
, only for another villager to state that it was probably Kakashi who had done so, and how everyone was shocked when he was able to
defeat

Neji
, a skilled member of the
Hyūga clan
, during the
Chūnin Exams
.

As Ebisu praises how Naruto has come far from then and how he had made the village finally accept him, Iruka thinks back upon how the villagers' opinions on Naruto began to change as word spread out that it was Naruto who
defeated

Gaara
, the
jinchūriki
 of
Sunagakure
, and how their perspective progressed when they heard that Naruto and Jiraiya were the ones who convinced
Tsunade
 to become their new Hokage and how Naruto was the one who had rescued the Fifth
Kazekage
 from the Akatsuki and had thus ensured an alliance between the two nations. Iruka remembers the Third Hokage notifying him that Naruto pulled pranks in order to force the villagers to acknowledge his existence and that the
Fourth Hokage
's dying wish was for Naruto to be seen as a hero someday; shedding tears, Iruka remarks to the Third and Fourth Hokage that there is a new hero among them as the villagers (including Sakura, Ino,
Rock Lee
,
Might Guy
 and Kiba) haul Naruto into the air.
