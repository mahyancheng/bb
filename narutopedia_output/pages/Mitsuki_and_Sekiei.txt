 anime.

Synopsis

The damage
Mitsuki
 inflicted causes Kū's body to begin to break down.
Kū
 departs to get medical attention, but
Sekiei
 prevents
Boruto
 from following him with
Explosive Clay
. Mitsuki wants Boruto and
Sarada
 to go after Kū while he deals with Sekiei, who is furious with him.
Kirara
 blocks Boruto and Sarada with
Akuta
. Mitsuki tries to dissuade Sekiei from fighting so his body doesn't break down any further. Sekiei attacks Mitsuki, all the while accusing him of pretending to be his friend. Boruto and Sarada destroy a few of Kirara's Akuta, whose body begins to break down as well. Kirara brings out a gigantic Akuta to kill Boruto and Sarada. Boruto summons
Garaga
 to help. In between discussing with Boruto, Garaga fights the giant Akuta. Sarada moves against Kirara, managing to distract her with a
Sharingan

genjutsu
, giving herself an opening to land a
Lightning Release
 attack on her. Kirara orders the giant Akuta to save her, but Garaga constricts it until it breaks down, one of its chunks crushing her instead.
 Sekiei continues to attack Mitsuki while throwing accusations at him, who denounces Kū's path, but thinks Sekiei can still be saved. Sekiei manages to get Mitsuki to fight back by threatening to kill Boruto. Mitsuki disables Sekiei's Explosive Clay with his Lightning Release.
Sekki
 finds
Ōnoki
 sneaking out, and explains he was sent by
Akatsuchi
. Kū reaches the doctor, but is informed the donors escaped, so he decides to get the doctor's heart. Mitsuki offers to take Sekiei to
Orochimaru
, but Sekiei is too damaged, and muses on how they are alike and how they are different, their feelings and motivations. Sekiei dies.
Kurotsuchi
 leads the Iwa shinobi on taking back sectors of Iwagakure. Mitsuki catches up with Boruto and Sarada at the Old City, and they find Kū recovered with a new heart.
