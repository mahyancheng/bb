Viz:
 Naruto Attacks!!) is chapter 165 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Wishing to finish the fight by herself,
Tsunade
 charges passed
Jiraiya
.
Kabuto
 slits his own wrist to cover her in his blood, immobilising her due to her fear of blood.
Naruto
 is confused, having considered Kabuto a friend the last time they saw each other. Kabuto informs him that he is an
Otogakure
 spy. He adds that he is disappointed with Naruto, as he makes unimpressive use of the
Nine-Tails
 and doesn't even compare to
Sasuke
. Angry, Naruto attacks him, intending to take advantage of Kabuto's injured arm, but he is easily repelled. Kabuto then heals himself. They all split up;
Shizune
 will fight Kabuto, while Jiraiya will fight
Orochimaru
, and Naruto will protect Tsunade since Orochimaru and Kabuto are out of his league. Orochimaru, with Kabuto's help, summons two
snakes
 and Jiraiya tries to summon a
toad
. Still under the effects of Tsunade's drug, he only manages to summon
Gamakichi
.
