Kunai
 (
クナイ
), like
shuriken
, are one of the most common
tools
 used by
shinobi
. It is a black dagger — about the length of one's hand — with a handle wrapped in bandages and a ring-like pommel. While usually kept in a shinobi's weapon pouch, they can also be kept on
spring-loaded wires
 up the user's sleeve.

Kunai generally are designed for thrusting and stabbing, but can be thrown as a projectile as well. Using it as ranged weapon, shinobi can attach an
explosive tag
 to the blade, causing it to detonate when it reaches near its target. This use of the weapon is known as an
explosive kunai
 (
起爆クナイ
,
kibaku kunai
). Kunai can also be
empowered

with

chakra
, allowing them to be capable of cutting through solid wood and stone.

Types of Kunai

Different types of kunai have been seen in the series:

Zabuza Momochi
 was shown using a special kunai that curved inward on one side, making it more suitable for stabbing and thrusting.
 This type is also shown used by
Kirigakure
 in the anime.

Before the first part of the
Chūnin Exams
,
Zaku Abumi
 used kunai with holes in the middle and no rings at the ends.

The kunai that
Kotetsu Hagane
 threw at
Sukima
 during the first part of the Chūnin Exams had a tassel connected to the ring (possibly to make it more noticeable).

During the second part of the Chūnin Exams,
Team Oboro
 used double-bladed kunai while facing
Team 7
.





Minato's marked kunai.



During the Chūnin Exam, Tenten used two kunai with curved blades, which were connected through a short chain in the bottom ring.

Kabuto Yakushi
, when threatening to kill a hospitalised
Sasuke Uchiha
 in Part I, held a kunai with a curved blade to Sasuke's neck. This seems to be the same type that
Rōshi
 used.
 Its design is reminiscent of a Chilean Corvo knife.

In his battle with
Neji
,
Kidōmaru
 formed kunai using his
Spider Sticky Gold
 technique.

Minato Namikaze
 used
three-bladed kunai
 that had a special seal applied to them in order to perform his
Flying Thunder God Technique
.

When the Third Division engaged the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
, three-pronged kunai were shown.

In the anime, a member of the
Kurama clan
 used a kunai with a shape similar to a combat knife.

Tenten
 used a smaller version of kunai when threatening
Menma
.

Shiin
 used kunai with long, thin, red ropes attached to them, similar to a
Jōhyō
.

In the light novel adaption of
Naruto: Mission: Protect The Waterfall Village! (novel)
,
Hisame
 was able to use a
kunai made of water
.

In the OVA
Mission: Protect the Waterfall Village!
,
Murasame
 and a group of nine unnamed Amegakure shinobi used a variety of kunai to attack Naruto's group.

The
Father
 puppet, created by
Sasori
, was equipped with a segmented wooden whip covered with kunai.

Deidara
 was shown wielding a kunai with a square hilt in his mouth. Asuma was also seen with a pair of these after being
reincarnated
.

During their battle with
Hidan
,
Izumo Kamizuki
 and Kotetsu used kunai the size of ordinary
blades
 to attack him.
 When next observed, the pair were connected by a length of chain, with a weight attached to its centre.

In the manga, the
Prajñā Group
 used very long kunai to assault
Danzō Shimura
.
 However, in the anime, these were replaced instead by the standard variant of kunai and later
katana
.

An unnamed
Iwa
 shinobi of the
First Division
 used a kunai with a
manriki-gusari
 attached to its hilt, in a similar manner to a
kusarigama
, during their initial engagement with the
Akatsuki
 forces in the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

An unnamed
Kiri
 shinobi of the
Fourth Division
 used a kunai with a noticeably
serrated
 edge along at least one of its sides during their first direct engagement with the
Second Mizukage
 and
Third Raikage
 in the Fourth Shinobi World War.

Obito Uchiha
 owns several kunai of immense size, storing them in the
other dimension
 to launch them with
Kamui
 in quick succession.

In the anime, a young Naruto finds a special
Takigakure
 kunai with an extending blade on one side before being pursued by The
Taki Kunoichi
. It had two thin blades, one larger and one smaller, causing it to resemble a
jutte
 or a
hachiwara
.

Among the many weapons created by
Iō
 there were two variations of a kunai: a double-bladed one without a handle, but with poison on the blade (and therefore dangerous to the user), and one with another ring at the end instead of a blade. Obviously, they were basically useless.

Shinobi from
Benisu Island
 use kunai with curved sides and flat surfaces.

In the anime,
Indra Ōtsutsuki
 used kunai carved out of stone.

Kusuna
 used a double-bladed kunai that could disconnect into two kunai during his first attempt to assassinate
Shion
. The kunai each had a grip around the handle.

During the assassination attempt on Shion's life,
Shizuku
 was seen using a kunai with two retractable blades at the hilt, which in turn was attached to a chain ending in a handle, thus allowing the kunai to be wielded similarly to a Jōhyō.

In the novel
Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze
,
Magire
 employed unique glass kunai that were filled with poison.

Tenten sold a special kunai in honour of
Parent and Child Day
. One end had a long blade attached to a ring (representing a parent) and the other had a shorter blade with a ring on one side and a small hook on the other (representing a child).

Kunai Launching Weapons

Kiba Inuzuka
 employed the use of a clone of
Akamaru
 to release kunai when approached. The doppelgänger swelled and then burst, launching the kunai at the opponent.

Dotō Kazahana
's army of
Yukigakure
 ninja used
mortars
 mounted on their train compartments to launch massive amounts of kunai at a very rapid rate.





Kunai gun from
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: Bonds
.



Tenten
's
metal sphere
 had kunai welded into it which, when detonated, sent shrapnel fragments flying in an omnidirectional manner.

Chiyo
 used a simple length of cord to thread numerous kunai together, in such a manner that the entirety could be released and thrown consecutively with just a single motion.
 A similar arrangement was employed by a shinobi of the
Third Division
, during their attack on the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
, in the Fourth Shinobi World War.

In the anime, kunai-launching cannons were used as part of a trap, firing automatically at intruders.

The ninja of the
Land of the Sky
 equipped themselves with
Handheld Kunai Launchers
 that could fire kunai rapidly, similar to machine guns.

The ninja of the Land of the Sky set up crossbows that launched kunai as traps in
Amaru
's village after attacking it.

When
Hiruko
 declared war against the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 and
Konohagakure
 was blamed for it,
Tsunade
 had prepared a large amount of mortars with giant kunai loaded into them, akin to missile launchers, in an attempt to defend her village from
Sunagakure
's attack.

Trivia

Historically, in reality, the kunai were just simple farming tools similar to trowels. When the Japanese emperor announced Martial Law and banned weapons, farming tools were among the easily disguised substitutes adopted, mostly because of how cheap they were to manufacture. Kunai were not as effective as projectiles compared to actual
throwing knives
 and shuriken, but owing to their original purpose as a gardening implement, they were still effective stabbing implements that could be used as a crowbar or a climbing piton, or attached to a shaft to make an improvised spear.
