Surprise Attack Division
 under
Kankurō
's command. After they had arrived into enemy territory and set up camp, they soon encounter an injured

Deidara

explosive clay
 had replaced the
kikaichū
 which should have been in Muta's jar. He alerted everyone to this fact, which allowed
Ittan
 to react in time to take protective-evasive action and
lower

Trivia

Hoheto might come from the first seven syllables of the
Iroha

, Hoheto was erroneously depicted with black eyes. This was fixed in subsequent depictions.
