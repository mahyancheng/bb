"
Roar and Howl! The Ultimate Tag-Team!
" (
唸れ!吼えろ!究極のタッグ
,
Unare! Hoero! Kyūkyoku no Taggu
) is episode 120 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Tayuya
 guides her three
Doki
 after
Shikamaru
, she activates the first level of her
cursed seal
 to control them easier.
Naruto
 begins his battle, creating a great deal of
shadow clones
 to attack
Kimimaro
, who, however, is able to defeat the clones. As the fight between
Kiba
 and
Akamaru
 vs.
Sakon and Ukon
 rages on, Ukon pushes his
cursed seal
 into its second level. Recognising the huge increase in strength that this allows the brothers, Kiba and Akamaru combine to become a
giant double-headed wolf
. The combined beast charges towards Sakon and Ukon, and bisects them. However, the brothers' internal organs creates new legs and arms. Kiba and Akamaru charge at them again, though the brothers are able to use
Summoning: Rashōmon
 to block the attack. As the wolf transformation disperses, Akamaru is attacked and left heavily injured, although Akamaru manages to squirt acidic urine into Sakon's eyes. Sakon goes to wash his eyes in the river while Ukon merges himself with Kiba's body. Needing to get rid of Ukon to save Akamaru, Kiba stabs himself in the stomach, causing him and Ukon to start coughing up blood.
