Reincarnation…!!
 (
転生…!!

Tensei…!!
,
Viz:
 Comrades) is volume 22 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 191

"
Comrades…!!
" (
仲間…!!
,
Nakama…!!
)

Jirōbō
 dies and
Chōji
 starts walking in the direction that the rest of the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 went in. Seeing that they have marked their path for him, he collapses, glad to know he has friends that believe in him. Meanwhile, the rest of the team notices that the
Sound Four
 has not set traps for them, meaning they expected Jirōbō to win. Taking advantage of this,
Shikamaru
 transforms into Jirōbō and joins up with the three other Otogakure ninja. However, because he doesn't reprimand
Tayuya
 for her insults like Jirōbō would, his identity is exposed and most of the team is caught in
Kidōmaru
's webbing.
Neji
 takes advantage of this preoccupation and attacks him from behind.

Chapter 192

"
The Plan…!!
" (
段取り…!!
,
Dandori…!!
)

Kidōmaru
 avoids
Neji
's attack and catches him in a cocoon of webbing. With the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 unable to move, Kidōmaru decides to enjoy himself before regrouping with the
Sound Four
.
Naruto
 and his
shadow clones
 are caught in his web, so Kidōmaru plays target practice to figure out which is the real one. They all turn out to be shadow clones, and Naruto attacks Kidōmaru from behind. It ceases to work and Naruto is about to be captured, but Neji appears and releases him. Able to break Kidōmaru's
chakra
-infused webbing with his
abilities
, Neji concludes that he is the only one who can fight him.

Chapter 193

"
Game Over
" (
ゲームオーバー
,
Gēmu Ōbā
)

Because they need to catch
Sasuke
 at any cost,
Neji
 volunteers to fight
Kidōmaru
 by himself. The remaining members of the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 resume their pursuit of the
Sound Four
. Kidōmaru attempts to stop them but Neji neutralises his webbing. Concluding that Neji is the strongest member of the team, Kidōmaru tries various attacks to figure out Neji's strengths and weaknesses. Believing Neji can only break his webs by touching them with his hands, Kidōmaru binds his arms. Since this is not true, Neji takes advantage of Kidōmaru's lowered guard to attack with
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
.

Chapter 194

"
Sounding Out
" (
さぐりあい
,
Saguriai
)

Neji
 successfully strikes
Kidōmaru
 with his
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
. Kidōmaru covers himself with a special golden version of his webbing at the last second, allowing him to avoid damage and prevent Neji from sealing his
tenketsu
. Knowing he cannot win a close-combat fight, Kidōmaru starts attacking from afar. Neji is able to block his attacks with
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
. Surprised by the defence and Neji's ability to react to attacks from behind, Kidōmaru tries to find a weakness in his abilities. After activating his
cursed seal
 he douses Neji in webbing.

Chapter 195

"
The Way to Capture…!!
" (
攻略法…!!
,
Kōryakuhō…!!
)

Kidōmaru
's webbing sticks
Neji
 to the ground, leaving him unable to perform the
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
. Neji opts to block the incoming attacks by hand, but is unable to block all of them. Kidōmaru realises that this means Neji's
Byakugan
 has a blindspot, so he concentrates his efforts on pinpointing it. After determining that Neji cannot see things beyond fifty metres and cannot see anything directed at a particular point behind his neck, Kidōmaru believes he has "won the game". He activates level two of his
cursed seal
 and creates a bow and arrow to put an end to his "worthy opponent".

Chapter 196

"
The Number One Strongest Enemy!!
" (
一番強い敵!!
,
Ichiban Tsuyoi Teki!!
)

Kidōmaru
 fires an arrow at
Neji
's blindspot. Neji, having suspected his blindspot had been discovered, is able to dodge enough to keep the attack from killing him. Kidōmaru realises that Neji must have surrounded the area with
chakra
 to compensate for his blindspot and pick up on anything that approaches from that direction. Disappointed that the strongest "character" of the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 has been figured out so easily, Kidōmaru modifies his arrow to make it faster and adds a string to guide it mid-flight. Once a fleeing, injured, exhausted Neji presents his blindspot, Kidōmaru fires again and successfully hits him.

Chapter 197

"
Prepared to Die!!
" (
決死の覚悟!!
,
Kesshi no Kakugo!!
)

Neji
 is badly wounded by
Kidōmaru
's arrow. However, he continues fighting; he injects some of his
chakra
 into the guiding string attached to the arrow, which travels back to and paralyses Kidōmaru. Kidōmaru falls from the tree he was hiding in, assuming that this was Neji's dying effort. Following
Naruto
's example of not allowing seemingly insurmountable odds stop him from winning, Neji meets Kidōmaru as he reaches the ground and delivers a killing blow. As Kidōmaru's life fades Neji explains that he allowed himself to be hit, knowing Kidōmaru would attack from his blindspot and therefore making it easy to avoid a fatal wound. Kidōmaru asks if it was worth it, which Neji affirms: this victory and his helping the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 has made his injuries and likely death worth it.

Chapter 198

"
Reincarnation…!!
" (
転生…!!
,
Tensei…!!
)

With his dying breath,
Kidōmaru
 tells
Neji
 that the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 is wasting their time, as
Sasuke
 is fully committed to joining
Orochimaru
. Neji is confident that
Naruto
 can change Sasuke's mind, and passes out after entrusting Sasuke's retrieval to the rest of the team. The retrieval team near the remaining
Sound Four
 while the Sound Four realises their teammates are running late. Elsewhere, Orochimaru agonises over the Sound Four's tardiness, desperate to take Sasuke's body to escape the
Third Hokage
's seal. When he cannot wait any longer, he instructs
Kabuto
 to prepare an alternative. Kabuto has several prisoners fight to the death with the promise that the victor will be released.

Chapter 199

"
Desire…!!
" (
願望…!!
,
Ganbō…!!
)

As he watches the prisoners fight each other,
Kabuto
 tells the dying
Kimimaro
 about
Sasuke
. Of comparable abilities to Kimimaro, Sasuke is to be
Orochimaru
's new host body. Whereas Kimimaro is too sick to fill this role, Sasuke is now too late. Orochimaru approaches the victor,
Gen'yūmaru
, who realises what is about to happen to him. He asks that Orochimaru at least release his family, which Orochimaru agrees to before taking control of his body. Kimimaro, regretting that he could not help Orochimaru, leaves, deciding to be useful one last time by retrieving Sasuke. Elsewhere, the remaining members of the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 catch up to
Sakon
 and
Tayuya
. The Oto ninja spot them and Sakon goes in to attack.
