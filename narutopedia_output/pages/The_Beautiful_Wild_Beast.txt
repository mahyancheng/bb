Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Sakura
 tends to the still unconscious
Sasuke
 and
Naruto
. When she hears something approaching she turns around suspecting an enemy, but it is only a squirrel. She nevertheless makes it a point to scare the squirrel away, so that it can avoid the traps set for the enemy. Soon afterwards,
Rock Lee
 finds the squirrel and save it from an
explosive tag
 that has been applied to its back. At the same time, Sakura is confronted by
three Sound ninja
 that express an interest in fighting Sasuke. Sakura asks why
Orochimaru
 gave Sasuke a
cursed seal
, but they do not answer, in fact being surprised to learn of their master's earlier actions. They attack her, avoiding the traps that Sakura indirectly revealed by scaring away their squirrel-bomb, but she is saved by Lee.
