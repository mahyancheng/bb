History






Twelve Guardian Ninja Symbol.



The group was composed of twelve skilled ninja drawn from around the Land of Fire. Their only task was to protect the country's daimyō, even at the cost of their own lives.
 In
Itachi Shinden: Book of Bright Light
, two Guardian Ninja accompanied the daimyō on his annual trip to
Konohagakure
, but were
paralysed
 by the
masked man
; the man was driven off by Konoha's
Itachi Uchiha
 and
Kakashi Hatake
. The Guardian Ninja were eventually disbanded.

In the anime, around two years after the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
, six of the Guardian Ninja – led by
Kazuma
 – let their single goal of protecting the Land of Fire consume them into become radicals, believing that the status quo of the world was too delicate and the military resources of their country was wasted on
Konohagakure
 with their more passive approach. Believing they had to "unite" the country under one leadership, the Fire Daimyō, they became determined to overthrow the
Hokage
 and destroy the ninja village. At the same time, to ensure their country's continued safety and prosperity, they began making plans to invade and conquer the rest of the world under their country's authority. When the daimyō found out about this, he rejected the proposal and ordered the six loyal Guardian Ninja (
Asuma Sarutobi
,
Chiriku
,
Kitane
,
Nauma
,
Tōu
, and
Seito
) to stop the six conspirators. Of the twelve, only Asuma and Chiriku were known to survive the battle;
 Kazuma also survived and went into hiding so that he could continue his plans.

Even though the Guardian Ninja disbanded, its former members were still famed in criminal circles, earning them bounties on the black market: Chiriku had a bounty of 30 million
ryō
 and Asuma had a bounty of 35 million
ryō
.
 It was because of these bounties that Chiriku and Asuma were killed by
Hidan
 and
Kakuzu
 of
Akatsuki
, though only Chiriku's bounty was actually collected upon.

Trivia

In the anime, the Twelve Guardian Ninja were reformed at some point, as
Shikamaru Nara
 was invited to join. He declined, saying that he would rather stay in Konoha and protect his friends.
