Ashina
 (
アシナ
) is a former actress of the Konoha Film Studio.

Personality

Ashina is very self-centred, regularly ordering those around her to carry out tasks for her. She was so used to death threats that when one of her fan letters containing such threat, she easily shrugged it off and asked for the next letter to be read. As an actress, she places more importance in an actor's acting ability over their appearance, resenting
Tomaru
 when he starts monopolising production because of his good looks. She focuses on her popularity very much to the point of staging a kidnapping attempt to revitalise her dwindling public image. In her desperation for fame, she was prepared to give up her life via a suicide bombing to have herself memorialised in the media.

Appearance

Ashina has long dirty blonde hair and reddish brown eyes. She wears a red sleeveless dress for her soap opera, black shorts, fingerless black gloves, red boots, and a fictitious shinobi headband.
