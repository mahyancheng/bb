"
Attack! Fury of the Rasengan!
" (
くらえ!怒りの螺旋丸
,
Kurae! Ikari no Rasengan
) is episode 94 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Uninterested in their assistance,
Tsunade
 tries to resume her battle with
Kabuto
, though he slits his palm, paralysing her due to her fear of blood. As she is taken aside to recover,
Jiraiya
 battles
Orochimaru
 while
Naruto
 and
Shizune
 battle Kabuto. Using his own blood and a summoning seal on Orochimaru's arms, Kabuto manages to
summon twin snakes
, while Naruto and Jiraiya both attempt to summon
Gamabunta
; however, they both lack the chakra required and end up summoning
Gamakichi
 and
Gamatatsu
 instead. Due to the drug Tsunade gave him, Jiraiya is unable to properly control his chakra and his techniques are underpowered. With Orochimaru unable to use his arms, however, his abilities are limited as well. Kabuto, on the other hand, is more than capable of dealing with Naruto and Shizune, and after making quick work of them returns his attention to Tsunade. Before he can harm her, Naruto appears and blocks his attack, determined to protect Tsunade. Trapping Kabuto with one hand and using a
shadow clone
 for assistance, Naruto creates and delivers a perfect
Rasengan
 to Kabuto's stomach.
