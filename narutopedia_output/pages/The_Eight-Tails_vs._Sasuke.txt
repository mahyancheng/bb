Hachibi Bāsasu Sasuke!!
) is chapter 411 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Sasuke
 attacks
Killer B
 with his sword, aware that he cannot kill B. That same stipulation does not apply for B, who uses
Suigetsu
's
Kubikiribōchō
 to spar with him. B is impressed by Sasuke's skill with a blade, so B does him the courtesy of using his seven personal blades instead of Suigetsu's. Sasuke has difficulty keeping up with B's many strikes even with his
Sharingan
, but believes he has the advantage of channelling
lightning
 into his sword. B also has that advantage, which he uses to stab Sasuke with multiple swords.
