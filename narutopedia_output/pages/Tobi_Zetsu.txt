This article is about the mutated human. For the masked man called Tobi, see
Tobi
.

Tobi
 (
トビ
,
Tobi
), nicknamed
Guruguru
 (
グルグル
,
Guruguru
,
English TV:
 Swirly) by
Obito Uchiha
 for the swirl pattern of his face, was one of the first victims of the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
, and eventually was pulled from the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 by
Black Zetsu
.

Background






Tobi and White Zetsu overseeing Obito's rehabilitation.



He was originally a human victim of
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
's Infinite Tsukuyomi, who was
tethered
 to the
God Tree
 over the course of years until transforming. He was ultimately stored within the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, where he remained until the statue was
summoned
 by
Madara Uchiha
, who used it to cultivate
Hashirama Senju
's DNA to produce a
large flowering tree
. Black Zetsu then removed him and
White Zetsu
 from inside the statue and modified with Hashirama's DNA, leading Madara to believe they were imperfect clones of Hashirama.






Tobi helps Obito during his rehabilitation.



Serving as one of Madara's minions, he met and befriended Obito Uchiha shortly after the latter was brought beneath
Mountains' Graveyard
 and saved by Madara, being designated the task of making sure the young Uchiha was of use to Madara when he woke up. He, along with White Zetsu, enjoyed annoying and teasing Obito about things such as what he murmured in his sleep and human bodily functions. Over time, the duo became friends with the young Uchiha.
 During this time, Obito coined the nickname
Guruguru
 based on his appearance,
 a nickname that would eventually stick.

Months into Obito's rehabilitation, White Zetsu returned to the underground base and urgently alerted Obito that he saw
Kakashi Hatake
 and
Rin Nohara
 being cornered by
Kirigakure
 shinobi while he was outside. Resolving to save his friends and return home, Obito tried to break the huge stone blocking the exit in an effort to escape, but destroyed his artificial arm, only cracking the wall in the process. Seeing how desperate Obito was, Tobi noted that his limbs were not strong enough to break through stone yet, and offered himself as a suit of sorts for Obito to wear in order to make it to the surface. Although Obito was sceptical about whether they had permission to help, White Zetsu noted that it would be fine.

Attaching himself to Hashirama's living clone in order to access the power of the Demonic Statue, Tobi was able to break the rock barring the passage way. Opening himself up to form a hood of sorts and encasing Obito, the pair mobilised with Tobi giving directions to the young Uchiha. While en route, he offered to fight in Obito's stead, seeing the young man as weaker than himself. When this offer was refused, Tobi informed Obito of the added benefit of the access he now had due to Hashirama's DNA because of his artificial body, stating that due to obtaining Senju's powers through the infusion of his cells, by combining those powers with his own, Obito could awaken an unusual power. Pointing Obito toward a location where giant bodies of water were being displaced, Tobi and Obito arrived to find Kakashi's hand
run through
 Rin's chest, killing her instantly as a horrified Obito looked on.

After witnessing Rin's death, Tobi watched as
Obito Uchiha
, now consumed by a strong, overwhelming surge of grief and anger, viciously and brutally slaughtered the Kirigakure shinobi at the scene using a combination of
Kamui
 and
Wood Release
 — the latter of which he marvelled that the young man could already use, stating that he now understood why Madara had chosen the young Uchiha as his apprentice.
 After returning to the Mountains' Graveyard and watching Madara pass away, Tobi would remain attached to Obito for some time, accompanying him and Zetsu to
Amegakure
, where they confronted the
Ame Orphans
.

Personality

When first meeting Obito, Tobi was playful and enjoyed teasing him about things such as what he murmured in his sleep. Although Obito was initially greatly annoyed by him, the two befriended each other during the former's rehabilitation. Tobi believes that the
Eye of the Moon Plan
 is good for mankind, and sees Madara as a benevolent man. He is also kind-hearted, as shown when he and White Zetsu decided to help Obito without Madara's permission. Because he does not carry out normal bodily functions, he is very curious to know about the mechanics behind them, particularly those involving faeces.

By the time of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Tobi had become noticeably more serious, more akin to how Obito became, although he retained his fascination with human bowel movements. He also seemed to be sadistic, revelling in taking lives as a form of relief.

Appearance

Tobi was fully white and could be easily distinguished by the spiral-pattern that stretches all over his body, ending in a circular eyehole. This pattern did not cover his forearms and legs but could open up in a similar manner to the flytrap extensions of the original Zetsu to reveal that he is hollow inside. Tobi showed no visible orifices at all but had a fully defined body. Both while encasing Obito and while fighting in the Fourth Shinobi World War, Tobi wore an indigo cloak.

Abilities

Tobi was a hidden ally
Madara Uchiha
 kept in the shadows after
Obito Uchiha
 used him against the
Kirigakure
 shinobi. Upon his reappearance in the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, due to encasing Yamato inside him, his abilities had advanced to the point where he could battle thousands of members of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, including four
Kage
, simultaneously.

Body Structure

Tobi was presumed to have the standard abilities White Zetsu possess, such as their signature
Mayfly
. Tobi and White Zetsu claimed to have vocabularies and brains that surpass those of humans.
 Like White Zetsu, Tobi could survive without food or water and did not need to carry out normal bodily functions.

Tobi had displayed the ability to open up his top half entirely and use himself as a suit of sorts to encase someone in.
 By attaching himself to Hashirama's artificial body and using the power of the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, Tobi was able to greatly augment his strength to the point that he was able to destroy a boulder with a single punch.
 Due to his extraordinary body structure, Tobi was highly durable and resilient, as he took minimal damage from
Suigetsu Hōzuki
's point-blank
Water Gun: Two Guns
 technique and recovered from the effects of a
cursed seal
 in seconds.
 Likewise, during the few seconds it was paralysed, Tobi was still able to mould its chakra and control its activated techniques.

Ninjutsu

Nature Transformation






Tobi using all five elements simultaneously.



Tobi's genetic material was nearly identical to Hashirama's, and he had access to
Wood Release
, albeit on a much weaker scale than Hashirama himself.
 Tobi had knowledge of several Wood Release techniques, and was able to identify Obito's use of the
Wood Release: Cutting Technique
.
 During the Fourth Great Shinobi War, Tobi was able to use
Yamato
's prowess to dramatically enhance his own; taking on several of the Kage and a large amount of
Allied Shinobi Forces
 singlehandedly. He was able to create a
giant wooden statue
, through which he could
simultaneously perform techniques of all five elemental nature transformations
,
 as well as utilise the wooden statue's
thousand arms
 with devastating effects.

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki






Tobi overwhelming the Allied Shinobi Forces with his statue.



At some point after Madara's
revival
, Tobi appeared on the battlefield to buy the
Ten-Tails
 time to revive so Madara could become its
jinchūriki
 and started fighting the Allied Forces with a
gigantic wooden statue
. Informing his opponents that he would never let them go so easily, he asked whether or not anyone would take his question seriously, which was how it felt to have a bowel movement, but shrugged it off, assuming that it resembled the satisfaction of taking another life. Observing the situation on the battlefield, Tobi was greeted by a
White Zetsu clone
, who told him that Naruto was of the
Uzumaki clan
, and thus could temporarily resist death from having the
Nine-Tails
 extracted from him, but the two simultaneously affirmed that Naruto was doomed to die.






Tobi impales Karin.



After impaling
Karin
 with the
Wood Release: Cutting Technique
 in an attempt to stop her from saving
Sasuke Uchiha
's life, the left side of his head was
shattered
 and it was revealed that
someone
 was inhabiting his body. Though his movements were temporarily stopped by
Orochimaru
's
cursed seal
, Tobi mused that their efforts were in vain nonetheless. When Madara initiated the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
, Tobi abruptly stopped fighting the Allied Forces and noted that his job was done before unceremoniously ejecting Yamato from his body, noting that he no longer had a need for him either.

Trivia

Tobi's face resembles the orange mask Obito wore before his fight with Konan, and his personality also resembles Obito's when he was acting as
Deidara
's partner. In fact, his real name as revealed in the

Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
, he even shares the same voice as Obito's "Tobi" persona.

His nickname comes from Obito calling him
Guruguru
 (
グルグル
,
Guruguru
),
 which is an
onomatopoeia
 for
turning round and round
 or
going around in circles
. It can also mean
wrapped around
, referring to Tobi's function as an armour for Obito. This name was later confirmed in a special page added to Issue #14 of
Weekly Shōnen Jump
.

Tobi is unique in appearance and personality resulting from mutation after being trapped inside Kaguya's Infinite Tsukuyomi; all others share the

We are fully artificial humans. We have feelings and everything!
