The Manji Formation.



The
Manji Formation
 (
卍の陣
,
Manji no Jin
) is a very basic formation that is used to protect a central point, to defend against multiple attacks coming from multiple locations, or to defend a group against an attack that could come from any unknown angle.
 Its name derives from the shape of a
manji
 as the formation requires a person facing outwards at all four points, where the four
ninja
's backs face each other. Each person is responsible to guard against the area straight ahead of them and to the left, as the manji suggests. This formation has one blind spot, which is the centre of the formation.
