The
Hirasaka Clan
 (
比良坂一族
,
Hirasaka Ichizoku
) is one of the three clans that hail from
Yumegakure
.

Appearance

A defining trait of the Hirasaka clan is that all its members wear large hoods over their heads and some have it covering their mouths too. They are the only clan in Yumegakure to not have any facial markings or, at least, none have been seen.

Abilities

Some techniques in this clan include sealing the opponent's chakra or confusing them to the point where they attack their own allies. Some members carry scrolls that can dispel confusion and/or chakra sealing. Some
chūnin
-level shinobi have been shown to use the
Shadow Clone Technique
 and bombs that release electricity when they explode. Many shinobi are also fairly skilled in
taijutsu
.

Trivia

The name Hirasaka might be a reference to Yomotsu Hirasaka (
黄泉平坂 or 黄泉比良坂
) from Shinto mythology, which is
the slope
 that descends into
Yomi
, the underworld.

Even though
Yomito Hirasaka
 is the only named character from this clan, there are times in this video game where the player has to face groups of unnamed Hirasaka ninja. There is also a level boss that is named Hirasaka chūnin, referring to his clan and rank.
