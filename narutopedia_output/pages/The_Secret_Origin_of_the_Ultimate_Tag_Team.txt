Hiwa: Saikyō Taggu!!
) is episode 282 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

The two
jinchūriki
's progress to the battlefield is barred by
A
 and
Tsunade
. Despite
Naruto
's attempts to press on, the
Raikage
 proves able to keep up with Naruto even while in the
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
. Tsunade, who noted that it was actually the opposite — a miracle  that Naruto could keep up with the person who held the title as the fastest
shinobi
 alive since the death of
Konoha's Yellow Flash
 — also stated that though she was the
Hokage
, she could not act independent of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. Tsunade is shocked when A declares that he would kill both Naruto and
B
, if it came down to it, but resolved to kill Naruto at that moment because B, being a perfect jinchūriki, held greater military worth than Naruto. As A moved in to attack Naruto once again, his punch is deflected by B who had transformed his arm into that of the
Eight-Tails
. First-bumping his brother afterwards, the two remember the story that led up to B becoming A's brother, the many missions they went on, the advice given to A by
his cousin
, his subsequent death and B becoming the new jinchūriki of the Eight-Tails, and their encounter with the then thought to be
Saviour of this World
: Minato Namikaze, and the words he imparted to them.
