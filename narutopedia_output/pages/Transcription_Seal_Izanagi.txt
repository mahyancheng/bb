This is a
Mangekyō Sharingan
 technique that seals the technique
Izanagi
 within the
Sharingan
 of the target. After being sealed within the person, it is involuntarily activated when certain requirements, which are predetermined by the user, are met. Madara Uchiha used this on his own right eye, to trigger after he dies in order to rewrite his death into a mere dream.
