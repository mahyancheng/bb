Amuda
 (
アムダ
) was once a member of the
Lightning Group
.

Background

Amuda was once a member of the
Lightning Group
, whose members were all
kekkei genkai
 users that had been persecuted because of their abilities. They would travel around stealing from criminals and giving their plunder to the downtrodden, intending to do for others what was never down for them. Their group eventually earned the attention of
Kirigakure
, who tricked them into attacking some government officials of a foreign country. Kiri defended the officials from the Lightning Group and killed most of its members; Amuda,
Nowaki
, and
Karyū
 were among the few to escape. Such injustice caused Amuda to lose his will to live.

Chino
 enlists the help of Nowaki and Amuda to help her take revenge against the
hidden villages
 for how they've treated people with kekkei genkai. Amuda sees this as an opportunity to give his life getting some payback against the villages and volunteers to be converted into a human bomb by Chino. Amuda is embedded into a group of
Konoha
,
Kumo
, and Kiri-nin under the control of Chino's
genjutsu
 and sent to attack Konoha; only Amuda is allowed to be in control of his own actions. He is captured and knocked unconscious before he has a chance to detonate. Konoha eventually discovers that he was not being controlled and has his
mind read
, allowing them to gather information that eventually leads to the capture of Chino and Nowaki.

Amuda, Chino, and Nowaki are given an offer by the
Sixth Hokage
 on behalf of the
Fifth Mizukage
: use their abilities to help Kirigakure to rid the world of the same evil and persecution they have been subjected to their whole lives, a repentance for those who died in their attacks. The three of them agree.
