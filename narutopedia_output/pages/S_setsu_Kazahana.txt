Sōsetsu Kazahana
 (
風花早雪
,
Kazahana Sōsetsu
) served as the former
daimyō
 of the
Land of Snow
 and was the father of
Koyuki Kazahana
.

Background

Sōsetsu used to share with his daughter the tales of the beauty of spring, a season she had yet to witness in the Land of Snow, where perpetual winter prevailed. Determined to bring spring to their homeland, he devised a climate-warming generator, now known as the Kazahana treasure. Activated by a hexagonal crystal, regarded as the key, this invention aimed to transform the icy landscape into a blossoming paradise.

Residing in the splendid
Kazahana Castle
, Sōsetsu's dreams were shattered when his brother,
Dotō Kazahana
, set the castle ablaze, claiming the lives of all inside. Dotō seized control of the Land of Snow in his pursuit of the treasure, of which he was unaware of its nature. Koyuki, Sōsetsu's daughter, emerged as the sole survivor, escaping with the crucial hexagonal crystal.

Personality

By all indications, Sōsetsu was a benevolent ruler, a kind man, and a loving father. Even years after his passing, many of his subjects remained loyal to his memory. Despite the financial strain it imposed on the country, Sōsetsu pursued the ambitious goal of bringing spring to his homeland. The construction of the generator required for this endeavour nearly bankrupted the nation.

Appearance

Sōsetsu had long, receding black hair and large, black eyes. He adorned a pair of circular-framed glasses and typically wore a daimyō uniform.

Legacy

Sōsetsu's untimely demise left a lasting mark on Koyuki, shaping her into a cold and seemingly emotionless individual for the next ten years. She maintained a facade of indifference, dismissing her father's dreams of spring as mere falsehoods. However, Koyuki's emotional armour began to crack when the generator, fulfilling Sōsetsu's vision, finally brought the spring season to the Land of Snow. This transformation delighted Koyuki, but infuriated Dotō, who was angered to discover that the coveted treasure was nothing more than a generator.

Sōsetsu's death also fuelled
Sandayū Asama
's deep-seated resentment towards Dotō. Attempting to avenge Sōsetsu, Sandayū sought revenge against Dotō, but his efforts ultimately ended in failure.
