By controlling the vast chakra flowing from the
Ryūmyaku
 (
龍脈
,
literally meaning:
 Dragon Veins), the user is able to convert the
chakra
 and use it in various ways including to power up an entire
city
 and control a large number of
puppets
. If not stopped, the user would have an unlimited source of energy to feed off of.

While anyone can control an open flow of the Ryūmyaku for their own purposes, only those of the royal bloodline can open or close the flow.

Trivia

Mukade was able to use the chakra to accelerate his healing and transform his body in a similar way of a
jinchūriki
 and their
tailed beast
.
