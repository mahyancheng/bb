"
The Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki
" (
十尾の人柱力
,
Jūbi no Jinchūriki
) is episode 378 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

As the
Shinobi Alliance
 wonders about the
Ten-Tails
 disappearing from the battlefield,
Sakura
 asks
Hinata
 to explain what happened, and it is explained that the beast's body and
chakra
 were completely absorbed by the
enemy
.
Naruto
 explains to
Sasuke
 and
Minato
 that Obito never tried to
revive

Madara
 from the beginning, but was actually
making himself
 the Ten-Tails'
jinchūriki
.
Hashirama
 and
Tobirama
 soon realise how big of a threat just appeared, and the First
Hokage

pins
 Obito, only for the new jinchūriki to destroy both the restraints and the
barrier
 with
chakra arms
.
 As Minato tries to call out to his former student, who barely recognises his own name, the other
reincarnated
 Hokage start attacking the enemy, using their immortality to study the enemy's power. His predecessors being easily knocked out, with Hashirama forced to take on Madara, Minato goes on the front trying to exploit Obito's inability to suppress the Ten-Tails. In his mind, Obito gets his consciousness ripped by the Ten-Tails but ultimately manages to take control of the monster, gaining a new form and making an attempt to kill the enemies in one single blow.

Trivia

There were a few moments where the flow of Minato's hair in
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 changed styles.

When his memory of
Rin
 was about to be torn away, Obito's hair was black again.
