Two Great Sage Toads
 (
二大仙蝦蟇
,
Nidaisengama
) is the collective name given to
Fukasaku
 and
Shima
 - two toads from
Mount Myōboku
, who rank immediately under the
Great Toad Sage
.
They are husband and wife and often call each other "Ma" and "Pa".

If one needs to enter
Sage Mode
, they can be summoned and
fused
 onto the summoners shoulders, to channel the
natural energy
 while the summoner is in combat. Both great sage toads are extremely proficient in the use of elemental techniques that require the nature manipulation of wind, fire, and water. In addition, they are equally adept in the use of natural energy to augment their abilities. They are also able to use high level sound-based genjutsu techniques that involve the use of sound waves to confuse, paralyse, or immobilise the enemy.
They were first called into battle alongside
Jiraiya
 when he fought the
Six Paths of Pain
 and later fought alongside
Naruto
 during
Pain's assault
 on
Konohagakure
.
