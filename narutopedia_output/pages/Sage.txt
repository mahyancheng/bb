Naruto as a Sage.



A
Sage
 (
仙人
,
Sennin
) is someone who is able to utilise
senjutsu
 and has mastered the art of
Sage Mode
. It is also a title given to someone because of their renowned power, wisdom, or holy standing.

Senjutsu

Main articles:
Senjutsu
 and
Sage Mode

Senjutsu
 (
仙術
,
English TV:
 Sage Jutsu,
literally meaning:
 Sage Techniques) are a specialised field of
jutsu
 that involve the use of
natural energy
. Senjutsu practitioners, known as
sages
, learn to draw natural energy inside their bodies, blending it with their own
chakra
 to create
senjutsu chakra
 (
仙術チャクラ
,
senjutsu chakura
,
English TV:
 Sage Jutsu Chakra). This chakra adds a new dimension of power to the user's techniques, while also allowing for the use of techniques that would not otherwise be possible.

Senjutsu is taught by the
toads
 of
Mount Myōboku
 and the
snakes
 of
Ryūchi Cave
. Whereas use of senjutsu is somewhat common amongst the animals that reside in these locations, very few humans have learned to perform senjutsu due to steep prerequisites and the inherent dangers of it.

Other Meanings

Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
, more commonly known as the
Sage of Six Paths
, was one of the first to be born with
chakra
, he saved the world from the
Ten-Tails
 and created
ninshū
, a predecessor of the modern
ninjutsu
. He was capable of using the
Six Paths Senjutsu
 which he, post-mortem, transfers as the
Six Paths Sage Mode
 to his
son
's
reincarnation
.

Son Gokū
 has the moniker of
Great Sage Equalling Heaven
 (
斉天大聖
,
Seiten Taisei
) and is also called the
King of the Sage Monkeys
 (
仙猿の王
,
Sen'en no Ō
), although neither of the terms are written with the same kanji as the title "Sage".

Trivia

The term 仙人 (
Sennin
), refers to the Japanese term of Chinese sages and practitioners of Taoist ways, who have gained immortality and incredible powers through the manipulation of qi, or natural energy through their body by becoming ascetics and living on mountains, where qi is said to gather at the most and to start flowing from into the world. The training and measures needed to become a Sage in
Naruto
 is just as vigorous and demanding, and similar in some regards, requiring one to have massive reserves of chakra, and come to adopt natural energy, not for the pursuit of immortality, but to become harmonised with the flow of the world around them.

In the fourth databook, Hagoromo is called "Rikudō no Shinsen" (
六道の神仙
) on one occasion. Although both "sennin" and "shinsen" can be translated as "sage", the latter is an archaic way to refer to supernatural beings and even gods.

The Mount Myōboku, the Ryūchi Cave and the
Shikkotsu Forest
 are called the "Three Big Unexplored 'Sage' Regions" (
「仙人」三大秘境
,
"Sennin" Sandai Hikyō
).

When Kabuto Yakushi used Sage Mode, he described himself as a "perfect sage" (
完ペキな仙人
,
kanpeki-na sennin
), as opposed to Orochimaru, who lacked the body to attain Sage Mode. This suggests that a sage is simply someone who can use senjutsu.
