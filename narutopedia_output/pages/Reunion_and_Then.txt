Summary

Accessing the power of the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 while connected to
Hashirama's living clone
, impressing the original
White Zetsu
, a
Tobi
-encased
Obito
 is able to break the boulder used to cover one of the passage ways. An awakened
Madara
 asks whether or not the young
Uchiha
 was leaving and despite Obito thanking Madara for saving his life, Madara disregards it stating that he would be back to thank him more sincerely. With White Zetsu ready to remotely give his clone directions, Obito dons a cloak before leaving. As he rushes towards his friends' location, he receives updates about the situation, and learns that
Minato
 is not with them. The clone then tells Obito that as he was weaker than him, it would be best to let him fight in his stead, but Obito refutes this stating that
Kakashi
 had his other
Sharingan
, and his combination with him would be better. As the clone tells him about the additional benefits of having the
Senju
 and Uchiha DNA, Obito believes that it is raining before he sees giant geysers of water rising up from the earth due to explosions. Continuing to that location, Obito begins to see flashes of
Rin
 from his left eye socket with a hand running through her chest. Believing these to be nothing more than phantom images, the young Uchiha presses on only to arrive on the battlefield to see Kakashi's hand
run through
 Rin's chest.
