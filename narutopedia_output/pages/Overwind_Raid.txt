Using his
Kote
, Boruto sends a Wind Release-infused
shuriken
 at his opponent, pushing them back. Boruto then uses a Kote Water Release technique to flood the place, holding the opponent in place, and while surfing on the waves, sends a Vanishing Rasengan through the water, pushing the opponent up when it hits.
