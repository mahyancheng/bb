This team, disguised as
Konohagakure

genin
-levelled
shinobi
, were
Otogakure
 spies that took part in the
Chūnin Exams
 to observe
Sasuke Uchiha
 for
Orochimaru
. Kabuto proved most successful in this goal, but withdrew from the exams before the preliminary matches. Testing Sasuke's mettle was left to
Yoroi Akadō
, who was defeated by Sasuke in the first preliminary match.
Misumi Tsurugi
 was later defeated by his
opponent
 as well.

Yoroi, Misumi, and their unnamed team leader were not seen again in the manga. In the anime, Yoroi and Misumi made another appearance in the
Land of the Sea
 assisting Orochimaru's scientist,
Amachi
. Both are presumably killed when Misumi was trapped inside a collapsing cave and Yoroi sinks into the depths of the ocean. The unnamed leader also makes several cameos in the anime, most prominently at
Hiruzen Sarutobi
's funeral and later in Part II as a member of the
Nijū Shōtai
.

Trivia

Kabuto's name, along with Yoroi's and Misumi's, makes up the helmet—armour—sword trio.

Although the three members were Orochimaru's spies, it is unknown if the team leader was as well. However, he was a student of Orochimaru.

All members of this team, including their sensei, wore a pair of glasses.
