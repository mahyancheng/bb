New Era

Gatai arrived at Konohagakure with his attendant, and issues a challenge to Hiashi Hyūga on the basis of renown. When Hanabi claimed he was away on her father's instruction, Gatai believed Hiashi to be weak. Later, at the
Lightning Burger
, boasted of having Hiashi scared of him. A fed-up Boruto challenged him to a match, easily avoiding his attacks, and taunting him back, saying he wouldn't even beat Hanabi. Enraged, Gatai resumed attacking, damaging the surrounding area. Boruto noticed it, and attempted to end the match with a Rasengan, but Hiashi stopped them. Blaming himself for not anticipating Boruto's reaction, Hiashi accepted the challenge, but Gatai backed down, intimidated.
