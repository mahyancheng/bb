 Exceeding One's Limits…!!) is chapter 128 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

The pain caused by
Chidori
 only increases
Gaara
's interest in the battle. After advancing his transformation further he attacks
Sasuke
 again, this time even faster than before. Knowing Chidori is the only way to damage Gaara, Sasuke remembers what
Kakashi
 told him about the technique: that his limit is two uses per day and, if he tried to exceed that, he would die. Having already used Chidori twice and knowing he will die anyway if he doesn't try, Sasuke uses a third Chidori, activating the
cursed seal
 to give him the needed strength. While the attack succeeds, Sasuke is unable to move afterwards. Gaara quickly recovers and moves to finish Sasuke, but is stopped by
Naruto
.
