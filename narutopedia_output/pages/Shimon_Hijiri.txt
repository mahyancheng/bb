forehead protector
 obscures his eyes. He wears the standard outfit of the Torture and Interrogation Force which consists of a grey button-up suit.

Abilities

Not much has been seen in the way of Shimon's abilities but he is skilled enough to aid Inoichi in
delving
 into the minds of the enemy in order to retrieve potentially valuable information.

 assisted

 in
reading the mind
 of

 in order to extract valuable information for the village. When
Pain's Assault

Trivia

His eyes are obstructed by his bangs in the manga. In his anime début, however, they were visible and shown to be black. This was corrected in his later appearances in the anime.

"Shimon" can mean a lot of things, including "question" (
諮問
), "city gate" (
市門
), and 'finger print' (
指紋
) while, "Hijiri" (
聖
) can mean "saintly" or "virtuous". His name might be an allusion to
Saint Simon
 (
聖シモン
,
Sei-Shimon
) who signified listening. In fact, in the TCG his card is named St. Simon.
