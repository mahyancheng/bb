This technique enables the user to manipulate water and moisture around oneself. In this way, the user can quickly extract and utilise groundwater or water from vegetation, should no other source be available.

It can be used to block incoming
attacks
 and explosions,
trap
 or drown opponents, and shape the water into various shapes. Uniquely, the user can employ a strategy to suspense countless droplets in the air in order to redirect projectiles, act as a shield, or quickly take hold of an opponent.

Having the ability to manipulate the water from long distances allows the user, in conjunction with the
Summoning Technique
, to make use of water-based summonings to fight in areas that it normally wouldn't be able to.

Trivia

水天彷彿 is a Japanese idiom referring to a view of the horizon where the earth and the sky cannot be easily distinguished.

Ruiga
 uses his
tonfa
 as dowsing rods to ensure he stays in areas with groundwater for this technique. As a result, Ruiga tends to avoid rocky areas where water source is scarce.
