Kidōmaru
 imprisons a target in a cocoon of spider threads. Because of how tightly around the target the spider threads are stretched, they are unable to move once they've been trapped. Kidōmaru can further constrict the threads by flowing additional
chakra
 into them, to the point of ultimately strangling the target.
 The threads are produced by mixing Kidōmaru's saliva with chakra, making them exceptionally sticky. As with all of Kidōmaru's webbing, targets can free themselves by injecting their own chakra into the threads, such as with the
Gentle Fist
.
