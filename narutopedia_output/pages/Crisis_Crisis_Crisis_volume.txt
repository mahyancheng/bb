" (
助っ人、参上!!
,
Suketto, Sanjō!!
)

Shikamaru tries to
strangle

Tayuya
 with his shadow before she can escape, and despite the technique being in close proximity of its target where it worked best, Tayuya is able to use the power of her
cursed seal
 to resist his attack. Meanwhile,
Kimimaro
 continues to defeat
Naruto
's waves of
shadow clones
. Just when all of his shadow clones are destroyed, the seal keeping
Sasuke
 within his coffin dissipates and he emerges. Naruto tries to convince him to come back but he runs off. When Naruto starts to follow Sasuke, Kimimaro attacks but is blocked by
Lee
, who tells Naruto to go after Sasuke while he deals with Kimimaro.

Naruto
 that he promised
Sakura
 that he would bring

 back to
Konoha
. Naruto leaves
Kimimaro
 to Lee and follows Sasuke. Back in Konoha,
Guy
 races to
Tsunade
 as soon as he returns from his mission. She informs him that Lee's surgery was a complete success, and both are then informed that Lee has left the hospital. Tsunade notices that Lee has forgotten his medicine, accidentally taking her sake instead. Guy is horrified by the news. Lee and Kimimaro begin fighting but Kimimaro has no difficulty predicting and blocking Lee's strikes. After Lee takes a short break to take his "medicine", he becomes drunk and assumes a
Drunken Fist
 stance.

" (
変則的…!!
,
Hensokuteki…!!
)

Kiba
 leaves the safety of the river to hide on land. Elsewhere,
Lee
, drunk, attacks
Kimimaro
. Kimimaro is no longer able to predict and block Lee's attacks, as Lee himself does not know what he is doing. After Lee manages to land several blows and dodges all of Kimimaro's, Kimimaro makes greater use of his
Shikotsumyaku
, sprouting bones from all over his body to damage Lee whenever he attacks.

Chapter 212

"
Crisis, Crisis, Crisis!!
" (
ピンチ・ピンチ・ピンチ!!
,
Pinchi, Pinchi, Pinchi!!
)

Kimimaro
's manipulation of his skeletal structure allows him to block or neutralise all of
Lee
's attacks. This, combined with Lee's sobering up, again leaves him unable to damage Kimimaro. Lee persists despite his recent surgery, knowing he must buy time for
Naruto
. Elsewhere,
Sakon
 searches for the hiding
Kiba
. Kiba believes he has escaped detection when Sakon begins to move away, only to be greeted by Ukon, who could approach unnoticed by wearing Kiba's coat, masking his scent with Kiba's own.
Shikamaru
 meanwhile can no longer restrain
Tayuya
 and she moves to finish him off. Before either he, Kiba, or Lee can be killed, one of the
Three Sand Siblings
 appears and rescues each.

Chapter 213

"
A Great Debt…!!
" (
大きな借り…!!
,
Ōkina Kari…!!
)

The
Three Sand Siblings
 inform the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 that the
Fifth Hokage
 asked for their help, which, because of
Naruto
, they were inclined to provide.
Gaara
, seeing that
Lee
 is still suffering from the injuries he inflicted, protects him from
Kimimaro
.
Tayuya
 retreats when
Temari
 arrives.
Shikamaru
 briefs her on Tayuya's abilities and suggests retreating, but Temari is not interested.
Sakon
 tries to merge with
Kankurō
 in an effort to kill him and get at
Kiba
. Kankurō uses his
puppets
 as shields which, being unable to merge with, Sakon is easily defeated by.

Chapter 214

"
Step Aside for a Moment…!!
" (
いったん退いて…!!
,
Ittan Hiite…!!
)

Ukon
 appears to protect
Sakon
, allowing his brother to recuperate within his body. Taking advantage of the fewer targets,
Kankurō
 navigates them into his
Kuroari
. Once they are trapped within it, Kankurō bombards it with knives, killing Sakon and Ukon. Elsewhere,
Tayuya
 hides from Temari among the trees, She brings out a spare flute, but her sound-based
genjutsu
 is unable to break through the gusts of wind generated by Temari's fan. Temari summons
Kamatari
, who levels the forest and crushes Tayuya under debris.

Chapter 215

"
Gaara of the Sand Waterfall
" (
砂瀑の我愛羅
,
Sabaku no Gaara
)

Not wanting
Gaara
 to fight by himself,
Lee
 tries to help and attacks
Kimimaro
 to try and provide an opening for him. Gaara restrains him and instructs him to not interfere, saying he doesn't need the help, especially from someone in Lee's condition. Kimimaro, seeing that Gaara does not rely on
taijutsu
 like his two opponents, contemplates how to respond. He is quickly captured with Gaara's sand and crushed, but by activating the first stage of his
cursed seal
 and strengthening his bones, he avoids death. Gaara tries once more, using even more sand to crush Kimimaro and the surrounding area, but Kimimaro again survives.

Chapter 216

"
Spear and Shield…!!
" (
矛と盾…!!
,
Hoko to Tate…!!
)

With level two of his
cursed seal
 active,
Kimimaro
 is able to outrun
Gaara
's
sand
 and break through some of his more basic defences. He uses his spine to immobilise Gaara and creates a battering ram out of bone. Kimimaro claims it to be capable of breaking through any defence, so Gaara creates his strongest defence: a
Shukaku
 replica. As the two test which is superior,
Orochimaru
 and
Kabuto
 discuss Kimimaro. The last member of the
Kaguya clan
, Kimimaro is a natural prodigy with the clan's
Shikotsumyaku
. Both repeat their regrets that Kimimaro's illness will soon cause his death, depriving Orochimaru of such a useful ability.

Chapter 217

"
For the Sake of Those Precious
" (
大切な者の為に
,
Taisetsuna Mono no Tame ni
)

Gaara
's defence proves stronger than
Kimimaro
's attack. Defeated, Kimimaro finds solace in that, when he dies, he will continue to live on in
Orochimaru
's heart. Gaara tells him he has been brainwashed and buries him underground. Kimimaro attacks again as he sinks, sprouting a field of bones from the ground, but Gaara protects himself and
Lee
 from damage. Kimimaro emerges from one of the bones, telling them he was not brainwashed and preparing another attack. He succumbs to his illness before he can follow through. Lee and Gaara discuss Kimimaro and how strong he was, which Gaara observes to have been because he fought for Orochimaru. Even if someone is evil, people who consider them precious will always fight for them. At the
Valley of the End
,
Naruto
 finally tracks
Sasuke
 down.
