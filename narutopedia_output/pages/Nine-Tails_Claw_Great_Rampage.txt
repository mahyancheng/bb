In his four-tails
form
, Naruto swipes downwards at his opponent with his right claws, makes a half spin, this time hitting with his claws, followed by a second chakra body emerging from his to strike with his right claw. Naruto continues with a backwards spin that again hits the opponent with the tails, throwing them up in the air, and then jumps spinning forward, hitting with the tails many times before finishing with a downward swipe with both arms.
