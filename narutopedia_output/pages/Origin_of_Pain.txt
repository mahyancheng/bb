"
Origin of Pain
" (
ペイン誕生
,
Pein Tanjō
) is episode 173 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Nagato
 continues telling his story to
Naruto
 and tells him how fate led the three
Ame Orphans
 to the three legendary
Sannin
, and how
Jiraiya
 offered to take care of them. After spotting Jiraiya's
Konoha

forehead protector
, Nagato did not accept him, as it was Konoha
shinobi
 who had murdered his
mother
 and
father
. However, after spending time with Jiraiya, Nagato came to regard him as his sensei.

One day, he and
Yahiko
 were attacked by a renegade ninja from
Iwagakure
. The enemy was about to murder Yahiko, and Nagato used his
Rinnegan
 to kill him. After seeing Nagato's
dojutsu
, Jiraiya agreed to teach the three orphans
ninjutsu
 and privately confided in Nagato that he viewed him as the reincarnation of the
Sage of Six Paths
, who wielded the Rinnegan and spoke of obtaining peace and understanding one another. Nagato decided that he would use his power to protect Yahiko and
Konan
, and after they had gained enough strength to thrive on their own, Jiraiya had left them.

Yahiko, Nagato and Konan travelled throughout
Amegakure
 and recruited various Ame-nin into their newfound
organisation
, which would find a peaceful solution to the
war
.
Hanzō
, the ruler of Ame, perceived them as a threat and invited them to a negotiation under the pretext of quelling the conflicts between the lands of
Fire
,
Wind
 and
Earth
. However, the meeting was a trap, consisting of Hanzō's men and
Danzō Shimura
, a commander from Konoha, who supplied his
Root
 members for the ambush. Hanzō held Konan hostage and threw a kunai to Nagato, ordering him to kill Yahiko in order to save himself and Konan. As Nagato picked up the kunai and hesitated, Yahiko threw himself onto the blade, telling Nagato to protect Konan and that Nagato was the true saviour of the world. Satisfied that Yahiko was dead, Hanzō ordered his troops to kill Nagato and Konan as well.

Enraged, Nagato
summoned
 the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, using it to engulf the souls of Hanzō and Danzō's men and killing them, although at the cost of having
black chakra receivers
 stabbed and embedded into his back, becoming permanently emaciated from the effort.
