Handing Down Senjutsu…!!
 (
仙術伝承…!!
,
Senjutsu Denshō…!!
,
Viz:
 Senjutsu Heir) is volume 44 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 403

"
Tears
" (
涙
,
Namida
)

Naruto
 thinks about his last encounter with
Itachi
, where he told Itachi that he was more of a brother to
Sasuke
 than Itachi was. Itachi asked, if this were true, what he would do if Sasuke attacked
Konoha
. Naruto responded that he would defend the village and stop Sasuke without killing him. Pleased, Itachi gave him some of his power, hoping Naruto would not need it. He then left. Sasuke, elsewhere, also thinks about Itachi; the night he killed the
Uchiha clan
. At the point Sasuke had thought he had passed out that night, Sasuke had followed Itachi and attacked him. Itachi was not harmed, but he looked upon Sasuke with tears in his eyes. Sasuke concludes that he cannot do as Itachi wanted him to.

Chapter 404

"
Taka and Akatsuki
" (
“鷹”と“暁”
,
"Taka" to "Akatsuki"
)

Naruto
 is called to
Tsunade
's office. There, he finds
Team 7
 and a number of
toads
 waiting for him.
Fukasaku
 informs him of
Jiraiya
's death. Elsewhere,
Taka
 has a meeting with
Akatsuki
. Sasuke states his intentions to kill the leaders of
Konoha
 responsible for the
Uchiha
's destruction but does not care about the villagers. Akatsuki volunteers to help, but only if Taka captures the
Eight-Tails
 while they handle the
Nine-Tails
. Afterwards,
Tobi
 speaks with
Zetsu
, glad to be rid of
Itachi
 at last. He admits that the losses the organisation has suffered have been severe, but that they were worth it to gain Sasuke's loyalty.

Chapter 405

"
What is Left Behind
" (
遺されたもの
,
Nokosareta Mono
)

Fukasaku
 explains that
Jiraiya
 gave him a coded message about
Pain
 before dying and shows it to those present.
Naruto
 instead focuses on
Tsunade
, blaming her for letting Jiraiya go on such a dangerous mission by himself. Tsunade makes no effort to refute his claim so he storms out despite
Sakura
's protests. Naruto continues the rest of the day wandering town and mourning Jiraiya. He runs into
Iruka
, who reveals that Naruto is finally gaining acknowledgement on a village-wide scale, and offers to take him to
Ramen Ichiraku
, but Naruto declines. In the evening, Naruto, holding a popsicle, goes to a park and starts crying, regretting how Jiraiya was not able to see him as Hokage. Iruka tracks him down and comforts him about Jiraiya's death, saying how proud Jiraiya had always been of Naruto and how, as Jiraiya's student, he lives on in Naruto. Meanwhile, Tsunade tasks
Shikamaru
 with deciphering Jiraiya's message alone. Although Shikamaru objects to doing the task himself, Sakura insists he does. It is revealed that shortly afterwards, Tsunade takes some time alone to cry for Jiraiya, remembering when the two met and regretting not having reciprocated Jiraiya's feelings earlier.

Chapter 406

"
The Key to the Future
" (
未来への鍵
,
Mirai e no Kagi
)

Interrogation of the
Amegakure
 prisoner
Jiraiya
 captured is left to
Ibiki
, while study of the
Pain
 he captured is left to
Shizune
.
Shikamaru
 visits the
Konoha Cryptanalysis Team
 to try and decipher Jiraiya's dying message, but they conclude that they cannot do so without figuring out the key, something only someone close to Jiraiya would be able to figure out. Shikamaru asks around, but it becomes apparent that
Naruto
 would be the only one who could help. Naruto, still sad about
Jiraiya
's death, has difficulty focusing. Through a visit to a pregnant
Kurenai
, Shikamaru inspired Naruto by reminding him that he lost a
teacher
 too, but that they cannot waste time moping because they must eventually become just as great as their late masters.

Chapter 407

"
Addressed to Naruto
" (
ナルトに宛てて
,
Naruto ni Atete
)

Naruto
 looks at
Jiraiya
's coded message, that appears to be a string of numbers. He informs
Shikamaru
 that the first character is not a number, but
katakana
 for "ta", a writing quirk of Jiraiya only Naruto would know.
Kakashi
 suggests that that is meant to indicate
Icha Icha Tactics
 is the key for the other, actual numbers. Taking the first word on each page of the book, they form the message of "the real one is not among them". They have no idea what this means, so ask someone who would. In
Amegakure
, the
Six Paths of Pain
 sets out for
Konoha
, the one Jiraiya captured having been replaced.

Chapter 408

"
Fukasaku's Proposal
" (
フカサクの提案
,
Fukasaku no Teian
)

In
Kumogakure
,
Taka
 interrogates a Kumo ninja about the
Eight-Tails
'
jinchūriki
. By using his
Mangekyō Sharingan
,
Sasuke
 is able to find out where he is. In
Konoha
, Naruto asks
Fukasaku
 about the meaning of
Jiraiya
's dying message: "the real one is not among them". Fukasaku cannot offer any likely theories on how it relates to
Pain
. With the study of the other clues Jiraiya left behind still ongoing, Fukasaku offers to teach Naruto
senjutsu
 to prepare him for his inevitable encounter with Pain.

Chapter 409

"
Handing Down Senjutsu…!!
" (
仙術伝承!
,
Senjutsu Denshō!
)

Naruto
 wishes his friends in
Konoha
 good luck with the investigation into
Pain
.
Fukasaku
 reminds them to send for help if they need it before going to
Mount Myōboku
 with Naruto. When they get there, Fukasaku informs Naruto that learning
senjutsu
 requires he become one with nature. Once mastered and combined with his own
chakra
, Naruto will achieve
Sage Mode
. Naruto asks where to start, which
Gamakichi
 says to be by dying. Meanwhile,
Taka
 locates the
Eight-Tails
'
jinchūriki
.

Chapter 410

"
The Battle at the Valley of Clouds and Lightning!!
" (
雲雷峡の闘い!!
,
Unraikyō no Tatakai!!
)

Naruto
 is worried by
Gamakichi
's claim that he must die, but
Fukasaku
 assures him this is just a terrible analogy. To become one with nature, and thus master senjutsu, Naruto must learn to be perfectly still and take in natural energy. A special oil can help him with this, but it runs the risk of turning him first into a
toad
 and then into a statue if he is not careful. Naruto decides to go through with it, determined to be just as great as
Jiraiya
. Meanwhile,
Taka
 battles
Killer B
, the
Eight-Tails
'
jinchūriki
. When
Suigetsu
 and
Jūgo
 prove no match for him,
Sasuke
 steps in.

Chapter 411

"
The Eight-Tails vs. Sasuke!!
" (
八尾VSサスケ!!
,
Hachibi Bāsasu Sasuke!!
)

Sasuke
 attacks
Killer B
 with his sword, aware that he cannot kill B. That same stipulation does not apply for B, who uses
Suigetsu
's
Kubikiribōchō
 to spar with him. B is impressed by Sasuke's skill with a blade, so B does him the courtesy of using his seven personal blades instead of Suigetsu's. Sasuke has difficulty keeping up with B's many strikes even with his
Sharingan
, but believes he has the advantage of channelling
lightning
 into his sword. B also has that advantage, which he uses to stab Sasuke with multiple swords.

Chapter 412

"
Unprecedented Shivers
" (
かつてない戦慄
,
Katsutenai Senritsu
)

At
Mount Myōboku
,
Naruto
 asks to train with
shadow clones
 to help his learn
senjutsu
 faster.
Fukasaku
 agrees, but they do not help much. Seeing that Naruto is having trouble, Fukasaku informs him that not everyone can learn senjutsu; only those with large
chakra
 reserves and the determination to never give up can do so. Naruto is happy to find he has plenty of both. Meanwhile,
Karin
 heals
Sasuke
's injuries while the rest of
Taka
 fights with
Killer B
. Seeing that they might actually be a challenge, B decides to go all out.

“

I went home to visit my parents for the first time in a long while. The clouds I saw out the aeroplane window were very pleasant and made me remember that I like clouds.
