Kakuzu's
fire-element mask
 fires a small fireball that erupts into a giant fire-storm after making contact with a surface, causing widespread destruction to the area. Since the flames travel along the ground, and cover such a wide area this is a difficult technique to evade. When combined with
Wind Release: Pressure Damage
, this technique is amplified to the point of being able to evaporate a large amount of
water
 in an instant.

Trivia

Like the rest of Kakuzu's techniques, the name of this technique comes from the legendary mecha anime
Mobile Suit Gundam
 (
機動戦士ガンダム
,
Kidō Senshi Gandamu
). The name Zukokku was taken from the
Gundam MSM-07

Z'Gok
 (
ズゴック
,
Zugokku
). The name was altered slightly and given kanji to create the name of this technique.
