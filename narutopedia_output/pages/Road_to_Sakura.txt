"
Road to Sakura
" is episode 271 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Ino
 strolls through the outlying forest of the village, considering what she should do on her day-off, she sees a bright light and hears a scream. Looking up, she sees her friend,
Sakura
, falling through the sky. Rushing to her aid, she finds Sakura unconscious on a tree branch. Ino then brings Sakura back to
Konoha
 and has
Tsunade
 check on her. Noting that Sakura had developed amnesia, a comical argument develops as Sakura unreservedly calls
Tsunade
's breasts gigantic (and voices the suspicion, that Tsunade enlarged her breasts artificially) and
Shizune
's underdeveloped which culminates in Ino having to stop them both from further hitting Sakura on the head, reminding them of her condition.

As they go through the village and encounter the other members of the
Konoha 11
, Sakura notes that they look vaguely familiar but not as how she remembered them. In an attempt to jog her memory, everyone attempts to represent themselves the way Sakura remembers (which is the complete opposite of their current personalities), though this endeavour is ultimately unsuccessful. Later when Sakura realises that she had lost a pendant of a
cherry blossom
 she had around her neck, she and Ino begin searching frantically for it. Her parents,
Kizashi
 and
Mebuki
 end up finding a dazed Sakura and her father returns the pendant, which she had dropped at their doorway, to her. Remembering parts of her past, Sakura runs to embrace her parents, crying. Though this puzzles her parents greatly, they depart telling her to come home later. Sakura ends up telling Ino that it was likely that she was not the Sakura she knew before disappearing again in a bright light, leaving Ino severely confused, wondering where the Sakura she knew was then.

Trivia

This episode is a tie-in to the
Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie
 and as such even had a promotional poster in the background during the episode. The Sakura featured in this episode is Sakura's counterpart in the
Genjutsu World
 from the movie.

Though the Sakura of the Genjutsu World mentioned that she never lived in the home of the real Sakura before, she in fact lived in the same home that the real Sakura did.
