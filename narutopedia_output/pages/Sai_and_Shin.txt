"
Sai and Shin
" (
サイとシン
,
Sai to Shin
) is episode 263 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Upon seeing his old puppet body,
Sasori
 mused that he no longer required it as he had an immortal body that he had always desired now. As the battle between the two divisions got under-way,
Shin
 was sent in to battle
Kankurō
's
Sasori
 puppet. Omoi also joined the fray having been informed by
Hoheto Hyūga
 that
Shin
's stomach was full of
explosive clay
 and that
Lightning Release
 was able to counter it. Omoi's attack missed, however, and
Deidara

detonated
 Shin. The explosion was stifled by Kankurō's
puppet
,
Sanshōuo
, which encased Shin. Enraged by Deidara's reference to his brother as a bomb, Sai
created
 a replica of the
Benevolent Kings
 who knocked Deidara and Sasori out of the air and into Kankurō's
awaiting puppets
.

As Deidara tried to
blow himself up
, Omoi
channelled
 his lightning-imbued sword into the mouth on his chest before Deidara was immobilised by the Sasori puppet's coil of wire. Shin saw the drawing of both him and Sai holding hands which freed his soul. Kankurō's speech to Sasori moves him despite Deidara's warning not to listen to them. Entrusting Kankurō with his
Mother and Father
 puppets, Sasori asked Kankurō to pass them down to the generations to come, to which Kankurō agreed. Seeing Shin's and Sasori's bodies crumbling into ash and the bodies beneath them, the
Surprise Attack Division
 realise that sacrifices were needed for the technique. Elsewhere
Kabuto Yakushi
 told
Tobi
 to head out the battlefield while he focused on the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
. Tobi deduced that Kabuto was using him and the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 to take each other out, but promised he was the one using Kabuto.

Trivia

In the English dubbed version of this episode, during Shin's fight against Sai as well as during the flashbacks, he calls the latter by his current codename, even though Sai was never given said codename prior to Shin's death, thus Shin shouldn't have known this.
