This
jutsu
,
 allows the user to freely manipulate carbon. For external sources, the user is able to remotely control the said carbon, shaping it into a myriad of shapes, and levitate it freely. Upon which, the user can manipulate the cluster of carbon in a myriad of formations and launch them as a barrage of speeding projectiles that even the
Sharingan
 has difficulty following. The user can also increase the size of the projectiles, strengthening to the point that their sheer force can plough through an
Iron Sand Wall
.

Alternately, the user can manipulate, and fine-tune their control over the carbon within their own body, and rearrange the molecular-bonds between them. In doing this, the user's body will take on a dark reflective state akin to metal. In this state, the user's body becomes super dense, as hard as diamond, granting them immense physical strength and becomes impervious to nearly any form of damage. This ability can also be used on any isolated part of the body or their entire being.

When utilising this internal and external nature of this technique on oneself, it produces a large armour that encases the user. In this state, it maximises the user's strength and resilience of the carbon, showing by it shining like diamonds.

Trivia

The nature of this technique's application on one's person is virtually identical to the innate ability of
Greed
 from
Fullmetal Alchemist
.
