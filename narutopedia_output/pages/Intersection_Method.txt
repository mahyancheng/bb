With this technique, the user is able to intercept and counter an oncoming
taijutsu
 technique by raising the knee, and driving the elbow downwards at the same time. This catches the attacking limb between their two limbs, and drives the elbow down with great force, effectively shattering the bone. Genshō used this technique while disguised as
Yagura
 to "break"
Rock Lee
's
Leaf Whirlwind
 by intercepting his attacking leg. Even though Lee's ankle was not broken due to protection from his ankle
weights
, he was forced to completely halt his training until the injury was fully healed.
