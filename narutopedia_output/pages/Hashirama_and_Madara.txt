Summary

When the
Tailed Beast Ball
 held by
Hashirama Senju
's
humanoid
 creation collides with
Madara Uchiha
's
Susanoo Sword
, it explodes. As the smoke clears, a Susanoo-clad
Nine-Tails
 is revealed ready to attack Hashirama as he emerged from his wooden
defence
. With Hashirama praising Madara, he quickly
grabs
 the ethereal sword and counters with several additional hands emerging from the ground to suppress the beast only for the
tailed beast
 to destroy with a swing from another blade. Not wanting the landscape of the current area to be completely decimated, Hashirama quickly retreats to the coastline prompting Madara to give chase. As the
Uchiha
 charged another Tailed Beast Ball onto Susanoo's sword and throws it, Hashirama summons
a set of barriers
 to deflect the attack. Hashirama then attempts to reason with his friend and comrade, wanting to stop the battle but Madara refuses, noting that he has gone too far. Knowing that Madara was beyond the point of being persuaded, Hashirama enters
Sage Mode
 and uses the
gigantic wooden construct
 with which he prepares to attack. As the battle progresses, Hashirama remembers the first time when he and Madara met, skipping stones by a river. When asked who he was, Hashirama noted that he was currently Madara's rival in stone skipping, at which he was winning.
