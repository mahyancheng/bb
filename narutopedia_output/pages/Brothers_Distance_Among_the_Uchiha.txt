Sasuke
's face, but to Naruto's surprise, he acts unharmed, intimidating him. Naruto lands several blows on Sasuke's face, but even as his blood falls to the ground, he remains the same. Sasuke laughs and tells Naruto that he's not even using his
Sharingan
. Angered, Naruto attacks again but is blocked and pushed off of the top of the statue. Both falling off, Sasuke ruthlessly beats Naruto to the ground easily where he stays down and tosses the bag of ninja-tools to where Naruto lies. Sasuke begins to remember his childhood and his reasons for becoming obsessed with power. Sasuke's childhood was spent living in his brother,
Itachi
's, shadow. Being the prodigy of the clan, Itachi received all the attention from their father, leaving Sasuke to live his life trying to earn his father's recognition.

Uchiha clan
 began to suspect Itachi of being a murderer, and Itachi started openly attacking and disrespecting the clan.
