This highly versatile technique allows the user's spirit to leave their body. By taking possession of a target, the spirit can suppress and collapse the victim's spirit, killing them, or freely manipulate their actions. This technique can also be used to communicate information or transfer
chakra
.
 This technique will always reach the intended target, even when their whereabouts are unknown to the user. Having become a living ghost, the spirit has no substance and cannot be affected by enemy attacks.

With the release of the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 technique, a reincarnated Dan was capable of taking control of his ascending spirit for a short period of time using this technique. Dan Katō noted that this technique had been used to kill a great number of shinobi during his lifetime
 and that the only way to counteract the technique is to trap the user within a barrier, such as the
Four Violet Flames Formation
, before it is activated.

Trivia

Dan's ability to cause his soul to exit his body makes him reminiscent of an "
ikiryō
" (
生霊
,
literally meaning:
 living ghost), from Japanese folklore. An ikiryō is a person whose soul can dwell outside his or her body.

Tobirama Senju
 is capable of using a similar technique, where he can send his soul into
another
 person's body if they were still alive, but unlike this technique, it is labelled a
kinjutsu
.
