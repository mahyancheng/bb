The user creates a
shadow clone
, intending for their opponents to attack the clone at close range. After a certain amount of time has passed, the clone detonates, creating a large explosion. If opponents happen to notice that it's a shadow clone they may be able to escape in time, for which reason the user should try to conceal the clone's identity and purpose as much as possible.
