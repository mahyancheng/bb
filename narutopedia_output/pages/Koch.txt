The
kochū
 (
蠱虫
,
literally meaning:
 worm insect) are a species of insect used by members of the
Aburame clan
, seen in
Book of Dark Night
. They can produce a poison that will paralyse their victims and kill them a short while later; the poison disappears upon death, preventing it from being found during autopsies.
Danzō Shimura
 notes kochū are perfect for performing assassinations, as they are as imperceptible as mosquitoes yet as deadly as scorpions.

Yōji Aburame
 is the only clansman known to use kochū. Because he cannot talk, Yōji controls the kochū in such a way that their sounds resemble speech, an effective yet exhausting accomplishment.

Trivia

Their name comes from
kodoku
, a type of poisonous magic in Japanese folklore.
