She was a member of the
Uzumaki clan
 who lived in
Kusagakure
.

Background

Karin
's mother came to Kusagakure while her daughter was still young. The two were allowed to stay, provided that the mother would use her powers to heal the injured of the village under watch by
Zōsui
. As the fighting broke-out, the mother was forced to regularly over-use her powers. Eventually, she died from healing too many people at once. This led the leaders of Kusagakure to pass on her former duties to Karin.

Personality

From what little was seen of her, she cared tremendously for her daughter, Karin. She was willing to risk her health and life simply to provide a stable home for the two.

Appearance

She was a fairly tall and light-skinned woman with grey eyes. Common among those of Uzumaki descent, she had bright red hair, which was straight, chin-length and parted to frame both sides of her face. Like her daughter, after her passing, the woman possessed countless bite-marks about her body from repeatedly letting people feed on her chakra to heal.

Abilities

As a direct descendant of the Uzumaki clan, she had a remarkably powerful life-force, granting her immense vitality, longevity, and healing powers. Even more, she could
transmit
 her healing to anyone who
bit her
 and sucked on her
chakra
, immediately healing any injury. She was shown to have tremendous reserves of stamina and chakra. However, such ability had a habit of leaving permanent bite marks, and healing too many at once would ultimately kill her.
