Ice Release
 (
氷遁
,
Hyōton
,
Viz:
 Ice Style) is a
nature transformation

kekkei genkai
, a combination of
water
 and
wind
.
 The
Land of Water
's
Yuki clan
 was feared for the power of their Ice Release,
 forcing its members to go into hiding to escape persecution.
 In
Kakashi Hiden
,
Kahyō
 and
Rahyō‎‎
 are ‎‎ice users whose family was conquered by
Kirigakure
 decades earlier. Because Kiri did not value their lives, they both
defected
 and settled in the
Land of Waves
. In the
Boruto
 anime,
Ryōgi
 from the
Land of Snow
 can use Ice Release.

Haku
, a descendant of the Yuki clan, can make
mirrors of ice
 that he is able to enter and instantly travel between.
 His ice is resistant to
fire
, experiencing little to no melting despite the heat.
 Kahyō can plant
ice particles
 on targets, causing them to freeze to death if they don't constantly use their chakra to keep themselves warm. Her Ice Release is dependent on moisture in the air, preventing her from forming ice in dry conditions. Rahyō
encases his hands with ice
, strengthening his
taijutsu
 strikes and making it easier for him to block opponents' taijutsu. Ryōgi can shoot
shards of ice
 at targets.

An Ice Release user's presence can lower their surroundings' temperature, causing snow to fall in the immediate vicinity.
 Similarly, Ryōgi is shown lowering his own body temperature so that his movements will not activate thermal sensors.

Trivia

In
Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow
, ninja from
Yukigakure
 use Ice Release by manipulating pre-existing ice and snow. Their Ice Release is not a kekkei genkai, as
Kakashi Hatake
 is able to copy it with his
Sharingan
. Most of these Ice Release techniques use the Dog
hand seal
.

In the original
Naruto
 anime,
Renga
 crystallises the water vapour around him into ice. This is never mentioned to be Ice Release.






Sasuke making ice in the
Sasuke Retsuden
 manga.



In
Sasuke Shinden: The Teacher's Star Pupil
, after
Sasuke Uchiha
 performs a Water Release, he
rapidly cools
 it with Wind Release, creating ice.
Konohamaru Sarutobi
 compares this process to Ice Release, but Sasuke insists that it's inferior to true Ice Release.

Sasuke later dispenses with Wind Release entirely, instead manipulating the molecules of his Water Release so that it changes from its liquid state (water) to its solid state (ice).
