Like the parent technique, it creates a reinforced wall of earth to be used as a defensive mechanism. Using a pre-existing source of earth however, it allows the user to create multiple walls of earth, further fortifying their defence, so that even while the outer walls are destroyed the inner ones are still left intact. The walls can also be curved inward to block escape from above.
