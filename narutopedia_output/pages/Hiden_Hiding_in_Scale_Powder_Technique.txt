The user exhales a large quantity of fine powder from their mouth, which due to its luminous quality, shines so brightly that it can temporarily blind multiple targets within its area of effect. This momentary handicap can be utilised either by the user or their allies to attack the opposition whilst their vision is still impaired.

Trivia

While the kanji in the term "rinpun" (
鱗粉
) literally mean "scale powder", the term refers specifically to insect
scales
 (such as the "dust" on moth wings). According to old wives' tales, that dust causes blindness.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
 and
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
, the powder appears to be orange as well as
combustible
, while in the anime, it is bright white. They are also an ability of Chōmei's, while in the manga, that is unconfirmed.

This technique can be effectively countered if the target's eyes are protected for the duration of the technique, or otherwise possess
sensory abilities
 to compensate for the loss of sight.
