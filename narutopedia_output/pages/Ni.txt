Ni
 (
弐
) was an antagonist that appeared in
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
. She was a
kunoichi
 and one of
Hiruko
's three followers, along with
Ichi
 and
San
.

Personality

She, like her comrades, was very overconfident in her abilities. She would mock her opponents during battle and would even talk down to her dog-like summonings. She also would not hesitate in using the
Chimera Technique
 to merge with others, even if it meant distorting her own body.

Appearance

She had two purple rectangular markings on her left cheek, a red-violet bodysuit that revealed much of her chest and figure, and long brown hair curled into a very intricate spiral. Ni also had a mark on her back that was the same as the one in Hiruko's left palm.

Abilities

She summoned multiple
dog-like creatures
 that have been modified with cable projectiles on their back. She could also summon a
Lion-Turtle
 and merge with it using the
Chimera Technique
. The new creature, although strong, was slow due to its large size, leaving it vulnerable to faster opponents. Ni also wielded a
whip
 which she could use proficiently at close range.

Plot Overview
