This article is about the sword wielded by Orochimaru. For the chokutō wielded by Sasuke Uchiha, see
Sword of Kusanagi
. For other uses, see
Sword of Kusanagi
.

The
Kusanagi Sword
 is a legendary sword owned by
Orochimaru
. He retrieves this sword by opening his mouth and extending a snake which then opens its mouth and produces it. Orochimaru was seen producing the sword handle first so he could use it freely, or blade first to attack his opponent instantly.

The sword can quickly extend and retract its blade to attack from long distances,
be controlled telekinetically
 according to Orochimaru's command, and cut through almost anything. Even
Enma
, who is able to transform into a
diamond-hard staff
, noted that the Kusanagi blade would leave him considerably sore.
 It should be noted that Orochimaru's Kusanagi could not pierce
Naruto Uzumaki
's
four-tailed form
.
 The sword has been seen transforming into a small snake and returning to Orochimaru.

After Orochimaru re-emerged from
Sasuke Uchiha
 through his
Eight Branches Technique
, he was sealed by
Itachi Uchiha
's
Sword of Totsuka
. As a result, the Kusanagi was subsequently sealed with him. As he was brought back via the
Evil Releasing Method
, the fate of the sword is unknown.

Influence

The
Kusanagi no Tsurugi
 (
草薙劍
,
literally meaning:
 Grass-Mowing Sword) is one of the Three Imperial Regalia of Japan (
三種の神器
,
Sanshu no Jingi
), together with the Yata no Kagami  (
八咫鏡
,
literally meaning:
 Eight Span Mirror) and the Yasakani no Magatama (

Trivia

The Kusanagi appears differently from the
manga
 to the
anime
. In the manga, the Kusanagi is depicted as an
uchigatana
, while in the anime it is depicted as a Chinese
jian
. Due to the name of the sword, its appearance in the anime would have been more true to its counterpart, as a '
tsurugi
' is essentially a Japanese interpretation of the jian.

Sasuke Uchiha
 refers to the
chokutō
 he carries as a "Sword of Kusanagi", but it carries none of the unique attributes that Orochimaru's does.

The Totsuka Sword wielded by
Itachi Uchiha
's
Susanoo
 is also said to be a "Sword of Kusanagi", although this has been commonly mistranslated as it being the "
perfect counter
" to the Sword of Kusanagi.
