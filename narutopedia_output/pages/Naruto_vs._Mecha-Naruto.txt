"
Naruto vs. Mecha-Naruto
" (
ナルト対メカナルト
,
Naruto tai Meka-Naruto
) is episode 377 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Shikamaru
 is overwhelmed by
Mecha-Naruto
 and continues to follow the group while firing missiles in the process.
Chōji
 uses his
Human Bullet Tank
 in an attempt to distract Mecha-Naruto but ultimately fails.
Kiba
 and
Akamaru

transform into a double-headed wolf
 and attack using the
Fang Passing Fang
 but is easily countered by the mecha. The palanquin carrying
Naruto
 falls over since there was no one holding it.
Neji
 is next to join the fray, using his
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
. Mecha-Naruto tries blasting the rotating shield with lasers, but to no effect.
 After dominating Neji's technique with high speed, Mecha-Naruto breaks through and eliminates him and
Yamato
.
Kakashi
 uses his
Sharingan
 in a failed attempt to defeat the mecha. Just as Naruto is cornered by his mechanised replica,
Gaara
 arrives in time to save him. As he is about to crush Mecha-Naruto's arm,
Deidara
 appears and taunts the young man, forcing the
Kazekage
 to chase after him. Naruto and Mecha-Naruto are
summoned into a snake's stomach
 by
Orochimaru
 who reprogrammed Mecha-Naruto to obey him.
Jiraiya
 then appears and summons
Gamabunta
 thus freeing them from the
snake
's stomach. Mecha-Naruto easily overwhelms Naruto who was nearly drained of the
Nine-Tails
' chakra. Mecha-Naruto changes its programmings – courtesy of
Itachi
 – and returns the Nine-Tails' chakra back to Naruto. As Mecha-Naruto bisects Orochimaru in half to protect Naruto, he activates a switch, causing
Mecha-Kurama
 to appear and causes mayhem at
Konohagakure
. Mecha-Naruto encases itself onto Naruto and battle Mecha-Kurama but their attacks have no effect whatsoever. Mecha-Naruto ultimately sacrifices itself to destroy Mecha-Kurama. While the villagers celebrate Naruto's victory, they are comically drowned by Gaara's
Quicksand Waterfall Flow
.

Trivia

Mecha-Naruto encasing Naruto into itself and how it functions as a suit is reminiscent to
Iron Man
.

Mecha-Kurama's attack on Konoha mirrors that of
Pain
's
assault
 on the village.

In this episode,
Team Guy
 is referred to as Team Three. In Naruto's SD (Rock Lee's Spring of Youth), they are also referred to as Team Three, but this designation is not used in the manga or in any databooks.
