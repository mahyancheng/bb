The
Super God Imitating Drawing
 is a technique usable by those who have mastered the
Super Beast Imitating Drawing
.

Usage

Often employed in one-to-one combat, the user is able to bring forth massive and powerful gods. Boasting greater power than the Super Beast Imitating Drawing, each creation can quickly deliver deadly blows capable of easily destroying stone and the terrain. Because these drawings draw on the emotions of the user, the angrier they become, the more powerful the drawings become.

Gatekeeper
 a considerable distance.
