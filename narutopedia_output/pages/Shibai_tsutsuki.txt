Shibai Ōtsutsuki
 (
大筒木シバイ
,
Ōtsutsuki Shibai
) was considered a god of the
Ōtsutsuki clan
.

Background

Over several millennia, Shibai repeatedly resurrected himself using
Kāma
, during which he ate many
Chakra Fruits
. He was ultimately deemed to have evolved into godhood, with his abilities being labelled as divine miracles.

Personality

In his pursuit of power, Shibai sacrificed countless worlds, implying his indifference to the countless sacrificed living beings so the Chakra Fruits would come to fruition.

Appearance

Shibai appeared to have been a slim man with long flowing hair reaching his lower back and wore black, tattered robes. His horns curved upward like a crown above his head. He had a
Byakugan
 in his right eye and a
Rinnegan
 which opened vertically on his forehead, similar to
Momoshiki
 after he consumed
Kinshiki
's
existence
, and
Kaguya
 after she consumed Chakra Fruit.

Abilities






Shibai using Shinjutsu.



Upon reaching his apparent godhood, Shibai's techniques were dubbed "
Shinjutsu
". His incredible abilities that were achieved without
hand seals
 were said to be able to generate storms with a wave of his hand, as well as calling forth thunder bolts with a roar.
 He had access to various remarkable abilities, including
seeing

through time
, producing
black bands
 to instantly travel long distances through, and automatic
reflection
 of all harm to himself.
 He could also use the power of
Omnipotence
 to make anything he desired a reality.

Legacy

After several cycles of evolution, Shibai was hypothesised by
Amado
 to have ascended to a higher dimension level and deliberately discarded his body, something Momoshiki privately confirmed to
Boruto
.
 Sometime later, Amado ended up in possession of Shibai's physical remains, and transplanted his DNA into the members of
Kara
 to give them some of Shibai's Shinjutsu abilities. However, the awakening of one or more Shinjutsu was up to luck, only
Code
,
Ada
, and
Daemon
 manifested any Shinjutsu, while
Koji Kashin
 manifested his after having a near-death experience against
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
.

Trivia

The name "Shibai" is a notable resemblance to Shiva, a major god in Hinduism. Like Shibai, depicted as a powerful, god-like figure transcending dimensions, Shiva is worshiped as the Supreme Celestial Lord with cosmic powers of creation, preservation, and destruction (transformation). The Japanese language often approximates the "v" sound with a "b," making the phonetics similar. Lord Shiva is also revered within Japanese Buddhism, though typically under different names.

Written as "芝居", "shibai" means "drama (for the theatre)".
