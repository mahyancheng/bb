C-rank
 (
Cランク
,
Shī ranku
) is one of the six classifications. It is preceded by
D-rank
 and followed by
B-rank
. It is typically used when classifying
techniques
 intended for
ninja
 of the
chūnin
 level. C-rank techniques are often one of the first techniques a ninja will learn that require some amount of training.

There are also C-rank
missions
. These missions are usually assigned to chūnin, or in some cases,
genin
. Assignments include bodyguard duty and hunting wild animals, all of which will likely pose some risk to the ninja, albeit, according to
Kakashi Hatake
 there generally shouldn't be a chance of combat against other ninja on these missions.
 The only known example of a C-rank mission was
Team 7
's assignment to escort
Tazuna
 to the
Land of Waves
. After it was discovered that Tazuna had assassins after him the mission was stated by
Kakashi Hatake
 to be
B-rank
 or even
A-rank
. C-rank missions pay between 30,000 and 100,000
ryō
.
