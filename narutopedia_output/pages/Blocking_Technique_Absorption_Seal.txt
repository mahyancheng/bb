A highly advanced sealing technique granted by the
Preta Path
, that conjures a see-through barrier around the user's body that is capable of absorbing any
chakra
, regardless of any shape or nature transformation, and dispersing it within one's body by spinning the chakra within one's body in the opposite direction. As a result, this technique can absorb any
ninjutsu
 based technique, rendering it ineffective on the user.

Trivia

When Nagato uses this technique through the corpse of a
Kusagakure shinobi
, the absorbed chakra does not transfer over to Nagato's own body.
