This technique allows its user to silently emerge from an earthen surface, moving as a fish does underwater. As or after they've emerged, users are often well-placed to perform assassinations or guerrilla attacks. To help them go unnoticed while they strike, users will often combine this technique with
clone techniques
:
Team Oboro

Haze Clone Technique
, concealing their movements among the mass of clones;

Mahiru
 uses the
Shadow Clone Technique
, drawing his targets' attention while another shadow clone sneaks up on them.
