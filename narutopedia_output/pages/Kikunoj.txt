Peddlers Escort Mission

Years later when the infamous
Janin
 attacked the Land of Vegetables, the daimyō sent Kikunojō and Yurinojō to protect his daughter,
Haruna
. Fearing that their combined skills would not be enough, Kikunojō hired
Konoha
 for assistance. Unfortunately, due to little money, they could only be offered assistance at a C-rank level mission under the guise of escorting merchants. To further these deceptions, Kikunojō, Haruna, and Yurinojō disguised themselves as merchants as well. When it soon became clear that the Janin saw through their deceptions, Kikunojō went off to face them head-on.

Kikunojō then found himself in a flower field against the youngest of the Janin,
Ruiga
. Kikunojō initially had the upper hand and for a while seemed the inevitable winner with his clan's secret techniques. Ruiga unveiled his own secret technique and killed him. In the end, Kikunojō was given a proper burial and Haruna apologised for not appreciating his selfless service.
