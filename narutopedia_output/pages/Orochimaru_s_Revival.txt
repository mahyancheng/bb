Viz:
 Orochimaru's Return) is chapter 593 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Despite
Suigetsu
's vehement and somewhat manic opposition to reviving
Orochimaru
 plying
Sasuke
 with several different reasons not to proceed, Sasuke is resigned to his decision. Moving to execute Sasuke's orders,
Jūgo
 retrieves some of
Kabuto
's DNA using his
Sage Transformation
 abilities, much to Suigetsu's disgust. After Jūgo places the DNA on
Anko
's
Cursed Seal of Heaven
, Sasuke uses the
Evil Releasing Method
 to revive Orochimaru using the remnants of his life force left within Anko. Retreating behind Kabuto as Orochimaru emerges, Suigetsu sheepishly greets his former captor, who notes that he was abreast of the situation having been able to observe everything from within Anko, further shocking them when he tells them he has no interest in the war that was currently going on. And instead, still had his sights set on Sasuke's body, but was unable to
steal
 it in his current state. Showing him the
scroll
 he was given, Sasuke tells Orochimaru that he wanted to hear everything from its source, leading Orochimaru to question him about whether or not he had wavered from his path of revenge, to which Sasuke denies. Moving over to the immobile Kabuto — which prompts Suigetsu to run to the other side of the cave — Orochimaru drains Kabuto of his chakra, causing Kabuto to revert to his pre-implantation of Orochimaru's DNA appearance. Noting to himself that Sasuke had changed since he last saw him, Orochimaru beckons him to follow him and tells him that they were going somewhere he himself knew well.
