Rivals, Gather!

) is episode 56 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Hinata
 and
Himawari
 wish
Boruto
 good luck on the exams.
Sarada
 and
Mitsuki
 pick him up. They meet up with other genin who will take the exam by the gates.
Team Moegi
 comments on Boruto's changed attitude to the exams.
Sumire
 and
Denki
 go through information from other villages' genin.
Shikamaru
 speaks at the opening ceremony. Before the first exam, some of the genin go eat.
Yurui
 and his team try to push Boruto and Sarada out of their booth, because Mitsuki isn't with them. Even after Mitsuki arrives, tension arises between them, but they're stopped by
Shinki
. At the first exam venue,
Chōjūrō
 greets Boruto, thanking him again for his help last time they met, and relaying a message from
Kagura
.
Kurotsuchi
,
Darui
, and
Kankurō
 talk about the genin.

Sai
 announces the first exam is a true or false quiz, to everyone's surprise. The question will be delivered in another venue, where the genin must arrive within a time limit, avoiding traps on the way. Though Sai is still speaking, the genin notice his stopwatch is already running, and leave.
Tenten
 oversees the traps along the way.
Team Konohamaru
 goes through the traps without issue. Tenten ups the difficulty, activating sentry puppets.
Team Shinki
 takes special care not to reveal their jutsu to other genin while dealing with them. Yurui simply binds them with his bubblegum. At the venue, those who made it in time are given the true or false question, about the fifth volume of a shinobi handbook. Sai says those who fail will be out, and instructs the genin to stand on the platform that corresponds to the answer they think is correct. Sarada is familiar with them, but had no idea there was a fifth volume. Both groups fall into a pit, and those who manage to not get covered in ink advance to the next stage. A Konohagakure shinobi observes Boruto and reports to someone. Shikamaru informs
Naruto
 that Boruto passed to the next stage, and suggests Naruto speak with Boruto. Naruto sends him an email. Boruto reads it, and vows to impress him in the next stage.

Trivia

The appearance of four
Kumogakure
 genin that competed in the Chūnin Exams were heavily based off
Shinko Inari
 and
Kakashi Hatake
's initial
genin
 team.
