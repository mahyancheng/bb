This technique is a more advanced version of the
Earth Release: Light-Weight Rock Technique
, in which the user drastically decreases the weight of their target, but to a much greater extent than that of the original ability. The user can use this technique to lift enormous objects that they normally wouldn't be able to such as a
meteorite
 or an
island
.
