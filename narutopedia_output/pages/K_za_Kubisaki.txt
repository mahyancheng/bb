Kōza Kubisaki
 (
首崎剛佐
,
Kubisaki Kōza
) was the leader of the
Land of Neck
.

Background

50 years prior to the start of the series, Kōza and his army were surrounded by an enemy army, where a majority of his soldiers were killed mercilessly. As only a few remained Kōza grudgingly admitted he would die by nightfall, but summoned
Shiromari
 as a last resort, with the intent of wiping out his enemies in the process. However, Kōza died before he could undo the summon, thus leaving Shiromari to take the form of the destroyed castle and devouring any passerby who approaches.

Appearance

Kōza wore basic
samurai
 armour including a tall helmet and a
sword
 sheathed at the waist. He had grey-brown hair and a moustache. He also had light grey-coloured eyes.

Abilities

Kōza was able to use the
summoning technique
. His summon was
Shiromari
, a giant chameleon, which could take almost any form to lure enemies inside it. Since he had a sword, he was presumably skilled in
kenjutsu
.

Part I

Lady Daimyō Search Mission

As Kōza died before he could undo the summon, Shiromari continued to devour anyone who enters what appears to be a castle, which attracted the attention of
Konohagakure
. When
Naruto Uzumaki
,
Hinata Hyūga
 and
Kiba Inuzuka
 visited the castle in a mission to investigate recent disappearances, Kōza returned in a soul form to guide them to the summoning contract, so they could release Shiromari from its castle form.
