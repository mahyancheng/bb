Trivia

A
ri
 (
里
) is an old unit of distance. It used to be about half a kilometre — and still is in China, where it is called a lǐ — but elongated over time until it was fixed on 3927.27 metres during the Meiji period (1868–1912). A thousand ri is used as a general measurement for a very long distance. Ten thousand ri would be a step beyond even that. There is a well-known saying by the famous Chinese philosopher
Lǎozǐ
 that goes, "a journey of a thousand lǐ begins with a single step" (
千里之行，始于足下
,
Qiān lǐ zhī xíng, shǐ yú zú xià
).
