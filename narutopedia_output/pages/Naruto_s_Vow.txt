"
Naruto's Vow
" (
ナルトの誓い
,
Naruto no Chikai
) is episode 242 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

While on his way to meet messengers from
Iwagakure
,
Chōjūrō
 decides to  go on ahead by himself, due to the slow progress in travelling and the knowledge that
Ganryū
 is out for vengeance. Naruto and his group stop at one of the smaller
islands
 off the coast of the Land of Water for restocking before going straight to the
Land of Lightning
; Naruto sets off to eat some ramen.
Akatsuchi
 is sent by the
Tsuchikage
 to the same isolated island in the
Land of Water
 to rendezvous with Chōjūrō, and
Kurotsuchi
 tags along.

As they await, they ar e attacked by a group of
Kirigakure
 ninja, led by Ganryū. Battle ensues and Akatsuchi is injured, although
Naruto
 and Chōjūrō interfere and stop the battle. Chōjūrō demands Ganryū and
his team
 to withdraw, stating that they are violating the
Mizukage
's will. The team leaves, and Kurotsuchi argues with Chōjūro to tend Akatsuchi's injuries, who says they need to wait for a
medical-nin
. Chōjūrō explains those were ninja who oppose the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, Ganryū being the sole survivor of the
Tragedy of Yosuga Pass
. Kurotsuchi heads out to kill Ganryū before he can kill her. Naruto however, stops Kurotsuchi from fatally injuring Ganryū, telling Ganryū that it will just create a cycle of hatred. Kurotsuchi attempts to slash Ganryū using her sword, but Naruto blocks it with his body. Ganryū agrees to let Naruto fulfil the peace. Chōjūro arrives with other Kiri ninja, telling Ganryū to surrender, which he does. Chōjūro informs him that the Iwa messenger was sent by the Tsuchikage himself, to formally apologise for the Tragedy of Yogusa Pass, and return a personal belonging of one of
Ganryū's teammates
 who was killed in it. Chōjūro tells the others that Ganryū won't be sentenced for execution. Akatsuchi then tells Kurotsuchi that Kiri will just owe Iwa a favour in the future to come.

Delighted that the Iwa-Kiri grudge has come to an end, Naruto leaves in a hurry, without introducing himself to the others. Once arriving with
Yamato
 and the others, they await for a new ship to take them to the
island
 in the Land of Lightning.

Trivia

The
flak jackets
 worn by
Team Ganryū
 and
Ganryū
's fellow assasins (with the exception of
Kiri
) are erroneously depicted like Iwagakure flak jackets with the exception of their colour and some even came with neck guards.

Ganryū also wears a white forehead protector cloth; usually only seen on
Kumogakure
 shinobi.
