Synopsis

As the
Three Sand Siblings
 are introduced,
Gaara
 scolds
Kankurō
 for his abuse of the kids. Gaara then apologises to
Sasuke
 for Kankurō's behaviour. The three are ninja from
Sunagakure
 and they come here in
Konoha
 for the
Chūnin Exams
.
Another team
 watches unseen from a tree nearby. The
Third Hokage
 asks
Kakashi
,
Asuma
 and
Kurenai
 to step forward and recommend any
Genin
 they believe to be fit to take the Chūnin Exams.
Iruka
 thinks that the rookies need more time, and that there is no way that any of them will be recommended. However, all three jōnin recommend their students which shocks Iruka greatly. Iruka challenges their decision, as he believes
Naruto
 and the others are not ready for the exam. They however stand by their decision and the Hokage agrees, but only after Kakashi reminds Iruka they are no longer his students, but ninja under his command. The next morning Kakashi gives
Team 7
 the application forms for the Chūnin Exams. Both Sasuke and Naruto accept, but
Sakura
 is uncertain. Later, all three of Team 7 are attacked by a mysterious ninja from a different village.
Moegi
 is captured by a mysterious ninja, and is seen tied up and gagged with a cloth. Naruto eventually saves her, but the mysterious ninja escapes. Sakura is taken in by his genjutsu but quickly figures it out. Despite this she is still uncertain about the exam. Sasuke easily defeats the ninja, telling him to stay out of
Konohagakure
. The ninja is revealed to be Iruka in disguise. He reports back to Kakashi, confirming they all passed his test. Inside the school registration for the exam is taking place, but
two

shinobi
 bar the way warning all the genin about the exam. An altercation nearly takes place but
Rock Lee
 steps in and diffuses the situation, which surprises Sasuke. Rock Lee later goes after Sasuke and challenges him to a duel.

Trivia

Iruka testing the members of Team 7 is unique to the anime.

When the two trainers were talking at the end of the episode, the students could be seen through the doors, but when they transformed back into their regular forms, the students were gone.
