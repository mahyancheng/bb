Reincarnation ninjutsu
 (
転生忍術

Tensei Ninjutsu

literally meaning:
 Life Transfer Ninja Techniques" or "Reincarnation Ninja Techniques) are techniques that usually require or accomplish the transfer of life force between people. These techniques are generally classified as
kinjutsu
 because the restoration of one life typically requires the sacrifice of the life of another, or that it violates the laws of nature and morality.
