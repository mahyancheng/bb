E-rank
 (
Eランク
,
Ī ranku
) is one of the six classifications. It is followed by
D-rank
. It is used exclusively when classifying
techniques
 intended for
Academy Students
. A number of E-rank techniques must be learned before
ninja
 can graduate, and are only difficult in the sense that students may not have learned how to properly control their
chakra
. With time, E-rank techniques like the
Body Replacement Technique
 become second nature for seasoned ninja.

Trivia

E-rank is the only rank not used for ranking
missions
 or
missing-nin
