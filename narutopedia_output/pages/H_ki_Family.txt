The
Hōki Family
 (
ホウキ族
,
Hōki-zoku
) is a
matrilineal
 shinobi clan (and family) of
medical-nin
 and information gatherers from
Sunagakure
, who originated in and moved down to the village of
Konohagakure
.
 The members of the family are also called "people who work behind the scenes" and, until the events of
Gaara Hiden
, were never placed in the centre of Sunagakure's government. The women of the family don't show their faces without make-up to any man, with the exception of the one they're going to marry.
