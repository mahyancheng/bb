The
Morning Peacock
 is a certain-kill taijutsu born from the philosophy of Might Guy. The principle of this taijutsu is to rapidly increase the body's abilities by opening up to and including the sixth of the
Eight Gates
, and then to strike the enemy down with countless punches.

Usage

The technique is started by kicking the enemy into the air, which for most would be an instant kill. The user then jumps into the air in a  distinctive stance and begins punching the enemy repeatedly. The punches are so fast, they are set ablaze by sheer speed and friction which in turn creates a peacock-like fan of flames around the opponent. Once the attack is finished, the enemy will be sent crashing back to the ground, covered with the attack's aura. The fire produced is strong enough to burn through

Trivia

In
Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles
,
Rock Lee
 used his version of this move called
Morning Gorilla
 (
朝ゴリラ
,
Asa Gorira
). In the anime, Lee used his different version of this move called
Morning Chicken
 (

Asa Niwatori

This move can also be performed without the initial kick.

Should the opponent be out of range or too vast in numbers, it may also be used from a distance.

While listed only as a short-range punch in the Sha no Sho, the flames produced can spread to a longer distance.
