Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Boruto
 finds his classmates are generally concerned with upcoming graduation exams, leaving them no time to hang out. Boruto finds
Shikadai
,
Inojin
, and
Chōchō
, who are exhausted from training. He tries starting a conversation, but the three just discuss their training.
Mitsuki
 wonders why Boruto is acting like that, and points out a thinner
Gongorō Kamakura
, Kagemasa's actor, on the tv, speaking about eating a famous carp, so good it's said one never forgets its taste. Boruto proposes they eat it as well. Boruto invites other classmates. Shikadai asks Boruto about his commitment over camping for the carp, something he'd usually find tedious. Boruto confides that he wants them all to do something together before going their separate ways after graduation.
 At home,
Sakura
 notices
Sarada
's lack of excitement over going camping, and her complaints about Boruto remind her, to her recalled amusement, of her own complaints about
Naruto
 during their
Academy
 days. Sarada finds the idea of treating the Hokage like that unimaginable, but her mom points out that to her, he's always just been Naruto. While they weren't close at the Academy, he's now a dear friend that's closer than family. She doesn't know if friendship is forever, but the friends she made then are still her friends today.

Boruto and his classmates set up at the camping site. They go fishing for the carp, but fail to catch anything. One of the caretakers says the rains have caused the carps to hide in the rocks, making them that much harder to catch. Boruto almost fishes one, but reels in too hard, causing the line to break. At night, they eat curry. Boruto goes fishing again, Sarada and
Sumire
 follow him. Boruto and Sarada end up arguing. Sumire finds it amusing, and thanks Boruto for helping her change. The carp catches on Boruto's line, and starts pulling him in. Sarada helps Boruto pull the carp, and Sumire summons
Nue
, using its chakra to strengthen the line so it won't break. Their classmates arrive, each using their ninjutsu to help reel the carp in. They all eat the carp, and Sumire points out the starry sky above them. On the moon,
Toneri
 struggles to smooth over spacetime distortions.
