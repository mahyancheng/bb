Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Killer B
 develops a
chakra shroud
 that he attacks
Taka
 with. Although they are able to dodge,
Sasuke
 realises that they will not be able to do so indefinitely. He uses his
Mangekyō Sharingan
 to catch B in a
genjutsu
 and, believing he has won, lets down his guard. The
Eight-Tails
 releases B from the illusion, so he attacks and fatally injures Sasuke. While
Jūgo
 heals him, B fully transforms into the Eight-Tails.
