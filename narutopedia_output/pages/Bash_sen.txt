The
Bashōsen
 (
芭蕉扇
,
literally meaning:
 Banana Palm Fan) is a large fan that is able to generate all five of the basic
elemental chakra natures
. To do so, the user need only say a mental command, which produces substantial amounts of the desired element when the fan is waved. In the anime, the fan could also be used as a shield and was able to defend Kinkaku against Darui's
Storm Release: Laser Circus
.

The Bashōsen is revered as one of the
treasured tools
 of the
Sage of Six Paths
. All five of the tools consume enormous amounts of
chakra
 when used, so much so that normal humans would die after using the tools for only a short period of time. When the tools later came into the possession of
Kumogakure
, only the
Gold and Silver Brothers
 had the large chakra reserves necessary to constantly wield the treasures without fatal repercussions. While not in use,
Kinkaku
 had the fan stored within his own body, drawing it from his mouth when needed.

Kinkaku still possessed the Bashōsen when
reincarnated
 by
Kabuto Yakushi
, but dropped it during
battle
 against
Darui
. After Kinkaku was sealed away,
Tenten
 found the Bashōsen,
 and used it in battle at least once — destroying
Kakuzu
's
lightning-element mask
 — before collapsing due to its high chakra absorption.

After the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Tenten placed the
Benihisago
, the
Kōkinjō
 and the Bashōsen on display in her weapons shop.

Trivia

Both Ginkaku and Kinkaku's hair is styled in a manner similar to that of the appearance of the fan.

The Bashōsen is based on a tool from the Chinese classic "
Journey to the West
". In the story, there are two demon king brothers, known as the Great King Kinkaku (
金角大王
,
Kinkaku-daiō
) and the Great King Ginkaku (
銀角大王
,
Ginkaku-daiō
). The siblings possess five treasured tools, one of which is called the Banana Palm Fan (
芭蕉扇
). It is normally hidden underneath the tongue of Ginkaku's wife.

The Bashōsen is the only one of the Five Treasured Tools that it is not involved in any sealing technique process.

On the
cover
 of
volume 7
,
Sasuke
 is seen holding a fan that faintly resembles this one.
