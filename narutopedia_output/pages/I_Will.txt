 manga.

Summary

The pain from the application of the
cursed seal
 causes
Sasuke
 to lose consciousness. With
Naruto
 similarly incapacitated,
Sakura
 wonders what she is supposed to do. Elsewhere,
Anko
 travels through the
Forest of Death
 and locates
Orochimaru
. She attacks him and tries to kill him by sacrificing her own life, but stops at the last moment when she realises she was not attacking the real Orochimaru. He advises against so innocently using the techniques he taught her and tells her of his interest in Sasuke. He warns her against ending the exams prematurely before leaving, saying that to do so would not be in
Konoha
's best interests.

Trivia

literally meaning:
 Always a life of love).

Konohanasakuya-hime
