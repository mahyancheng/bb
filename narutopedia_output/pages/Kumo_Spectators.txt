Sekiei and Mikage were spectators from
Kumogakure
 who were watching the final rounds of the
Chūnin Exams
. When  the
Konoha Crush
 by
Suna
 and
Oto
 began, they took the opportunity to kidnap
Hinata Hyūga
 for her
Byakugan
. The
Hyūga Elder
 tried to save her but they escaped before he was able to get to them. He was later knocked unconscious by an Otogakure ninja.
Neji Hyūga
,
Tenten
, and
Kiba Inuzuka
 trailed the two ninja outside the village limits and Kiba rescued Hinata after she
struck
 the short spectator. Neji, disguised as Kiba, had the Kumo ninja following him with a decoy Hinata while Kiba took Hinata to safety. After defeating the
first ninja
, Neji fights against
Sekiei
 but struggles against his
Earth Release
 technique that had bound both his hands and feet. Neji was saved by
Hiashi Hyūga
 who subsequently defeats the ninja with the
Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm
 technique. After their defeat, they were captured and questioned.
