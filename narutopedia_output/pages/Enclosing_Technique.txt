Using this technique, a wide variety of objects and even living things can be stored within
scrolls
, and can be released when the scroll is opened or meets a specific condition. It is possible to seal
ninjutsu
 into a scroll, as demonstrated by
Kisame Hoshigaki
, who placed sharks into his
Water Prison Technique
 that he sealed into a scroll, which would activate and imprison anyone that tried to read the scroll upon opening it.





Tenten's unique usage of the technique.



To save chakra, instead of sealing a nature element into a scroll that was created through chakra, one could just use pre-existing nature elements, like water from an ocean, and seal it within the scroll. Though a scroll is the most common use of sealing something, as demonstrated by
Ajisai
 in the anime, this technique can be used to seal things into a small sheet of paper too.

Trivia

This technique is fundamental to the creation of ammunition for the
Shinobi Gauntlet
.
