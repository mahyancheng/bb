Indra, Madara and Sasuke enter their completed Susanoo states. Sasuke
traps the opponent in a giant meteorite
, but Madara tries one-upping him by
summoning a larger meteorite
 above Sasuke's technique to crash into it, declaring that he alone is sufficient for the job. He is interrupted when Indra
shatters both meteorites with a lightning bolt
, and retorts that both of their jutsu are the same to him. Refusing to be outdone, Sasuke flies into the air and calls them both pathetic before calling a
Kirin
 coated in
black flames
 down upon the battlefield, finishing the opponent in a huge explosion.
