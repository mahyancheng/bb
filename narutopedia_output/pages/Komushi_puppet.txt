This article is about Sasori's human puppet. For the Sunagakure shinobi, see
Komushi
.

Komushi
 (
コムシ
,
Komushi
) is the first known
human puppet
 created by
Sasori
, while he was still an active
Sunagakure
 shinobi. The puppet was made out of the corpse of Sasori's only friend,
Komushi
, after his death. While Komushi's death was ruled accidental, it was suspected that Sasori was responsible for his death in order to use him as a human puppet prototype.

Weapons

Being a human puppet, it is highly likely that this puppet retains his
chakra
 and any abilities he possessed when he was alive.

The puppet's left arm could extend a hidden poisoned blade from the palm to strike at the enemy with a quick stab. It likely maintained the same mechanism and
poison
 in its right arm from when he was alive.

Since Komushi's right arm and part of his chest were shown discoloured from accidentally poisoning himself, it is likely the corresponding areas on the puppet also have poison.
