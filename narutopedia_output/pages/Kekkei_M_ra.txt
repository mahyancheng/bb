Kaguya using her kekkei mōra.



Kekkei Mōra
 (
血継網羅
,
literally meaning:
 Bloodline Encompassing) is an advanced branch of jutsu unique to
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 and her direct bloodline.
 All of Kaguya's techniques were classified as kekkei mōra; beyond these examples, what exactly classifies a kekkei mōra is unknown. What can be determined, however, is that it does not strictly follow the same guidelines as a
kekkei genkai
 or
kekkei tōta
, for instance: only Kaguya's
Byakugan
 and Hagoromo's
Rinnegan
 are classified as a kekkei mōra, while all others are kekkei genkai.

Given that they are closely linked to the
Ōtsutsuki Clan
 and those who obtain the powers of a
God Tree
, the term
mōra
 (
網羅
) may refer to its traditional meaning of "gathering" or "harvesting", referring to powers acquired by harvesting and consuming a chakra fruit, which is a concentrated mass of all the life energy and genetic information of an entire world.

List of Kekkei Mōra

All-Killing Ash Bones

Main article:
All-Killing Ash Bones

A certain-kill technique, the user hardens their own bones and protrudes them out of the skin, and then fires these weaponised structures from their back or from their palms at the intended target. When these bones pierce a living organism, the bone and target starts to deteriorate at a molecular level, disintegrating the victim and reducing their bodies to nothing more than a pile of ash.

Using her
Rinne Sharingan
,
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 replaces the world around her with one of her
personal dimensions
; everyone near Kaguya at the time will experience the same change of place.
 Unlike most
space–time ninjutsu
, where users move themselves to a destination, Kaguya moves the destination to herself.
 To relocate such large dimensions requires an immense amount of
chakra
, so much so that only Kaguya is able to do so.

Rinnegan
.

Eighty Gods Vacuum Attack

Main article:
Eighty Gods Vacuum Attack

Using her mastery of
chakra
, Kaguya gathers it in her palms and can then manifest it around her arms to enhance her attacks
 or into a sequence of countless fists in the air. This technique can be used both offensively and defensively. Combined with her
Byakugan
, this ability has the potential to wreak havoc on the battlefield and is considered the strongest offensive ability.  Not only was it strong enough to cause massive shock-waves upon impact, but even destroy a
Six Paths Chakra

Complete Body — Susanoo
 easily. The speed of this attack leaves no room for her target to escape.

God: Nativity of a World of Trees

Main article:
God: Nativity of a World of Trees

God: Nativity of a World of Trees
 is a technique used to manipulate the roots of the
God Tree
, spreading them around the entire world to encase those caught within the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 in the roots' bark. By ensnaring all living beings and connecting them to the tree, similar to cocoons, this will keep their now-slumbering bodies alive so long as they remain attached, while sapping their chakra. At the same time, this assimilates every victim to the God Tree, regathering the
chakra
 into one location, in order to sprout a new
fruit
. It is one of the Jutsu with the greatest expansive power, spreading throughout the planet.

Infinite Tsukuyomi

Main article:
Infinite Tsukuyomi

The
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 is an extremely powerful
genjutsu
 that traps the entire world in an illusion, enslaving the human and animal populations in a dream so that their
chakra
 may be
drawn
 upon by the
God Tree
.

 (
輪廻写輪眼
,
literally meaning:
 Saṃsāra Copy Wheel Eye) is a dōjutsu
kekkei mōra
 and the predecessor to the

 and

. It is characterised by red sclerae and irides, with a ripple pattern spreading over the eyeball and nine
tomoe
.

Rinnegan

Main article:
Rinnegan

The
Rinnegan
 (
輪廻眼
,
literally meaning:
 Saṃsāra Eye) is reputed as the most exalted eye amongst the "Three Great Dōjutsu",
 the others being the
Sharingan
 and the
Byakugan
. It is said that in times of disorder, one who wields the Rinnegan is sent down from the heavens to become either a "God of Creation" who will calm the world or a "God of Destruction" who will reduce everything to nothingness. The Rinnegan is characterised by concentric circles covering the eyeball.

Yomotsu Hirasaka

Main article:
Yomotsu Hirasaka

Yomotsu Hirasaka
 is a kekkei mōra technique used by members of the
Ōtsutsuki clan
, which is said to be the progenitor of all
space–time ninjutsu
.
 The user is able to open rifts in the fabric of space that allow them to instantaneously transport themselves to another location. The openings can be used to connect two different spatial locations within the same dimension, or to create a pathway that links two dimensions together.

Trivia

Due to the techniques used by Kaguya predating the invention of ninjutsu and not requiring hand seals to be executed, it is possible that her Kekkei Mōra derive from (or fall under)
shinjutsu
.
