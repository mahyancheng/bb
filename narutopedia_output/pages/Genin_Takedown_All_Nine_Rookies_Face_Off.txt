"
Genin Takedown! All Nine Rookies Face Off!
" (
蹴散らせライバル!新人9人全員集合
,
Kechirase Raibaru! Rūkī Nain Zenin Shūgō
) is episode 23 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Kakashi
 meets up with
Team 7
 before they enter the hall of the
Chūnin Exams
. He informs them that unless they had all consented to take the exams, none of them would have been permitted to enter. With that, he wishes them good luck. Within the hall, the
Rookie Nine
 meet up and have a spirited discussion.
Kabuto Yakushi
 warns them to quiet down as they are seemingly irritating the
shinobi
 around them. Explaining the exams further, Kabuto uses his
Ninja Info Cards
 to give
Sasuke
 information on
Gaara
 and
Rock Lee
. Kabuto says that the individuals taking the exams are all most likely elites from their respective villages, a fact that intimidates the rookies. With his standard enthusiasm,
Naruto
 loudly proclaims that he won't lose to anyone, and the rest of the room reacts to his words with equal parts shock and annoyance. Insulted by Kabuto's earlier detailing of the villages in which he discarded
Otogakure
 as a minor village,
three Oto-nin
 attack Kabuto. Although it appears that Kabuto dodged the attack, his glasses suddenly break and he becomes nauseated despite not being hit. Before things can escalate any further, the proctor,
Ibiki Morino
, and his team appear on the scene. With that, the Chūnin Exams begin.

Trivia

Despite the villages of
Kumogakure
 and
Kirigakure
 having no
genin
 participate, several candidates are shown wearing
forehead protectors
 from these villages. These are shown when
Neji
 is talking with Lee about Naruto (the far middle-left) and when
Sakura
 is strangling Naruto.

When Dosu is attacking Kabuto, the sound effect that was used would be introduced later in the series as the sound the
Rasengan
 makes.
