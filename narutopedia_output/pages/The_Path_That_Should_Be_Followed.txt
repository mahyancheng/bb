Summary

Because they needed another scroll, and because
Kabuto
 was alone,
Sasuke
 believes that defeating him would be their best chance to finish the second phase. Since Sasuke paid him a courtesy by explaining this instead of outright attacking him, Kabuto offers an alternative. He explains that other teams that are just now finishing are heading for the building in the centre of the
Forest of Death
 with a false sense of security and tired after four days in the forest. Thus, if
Sasuke and his team
 waits near the building, they may be able to take a scroll from one of the opposing teams. Kabuto then accompanies them to the building but finds that they are trapped in a
genjutsu
, victims of another team with the same idea.
