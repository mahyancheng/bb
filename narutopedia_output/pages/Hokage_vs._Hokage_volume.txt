Hokage vs. Hokage!!
 (
火影vs火影!!
,
Hokage Bāsasu Hokage!!
) is volume 14 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 118

"
Confinement…!!
" (
足止め…!!
,
Ashidome…!!
)

To share the thrill of getting to fight one's former masters,
Orochimaru
 summons the
First Hokage
 and the
Second Hokage
 for
Sarutobi
's benefit. Meanwhile,
Sakura
 informs
Naruto
 and
Shikamaru
 of the mission given to them by
Kakashi
.
Pakkun
 alerts them to the fact that they are being followed by nine
Otogakure
 ninja. Naruto suggests ambushing them, but Shikamaru states that this would waste too much time and that it would make no difference since they are all under-qualified to neutralise the ninja. Shikamaru volunteers to stay behind and buy time for Naruto and Sakura to catch up to
Sasuke
. The Oto ninja pick up on his trail, but it does not stop them from getting trapped by his shadow technique.

Chapter 119

"
My Life…!!
" (
オレの人生…!!
,
Ore no Jinsei…!!
)

Shikamaru
 quickly realises that he does not have enough chakra to immobilise eight
Otogakure
 ninja. What's more, he realises that he has missed one of the group, and hypothesises that the ninth had been keeping his distance from the others in case of an ambush. He attacks the eight to confirm his suspicions, and the ninth protects them. Although he now knows the ninth's location, Shikamaru lacks the energy to capture him too. Accepting that he will die, Shikamaru waits until he can no longer contain the eight ninja. Once they are free, however,
Asuma
 appears with the ninth in tow and kills the remaining eight, thanking Shikamaru for lasting so long. Meanwhile,
Orochimaru
 robs the
First Hokage
 and the
Second Hokage
 of their free will so that their memories will not get in the way of fighting
Sarutobi
.

Chapter 120

"
Hokage vs. Hokage!!
" (
火影vs火影!!
,
Hokage Bāsasu Hokage!!
)

Sarutobi
 attacks with a
fire
 technique, which the
Second Hokage
 neutralises with a
water
 technique. The
First Hokage
 follows with one of his signature
Wood Release
 techniques, immobilising Sarutobi. Sarutobi summons
Enma
 and has him transform into a staff to release him. Sarutobi attacks
Orochimaru
 with Enma, and Orochimaru parries with his
Kusanagi
. In the midst of his attacks Sarutobi plants
explosive tags
 on the First and Second. Although it removes their legs, the damage regenerates, a side-effect of the technique used to reincarnate them. Seeing that a normal fight will accomplish nothing and that he is already tiring, Sarutobi prepares for his death.

Chapter 121

"
The Horrible Experiment…!!
" (
恐るべき実験…!!
,
Osorubeki Jikken…!!
)

Just as
Hiruzen
 is about to perform his last technique,
Orochimaru
 removes his face, revealing that of a young woman underneath. Realising that Orochimaru has learned how to switch to others' bodies as a form of immortality, Sarutobi thinks back on how Orochimaru came to be expelled from
Konoha
; how he had caught Orochimaru experimenting on his fellow Konoha ninja in order to achieve immortality. With Orochimaru finally having proven successful, and already knowing of his interest in
Sasuke
, the
Hokage
 states that Orochimaru's true intentions for this
Konoha Crush
 are to gain the
Sharingan
.

Chapter 122

"
The Inherited Will!!
" (
受け継がれゆく意志!!
,
Uketsugare Yuku Ishi!!
)

Orochimaru
 restores his original face so that
Hiruzen
 can continue to fight his former protege. The
First Hokage
 and the
Second Hokage
 attack again, and Sarutobi once more reflects on the last time he saw Orochimaru. After being caught committing an unforgivable crime, Orochimaru gave Hiruzen the chance to kill him but he hesitated and Orochimaru fled, allowing him to at long last carry out his dream of achieving "greatness". Hoping to repent for this mistake, Hiruzen creates two
shadow clones
 and then performs the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
.

Chapter 123

"
The Final Seal
" (
最後の封印
,
Saigo no Fūin
)

The
First Hokage
 and the
Second Hokage
 attack
Sarutobi
's
shadow clones
, but the clones still manage to catch each of the former Hokage. The
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
 grabs the Hokage's souls, breaking all of the jutsu in play and allowing them a brief return to their senses. Sarutobi apologises to both for what he is about to do and then seals away their souls with the move also revealing the dead bodies of
Kin Tsuchi
 and
Zaku Abumi
, both of whom were used as sacrifices to summon the two Hokage. Angry that
Orochimaru
 could make such casual use of others' lives, the real Sarutobi tries to do the same to him. Sensing what is happening, Orochimaru summons his
Kusanagi
 back to him, which
Enma
 tries to stop.

Chapter 124

"
An Eternal Battle…!!
" (
永遠なる闘い…!!
,
Eiennaru Tatakai…!!
)

Despite
Enma
's efforts,
Sarutobi
 is stabbed in the back by
Orochimaru
's
Kusanagi
. Orochimaru assures him that he will now die, but Sarutobi is unconcerned, his death guaranteed because of the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
. Sarutobi explains the nature of the seal, how it defeated the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
, and then struggles to find the strength to complete the sealing of Orochimaru's soul. Meanwhile,
Jiraiya
 finally takes part in
Konoha
's defence, stopping the
snakes
 rampaging through the village. Elsewhere,
Sasuke
 catches up to the
Three Sand Siblings
.
Kankurō
 volunteers to fight Sasuke to give
Gaara
 a chance to escape, but
Shino
 appears and volunteers to fight Kankurō to give Sasuke a chance to catch up to Gaara again.

Chapter 125

"
The Time of Awakening…!!
" (
目覚めの時…!!
,
Mezame no Toki…!!
)

Sasuke
 reluctantly agrees to let
Shino
 deal with
Kankurō
. Shino prepares his
kikaichū
 while Kankurō prepares his
Karasu
.
Gaara
, sensing that Sasuke is near, sends
Temari
 away so that they can face each other, the monster within him craving Sasuke's blood. Having dreamt of fulfilling this lust for the past month, Gaara begins the transformation that he initiated during the
Chūnin Exams
.

Chapter 126

"
Negligence…!!
" (
油断…!!
,
Yudan…!!
)

Kankurō
 attacks
Shino
 with
Karasu
, but Shino avoids the attack thanks to his
kikaichū
. Karasu follows up with a poisonous gas attack. Shino just barely evades it, but in doing so walks into another attack. Meanwhile,
Sarutobi
 continues to struggle to remove
Orochimaru
's soul. At the same time his likeness on the
Hokage Rock
 cracks, worrying the ninja who see it. Shino is able to swarm Karasu with kikaichū but Kankurō still manages to get off another attack. The attack falls short, Shino having finally managed to guide his kikaichū to Kankurō's location. The kikaichū consume Kankurō's
chakra
 and Shino passes out from the gas he earlier inhaled, trusting the rest of the battle to Sasuke.

Author's Note

“

Thanks to everyone's support,
Naruto
 has finally become an animated series!
I wrote in the first manga volume, "The first time I won an award... I was so happy" And when my first comic book was published, I was 10 times happier still.
But the anime makes me 100 times happier! So please watch the
Naruto
 anime
and
 keep reading the manga.
Oh! But I guess I'm happy is knowing that people are still enjoying
Naruto
. Yup, that's it!
