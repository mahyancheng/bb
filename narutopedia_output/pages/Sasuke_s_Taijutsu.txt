Sasuke no Taijutsu…!!
) is chapter 112 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Kakashi
 explains that, having seen
Lee
's fighting style before with his
Sharingan
,
Sasuke
 has been training this last month to reproduce his speed. Lee knows from prior experience that speed is not enough to defeat
Gaara
, but
Guy
 recognises that the speed must serve some other purpose. After he continues to be pummelled by Sasuke, Gaara retreats into a
Shield of Sand
, which he shaped into a sphere, to give himself time to prepare. Sasuke is unable to break through this defence with speed alone.
Naruto
, worried that Sasuke will be killed, races to the arena to try and stop the match. Kakashi promises that there was a good reason for why they were late.
