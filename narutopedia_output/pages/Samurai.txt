Samurai on guard in the Land of Iron.



Samurai
 (
侍
) are a military power similar to
shinobi
, though not nearly as widespread. In
Gaara Hiden
, samurai and shinobi are noted to have first diverged in how they received the teachings of
ninshū
: samurai were more spiritual and idealistic, while shinobi focused on using their
chakra
 to keep people's bonds alive. Only the
Land of Iron
 continues to use samurai, with all other countries having since opted to use shinobi.
 In the anime, the
Land of This
 consisted of former samurai, what
Tatewaki
 calls
rogue samurai
 (
浪人
,
rōnin
).

Appearance

Samurai usually wear heavy, segmented plate armour that covers the shoulders, chest, stomach and lower back (anime only),  upper back, lower sides, and thighs. They also wear gauntlets, shin guards, and helmets; senior officers adorn their helmets with horns.
 The face masks they wear have built-in radios and double as
respirators
 to combat
poison
 regularly used by shinobi. Samurai wield as many as four
swords
, the
scabbards
 of which are mounted directly onto their
faulds
.

Abilities

The
Third Tsuchikage
 claims that any shinobi would be foolish to challenge the samurai of the Land of Iron. All samurai are practised sword users, into which they
channel
 their chakra. This allows them to extend the reach of their swords, alter the
shape
 to appear as other weapons, and launch the chakra across distances as crescents of energy.
 Samurai are typically taught
Iaidō
 (
居合道
) to increase the speed at which they draw and sheath their swords, allowing them to attack before opposing shinobi can perform the
hand seals
 required to use
ninjutsu
.

Trivia

Earlier in the series,
Gatō
 had two samurai bodyguards,
Zōri
 and
Waraji
, in his employ.
 Whether they were originally from the Land of Iron, or were taught by another organisation, is unknown.

Kōza Kubisaki
 was dressed like a standard samurai (unlike those of the Land of Iron) during his final war against a faction that was about to decimate his castle.

In
Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow
,
Sandayū Asama
 led a group of 50 samurai to attack
Dotō Kazahana
.

Samurai traditionally use
katana
, but the standard-issue sword wielded by the samurai of the Land of Iron seem to be closer in size and appearance to
wakizashi
. However, certain samurai, such as Mifune, Tatewaki, Tsubaki and Sazanka, use standard length katana.

Kusarigama
 are seen in the samurai's armoury in the
Land of Iron
, despite the fact that Kusarigama are traditionally of ninja origin.

In
Shikamaru Hiden: A Cloud Drifting in Silent Darkness
, it is mentioned that the
Land of Silence
 is a formerly samurai-led country on a distant continent that was taken over by a shinobi named
Gengo
 before he was defeated by forces from Konoha and Sunagakure.
