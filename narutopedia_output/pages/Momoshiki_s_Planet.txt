The planet.



The
otherworld
 is a planet that resides in a different dimension than
Earth
, and as such is only accessible from there using
space–time ninjutsu
.
Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki
 had recently created a
God Tree
 there using
Gyūki
's
chakra
.
 Though the planet's air is breathable, the planet appears to have no native life forms: remnants of dead forests dot the otherwise barren landscape. Thick, red clouds surround the planet.
