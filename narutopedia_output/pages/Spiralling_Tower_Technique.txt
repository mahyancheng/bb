This technique is devised by
Kakashi Hatake
 as a way to reach 200 kilometres above
Konohagakure
. His original idea is to create an
Earth-Style Wall
 to reach that altitude, but he doesn't believe he would have enough
chakra
 to make it tall enough. For this reason he recruits
Yamato
 to assist him. They practice all night to synchronise Kakashi's
Earth Release
 with Yamato's
Wood Release
, finding a configuration that is structurally sound but that also will reach the intended elevation within the one hour they'll be allotted.

The Spiralling Tower originally works as intended, with Kakashi's earth pillar and Yamato's wood pillar entwining in order to fortify each other as they grow into the sky. But a rainstorm begins shortly after they start, forcing Kakashi to spend additional chakra to reinforce the earth pillar against the rain and wind. The task eventually becomes too much for him and he loses sync with Yamato, briefly halting the tower's growth and potentially risking its destruction.
Gaara
 and
Kurotsuchi
, whose assistance Kakashi requested the night before, arrive in time to assist, stabilising the tower that has been created so far and adding a
sand
 pillar from Gaara and a second earth pillar from Kurotsuchi to its continued entwining growth.

The Spiralling Tower ends up being a success, with the
three-man team
 that was ascending it reaching their destination in time. At the conclusion of the three's mission, an impact at the peak topples the tower and causes debris to start falling on Konoha. Gaara attempts to use his sand to shield the village, but he has no additional chakra to do so. A separate team of six ninja assembled specifically to deal with this potential debris begins to repel the initial chunks of the tower, but they are quickly overwhelmed. It is ultimately the
Seventh Hokage
 who destroys the majority of the debris, saving the village.
