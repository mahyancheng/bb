 anime.

Synopsis

Confronting
Kakuzu
 once more,
Ino Yamanaka
,
Shikamaru Nara
 and
Chōji Akimichi
 learn that
Dan Katō
 and
Asuma Sarutobi
 have been resurrected to fight on the side of the
Akatsuki
.
Izumo Kamizuki
 and
Kotetsu Hagane
 manage to sneak up behind Kakuzu and restrain him so that
Team Asuma
 can seal him, but he manages to escape.
Shikaku Nara
 orders the new generation of Ino-Shika-Chō to deal with Asuma while
Darui
 aids Izumo and Kotetsu in battling Kakuzu and despite Izumo's protest, claiming this to be too cruel, they eventually agree. Out of the three, Chōji is most hesitant at confronting his former teacher while Ino and Shikamaru realise that they are the only ones who can defeat their teacher because they knew him best. Asuma attempts to give advice to three shinobi on how to defeat him before involuntarily
burning
 them alive. When the smoke clears, he finds his three students standing opposite him. Shikamaru and Ino begin to fight in earnest but Chōji is tormented by the happy memories of his sensei, as well as his kind personality preventing him from attacking Asuma.
Tenten
 meanwhile uses the
Bashōsen
 which she found it and
destroys
 Kakuzu's lightning mask. As Ino and Shikamaru try to boost Chōji's will to fight to no avail, Asuma even calls Chōji "fatso" in an attempt to enrage him. Chōji, infuriated then prepares himself to punch Asuma.
