"
Impure World Reincarnation: Release!
" (
穢土転生・解
,
Edo Tensei: Kai
) is episode 340 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

All across the battlefields, the reincarnated
shinobi
 are being released from the
Impure World Reincarnation
 respectively — which leads
Tobi
 to note
Kabuto
's failure.
Naruto
 and
Killer B
 take the ascending souls of the previous
jinchūriki
 as a sign of
Itachi
's success. Meanwhile, the
Kage
 wonder what was happening, to which
Ōnoki
 notes that that without a doubt, someone has stopped the Impure World Reincarnation technique and whomever that did so, is a hero to the shinobi world. Elsewhere,
Dan
 uses his
Spirit Transformation Technique
 to take control of his then-ascending soul in order to fly to
Tsunade
's location.
 Speaking to Tsunade within her subconscious, Dan
gives
 her the remainder of his
chakra
 before fading away, thus restoring her
Strength of a Hundred Seal
. As Tsunade returns to the real world, she and the other Kage wonder why
Madara
's soul still remains intact — to which the latter reveals that he is capable of rescinding the summoning contract from the summoner. With that, Madara advises the Kage to tell the caster not to use
kinjutsu
 so carelessly. Back at Kabuto's cave,
Sasuke
 is found by his team-mates
Suigetsu
 and
Jūgo
. Naruto continues to mock Tobi and still persists in tearing off his mask, despite
Kakashi
 telling him not to. Angered by Naruto's mockery, Tobi then brings forth the
Benihisago
 and
Kohaku no Jōhei
, preparing to move forward with his
plan
.

Trivia

When
Kakuzu
's soul begins to ascend, his sclerae are white instead of red.

When Madara releases the Impure World Reincarnation technique, his right eye is depicted as having his
Sharingan
 activated.

After he rescinds the Impure World Reincarnation contract, Madara's appearance is depicted without the cracks on his face standard for reincarnated beings, therefore looking "alive".

When Sasuke questioned what are shinobi, he envisioned
Shikamaru
,
Chōji
,
Ino
, and
Kiba
 in their Part II appearances, despite never seeing them since leaving Konoha in Part I.
