The
Rinne Sharingan
 (
輪廻写輪眼
,
literally meaning:
 Saṃsāra Copy Wheel Eye) is a
dōjutsu

kekkei mōra
 and the predecessor to the
Rinnegan
 and
Sharingan
. It is characterised by red sclerae and irides, with a ripple pattern spreading over the eyeball and nine
tomoe
.

Background





Kaguya awakens the Rinne Sharingan.



This dōjutsu was first manifested by
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 as a third eye on her forehead after eating the chakra fruit of the
God Tree
. It was also possessed by the
Ten-Tails
, the result of Kaguya merging with the God Tree. According to the
stone tablet
 handed down in the
Uchiha clan
, when one who wields the power of
Rinne
 approaches the
moon
, the eye which can reflect off the moon and grant the
infinite dream
 will open. This was proven true when
Madara Uchiha
, as the Ten-Tails'
jinchūriki
, was able to manifest this dōjutsu in his own forehead after regaining both of his Rinnegan.
 As a result of
Black Zetsu
's actions, Madara's body then served as a vessel for the resurrected Kaguya, who retained the Rinne Sharingan.
 When
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Sasuke Uchiha
 later used the
Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei
 to seal Kaguya, her third eye was closed by a
horizontal eyelid
 with the appearance of a
sun
 and
moon
 under the effects of the technique.

Abilities

The Rinne Sharingan possesses the ocular power of the Sharingan,
 and can be used to cast the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
,
 an extremely powerful
genjutsu
 which can only be undone by the combination of the Rinnegan and the
chakra
 of the nine
tailed beasts
.
 Using this
dōjutsu
, Kaguya can
transport
 herself and those in her vicinity to a series of
alternate dimensions
.

Trivia

While the term "Rinne Sharingan" does not appear in the manga or anime, this dōjutsu is named as such in the
Fourth Databook
.

Sasuke referred to the Infinite Tsukuyomi as a genjutsu cast by the Rinnegan.

Some subjects that possess a ripple-pattern eye design with six
tomoe
 have been recognised by Sasuke to be in possession of Rinnegan. These subjects are Sasuke himself,

Kara's Ten-Tails
,
 and, in the anime,
Urashiki
. The Fourth Databook also states Sasuke possesses Rinnegan.

The kanji "Rin" (
輪
,
literally meaning:
 Wheel) is also used in Sharingan and Rinnegan, potentially linking the three terms etymologically.





The Ten-Tails' Rinne Sharingan depicted with six tomoe.



In the Ten-Tails' debut appearance as a silhouette, its eye was shown to contain nine tomoe.
 However, following its revival, the beast's eye was consistently depicted with only six tomoe.
 When the Ten-Tails entered its final form, the God Tree, its eye was shown to possess nine tomoe once more.

Despite not possessing the Rinne Sharingan himself,
Obito Uchiha
 attempted to cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi by
manifesting
 a construct of the God Tree outside of his body as the Ten-Tails'
jinchūriki
.

There have been a number of times the dōjutsu has been depicted incorrectly:

During the Ten-Tails' battle with
Hagoromo
 and
Hamura Ōtsutsuki
, its eye was depicted with at least four rows of tomoe.

After casting the Infinite Tsukuyomi, Madara's Rinne Sharingan was depicted with only six tomoe.

On various occasions, Kaguya's Rinne Sharingan was depicted with six or three tomoe.

The eye in the
crystal ball
 used to cast the
Limited Tsukuyomi
 contained seven tomoe, possibly reflecting the number of
tailed beasts
 captured by
Akatsuki
.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
 and
Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu
, Sasuke's Rinnegan is erroneously referred to as a Rinne Sharingan.
