"
Deadlock! Sannin Showdown!
" (
三すくみの戦い
,
San Sukumi no Tatakai
) is episode 96 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Katsuyu
 and
Gamabunta
 double-teamed
Manda
, although the latter was able to hold his own. Using her inhuman strength,
Tsunade
 was able to pin Manda down with the sword of Gamabunta, and delivered
a finishing blow
 to
Orochimaru
. Deciding to use
his last resort
 in order to regain the use of his arms, Orochimaru retreated with
Kabuto
, leaving Tsunade,
Jiraiya
,
Shizune
, and
Naruto
 to their own devices. Once Naruto recovered, and learned of Tsunade's acceptance of the
Hokage
 title, he remarked that she was undeserving of the job, due to the fact that the
Third Hokage
 had been better in every possible way. The two stepped outside the restaurant to have another fight, although this time Tsunade gave Naruto a gentle kiss on the forehead instead of a blow to the face. After lunch, the group set off for
Konoha
.
