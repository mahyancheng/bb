Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

The remaining members of the
Infiltration and Reconnaissance Party
 are pursued by the
Akatsuki
's
Surprise Attack and Diversion Platoon
, but are hampered by
Muta Aburame
's
Insect Jamming Technique
. Separated from his teammates, Muta instructs his
kikaichū
 to carry the intel they had on the Akatsuki to the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 headquarters. Meanwhile, the
Surprise Attack Division
 arrives over enemy airspace with
Omoi
 feeling great apprehension about fighting in the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. As they land,
Zaji
, the group's sensor, notifies the team that his sensory abilities are being disrupted. Zaji spots an injured Muta and rushes to help him. However, it is revealed that Muta is being
controlled
 by
Sasori
, with
Deidara
 detonating the
explosive clay
 he had stuffed into Muta's insect jar.

Using his
chakra threads
,
Kankurō
 pulls Zaji away in time as
Ittan
 adjusts the terrain to their advantage with his
Earth Release: Moving Earth Core
 technique, although Muta dies from the explosion. With barely any time to relent, the team is set upon again by
Ranka
 and
Tokuma
, their fellow comrades who are also being manipulated by Sasori. Omoi tries to use his
Cloud-Style Crescent Moon Beheading
 technique to fend them off, but is saved by Sai, who arrives in time to deflect a secondary attack by
Shin
, whom Sai is shocked to see. Omoi is shocked when he finds out that Shin is Sai's brother while Shin tells Sai to run away as they cannot be killed.

Omoi becomes enraged that the Akatsuki would use such underhanded tactics as to have them fight their family and comrades and launches another attack on Deidara using his
Cloud-Style Reverse Beheading
 technique, although the attack is a trick that frees Tokuma and Ranka from Sasori's control. Using this opportunity, Ittan raises the earth as Kankurō connects his chakra threads to Sasori's severed ones and pulls him down into the ground, causing him to crash into Deidara. As Sasori praises Kankurō's skill, Kankurō reminisces on their
last

meeting
 and unveils his
Sasori puppet
 to use against Sasori himself.
