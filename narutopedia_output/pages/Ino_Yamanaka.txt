Ino Yamanaka
 (
山中いの
,
Yamanaka Ino
) is a kunoichi of
Konohagakure
's
Yamanaka clan
. She and her fellow members of
Team Asuma
 are their generation's
Ino–Shika–Chō
 trio. She later becomes the head of the
Konoha Barrier Team
 and a member of the
Analysis Team
.

Background






Ino as a child.



Ino is an only child and was a popular student during her time in the Academy. There, she met
Sakura Haruno
, who was teased by other kids for her large forehead. Ino defended Sakura from the bullies and encouraged her to embrace her forehead rather than hide it, becoming good friends with her. Over the following years, Ino's guidance and friendship helped Sakura become more confident and develop into her own person. However, when Sakura found out that they had a crush on the same boy,
Sasuke Uchiha
, Sakura approached Ino, telling her of her liking towards Sasuke. This caused them to end their friendship, starting their dislike towards each other in the beginning of the series.

Personality

From a young age, Ino has been a confident, bold, and outspoken girl who had a mild-temper and occasionally lashed out at others if their personal habits bothered her.
 At the same time, she was by nature very friendly and loyal to her allies, usually more motivated than her team-mates, and tended to take charge of them, a characteristic she would later pass on to her son, Inojin. Shikamaru, despite finding most girls "troublesome", typically offers no resistance to Ino's forceful behaviour, being unwilling to deal with her reaction if things don't happen her way.
 She is also prideful in her appearance and often tries to lose weight by dieting in the hopes that it will make her more attractive to boys; she even jokingly suggests that Chōji should do the same to attract girls.
 Ino is quite knowledgeable about different types and meanings of flowers, sometimes making analogies to them when talking.

Despite her assertiveness and uppity demeanour, Ino is a compassionate and kind person at heart, having been raised to embody the meaning of the
bush clover
: a blunt, candid love who treasures the bonds with her friends.
 It is these qualities that earned Sakura Haruno's friendship, defending Sakura from bullies who teased her and helping her become confident. Their warm friendship developed into a bitter rivalry over the following years, fuelled by competition for Sasuke's affections, ninjutsu and even trading insults, with Ino as "
Ino-pig
" (
いのぶた
,
Ino-buta
) and Sakura as "
Forehead Girl
" (
デコリーン
,
Dekorīn
,
English TV:
 Billboard Brow). After the
Chūnin Exams
, Ino becomes impressed by Sakura's growth and they rekindle their friendship, while maintaining their rivalry on more amiable terms. She cares greatly for her teammates as well, being relieved that they survived after the failed
Sasuke Recovery Mission
,
 promising her sensei
Asuma Sarutobi
 to look after them after he dies,
 and during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, encouraging them to stay strong in the face of danger.
 By the time of his death, Inoichi believed that Ino had truly blossomed into the bush clover of the Yamanaka Clan, and is proud of her bonds with her friends.






Ino dreams of handsome young men like Sasuke and Sai fighting over her.



Ino had the same infatuation for Sasuke that most other girls in their Academy class had, due to his good looks and cool personality. Even after Sasuke's defection from Konoha, Ino largely retained her feelings for him in Part II and she cried when he was declared an international criminal,
 and pictured him as the "love" the bush clover symbolism during the Fourth Shinobi World War.
 Ino meets
Sai
 in Part II, who not only replaces Sasuke on Team 7, but also strongly resembles him in appearance. For this reason, Ino becomes immediately smitten with him, flirting with him when first introduced and blushing when Sai called her beautiful.
 Although her
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 dream reveals she likes the idea of Sasuke and Sai fighting over her, Ino's affections ultimately shift toward Sai, showing a deeper desire to know more about him as she risks her life to save him in
Shikamaru Hiden
. Sai reciprocates Ino's feelings and the two marry years later, having a son,
Inojin
. Even after many years together Ino's love for Sai is as strong as ever, occasionally acting as love-struck as she did when they first met.

As a mother, Ino's personality is relatively the same, but she has greater respect for her clan and its traditions, insisting they be passed down to the next generation to form a new Ino–Shika–Chō. However, she firmly believes in not pushing her son Inojin in a career path he does not want, recognising that all people mature at their own rate and in their own ways, openly trusting her son to find his own path as a ninja. Ino strongly respects her father and tries her best to carry on his will in leading the clan.

Appearance

Ino in Part 1.
Ino in Part II.
Ino during the Fourth Shinobi World War.
1/3

Ino is a fair-skinned woman of average height with light green eyes (blue in the anime) and long, platinum blonde hair with bangs framing the right side of her face. As a young child, her hair was short. In the beginning of Part I, her hair grew to hip-length and is tied into a high ponytail. During the Chūnin Exams, Ino cropped her hair to shoulder-length, often keeping it up in a bun. By Part II, her hair grew back to hip-length ponytail with her bangs became thicker, hiding most of her right eye. In the Blank Period, her hair is hung loosely and extends to her calves; as an adult, her hairstyle returns to its shape in Part II, but her ponytail reaches her upper-back and sports a black clip.

Ino in the Blank Period.
Ino in the New Era.
1/2

Ino regularly wears a purple outfit consisting of a high-collared blouse and matching apron skirt. In Part I, she sports this attire with bandages on her abdomen and legs, small hoop-earrings, her
forehead protector
 worn as a belt, and for a time, white arm warmers. In Part II, Ino's outfit is slightly more revealing as she discards her forehead protector and bandages while exposing her midriff and wears mesh armour on her thighs, elbows and knees. She also replaces her hoop earrings with studs, a gift from Asuma, and sports a red hair clip on her left temple. During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Ino dons the standard Konoha infantry
flak jacket
 and assorted clothing. In the Blank Period, she wears a longer skirt that reaches her ankles, high-heeled sandals and pink lipstick.
 As an adult, Ino wears her purple outfit again exposing her midriff and open-toed sandals. She also dons the standard Konoha uniform while on missions.

Abilities

As a
genin
, Ino was noted to be a kunoichi with the potential to become the strongest member of the Yamanaka clan.
 During the time-skip, she becomes a
chūnin
, and her improved skills ultimately earned further praise from her father in the Fourth Shinobi World War.
 Around the era of the Seventh Hokage, Ino's talents made her the leader of the
Konoha Barrier Team
. Many shinobi in the village and of her own clan look up to her.
 In the anime, she also works in the
Analysis Team
 as an interrogator.

Chakra and Physical Prowess

While a genin, Ino showed to be skilled at
chakra control
, as seen when she used her own cut hair to
bind
 a target. In Part II, her chakra control improved greatly, having been made a
medical-nin
, and being chosen to help
seal
 the
Three-Tails
.
 She could also
transfer
 her chakra to others.

Although Ino rarely uses taijutsu, she has proven to be skilled enough in her battle against Sakura during the Chūnin Exams,
 and against a reincarnated Asuma in the Fourth Shinobi World War, a proficient taijutsu user himself.
 Ino has also shown to have strength and speed, able to tackle Chōji (with increased weight from his
enlarged arm
) away from Asuma's
Wind Release: Dust Cloud Technique
.
 Two years after the war, while usually positioned near the back lines during close-ranged combat situations, her taijutsu has improved enough to support
Sai
 in defeating multiple amounts of enemies.

Ninjutsu

By the Fourth Shinobi World War, she possessed the
Earth
,
Water
,
Yin
 and
Yang Release

nature transformations
.
 With Earth Release, she could erect a
rock wall
 to protect against attacks. She would later acquire
Fire Release
 as well in the anime.

Sensory Perception and Mind Reading Techniques






Ino senses chakra around her.



Ino has a great
sensory
 perception, able to
detect
 changes in another person's chakra.
 She can lock onto an enemy's chakra signature and
transfer
 the information to her allies for their benefit.
 Likewise, she became able to instinctively detect a person's chakra signature without first moulding chakra and also determine the potency of a chakra, becoming the leader of
Konoha Barrier Team
.
 Her sensory skills are currently noted to be the best of her clan.

By the era of the Seventh Hokage, Ino could skilfully
probe people's minds
 for information. She could delve into the mind of a severely injured individual to extract his memories without the help of a machine.
 Her talents for it also aided in interrogating people to learn their true nature and determine whether they are under the influence of someone else.

Medical Ninjutsu






Ino using the Mystical Palm Technique.



Ino learned
medical ninjutsu
 over the time-skip, and was noted to have mastered it by Part II. She is skilled enough to make an immediate judgement on the condition of a patient.
 Ino also employed anaesthetic-laced weapons.
 In the anime, she was a surrogate apprentice of Sakura's for three months under Tsunade's guidence where she learnt to
heal
 fatal wounds and to aid in surgeries.

Yamanaka Clan Techniques






Ino using the Mind Body Switch Technique.



As a Yamanaka, Ino specialises in mind-affecting techniques, such as the
Mind Body Switch Technique
, which allows her to possess a target and take control of their actions. She can also use this technique on animals for reconnaissance and espionage, as it was originally intended.
 Ino's body, however, is left vulnerable to attack while the technique is active, and therefore it is not suited for battle.
 She can also be forced out of the body if the opponent's will is strong enough. In the anime, she learns the
Mind Body Disturbance Technique
, which allows her to force her enemies to attack each other.






Ino using the Mind Clone Switch Technique.



During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Ino's speed with the Mind Body Switch Technique has improved greatly;
 able to quickly save her allies from incoming danger on multiple occasions.
 Ino has also learned the
Mind Clone Switch Technique
, which allows her to control multiple targets at once.
 With the
Mind Body Transmission Technique
, she can communicate telepathically with someone, and convey memories and feelings to them.
 She is quite skilled with this technique, able to connect the entire
Allied Shinobi Forces
 through a telepathic link. She can also
transmit
 what she senses into a target's mind. By making physical contact with a person, they can also communicate with one another while the technique is active.
 In
The Last: Naruto the Movie
, Ino's telepathic range has expanded enough to receive and broadcast messages across the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 in a short period of time with the aid of a
Chakra Transmission Communication Device
. In later years, she could perform this technique to connect as far as 100 kilometres beyond the distance of the village unaided,
 and likewise can maintain multiple independent channels.

Intelligence






Sakura falls prey to Ino's trap.



Ino is quite intelligent, graduating at the top of her class in the
Academy
, alongside Sasuke and
Shino Aburame
. She can be very deceptive in battle, able to get Sakura into lowering her guard by cutting her hair and seemingly using the Mind Body Switch Technique, despite Sakura being a moving target. While Sakura thought Ino lost her mind, Ino actually didn't use the technique and scattered her hair to create a chakra rope to restrain Sakura's movements, and thus, guaranteed that her Mind Body Switch Technique wouldn't miss.
 The anime shows that Ino is very attentive, able to determine a person's occupation by glancing at the condition of their hands.
 During
Pain's Assault
, she found a connection between
Pain
's technique and the
Yamanaka Clan
's mind techniques and concluded that Pain's real body must be around the village for his technique to work.

Prologue — Land of Waves

Main article:
Prologue — Land of Waves

In the anime, Ino races Sakura toward the Academy, where they will be added to new teams along with other graduates of her class. Despite hoping to be on the same team as Sasuke, she is devastated that not only Sakura becomes Sasuke's teammate along with
Naruto Uzumaki
, but she herself is added to Asuma's Team 10 with Shikamaru and Chōji. Ino immediately lays ground rules for her new teammates to follow.

Chūnin Exams

Main article:
Chūnin Exams

Despite how recently they graduated from the Academy, Asuma enters Team 10 in the
Chūnin Exams
 being held in Konoha. Shortly before the exams begin, Ino greets Sasuke by cheerfully hugging him, much to his, and of course, Sakura's chagrin. For the first stage of the exams, they are given a written test with ten questions too difficult for the standard genin to be able to answer, and for which reason participants are expected to cheat without getting caught. Ino uses her
Mind Body Switch Technique
 to copy answers from Sakura's exam sheet and transfer the information to Shikamaru and Chōji.






Ino infiltrates Kin's body.



For the second stage of the exams, Team 10 enters the
Forest of Death
 to take part in a five-day survival exercise. Team 10 initially spends their time avoiding conflict, hiding whenever they come across another team. When they are soon noticed by
Neji Hyūga
, Ino tries using her charm to convince Neji into giving her team the scroll, though she fails miserably and her team immediately retreats from Neji's intimidation. When they discover Sakura defending her teammates from a
team
 of
Oto
-nin by herself, Ino recalls her childhood memories of their friendship and finally decides to help her. Team 10 initiates
Formation Ino–Shika–Chō
: Chōji attacks
Zaku Abumi
 with
Human Bullet Tank
, Shikamaru immobilises
Dosu Kinuta
 with his
Shadow Imitation Technique
, and Ino uses her Mind Body Switch on
Kin Tsuchi
. Ino tries to use Kin as a hostage, but Zaku opts to attack Kin himself rather than let her be used against him. Too tired to offer much more of a fight, Team 10 wonders what to do. When Sasuke regains consciousness and activates his new
cursed seal
, Ino becomes frightened by the dark change in Sasuke's chakra and released herself from Kin's body. After the Oto-nin retreat, the Konoha genin take their leave, but not before Ino fixes Sakura's hair.






Ino and Sakura knock each other out.



After passing the second stage, the remaining genin take part in one-on-one preliminary matches. For her match, Ino is paired against Sakura. They start by trading insults and then punches, surprising Ino because Sakura proves her equal in both categories. Frustrated, Ino follows Sakura's earlier example by cutting her hair, a ruse that allows her to immobilise Sakura while she uses her Mind Body Switch Technique. In control of Sakura's body, Ino tries to make her forfeit the match, but she is stopped and exorcised by
Inner Sakura
. They are both exhausted by this, but exchange one final blow, knocking both out. When they later wake up, Ino informs her that their match was ruled a tie, and that therefore neither of them will continue to the finals. Despite this, they decide to rekindle their friendship, though they can't help but continue to bicker over Sasuke.

A few days later, Ino accompanies Sakura to visit Sasuke at the hospital with flowers, but discover he is gone. Instead, they see Lee training despite his injuries, causing him to fall unconscious as a consequence. On the day of the finals, Ino sat with Sakura in the audience and tried to cheer her up when Sasuke hadn't arrived yet. She becomes impressed by Naruto's victory over Neji and cheers for Shikamaru in his match with
Temari
, though is left shocked when he voluntarily gives up. Sasuke finally arrives for his match with
Gaara
, and Ino watches the fight with interest, noting to Sakura that her teammates are amazing.

After the failed attempt to stop Sasuke from defecting from Konoha, Ino and Sakura visited the injured at the hospital, showing great relief at Chōji's survival due to the
Fifth Hokage
's efforts.

In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths






Team 10 during the second Chūnin Exams.



In the anime, about two years after Naruto leaves Konoha to train, another Chūnin Exams is held. Because participants must enter as part of three-man teams, Ino invites Sakura to be Shikamaru's replacement on Team 10 since Shikamaru is already a chūnin. During the first exam, Ino, Sakura, and Chōji are seated in different rooms and are tasked with getting a combined score of exactly 100 points on their written test despite their separation. Ino telepathically contacts Sakura and Chōji in order to assign which questions to answer. After the initial testing period is over, they are given a bonus question: each team must unanimously select one of their members to disqualify from the rest of the exams. Team 10 selects nobody, which is the correct answer and which qualifies them for the next phase.






Ino links with teammates to help them sense enemy.



Those who pass the first exam must reach the
Demon Desert
 within three days in order to participate in the second exam. Team 10 successfully does so and they are given the same objective as they had in the exam several years ago: obtain a scroll from another team. They wander through the desert for three days, losing their provisions to an
Ame
-team. While recuperating at an oasis, they are confronted by
Team Ameno
, and Ino is knocked out on her first attempt to attack them. Awakening and remembering her training, she uses her sensing abilities to locate their attackers and
telepathically links
 with Sakura and Chōji once more, allowing them to coordinate their attacks and defeat Team Ameno. Once Sakura and Ino heal their injuries, Team Ameno offers them their scroll. However, theirs is the same scroll that Team 10 already has, so they are allowed to keep it. They go their separate ways, agreeing to meet again in the third exam.

Team 10 is later attacked by
Team Saya
.
Saya

possesses
 Ino's mind and forces her to attack Sakura. When Chōji, meanwhile, begins overwhelming Saya's teammates, Saya possesses his mind instead, and she forces him to attack Sakura using his
Super Multi-Size Technique
. Ino is able to release Chōji using her Mind Body Switch Technique, forcing Team Saya to retreat. Team 10 is afterwards trapped in a
sandstorm
, during which Ino and Chōji are poisoned by a
cloaked

Mamushi
. Sakura escapes the sandstorm, defeats Team Saya, and then returns to heal Ino and Chōji.






Ino and the other genin being promoted to chūnin.



Team 10 is eventually found by one of the exam's proctors, who brings them to where all of the other genin are being assembled. They are informed that the Chūnin Exams have been cancelled; reports on the participants' performances will be sent back to their villages, leaving their promotion up to their superiors. When they get back to Konoha, Tsunade promotes Ino, Sakura, and Chōji to chūnin.

Ino flirts with Sai.



Ino comes to retrieve Chōji for their mission with Asuma and, along the way, happily greets Naruto after having not seen him for almost three years. When Team 7 later returns from their failed mission to retrieve Sasuke, Team 10 visits them in the hospital where Kakashi is resting. Ino immediately expresses interest in
Sai
, who looks very similar to Sasuke, but Sakura tells her that his personality is much different. While their teachers discuss private matters, both teams have lunch at
Yakiniku Q
; Ino sits next to Sai and flirts with him. Sai, in an attempt to make friends by giving them nick-names, calls Ino "beautiful", causing her to blush and Sakura to become enraged, as Sai previously called her "ugly".

Akatsuki Suppression Mission






Ino tries to heal Asuma.



Ino and Chōji are assigned to one of the
Twenty Platoons
, a task-force assigned to hunt down
Akatsuki
 members within the
Land of Fire
. Led by
Raidō Namiashi
 and
Aoba Yamashiro
, the team is called in for back-up when Asuma's team engages
Hidan
 and
Kakuzu
 of Akatsuki. When they arrive, however, the Akatsuki members flee and Asuma's injuries are too severe for Ino to heal. Sensing his death, Asuma gives parting words to his students: he praises Ino's confident personality and tells her to look after Shikamaru and Chōji, as well as to not lose to Sakura in any pursuit. Ino tearfully mourns Asuma's death and later attends his funeral in Konoha with Choji, asking him why Shikamaru hasn't arrived.

Once Shikamaru gets everything ready, he sets out with Ino and Chōji to hunt down Hidan and Kakuzu. Tsunade tries to persuade them not to go, but they are all confident in what they plan to do. She tries to hold them back on the grounds that they need a fourth member, at which point
Kakashi Hatake
 appears and volunteers to be their fourth, causing Tsunade to relent. After the team review their battle strategy, Ino uses her Mind Body Switch Technique on a hawk to locate Hidan and Kakuzu. The team engages the Akatsuki duo in battle, though Ino cannot contribute much to the fight as her Mind Body Switch alone is too risky to use in battle and due to her status as a
Medical-nin
. Since Hidan and Kakuzu are formidable working together, Team 10 realises the duo need to be separated if they're to be defeated. Ino volunteers to lead Hidan away, but Shikamaru insists her not to and goes in her place.






Kakuzu attempts to kill Team 10.



Even with each side one member short, Kakuzu still manages to easily overwhelm and capture Kakashi and Team 10. His attempt to kill them is blocked by the
combined efforts
 of Naruto and
Yamato
, who arrive with Sakura and Sai to lend assistance. While Sakura and Sai set out to help Shikamaru, Naruto fights Kakuzu and eventually defeats him with his newly-created
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
. Afterwards, Ino heals Naruto's injuries and praises him for his improved skills before the teams return to Konoha. In the anime, Ino visits Neji and
Hinata Hyūga
 and tells them about the mission's events and Naruto's new technique.

Pain later
destroys
 the village, but Ino and the villagers saved from harm by Katsuyu. While Naruto fights Pain alone, she and her father meet up with Shikamaru and
Shikaku Nara
 to pool their knowledge about Pain. With their combined information, they hypothesise that Pain is actually being controlled remotely by someone, likely from the highest point near Konoha. Ino and Shikamaru stay behind while their fathers search for Pain, who is eventually defeated by Naruto and revives everyone he killed in Konoha. Upon Naruto's return to Konoha, Ino joins in the celebration of his victory; in the anime, she says she could almost fall for Naruto, surprising Chōji and Shikamaru.

 begins, Ino is placed in the Allied Shinobi Forces'
Fifth Division
. She and part of her division are later sent to provide support for the
First Division
, meeting Chōji and Shikamaru along the way. As they near the First Division's location, Shikaku contacts Shikamaru, Chōji, and Ino and tells them about the first threat they'll need to deal with:
Kinkaku
, who possesses some of the
Nine-Tails
' chakra. When they arrive, they use Formation Ino–Shika–Chō on Kinkaku, allowing his capture in the
Kohaku no Jōhei
. After Kinkaku's defeat, Team 10 is immediately confronted by a reincarnated Kakuzu, who is interested in fighting them. Shikaku contacts them and instructs them to deal with another threat instead: a reincarnated Asuma.






Ino saves Chōji from Asuma's attack.



Although none of them want to fight Asuma, they, as his former students, are experts on his fighting style and thus the best-qualified to defeat him. When he notices their presence, Asuma congratulates them for their clear growth since he last saw them. They attack him and he's forced to counter, but he gives pointers about how to avoid his attacks and ultimately defeat him. Although Ino and Shikamaru are committed to the fight, Chōji has difficulty bringing himself to strike Asuma, to everyone's frustrations, Asuma's included. Ino saves Chōji's life twice from Asuma's attacks and, using the Mind Body Switch Technique on Chōji, tells him he needs to pull himself together so they can defeat Asuma. Once Chōji is able to do so, Ino leaves Chōji's body and
takes control of two White Zetsu soldiers
 to attack Asuma, moving him toward Shikamaru and Chōji so they can restrain him. Defeated, Asuma gives them new parting words: that he has nothing more to teach them since their teamwork is now perfect.

By nightfall, the First Division's battle appears won: all the reincarnated forces have been captured and all present elements of the
White Zetsu Army
 have been defeated. The
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 suddenly appears on the battlefield and starts devastating the First Division, causing Ino and her team to take cover. The statue later vanishes after
Tobi
 escapes with the
Benihisago
 and the Kohaku no Jōhei, which contain the reincarnated
Gold and Silver Brothers
. The following day, a new threat emerges in the form of White Zetsu that have infiltrated the Allied Shinobi Forces. In the anime, the reincarnated
Sound Four
 also attack the members of the former
Sasuke Recovery Team
. While Shikamaru and Chōji defeat their opponents, the Sound Four's defeat activates
Space–Time Technique Formula: Underworld Turnover
, separating the Recovery Team's souls from their bodies and trapping them within a
barrier
 in a remote location. Ino risks her life to keep her unconscious teammates alive by
transferring
 her chakra to them simultaneously, despite warnings from her other allies. Inoichi telepathically contacts Ino and informs her of the technique's mechanisms, but he is unable to detect the barrier's location and thus have it destroyed so the victims can be freed. Naruto does so eventually, however, and Shikamaru and Chōji's souls are restored to their bodies, causing a relieved Ino to tearfully hug them.

Team 10 later encounter their reincarnated childhood friend
Yota
, whose emotionally-fuelled weather manipulation push the team back. As the trio contemplate having to fight Yota, Inoichi contacts them and links them to others also fighting Yota, including
Kiba Inuzuka
, Sakura and Naruto.
 Realising the Yota in front of them is a White Zetsu clone, Ino and her teammates defeat it.






Ino and the others bide their time until Naruto arrives.



Due to White Zetsu clones disguising themselves as allies, and the only way to tell is through
Negative Emotions Sensing
, her group  was forced to create individual circles to wait in until Naruto comes to expose the enemies. Ino suggests asking each other personal questions, but Shikamaru insists not to as it is possible that the enemy could guess correctly. After she greets Naruto, Ino helps kill the remaining White Zetsu clones.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax






Ino arrives on the battlefield in time to save her comrades.



After being informed by her father at HQ that Naruto and
Killer B
 were fighting the "
masked Madara
", Ino and the rest of the
Konoha 11
 rush to his aid. As she runs, she thanks her father for relaying Naruto's strong feelings to everyone and promises that his foretelling of their victory will be realised. Ino and the rest of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 arrive just in time as she, with
Hinata Hyūga
's aid, uses her Mind Body Switch Technique on Obito to shift the
Ten-Tails
'
Tailed Beast Ball
 away from Naruto's group. Shikaku Nara, through Inoichi's telepathic link, relays a plan of restraining the Ten-Tails to the assembled Allied Forces, but the plan is unsuccessful. Obito and
Madara Uchiha
 are nevertheless concerned by Shikaku's strategies and have the Ten-Tails fire a Tailed Beast Ball at the distant Allied HQ, where Inoichi and Shikaku are stationed. Before the HQ is destroyed, Inoichi tells a crying Ino that he is proud of his daughter for blossoming into the bush clover of the Yamanaka Clan and making strong bonds with her friends.






Ino communicates with the entire Shinobi Alliance.



With no time to grieve, the remaining Allied Forces enact Shikaku's last plan after being empowered by Naruto's
version 1
-like cloaks: a large-scale Formation Ino–Shika–Chō. Obito is unable to break free of Ino's improved Mind Body Switch Technique, which enables her to save Chōji from being skewered by the Ten-Tails' wooden spikes. She releases her technique and returns to her body once Shikamaru and other Nara members restrain the Ten-Tails. The attack succeeds in removing the Ten-Tails from Obito and Madara's control, but this makes its attacks more devastating and indiscriminate. When the Ten-Tails prepares to destroy the Allies with a Tailed Beast Ball, Ino uses the
Mind Body Transmission Technique
 to connect Shikamaru with
Kitsuchi
 and teach him a
simple protective wall
. Obliging to Shikamaru's request regardless of her capability, Ino manages through some strain to connect Shikamaru to the rest of the Allies so that he can teach them this same jutsu and use it to try and deflect the Tailed Beast Ball. It breaks through all their defences, but is slowed enough for the reincarnated
Fourth Hokage
 to arrive in time to save them.






Ino and her teammates attacking the Ten-Tails' clones.



Sasuke Uchiha
 arrives shortly after the Fourth, claiming to now want to help protect Konoha by defeating the Ten-Tails. A surprised Ino immediately rushes toward Sasuke's location before her teammates warn her to stay away from him. With their whole graduating class together again, which Ino finds nostalgic, the members of Teams 7, 8, and 10 attack the Ten-Tails'
minions
. For Team 10's contribution, they use the
Human Bullet Yo-Yo
, where Ino uses her
Sensing Technique
 to detect the number of enemies present and transmits the information into Shikamaru's mind so he can have Chōji attack them. Their formation is quite successful, but does not compare to the amount of damage inflicted by Team 7's members. Ino later noticed that something was troubling Shikamaru, but he dismissed her.

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki

Main article:
Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki






Ino connects Hashirama to the Shinobi Alliance.



Obito eventually becomes the Ten-Tails
jinchūriki
, against whom only Naruto, Sasuke, and the four reincarnated
Hokage
 can fight. Morale starts to sink because of this, so Ino telepathically links Shikamaru to the Alliance in order to boost their morale. When Obito prepares to destroy the Alliance with four Tailed Beast Balls, Naruto and the Fourth Hokage are able to
teleport
 Ino and everyone to safety through their reactivated version 1-like cloaks. Obito employs a different tactic: recreating the
God Tree
 to feed off the chakra of whatever Allies it comes into contact with. Ino is able to avoid having her chakra drained, but Shikamaru is not as fortunate and she and Chōji rush to their failing teammate. When
Hashirama Senju
 appears, Ino connects him to the Alliance (and the approaching Five Kage) so that he can explain the details of Madara's
Eye of the Moon Plan
, but this further demotivates them.






The Konoha chūnin attack Obito with the Rasengan.



Ino's active telepathy soon conveys Naruto's feelings and memories, as well as those of Hashirama, to the entire Alliance, giving them the morale they need to keep fighting. While Naruto and Sasuke engage Obito in battle, a version 1 cloak begins forming around Shikamaru as Sakura heals him; Ino senses from her technique that it is due to Naruto's subconscious desire to protect his comrades. After thanking Naruto and Sakura for Shikamaru's recovery, Ino relays Tsunade's message, when she arrives on the battlefield, of Katsuyu's healing abilities to the Alliance. She then helps Naruto and Sasuke defeat Obito, first by joining the rest of the Konoha 11 in hitting Obito with one of Naruto's
Rasengan
, and then by assisting the Allies in pulling the
tailed beasts
' chakra from Obito's body.






Ino caught in the Infinite Tsukuyomi.



Even with Obito defeated, other threats still remain: a final
Zetsu
 begins
overwhelming
 most of the Alliance, which they're all too weak to put up much fight against. During this time, a shocked Ino senses Naruto's weakened physical state, caused by the Nine-Tails' extraction from his body. When the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 is cast upon the world, Ino alongside most people are immobilised by the genjutsu and
restrained
.

 informs

 that both Kakashi and Guy are on the

, Ino is ordered to attempt to make contact with them while Tsunade assembles Konoha's available personnel. Following the killing of another hostage, Kakashi is contacted by Ino and she reports all exploding tags have been found and delivered to Guy, who will set up a distraction so that Kakashi can gather the remaining passengers and get them to safety. Before breaking off communication, Kakashi requests that Sai be sent to provide assistance.

As prisoners start to escape, Armament Alliance forces storm in looking for

, Ino performs her
Mind Body Transfer Technique
 on Garyō to take control of his body so he cannot escape and returns back to the Blood Prison. Ino then delivers a message from Tsunade that Kakashi is to personally see to it that the ship is destroyed before the Tsuchikage has a chance.

Before Shikamaru heads out on the mission to investigate
Gengo
, he sees his childhood friends and teammates, Ino and Chōji. As they reminisce about their childhood with Asuma, he doesn't have the heart to tell them about the assassination mission, desiring not to get them involved in such a task. However, later when Temari notices Shikamaru's strange behaviour during the meeting of union representatives and goes to negotiate with Konogakure, Ino, Chōji and Sakura also go with her to save Shikamaru and the other shinobi of Konogakure.






Ino freeing Sai from Gengo's control.



Aside from worrying about her friend Shikamaru, Ino is more eager to save Sai, the one who is under Gengo's genjutsu and whom she has a crush on, she is triggered into action after reading his distressed letter and is overwhelmed with a desire to rescue Sai from his inner conflict. Despite the danger for herself, Ino performs the
Mind Body Switch Technique
 and sinks deeply into Sai's heart to salvage his consciousness as she feels she is the only one who can rescue him. She feels that she wants to learn more about him and his loneliness as she dives deeper down into him. Ino finds him trapped deep in his consciousness, crying and wrapping himself with the memories of his friends and she calls out to him before putting a reassuring hand on his shoulder which he returns with a heartfelt smile.

When Sai is successfully saved by her, the two wake from Ino's jutsu and instinctively reach for each others hands and Sai expresses his gratefulness to Ino as her eyes begin to tear up by affectionately calling her "Miss Beautiful". After Gengo is defeated, Shikamaru assures Sai that everything that he's done is no fault of his own and Gengo's genjutsu is solely responsible. Shikamaru then asks Ino to look after Sai as they depart.

Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze

Main article:
Sakura Hiden: Thoughts of Love, Riding Upon a Spring Breeze

Ino assisted and supported Sakura's idea to open a clinic within the
Konoha Hospital
 that would assess and treat children's mental health. Ino would accompany Sakura on her journey to Sunagakure, as the village is in the process of adopting their own clinic as well, to help Sakura with preparations. On the way there, the two begin gossiping about the various relationships developing amongst their friends. Sakura then asks Ino about her own love life and she shyly reveals her crush on Sai. Ino tells Sakura she plans to confess her love but is unsure which type of flower to give to Sai to express her feelings, lavender or a flowering dogwood.

The two kunoichi meet a Suna shinobi who escorts them to their conference with the village's doctors. Afterwards, however, they are summoned before
Gaara
, the Kazekage, who informs them that Sasuke has been to Suna. Gaara repeats to them the conversation that Sasuke had with the terrorist group two days earlier, which he (who was surveying the group anyway) witnessed with his Third Eye. Although he, Ino and Sakura want to believe it was someone disguised as Sasuke, they can come up with no practical explanations for the man having Sasuke's chakra signature.

When Ino and Sakura return to Konoha, they inform Kakashi about the situation. Kakashi is also convinced that the man conspiring against Konoha was a lookalike of Sasuke, but he has no reliable way of contacting Sasuke in order to confirm this. He shares Gaara's recommendation to do nothing at the moment so that unsubstantiated assumptions can't be spread against Sasuke. A few days later, Kakashi informs them of rumours about Sasuke's activity that have been reported by Sai. Ino is more concerned by the risks Sai may be facing and anxiously questions Kakashi on Sai's safety but Sakura steers things back to what the rumours mean for Sasuke. Ultimately, Kakashi teams Ino and Sakura up with Sai; Ino dubs themselves
Ino–Saku–Sai
 and they promise to keep each other informed of their findings.

After a day of investigating
Kido Tsumiki
, the man apparently behind Sasuke's impostor, Sakura is kidnapped. Ino runs to Sai's home in order to inform him. However, when Ino arrives she becomes flustered at the sight of him in only his underwear, since Sai was taking a shower before her arrival. While he gets dressed, Ino contacts Kakashi and informs him of what's happened. He advises not getting anyone else involved in the rescue as that might only provoke Kido to kill Sakura.

Sai and Ino travel to some of Kido's hideouts to look for Sakura. Ino uses her
sensing skills
 to spot Sakura's chakra but she isn't there. Sai decides they should see what intel they can get from the guard standing at the door. Ino uses the
Mind Body Switch Technique
 on the hideout's sentry while Sai captures them, her first time using such a tactic without Shikamaru and Chōji. When the sentry, an acquaintance of Sai's, is unwilling to answer their questions, Sai forces Sakura's whereabouts from him by tickling him with a paintbrush. They go to the hideout where Sakura is being kept on Sai's imitating bird and Ino initially struggles to maintain her balance but Sai comforts her causing her to feel a sweet warm sensation well up within her heart. When they arrive they find that Sakura has already escaped and is on the offensive.

When Sakura sees Sai and Ino, she tells them what she's learned about Kido and the drugs he's making. They are surrounded by many Anbu,
Magire
, and Kido himself, who tells them that he plans to sell his drugs not only as tools of war but as ways in which to cause those wars, thus giving him a never-ending source of revenue. Ino doubts that such drugs would ever have a market because the powers they grant are unearned, which Kido declares as naive, just like their clinic for children's mental health. He instructs his Anbu to use their synthetic tailed beast cloaks to either capture or kill Sakura and the others, no longer having a preference for their fate.

Sakura, Sai, and Ino work well together despite being outnumbered. While Sakura deals with the Sasuke impostor, Ino helps Sai fight off the Anbu. Sakura, Sai, and Ino defeat all their opponents but Kido and Magire. Since Magire is a medic-nin, Sakura decides to separate Kido from him so that Magire can't heal his injuries. Sai and Ino exchange attacks with Magire, but neither side is able to hit the other. Magire activates a synthetic tailed beast cloak and, with its tails, is able to create glowing orbs that detonate on contact. While Sai tries and fails to overpower Magire with his
Super Beast Imitating Drawings
, Ino takes control of an eagle which she uses to stab Magire from behind with a anaesthetic-laced kunai. Magire's movements slowed, allowing Sai to deliver a finishing blow. Kakashi arrives to help soon after Magire is defeated, with Naruto and Hinata accompanying him. Together, they head into the forest to help Sakura. However, she defeat Kido with her Cherry Blossom Impact.

Ino along with Sai, Naruto, Hinata and Kakashi joined Sakura and congratulate her on her victory. However, they are interrupted by news that several of Kido's Anbu have fled the village. Ino and the others immediately give chase, but on reaching the Anbu they find them all defeated with a combination of fire and genjutsu. They guess that it was Sasuke's doing and that he chose not to stick around when he confirmed Kido was defeated. Although they're disappointed that Sasuke didn't at least say hello, they are glad that the entire ordeal is over. After Ino–Saku–Sai is dismissed by Kakashi, Sakura is called to a meeting with Suna-medics. Ino offers to go with her, but Sakura tells her to instead have lunch with Sai.

Ino and Sakura fight over a picture frame.



Ino goes into a shop so as to buy a present for
Naruto
 and
Hinata
's wedding. She reaches for a picture frame only her hand to be met by Sakura's hand doing the same. Sakura uses her superhuman strength to pull the picture frame from Ino's hand, to which Ino responds by claiming the picture frame is ugly and a terrible gift. The two get into an argument so heated that they are thrown out of the store, neither of them able to purchase the picture frame.

Ino blames Sakura for what's happened, insisting Sakura's unnatural strength and large forehead make her uncouth and, more particularly, unlikely to ever be married. Sakura is deeply insulted by the latter accusation and challenges Ino to a cooking competition to prove that she would make a good wife. Ino puts
Military Rations Pills
 in Sakura's favourite dessert, anmitsu, and Sakura does the same in Ino's favourite dessert, pudding. The next day, Ino wants to use Chōji as an impartial judge. Chōji samples each of their soldier pills and finds them so delicious that he starts putting them into his mouth by the handful. He soon collapses to the ground with blood running from his nose.

Sakura suspects Ino put poison in her soldier pills, intending for Sakura to try one and fall deathly ill. Ino suspects the same of Sakura. In order to save Chōji they must identify the poison as soon as they can: each samples the other's soldier pills so that they can identify what type of poison it is. Neither can taste poison, but they do taste their favourite desserts, Ino loving the pudding in Sakura's and Sakura loving the anmitsu in Ino's. Chōji gets up soon afterwards, having finally recovered from his blood sugar overload, and he praises both of their soldier pills. Sakura and Ino reflect on their like-mindedness and how their competitions always push each other to be better. They therefore decide to go shopping together, helping each other find a gift even better than a picture frame.

Shikamaru stops by Yamanaka Flowers. Ino is surprised to see him and guesses that this has something to do with recently forgetting his wedding anniversary. Annoyed that she knows this, Shikamaru asks if Sai has ever forgotten their anniversary. Ino responds that Sai always remembers to buy a gift for holidays and special occasions, even if he's going to be away on the specific day of celebration.

After learning the reasons behind Ino's enthusiasm about the job, Inojin gave it another try, and was able to detect an actual intruder, who had disguised his chakra signature with a registered one.

Later still, Ino sold flowers to Sakura, surmising Sasuke would be home soon. She confessed she couldn't imagine having a husband who's home so infrequently. While Sarada was asking her mother about the
Strength of a Hundred Seal
, Ino trembled when detecting
Jigen
 instantly appearing next to Naruto. Ino determines the incredibly sinister chakra must be the enemy after Kawaki, so she immediately contacts Naruto. Naruto tells her that he again wants to confront the enemy one on one, but this time Ino moves to have the police force on standby for him. She updated Shikamaru on the disappearance of Naruto's chakra before he arrived at the scene. She again sent a dispatch to Shikamaru's team about Sasuke's return and his condition.

After Naruto was rescued and recovered, the village was put on high alert. In the anime, when some old data of village's shinobi was stolen by a
hooded figure
, Ino found out that there were no anomalies detected by the Sensory Barrier before or after the incident. Later, while
Team 10
 was training outside the village territory,
Kara
's chief scientist
Amado
 appeared who took Shikadai as a hostage and demanded to talk with Shikamaru as the acting head of the village, unaware that Naruto was saved. Terrified,
Inojin

called
 Ino for help. Ino immediately contacted reinforcements before informing the situation to Shikamaru. As Amado made clear that he could kill Shikadai anytime with a bomb, Ino put Amado in contact with Shikamaru from whom Amado becomes aware that Naruto was alive and well. Shikamaru requested Ino to widen her telepathic range so that Naruto and the others could also hear Amado. Amado then firmly stated that he wished to defect to Konoha, offering his full intel on Kara, their
Ten-Tails
 and even on the
Ōtsutsuki
, which was allowed by Naruto under strict conditions.

Later, Ino sensed the arrival of
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
, whose improper resurrection required him to rebrand Kawaki with his
Kāma
. Ino instantly contacted Naruto, warning him of an enemy with an unknown chakra signature above the village. Ino relayed Shikamaru's evacuation orders to other shinobi, and updated Naruto on Isshiki's location and the status of evacuating the citizens.

In the anime, following Isshiki's defeat, Naruto organised another Chūnin Exams in the village. Inojin advanced to the final rounds, and Ino watched his broadcast match against
Hōki Taketori
 at Yamanaka Flowers. Despite his loss, Ino was proud of Inojin's progress and attitude.

Code's Assault Arc

Code's Assault Arc






Ino and her team searching for Kawaki's chakra.



Several days after the death of
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
, when Kawaki evaded surveillance to leave the village despite the threats from
Code
, Ino patched Naruto and Shikamaru to coordinate the search, and was told by Naruto that deploying the Sensing Unit would be hampered by Kawaki's ability to suppress his chakra signature. Ino wondered why he would leave, as she believed he had grown accustomed to being in the village. After coordinating an extended search, Ino commented to Naruto on the futility of looking for Kawaki through sensing if he could actually suppress his chakra signature. Instead, Naruto decided to track Boruto's chakra via Sage Mode, assuming that he would be with Kawaki by now. As Naruto and Shikamaru were ready to head out to retrieve Kawaki and Boruto, Ino was assigned to keep a high-alert for the entire village. Ino asked Shikamaru to be careful before he left.

Omnipotence Arc

Main article:
Omnipotence Arc

After the confrontation with Code, Ino was one of the few people who knew of all the events that transpired. When Code emerged through a
Claw Mark
 on Shikamaru in an attempt to have Amado lift his power limiters, Ino detected his intrusion. She contacted Shikamaru, who instructed her to inform Naruto, but not to send reinforcements as not to scare off Code, and to keep a watch for his signal. When Code was paralysed by Shikamaru's Shadow Imitation Technique, he used his Claw Mark to bring
Ada
 for help. As her presence prevented Shikamaru from attacking her, Shikamaru had Ino link him to Amado for an explanation of Ada's powers. Having learned it, he requested that Ino change the access codes to the room and keep any reinforcements away. She maintained the link between Amado and Shikamaru during the ordeal, letting Shikamaru warn Naruto against entering the room, and trying to get things back into focus when Amado and Shikamaru started arguing.

New Era: Part II

Boruto's Return Arc

Main article:
Boruto's Return Arc

After Boruto fought off Code during his attack on the village, Shikamaru asked Ino for old mission logs, signalling her to establish telepathic contact. He asked her to set up an off the record line of communication only they could access. Ino was concerned by a request that so blatantly violated regulations, but Shikamaru assured her of its necessity for Konoha. When Mitsuki reported that Kawaki detected Boruto, Shikamaru had Ino establish a connection. Ino was shocked by Shikamaru's belief that their memories had been altered, and that Boruto was the true son of Naruto. She maintained their connection as Boruto had to evade Mitsuki, who pursued him to the outskirts of the village.

As Boruto and Mitsuki talked after clashing, Ino refused Shikamaru's request to extend their link to Mitsuki to get more of their conversation to avoid Mitsuki listening to them. She was shocked when Boruto revealed Naruto and Hinata were still alive, and listened as Boruto explained how Omnipotence wouldn't let them retain any knowledge about it acquired from others. While Boruto continued to explain about the sentient God Trees, Kawaki attempted to report it. She assured Shikamaru that as a different connection, Kawaki would not be able to hear Boruto through Shikamaru's connection. After conversations were done and Boruto leaves, Ino expressed her concern about Boruto's allegations, but Shikamaru asks her to keep it a secret. Upon the news of
Jura
 and
Hidari
 attacking the village from
Koji Kashin
, Boruto teleports back to the village. A toad contacts Shikamaru, notifying him of Boruto's return, and instructs him to have Ino establish the communications again.

Later, when Boruto was captured by Konoha after the sentient God Trees retreated, Ino was present in the hospital looking after her son who was injured in the battle, relieved to hear that he was fine after Himawari, the new Nine-Tails
Jinchūriki
, healed him. As the interrogations on Boruto escalated to physical torture, Shikamaru contacted Ino and asked her for another private link to Boruto quickly. However, Ino, having already forgotten the previous talk with Boruto, refused to help Shikamaru again as it was violating the protocols too many times and expresses her worries about Shikamaru trusting Boruto. When Shikamaru desperately asks her as a friend instead of an order as the Hokage, Ino still reluctantly denied to link him with Boruto, who she remembers as a traitor, and she subtly looks at an unconscious Inojin before refusing again.

Due to Ino's
Mind Transfer Technique
 being more support oriented than for combat, Ino's movesets instead typically include the use of flower-based attacks (example:
Ninja Wolfsbane
) and elegant acrobatic physical attacks similar to the Musoh-Battoh-Ryu style of fighting despite not doing such things in canon.

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Ino Yamanaka

The name "Ino" can be short for "Inoshishi" which means "boar" (
猪
), hence Sakura calling her Ino-pig-chan (
いのブタちゃん
,
Ino-buta-chan
). Her family name "Yamanaka" means "among the mountains" (
山中
). Wild boar are heavily associated with mountains in Japan, and are even called the whales of the mountains (
山鯨
,
yamakujira
), because of the amount of meat they produce.

The name "Ino" (偉野, 偉埜) is sometimes used as a given name meaning "Great Field".

"Ino" (いの町
Ino-chō
) is also a name of a town in the Agawa District, Kōchi Prefecture, Japan.

Her family owns a flower shop called
Yamanaka Flowers
, where she works part-time.

In the manga, it was never revealed how or why Ino became a medical-nin. Her choice to study under Tsunade was anime-exclusive.

Ino was ranked as the 29th most popular character in the seventh Naruto character popularity poll. She placed 14th in the fifth poll, 17th in the sixth poll and 23rd in the fourth poll. She finished 30th in the first poll.

According to the databook(s):

Ino's hobby is
shopping
.

Ino wishes for a rematch with
Sakura
.

Ino's favourite foods are cherry tomatoes and pudding, while her least favourite is
sashimi
.

Ino has completed 40 official missions in total: 23 D-rank, 9 C-rank, 6 B-rank, 2 A-rank, 0 S-rank.

Ino's favourite phrase is "The many
meanings of flowers
" (
花言葉の数々
,
Hanakotoba no kazukazu
).

Ino's favourite thing is the flower she gave Sakura when they were children.

According to
Hyō no Sho
, while in the
Academy
, Ino had an A in ninjutsu and positivity, and a B in taijutsu, genjutsu, cooperation, and classroom attitude.

Quotes

(To
Sakura
, when she asks her why she gave her a ribbon) "
Because… I thought it would be a waste for you to wither away as a bud. There's no meaning to a flower unless it blooms. It might turn out to be… a flower more beautiful than a
Cosmos
.
"

(To Sakura) "
Who're you calling "pig", you billboard brow?!
"

(To Sakura) "
You've bloomed into a beautiful flower.
"

(To
Chōji
 about
Asuma
) "
Listen, I know how you feel… the three of us, Team Ten… We went on a lot of missions with Asuma-sensei. Shikamaru and I don't want to fight him either. But it's
because
 we know him so well that we can stop him with the least risk to the army. Don't you remember what those earrings are supposed to represent Chōji?
"

(To
Shikamaru
) "
It's not a matter of can or can't, I'm doing it!
"

(To
Inojin
) "
I'm not closing up the flower shop. Whether it's using my sensory skills to protect the village or making people happy with the flower shop… They're both important to me and things I want to do. That's why I want you also to do what you want, and not worry about anything!
"
