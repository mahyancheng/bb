The perfume is an
antidote
 developed by
Sunagakure
 to break
genjutsu
 cast through speech by stimulating the users' sense of smell. The research unit was led by
Kankurō
. Its main ingredients are the Desert Orchid and Flare Grass, the rarity of the first making mass production unfeasible.

Gaara
 deemed that shinobi with long-distance fighting styles were to receive it, being less likely to fall under genjutsu themselves, and thus in a better position to help their team-mates. Temari in particular was picked, able to quickly spread the perfume across the battlefield with her
Wind Release
.
