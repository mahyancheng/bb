" (

,
Rōjin to Ryū no Me
) is episode 312 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Still searching thoroughly for any remaining factions of the enemy, the
Third Division
 came across another
reincarnated
 shinobi: Master
Chen
 — a renowned hero of
Konohagakure
 who was thought to have died during the
Third Shinobi World War
. As
Might Guy
 who is happy at the prospect on challenging such a famed
taijutsu
 master, Konoha's Sublime Green Beast of Prey soon finds himself being forced on the defensive by the old man. A shinobi is able to break away from the battle and in his search for reinforcements, finds
Rock Lee
 who rushes to Guy's aid.
 Seeing the legend he met once before as a
genin
 before him, Lee reveals his history with Chen before engaging the legend in battle. Ultimately, Lee is able to counter Chen's
Leaf Dragon God
 technique, using the
One-Man Front Lotus
 which he had engineered to counter the rotation of the winds of the former. As Chen's immortal body disintegrates, he remembers the time when he had his own student who was incapable of using
ninjutsu
, and how he had died during the Third Shinobi World War. With that, he notes that it was high time his grave served a purpose. With tears streaming down his face, Lee noted that he would bring offerings of rice balls to his grave.
