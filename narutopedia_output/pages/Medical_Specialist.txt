Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Because
Orochimaru
 is unable to fight in his current state,
Kabuto
 battles
Tsunade
 in his place. He informs Orochimaru that
Jiraiya
 is nearby and likely en route, so they relocate. Jiraiya,
Shizune
, and
Naruto
 just miss them, but pick up the trail. Unskilled with
taijutsu
 and otherwise outmatched, Kabuto tries to end the battle quickly. He damages Tsunade's chest to disable her while keeping her alive, but she shirks it off and attacks him. He recovers and attempts to take advantage of her fear of blood, but Jiraiya and the others appear between them.
