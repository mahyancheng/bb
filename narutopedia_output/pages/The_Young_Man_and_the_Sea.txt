Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Tsunade
 sends
Naruto
 to the
Land of Lightning
 under the guise of an
S-rank
 mission to keep him hidden away from the
Akatsuki
. Naruto leaves
Konoha
 with
Aoba
,
Yamato
,
Guy
, and three unknown
shinobi
. However, they find themselves held up at port due to a report of a monster attacking ships, making people afraid to set sail. When Guy and Aoba go out to see if they can solve the problem, they encounter an aggressive
giant marlin
, as well as a fisherman named
Yūsuke
. Yūsuke notifies them that the marlin has been in their waters for fifteen years and is responsible for the death of his
father
, and wishes to avenge him. In order to help him on this quest,
Yamato
 uses his
Wood Release
 to fashion a boat and a fishing pole with
Guy
 providing rowing power, tapping into his
Eight Gates
 to keep up with the marlin.

Yūsuke manages to tire out and defeat the marlin, considering his vengeance to be complete. The
jōnin
 wonder why the marlin, believed to be a
summon
 cast by a shinobi during the
Third Shinobi World War
, has not dispelled itself yet. Naruto notices a
Fūma Shuriken
 embedded near its head and pulls it out. No longer in pain, the marlin dispels itself home. The crew and fishermen of the port are free to sail once more; as Naruto heads to the Land of Lightning, he waves Yūsuke goodbye.
