This technique is very similar in both execution and result to the
Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique
. It is a cooperation ninjutsu where three users, after throwing
shuriken
 at their target and forming the necessary hand seals, can create corporeal replicas of the shuriken — turning a small amount of shuriken to a large amount in an instant with which to bombard the enemy. Unlike the Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique, however, this technique makes no use of the
Shadow Clone Technique
.
