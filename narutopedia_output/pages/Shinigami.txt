The
Shinigami
 (
死神
,
English TV:
 Reaper,
literally meaning:
 Death god) is the spectral entity summoned through the usage of certain
Uzumaki clan

fūinjutsu
.

Background

The Shinigami was first summoned by
Minato Namikaze
, the Fourth
Hokage
, as a last resort, with the intention of sealing the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 into his
infant son
. However, he wasn't able to seal the entirety of Kurama's
chakra
 into the infant, due to the immense amount of chakra the beast possessed being too much for the newborn. Using the Shinigami, Minato was able to
seal
 the
yin
 half of the tailed beast within himself, before going on to use
another sealing method
 to seal the
yang
 half of the fox within his son.

Personality

It loves eating souls more than anything.

Appearance

The Shinigami is a translucent, gaunt spectre with a demonic visage. It is much larger than an average human, possessing long, shaggy, white hair, from which two red horns protrude, as well as purple-hued skin. It is draped in a large white kimono and carries a set of prayer beads. When not using it, the Shinigami is almost always seen with a
tantō
 in its mouth. When removed, however, its mouth is revealed to be full of sharp, jagged teeth, and a very long, almost serpentine tongue. When sealing a target, a series of
cursed seals
 spread across its arms.

Abilities

The Shinigami's primary strength lies in its ability to forcibly extract the
souls
 of both its summoner and its summoner's target, cut them free with its tantō, and seal them within its belly. It does this through the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
 technique, primarily used by
Minato Namikaze
 and
Hiruzen Sarutobi
. The amount of the victim's soul that can be extracted and sealed is dependent on the summoner's chakra level proportionally to that of the victim's; regardless of the amount of success, the Shinigami will seal away the summoner's soul upon the technique's evocation.

Through use of a
special mask
 stored within the
Uzumaki clan temple
 outside of
Konohagakure
, the contents of its stomach can be
released
.

Part I

Konoha Crush






The Shinigami summoned by Hiruzen.



During the
Konoha Crush
, the Shinigami appeared as Hiruzen executed the Dead Demon Consuming Seal technique in an attempt to seal away the
First
 and
Second Hokage
's souls. As he bid a heartfelt goodbye to his teachers, he turned his attention to
Orochimaru
 and revealed the technique's double edge as he must sacrifice both his soul and those of his predecessors to the Shinigami. Intending to have Orochimaru join them in the spectre's stomach while throwing aside his former pupil's
Kusanagi
, Hiruzen attempted to seal Orochimaru's soul as well.
 After an hour of struggling, Hiruzen came to accept that his old age had left him too weak to completely seal Orochimaru away.
 Seeing that completely removing Orochimaru's soul was impossible, yet his desire to redeem himself for allowing his former student's escape, Hiruzen decided to instead have the Shinigami take Orochimaru's arms to rob him of using ninjutsu as his way of fittingly punishing Orochimaru for his obsession with power.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax






The souls being released from the Shinigami's stomach.



In an attempt to free the former
Hokage
's souls from the Shinigami's stomach, Orochimaru led
Sasuke
,
Suigetsu
, and
Jūgo
 to the
Uzumaki Clan's Mask Storage Temple
 to pick up a mask from the ruins, and then took the group to the underground hall in the
Naka Shrine
. Orochimaru proceeded to don the mask which invoked the Shinigami to possess his body. Orochimaru then cut open the Shinigami's stomach, a wound reflected on himself, to release the trapped contents inside the Shinigami.
