"
She of the Beginning
" (
はじまりのもの
,
Hajimari no Mono
) is episode 459 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Throughout the world, people's
chakra
 is drained and channelled through the
roots
 of the
God Tree
. The chakra is absorbed into
Madara
, transforming him into
Kaguya
. Kaguya senses the
Yin
 and
Yang
 powers in
Sasuke
 and
Naruto
, and flings them away with her hair. She confirms with her
Byakugan
 that they are reincarnations of
Asura
 and
Indra
.
Kakashi
 asks Kaguya her intentions, but she deems it pointless to explain to shinobi who tamper with chakra, ignorant of its meaning. Not wishing to damage the world with more fighting, Kaguya
teleports
 everyone, including herself, to a
lava-filled dimension
.
 While she hovers above, Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi,
Sakura
 and an unconscious
Obito
 begin falling towards the lava. Sasuke saves himself by summoning
Garuda
 to fly on it, then has Garuda catch Naruto. Kakashi saves Obito by pinning him to a wall with a kunai, and saves himself by pinning one end of an opened scroll to a wall with a kunai and hanging onto the other end like a rope with Sakura in his arms.

Kakashi surmises that they aren't in a
genjutsu
, but in an entirely different dimension. Sasuke explains to Naruto that he and him must not be killed or else the world will end because only they can seal Kaguya away. Suddenly, Kakashi's "rope" gets burned, causing him and Sakura to fall. As Naruto catches them with a
chakra arm
, Kaguya seizes the moment by shooting
hair needles
 at them. Sasuke activates Susanoo, blocking most of the hair needles, but a few strike Garuda's
tenketsu
, causing them all to fall. Naruto manages to activate his flight ability and catches his comrades with chakra arms. Intent on reuniting chakra once again, Kaguya releases a wave of
chakra fists
. Naruto manages to briefly counter her attack, but is overpowered, however, it creates an opening for Sasuke to attack with his Susanoo. Kaguya counters his attack, shattering Susanoo. After Sasuke
teleports
 to Naruto, Naruto creates a floating platform from a
Truth-Seeking Ball
 for Sasuke. Kaguya then
appears
 behind Naruto and Sasuke, and
paralyses
 them as they turn to see her crying face. As Kaguya thinks of her sons, Black Zetsu
manifests
 from her and begins
covering
 them and absorbing their chakra. Black Zetsu tells them about his role as Kaguya's will and as a manipulator of the history of shinobi from the moment he was born, just as Kaguya was first sealed.

Trivia

There are some errors shown in this episode:

Naruto is at times depicted with seven Truth-Seeking Balls, despite only possessing six.

In one scene, Sasuke is depicted without
Sharingan
 activated in his right eye.

During the clash against Naruto, Kaguya's lipstick disappears.

Despite Sakura's forehead protector falling in the lava, it appears when Sasuke says he had not intended to save Sakura or Kakashi.
