The
Hero Water
 (
英雄の水
,
Eiyu no Mizu
) is a specialised liquid from
Takigakure
. It is produced once every one hundred years from the giant tree that hides the village.

Overview

By drinking the water, it allows a ninja to have at least a ten-fold increase in
chakra
 for a short period of time. The chakra increase was so potent that, as
Suien
 demonstrated, the user can create a chakra shield to deflect kunai, similar to the
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
.

Drawback

In exchange for this power, the water shortens the user's life span proportional to the number of times their chakra increased, as
Shibuki
's
father
 died from the side-effects.
