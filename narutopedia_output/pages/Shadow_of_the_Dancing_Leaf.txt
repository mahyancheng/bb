The user moves close behind a target and carefully matches their movements, following them in the same way that a leaf is followed by its shadow. Simply mimicking a target in this way does no harm to them, but it's useful as a setup for other techniques, such as the
Front Lotus
 or the
Lion Combo
. Because of how difficult it can be to use this technique, most
genin
 are unlikely to be talented enough to perform it.

Trivia

Rin no Sho
 claims
Neji Hyūga
 is skilled enough to use Shadow of the Dancing Leaf,
 though he never actually has.

This is a Leaf-Style Taijutsu (
木ノ葉流体術
,
Konoha-Ryū Taijutsu
,
literally meaning:
 Tree Leaf-Style Body Technique).
