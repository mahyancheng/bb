"
The Vengeful
" (
復讐者
,
Fukushūsha
) is episode 305 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As the search to find their comrades' souls becomes frantic, both
Shino
 and
Ino
 will themselves to continue keeping their comrades alive. Within the barrier, the battle wages on between the
Sound Four
 and the members of the disbanded
Sasuke Recovery Team
. Meanwhile on the battlefield,
Naruto
 is finally able to get in touch with
HQ
 after finally finding someone from the
Communications Team
. When told that there was nothing that could be done as there was no-one in the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 that could
sense
 souls, Naruto lashes out at
Shikaku
 for his seeming indifference to the welfare of his own son, but Shikaku merely notes that as the Chief Strategist of the Alliance, it was his duty to keep a level head and co-ordinates their efforts on the battlefield.

Back within the
barrier
, as the
Konoha
-nins' efforts seem even more wasted, they are further perplexed by Shikamaru's constant aggravation of their opponents amidst their seemingly coordinated attacks. The Sound Four's true intention is soon revealed, as they note that they had become more powerful by carrying a vengeful will which was empowering them beyond their imagination — believing that
Orochimaru
 was the one to have
reincarnated
 them. This soon proves to be their undoing as their ill-will festered and grew to tremendous levels, seeping out of the barrier, allowing Naruto to
pin-point
 their location. Realising the rationale behind Shikamaru's indirect and aggravating attacks, on the other side of the barrier Naruto creates an
enormous Rasenshuriken
 and successfully destroys the barrier, freeing his comrade's souls which return to their bodies. Back in their bodies, the Alliance is overjoyed to see their comrades alive and well. Conversely, however, Naruto worries that negative feelings were still festering all over on the battlefield.
