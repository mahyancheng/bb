A unique
Hiden
 jutsu that is passed down to members of the
Onikuma clan
. Described as a "possession-type"
Summoning Technique
, the technique mutates the users arms into a beast-like form granting them enhanced strength and allowing them to stretch similarly to the
Soft Physique Modification
. Similar to
Jūgo's Clan's Kekkei Genkai
, this technique can prove mentally unstable at times as it can cause the user to assume a more bestial form when they become emotionally vulnerable resulting in them losing complete control over the technique. Enko Onikuma was prone to fits of rage which were triggered by feelings of loneliness caused by other's fear of her due to the jutsu's appearance. Until she understood what brought these fits, it required her team-mates to tranquillise her when she lost control.
