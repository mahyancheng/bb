Asuma Sarutobi
 (
猿飛アスマ
,
Sarutobi Asuma
) was a
jōnin
 of
Konohagakure
's
Sarutobi clan
 and a former member of the
Twelve Guardian Ninja
. He was also the leader of
Team 10
 which consists of
Shikamaru Nara
,
Ino Yamanaka
, and
Chōji Akimichi
.

Background






Asuma at his entrance ceremony.



Asuma was born to
Biwako
 and
Hiruzen Sarutobi
, the Third
Hokage
. During his
Academy
 entrance ceremony, Asuma became friends with
Kurenai Yūhi
. In the anime, during the
Chūnin Exams
, Asuma was placed on a team with Kurenai and
Raidō Namiashi
.
 He later cheered on his classmates during the third round of the Chūnin Exams.
 During the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
, Asuma along with the other young ninja were barred from participating in the defence of the village by
Shinku Yūhi
 and the other senior shinobi. Asuma then told Kurenai to calm down.
 A few years after the event, Asuma would become an uncle to
Konohamaru
.






Asuma and Chiriku while part of the Twelve Guardian Ninja.



About seven years before the start of the series, he had a disagreement with his father and left Konoha to pursue his personal interests. During his absence, he became one of the Twelve Guardian Ninja, a group that protected the Land of Fire's daimyō, indicated by the sash on his waist.
 During this time he developed a strong friendship with the monk
Chiriku
, who would go on to become the head monk of the
Fire Temple
. Prior to returning to Konoha to resume active military duty, he accumulated a bounty of 35 million
ryō
 on the black market, something he seemed to be particularly proud of since it was a testament of his skill, even bragging that his bounty was 5 million more than Chiriku.
 After returning to the village, Asuma resumed his jōnin duties and became a teacher of
Inomatsu
 and presumably some more students. In the anime, about twelve years after the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
, seeing his
classmate
 fall into deeper self-pity from losing
Obito Uchiha
 and
Rin Nohara
, Asuma, along with
Might Guy
 and Kurenai decided to speak with the Third Hokage, voicing their disapproval of Kakashi being in Anbu with such bitterness and suggested instead that he be re-assigned as a jōnin sensei in the hopes of restoring Kakashi's kindness.

Personality






A young Asuma playing shōgi with Hiruzen.



Asuma was typically a laid-back individual, and did not get himself involved in things unless absolutely necessary, as seen when he decided not to help save
Hinata Hyūga
 during her fight in the Chūnin Exams. He was a heavy smoker, but, despite this, he would abruptly break the habit under certain circumstances, such as when his father died
 or learned that Kurenai was pregnant.
 Not always seeing eye to eye with his father, Asuma later came to respect his father's role as
Hokage
: referring to him as a great father, and was proud to have been born into the Sarutobi clan.






Asuma and Shikamaru playing shōgi.



Despite Asuma's very blunt personality, often calling his students what they were unreservedly, a "glutton" (Chōji), a "loud mouth" (Ino), and a "slacker" (Shikamaru), he had a very good relationship with all three. He often took them to
Yakiniku Q
 for lunch and dinner where more often than not Chōji would eat too much and Asuma had to pay more and apologise emphatically to the owner. To help them overcome their underachieving natures, he attempted to use bribery and outright trickery to manipulate them into doing what he wanted. This was seen most with Chōji, who Asuma was frequently able to entice into action with the promise of food and even Shikamaru whom he had to use games like
shōgi
 on to assess his skill level. Out of his students, Asuma spent the most time with and was closest to Shikamaru. Asuma and Shikamaru often played shōgi or Go in their free time, though Asuma was never able to beat Shikamaru.
 It was Asuma who first discovered that the lazy Shikamaru was actually a genius, with an I.Q. over 200.

Throughout the series it had been heavily hinted that Asuma was romantically involved with fellow jōnin
Kurenai Yūhi
, having been close to her since childhood. The two appeared together in most of their scenes, and the other characters made it a point to note this fact on several occasions. When
Kakashi Hatake
 found the two together at a dumpling shop, Kakashi asked if they were on a date, to which Asuma responded by quickly changing the subject.
 In a flashback, Asuma was shown buying flowers for a person he refused to name, though Ino asked that he say hello to Kurenai for her anyway, to which Asuma nervously asked how she knew about it.
 During Asuma's battle with
Hidan
 and
Kakuzu
, Kurenai was often shown wondering about his progress, appearing anxious. When she heard of his death, she fell to her knees grief stricken. She later laid flowers on his grave during his funeral. The truth of their relationship was then made clear when Kurenai revealed that she was pregnant with Asuma's child.

Appearance





Asuma's full appearance.



Asuma was a tall man, with brown eyes, olive skin, short black spiky hair, and a beard. His clothing consisted of the standard Konoha ninja uniform with the sleeves rolled up halfway, a darker-green
flak jacket
, regular shinobi sandals and
forehead protector
. He also wore a sash that had the kanji for "Fire" (
火
) marked on it around his waist, a pair of black bangles, and bandages wrapped around the arms of his sleeves.

As a genin, he wore a white short-sleeved shirt with a blue and black collar over chain-mail armour, along with a simple white vest, a pair of black pants, and a white belt.
 In the anime, it was shown that while he was a member of the Twelve Guardian Ninja, he wore a simple long sleeved shirt with bandages on the arms, pants, that sash denoting he was a guardian and a jacket with a fur collar. He also had his
trench knives
 with him at that point.

Abilities






Asuma using Welcoming Approach: Thousand-Armed Murder against Hidan.



Asuma was a highly talented, well-respected
jōnin
 of his village, gaining praise from
Shikaku Nara
 of being a great shinobi not easy to take down.
 He established a great record in military prowess — something many upcoming shinobi greatly admired.
 His abilities earned him a position into the Twelve Guardian Ninja — an elite hand-picked team which served to protect the
Land of Fire
's
daimyō
 — a role which later earned him a bounty of 35,000,000
ryō
.
 He could effortlessly take down nine
Oto
-nin during the
Konoha Crush
, noted to have been
chūnin
-level or above,
 and was able to compete against
Hidan
, a powerful member of the
Akatsuki
, while also protecting his team.

Physical Prowess






Asuma with his Chakra Blades.



Asuma was hailed as Konoha's foremost skilled ninja in close-ranged melee combat.
 His battle style revolved mainly around
taijutsu
, combined with his special
trench knives
 to create a melee-type fighting style. These knives are made of a special metal that is capable of easily being
infused
 with
chakra
. He was also physically strong enough to block
Kisame Hoshigaki
's
Samehada
 using his trench knives.

Ninjutsu

With his
Flying Swallow
, he could increase the cutting power of the blades to easily pierce through solid rocks and metal. He could also
extend the blades
 with his chakra to injure an enemy several feet out of the blade's physical range. In the anime, Asuma was taught how to use the ultimate technique of the Fire Temple, the
Welcoming Approach: Thousand-Armed Murder
. While admitting to not be as skilled with it as
Chiriku
, he was able to effectively manifest the spirit to attack and defend to a certain extent.

Nature Transformation






Asuma using Fire Release: Ash Pile Burning.



Asuma possessed an affinity to
Wind Release
. He would mainly combine it with his trench knives to increase their lethality. As explained by Asuma to Naruto, due to having an affinity for the nature, the trench knives will gain enough striking power to pierce through rock.
 He could also release a
powerful stream of wind
, and in the anime, use his wind-based chakra to
levitate
 his trench knives and control them remotely.

Asuma was also able to use
Fire Release
. With it, he can use the
Fire Release: Ash Pile Burning
 technique to breathe out a thick cloud of gunpowder-infused ash that causes a devastating explosion when ignited, leaving the target with third-degree burns.

Chūnin Exams

When Chōji, fearing the competition, contemplated forfeiting his match during the preliminaries of the Chūnin Exam, Asuma convinced him not to by offering to take him out for "all you can eat" barbecue (yakiniku or Korean kalbi). Asuma also claimed that he'd stop the match if it got out of hand, as the other jōnin did during
Hinata Hyūga
's match. Both Ino and Shikamaru noted to themselves that Asuma didn't actually help in that instance.

Konoha Crush

Asuma rescues Shikamaru.



During the Konoha Crush, Shikamaru was left by himself to defend against a group of invading Oto-nin. Later, just as Shikamaru had run out of options, and the nine Oto-nin were about to finish him off, Asuma appeared and single-handedly defeated the group saving his student. After the invasion, he attended his
father
's funeral.

Search for Tsunade

Search for Tsunade






Asuma clashes with Kisame.



During his brief battle with
Itachi Uchiha
 and
Kisame Hoshigaki
, Asuma managed to catch Kisame off-guard with his trench knives, leaving a cut on Kisame's cheek below the eye. Witnessing the blade made of wind chakra, Kisame switches to ninjutsu using the
Water Release: Water Shark Bullet Technique
 with Asuma seemingly still battle stationed with the blades. Kakashi Hatake arrived in time to copy the technique, and used it to block the attack, much to Asuma's surprise. Asuma, Kurenai, and Kakashi then faced off with the two
Akatsuki
 members, only for Kakashi to fall victim to Itachi's
Tsukuyomi
.
Might Guy
 arrived just in time to stall the Akatsuki duo and buy time for the rest of his comrades who were about to get targeted by Kisame, leading to him coaching Asuma and Kurenai on the essentials on how to fight against a
Sharingan
-using shinobi when the pair fled to pursue
Naruto Uzumaki
, their true target.

Asuma was later seen at
Tsunade
's inauguration ceremony as the new
Hokage
, amongst the villagers.

Sasuke Recovery Mission

Main article:
Sasuke Recovery Mission

Prior to Chōji's setting out with the squad assembled by Shikamaru to track down the renegade
Sasuke Uchiha
 and the
Sound Four
, Asuma berated him for eating so much and not training enough. After Chōji's recovery from his battle against Sound ninja
Jirōbō
, he quickly regained his lost weight, but also approached Asuma for more intense training, which Asuma agreed to, with some admiration.

Mizuki Tracking Mission

Main article:
Mizuki Tracking Mission

In the anime, Asuma and Kurenai were dispatched by
Tsunade
 to bring the
chūnin
 criminal
Mizuki
 in for questioning, regarding his suspected involvement with
Orochimaru
. The pair arrived at the Leaf Village Maximum Security Prison, only to be greeted by a swarm of released inmates, including the
Legendary Stupid Brothers
,
Fūjin
 and
Raijin
. Outnumbered, the two were beaten unconscious and later found by
Naruto
 who rushed them to the hospital for medical treatment.

Interlude

In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths

Main article:
In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths

About two years after Naruto left the village with
Jiraiya
 for training, Konoha decided to host an early Chūnin Exams alongside Sunagakure. Later, as Team Asuma began discussing their joining the exams, it became noted that with Shikamaru already a chūnin and therefore ineligible to join, it left the rest of the team short.
 After the first exam concluded — held in Konoha — Asuma and Kurenai acted as the second exam's supervisors, informing the genin teams that weren't part of the first 30 teams to arrive at the checkpoint, that they already lost and couldn't participate in the second round. Later, after the second exam began, he, Kurenai and
Guy
 received word from Tsunade to be on guard for potential assassins towards Gaara as many still rejected him as Kazekage.

Part II

Asuma made his Part II début standing at the Third Hokage's grave, where he commented on how he was finally beginning to understand what the Third had taught him. Asuma confessed that he'd always been detached from Konoha, but after seeing how his father sacrificed himself for the village, he was now proud to be a member of the
Sarutobi clan
.

Later, when Naruto began training to master wind chakra, he came to Asuma, who was also a wind-type user, for help. Asuma agreed to give him pointers, if he agreed to pay for his team's next meal (which, Naruto forgot, included Chōji).

Twelve Guardian Ninja

Main article:
Twelve Guardian Ninja

In the anime, when Team Kakashi returned to Konoha from their failed mission, he recognised a young monk named
Sora
 from the
Fire Temple
 who accompanied them back. He invited Sora and the boys of the
Konoha 11
 to join him at a restaurant to have a guys day. Some time after, he revealed to Sora that he knew his father and that he killed him for trying to kill the
Daimyō
. An enraged Sora tried to attack him, only failing as a few Anbu members got in his way and Sora stormed off.






Asuma confronting Kazuma.



Later, the Konoha was attacked by members of
Furido's 4-Man Team
, reviving many shinobi. Asuma recognised some of the revived shinobi from the
Twelve Guardian Ninja
, who planned on using a
powerful technique
 to destroy Konoha. He fought
Kitane
 and ultimately overpowers him. With the three members of Furido's 4-Man Team killed, the leader,
Furido
, remained. Asuma finds out that Fūrido was
Kazuma
, Sora's father, the man Asuma thought he killed. Having unleashed the seal he embedded on Sora around 10 years prior Kazuma informs Asuma and Naruto that Sora is a
Pseudo-Jinchūriki
 of the nine tails. Asuma engages Kazuma in battle, and later with Sai's help, Asuma finished Kazuma off. Ultimately, Naruto is able to stop Sora by releasing the nine tails' chakra sealed inside him.

When the invaders didn't succeed, Sora having came to his senses, departed from Konoha. Afterwards, Asuma was seen playing shōgi with Shikamaru.

Akatsuki Suppression Mission

Main article:
Akatsuki Suppression Mission






Asuma's team begin their search.



Asuma was teamed up with
Shikamaru
,
Kotetsu Hagane
, and
Izumo Kamizuki
 as members of the
Twenty Platoons
. His team, along with the entire group, was ordered to search for and, if possible, capture a pair of Akatsuki members who had entered the Land of Fire. Asuma and his team eventually tracked down the Akatsuki members,
Hidan
 and
Kakuzu
, at a
Bounty Station
, where they quickly discovered that Hidan was immortal after their first attack. Hidan ordered Kakuzu to stay out of it, wanting to do this on his own. Asuma decided to be the one to physically confront him and took him on in battle while Shikamaru backed him up from a distance with his shadows, keeping Hidan on his toes.






Asuma decapitates Hidan.



The situation worsened, when Hidan's counter-attack resulted in him becoming 'linked' to Asuma through a
ritual
. Hidan assumed a Grim Reaper-like form, causing any bodily damage to himself to be shared with Asuma, while at the same time not hindering himself at all. With some quick thinking by Shikamaru who managed to break Hidan's ritual and pin him down, Asuma was able to decapitate him with his chakra-extended trench knives. Surprisingly, Hidan's severed head started to talk, uttering expletives at Asuma and then Kakuzu for not helping him.






Asuma dying amongst his team.



Kakuzu finally stepped in as he admonished his partner for letting his guard down, and briefly attacked Asuma so he couldn't stop him from sewing Hidan's head back onto his body, and to prevent him from escaping. With Hidan's body restored, Hidan resumed the ritual, and impaled himself in the heart. Though the blow did not instantly kill Asuma, it was still quite fatal. The rest of Team 10 arrived as back-up, which, combined with a telepathic call from
Pain
, forced the Akatsuki duo to leave. Before dying, Asuma left some parting words with his students, and smoked one last cigarette.

Later, while Shikamaru exacted revenge upon Hidan for killing Asuma, Asuma appeared before Shikamaru, and congratulated him for finally defeating the immortal. After entrusting his
Will of Fire
 to Shikamaru, Asuma disappeared in a puff of cigarette smoke just before his student finished off Hidan with a huge explosion.
 Also, in his memory from the flashback, Shikamaru was finally able to understand who the "King" of Shōgi was in the real world. It is the next generation of shinobi, like Asuma's and Kurenai's unborn child, and how they would learn to care and live peacefully by the great shinobi in the present day. That was why Asuma entrusted his baby to Shikamaru, as apprentice and future sensei.

In the anime, Asuma was summoned by Kabuto Yakushi to battle
Team Kakashi
, who were investigating the massacre that he brought about in the
Tonika Village
 to gain access to
The Hole
. Quickly after being summoned, Asuma's coffin vanished, leading Kabuto to question whether the Impure World Reincarnation was still incomplete.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Asuma reincarnated, alongside Hizashi and Dan.



In preparation for the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Asuma was
reincarnated
 by
Kabuto Yakushi
 to fight against the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. He was later mobilised alongside
Hizashi Hyūga
 and
Dan Katō
. Informed by Dan of their current situation, he stated that he had an ominous feeling of what was to come. Relocating to the
Land of Lightning
's coast, Asuma emerged from the sea amongst the
White Zetsu Army
 and a few other reincarnated shinobi, before engaging the opposing
First Division
. Confronting
Chōza Akimichi
 with Dan initially, he soon separated from them and began fighting other shinobi, engulfing several in an enormous
explosion
.






Asuma attempts to attack Chōji.



Asuma is later confronted by his
former students
 where he praised them on their growth before he engaged them in combat. Moving involuntarily, Asuma attempted to provide what assistance he could by advising them on the best methods to counteract his attacks. Although hesitant,
Shikamaru
 and
Ino
 are able to fight regardless of their reluctance to harm their teacher, but
Chōji
 could not bring himself to attack his beloved teacher. This created an opportunity for Asuma to use his
Wind Release: Dust Cloud Technique
, however, Ino managed to push Chōji out of the path of the attack. Asuma tried in vain to provoke Chōji, and even went as far as to call him fat, yet ultimately forced his comrades to come to his aid once again.






Asuma bids farewell to his students, before being sealed.



Ino took
control
 of Chōji's body in order to fight Asuma in his place, but when she attempts to press the importance of their actions to Chōji, Asuma exploited her distraction by attacking with his
Fire Release: Ash Pile Burning
 technique. Chōza, however, dived in front of the attack, protecting them from harm and finally providing Chōji with the necessary motivation after remembering the oath he swore as the next head of the Akimichi. Observing Chōji's new found confidence and
metamorphosis
, Asuma happily encouraged them to defeat him. Overcome by Ino and Shikamaru's
combined

efforts
, Asuma was unable to avoid Chōji's
attack
 and was sent flying into a nearby cliff, where he is ironically
immobilised
 with his previous
weapons
. After complimenting his students' on their perfect
formation
 he thanked them, before being completely
bound
 and
sealed
 by the
Sealing Team
.

Main article:
Time Slip Arc

In the anime, an adult Sasuke and Naruto's future son,
Boruto Uzumaki
, followed
Urashiki Ōtsutsuki
 travelling back in time, arriving shortly after Sasuke's defection from Konoha, to protect the young Naruto from being abducted by the enemy. While Sasuke and Boruto pretended to be travelling performers so as to not change the timeline, Boruto was ultimately invited to join Naruto and Team Asuma at a barbecue restaurant, much to Asuma's dismay at needing to spend even more than usual.

Legacy






Asuma's gravestone.



Though somewhat understated, the legacy Asuma left behind was one of great value. Within Konoha, and the wider shinobi world he left a sterling record of military prowess which many young Konoha shinobi look up to, wanting to emulate. He is also forever recognised for this prowess having been selected as one of the twelve people deemed strong enough to protect the
leader
 of their country. Though initially also confused about the role of the
Hokage
 and the
Will of Fire
 which his father told him of, Asuma came to understand all of these in time and also came to appreciate his father, and the role the Hokage played in protecting the villagers. Along with this, Asuma was also responsible for training the current generation of the famed
Ino–Shika–Chō
 trio who are the future leaders of their respective clans as well as completing the all-important
ceremony
 concerning the three clans and the Sarutobi. He was also integral in assisting
Naruto Uzumaki
 with his
nature transformation
 training with
Wind Release
. Asuma left behind lover Kurenai Yūhi whom he fathered a
child
 with. This child he views as his "
king
" whom he asked his student Shikamaru to protect with his dying breath and years later his daughter would follow the footsteps of him and Asuma's father.

In the anime, Asuma's students continued his tradition of taking their respective
children
 to Yakiniku Q to celebrate accomplishments.

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Asuma Sarutobi

The name "Asuma" means "tomorrow truth" (
明日真
), paralleling his daughter Mirai's name which means "future". His family name "Sarutobi" means "monkey jump" (
猿飛
).

Studio Pierrot's Settei sheets of Asuma show that he was 126 cm when enrolling in the Academy and 150 cm around the time of the Kannabi Bridge incident.

Asuma and
his father
 both died on the 80th episode of their respective series: Hiruzen having died on the 80th episode of Part I, and Asuma having died on the 80th episode of Part II.

During a question and answer session held at Tokyo's Jump Fest '09,
Masashi Kishimoto
 stated that he was thinking of making Kurenai and Asuma's child a girl, which he follows through with.

Studio Pierrot has consistently given him the height of 190 cm, instead of 190.8cm as his Databook profiles gives him. In Shippuden Ep 76,
The Next Step
, he is listed in the collection centre Bingo Book as 6'5" or 195.58cm.

According to the databook(s):

Asuma's hobby was to play shōgi.

Asuma wished to duel Shikamaru in a game of shōgi.

Asuma's favourite foods were
sausage
 and
tororo

soba
. His least favourite food was asparagus.

Asuma had completed 719 official missions in total: 111 D-rank, 193 C-rank, 217 B-rank, 178 A-rank, 20 S-rank.

Asuma's favourite phrase was "Not right now!" (
今のナシ!
,
Ima no nashi!
).

Quotes

(To
Ino
, before he died) "
Ino, you are strong willed, and dependable. Chōji and Shikamaru, they are total goof-offs. Keep them in line. And, don't let Sakura beat you. In ninjutsu, or romance.
"

(To
Chōji
, before he died) "
Chōji, you're a kind man who cares for his comrades. That's why… you'll become a shinobi more powerful than everyone else. Be more confident in yourself. And… maybe diet a little.
"

(To
Shikamaru
, before he died) "
And Shikamaru. You're so smart… and have great sense as a shinobi. You could definitely become Hokage. But… you're too lazy… You'd probably hate it. I never even beat you once at shōgi… Ah, yes… Remember our talk about the King?…
"

(To Shikamaru, before he died) "
The "kings" are the unborn children who will grow up to take care of the leaf. One is still in Kurenai's womb… hers and my child. Take care of my "king"!
"

(Last words) "
I want one last smoke.
"

(To
Team Asuma
 about his last words before being sealed) "
Then let me add to them with something I couldn't say back then… I've got nothing more to say to you three. Your Ino-Shika-Chō formation was perfect!
"
