This squad was created to protect a range of
daimyō
 from being taken by
Akatsuki
 during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

History

The team came up with the strategy of rotating the safe house that the daimyō were in at odd times so that they were never in any one place for too long. Shinobi and traps were also left at each station in order to capture anyone who attempted to attack the daimyō.
Black Zetsu
 was ordered to capture the daimyō to be used as bargaining chips to get the
Eight-Tails
 and
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 out of confinement. When Zetsu attacked the first safe house, he encountered a trap comprised of puppets that roughly resembled the daimyō. When he found them a second time, he was confronted by
Mei
 and her team. Even though both the Eight and Nine Tails are out in the open, Zetsu continues to fight the protection squad in order to keep them from returning to the Alliance, to have their forces remain separated. The squad was later supported by one of
Naruto
's
shadow clones
. Black Zetsu is later incapacitated by
Chōjūrō
.

Trivia

In the manga, the team is comprised of only Konoha and Kiri shinobi.
