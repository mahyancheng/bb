Gaara Hiden: A Sandstorm Mirage

Gaara Hiden: A Sandstorm Mirage

After Hakuto's first meeting with Gaara, Shigezane and Hakuto's older sister,
Shijima
, stage her kidnapping. Shigezane travels with her towards the
Land of Fire
 to begin a new life together, and attempts to cover their trail. Nevertheless, they are tracked down by Gaara to some ruins near the Hōki family's compound; Shijima is with him. Shijima, pretending anger, begins attacking Shigezane, which he counters using water from deep underground. Once Shijima is defeated, Shigezane turns his attacks towards Gaara, who defends using his
sand
. But Shigezane is not primarily concerned with injuring Gaara, as his attacks are instead meant to convert the area to quicksand.

Shijima is caught in the quicksand. Gaara, in order to save her, wraps her in sand with him and is pulled under. Shigezane and Hakuto continue towards the Land of Fire, but just as they reach the border they are once again confronted by Gaara and Shijima. Hakuto, feeling guilty, tries to explain what they're doing. But Gaara is already aware of their relationship and guesses that
somebody
 arranged their marriage in order to force her to elope, thus embarrassing Gaara publicly. Gaara has no intention of breaking up Shigezane and Hakuto, but wants them to return to Suna so that Shigezane's skills can benefit the village.

Shigezane is flattered, but cannot go back. Since Gaara can't let them leave Suna, fighting is the only option. Having learned from the Fourth Kazekage how to fight a
jinchūriki
 of
Shukaku
 such as Gaara, Shigezane attacks Gaara and manages to pierce Gaara's Shield of Sand. This forces Gaara to use his
Magnet Release
 to reinforce his Shield of Sand, allowing him to move close to Shigezane and hold him at his mercy. Shijima threatens Gaara to let him go, finally being open about her desire to help Shigezane and Hakuto. Already knowing of her involvement, Gaara restrains her and strikes with his
Sand Sword
. Rather than strike Shijima, Gaara hits
Metoro Konjiki
, who has been secretly following them for largely unrelated reasons.

After questioning Metoro, Gaara kills Metoro with his
Sand Waterfall Funeral
. Seeing this, Shijima, Hakuto, and Shigezane lose their resolve and wait for the same fate. Gaara points out how effective his Sand Waterfall Funeral is at eliminating all traces of Metoro and once more repeats that he can't let Hakuto and Shigezane abandon Suna. Hearing this, they realise that Gaara plans to fake their deaths so that they can be together. At that moment,
Shikamaru Nara
 of
Konohagakure
 appears, his help having been requested by Gaara. He will file a report testifying that he witnessed Shigezane kill Hakuto, that Gaara executed Shigezane, and will meanwhile help them settle in Konoha under new identities.
