"
Terror: Steaming Danger Tyranny
" (
恐怖・蒸危暴威
,
Kyōfu – Jōki Bōi
) is episode 302 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Ōnoki
 is revealed to be a
sand clone
, shocking the
Second Mizukage
 as the
sand
 rose up to seal him. However, before the
tags
 can be completely applied,
Gaara
's
Desert Layered Imperial Funeral
 explodes and the
Mizukage
's ominous face appears in the sky above them. As hail begins to fall, Ōnoki explains that this was not
genjutsu
 again, but the Second's
Steaming Danger Tyranny
 technique. As a chibi-like clone forms before them and begins to attack the
Fourth Division
, Gaara sets out to find the real Mizukage who, as the
Tsuchikage
 noted, had been left severely weakened after using this technique.

Finding him, Gaara moves to immediately seal the Mizukage, but once again before the seals can be applied, the clones intervenes this time, ripping them off the sand pyramid.
Popping
 his head out from atop the pyramid, the Second greets his opponents serenely before ducking back in to avoid a volley of
shuriken
 launched at him. Commenting that this was a good spot to hide, the Mizukage tells the
Kazekage
 and Tsuchikage that he would no longer divulge the mechanisms behind his techniques, because if they were unable to defeat him, they had no hope of taking on the
opposition
's leader. Narrowly protecting his division from another explosion, Gaara then directly takes on the clone and is successfully able to stop the clone after using a mixture of his sand drenched in hail and his
father
's
gold dust
 to both halt the clones movements and stop it from exploding by keeping it cool.

Greatly impressed by this feat, the Second beams at Gaara stating that he and
Naruto Uzumaki
 who had made his way to the battlefield eventually made a good combination. Before being sealed, the Second declares that he had found the golden egg amongst the current
Kage
 after all. Elsewhere on the battlefield, it is revealed that before being sealed away,
Mū
 had
split
 himself in half. Unable to free his other half,
Kabuto Yakushi
 contemplates his next move which would buy him enough time to summon his
trump card
. On the
Alliance
's side, everything has come to a standstill in the face of the threat of the
White Zetsu Army
 clones
infiltrating
 their ranks, especially at the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
.
