Plot Overview






Genie's bottle.



When
Naruto Uzumaki
 found a bottle and opened it, Genie came out of the bottle and claimed that he would grant them three wishes, though no one believed him. To verify the Genie's claim, Naruto wished for an entire plate of barbeque. The Genie granted his wish and notified Team 7 that they now had two remaning wishes. The trio told the Genie to wait while they think of their next wishes. Genie complied, but told them that they had used another wish. The Genie did go back to his bottle and the genin (excluding
Hinata
 and
Chōji
) proceeded to fight over its posession, each wanting to make the last wish for themselves.

After much fighting, the Genie reappeared and the genin prepared to make their wish. However,
Kakashi
 arrived and asked for some change before they could do so. The Genie granted him his wish and disappeared, promising to return in another thousand years, much to everyone's dismay.
