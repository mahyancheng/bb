The most basic and versatile form of explosive clay.

Usage

The user moulds their clay into figures, often resembling animals and insects. Depending on the size of the animal, the user can use them as a mount in order to fly. Some even share the abilities of the creatures they are modelled after, such as those resembling birds which are capable of flight. This feature makes them excellent for covert operations. The explosive power of these clay creatures are the lowest level of the user's bombs, but nonetheless effective.
