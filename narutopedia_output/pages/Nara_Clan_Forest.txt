The Nara clan's forest.



This forest is a large expanse of land owned by
Konohagakure
's
Nara clan
. Located on the outskirts of Konoha, it is a unique forest within the
Land of Fire
. Many
deer
 reside here as the clan looks after them and often times use their antlers in medicines, one such being the remedy to the
Akimichi clan
's
Three Coloured Pills
. According to
Shikamaru Nara
, no one but members of the clan are allowed to step foot into the forest without permission.

The
Akatsuki
 member
Hidan
 — though currently still alive — is buried here, trapped in a grave made for him by Shikamaru. As he buried him, Shikamaru swore to Hidan that the Nara would keep him buried there for all eternity.
 In the anime,
Kabuto Yakushi
 was able to sneak into the forest and collect some of Hidan's DNA for
later use
.
