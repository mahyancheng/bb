Viz:
 The True Choice!!) is chapter 382 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Although he figures out who
Pain
 is,
Jiraiya
 can neither speak nor move. His life begins to fade and he reflects on the many failures of his life; his inability to protect the
Third Hokage
 or
Fourth Hokage
; his inability to save
Orochimaru
; his inability to win the heart of
Tsunade
; and, most sadly for him, his inability to die with honour. He then remembers how
Naruto
 was named after the protagonist of his
first book
, making him Naruto's godfather. Since Naruto's
nindō
 is to never give up, Jiraiya, as Naruto's teacher, decides that that should be his nindō too. He finds the energy to relay a message to
Fukasaku
, confident that Naruto will save the world.
