While
preparing
 to enter
Tailed Beast Mode
,
Gaara
 covers his body with
sand
. With this sand, he is able to form mouths all over his body. Gaara inhales with these and his regular mouth, causing his body to swell up. He then exhales this
wind
, mixing it with sand that's been coated with his
chakra
. The resulting sandstorm covers a wide area in front of Gaara and is very powerful, enough to knock down trees and deal extensive physical damage. For these reasons, it is a useful attack against multiple opponents.
