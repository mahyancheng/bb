Synopsis

In a flashback,
Sunagakure
 celebrates a victory over
Iwagakure
 and recognised
Pakura
 as their hero.
Maki
, Pakura's student, wanted to train with her despite being tired from the previous skirmish and Pakura praises Maki for her fighting spirit and resolve. After their training session, Pakura advised Maki to be strong so she can protect her loved ones and the village. Meanwhile, at a meeting of the Seniors they discuss a truce with
Kirigakure
 despite the conditions of the truce being against in their favour and notes that they would have to use Pakura again, to solve the issue. Later, Suna mourns the death of Pakura and vows to destroy Iwagakure in order to avenge her death.

In a present time, the
Third Division
 struggles to fight the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
 as well as
Gari
 and Pakura.
Monga
 manages to incapacitate Gari, but is killed by Pakura, who confronts Maki and blames Sunagakure for turning her into a sacrifice during a doubtful truce with Kirigakure.
Ruka
 intervenes their argument that Kiri had no longer its bloody and vicious reputation under the new leadership of the
Fifth Mizukage
. Pakura continues her attack and Maki tells to Pakura that
Allied Shinobi Forces
 will improve its relations and might change the future then she begs Pakura to remain the hero that she died as to the village. Still sceptic, Pakura attempts to attack but she is stopped by
Omoi
 and
Zaji
. In their successful coordinated attack, they manage to incapacitate Pakura but Gari arrives. Gari targets Maki but Pakura corners Gari with her
flaming orbs
 and tells Maki to flee. After fleeing, Gari and Pakura have their personalities erased once more. As the group successfully retreat to the forest, Maki goes off on her own to pray.
