Tsubaki Kurogane
 (
鉄ツバキ
,
Kurogane Tsubaki
) is a young
samurai
 from the
Land of Iron
 and
Mifune
's most recent disciple. She is currently an exchange-student in
Konohagakure
, serving as a member of genin squad,
Team 15
.

Background

When Tsubaki became a student to Mifune, she befriended a senior disciple,
Sazanka
, looking up to his commitment to honing his skills. They frequently trained together and discussed their goals. During a tournament, it was rumoured the winner's prize was the right to claim
Kurosawa
 when Mifune retired. Tsubaki advanced to the final round, when she had to face Sazanka. Despite him having the clear advantage throughout the fight, she was able to exploit an opening at the last moment, defeating him. The loss shattered Sazanka, who went on to kill his other fellow disciples when they tried to stop him from claiming Kurosawa by force. After Sazanka's actions forced him to flee the Land of Iron as a wanted criminal, Tsubaki blamed herself for Sazanka's change.

Personality






Tsubaki's lighter side.



Very mature for her age, Tsubaki is a very driven young girl. Disciplined and committed to the task at hand, Tsubaki had adapted a no-nonsense mentality. She has a strong commitment to the traditions and ancient ways of samurai and likewise to honour her teacher's wishes, taking great pride in being one and is open about that. At the same time, this driven nature has led her to be somewhat arrogant and distant to others. While overall very respectful in the way she talks to her superiors, she can be rather condescending to all others. Viewing the shinobi of the modern and peaceful era as sloppy and lacking of commitment, she openly considers her reassignment as a member of a shinobi team as temporary and purely an obligation. However, upon seeing how committed her new team was to protecting the each other, Tsubaki began to respect what Konohagakure has to offer in soldiers. During her time in Konoha, while still proud of the Land of Iron's commitment to tradition, she came to admit it also constrained the country, making it harder to progress. She has also come to see her reassignment as both a chance to grow as a warrior and valuing the friendships she has made.

Despite her normal attitude, Tsubaki is not without some childish traits. Having committed herself so much to her training, she is fascinated by the more modern cuisines of the world, showing a special enjoyment for fries. At the same time, wanting to maintain her poise, Tsubaki prefers to keep her enjoyment of such things secret. Also, she is shown to be rather competitive. While proud of her high individual skills compared to the genin she works with, she hates the idea of losing, even in a team-effort. Likewise, while openly proud as a samurai, she is eager to prove her might in comparison to shinobi during official competitions. Her goal is to rise through the ranks and help her country grow.

Appearance

Tsubaki is a young girl of short stature. She has large pink eyes and thick eyebrows. She is fair-skinned with straight brown hair reaching her lower back with cropped bangs, apart from chin-length strands that frame the sides of her face. She keeps her hair in a high-ponytail secured by a headpiece with two pink flower-like beads. She dresses in a traditional samurai attire, consisting of a white robe with pink lining on the colour and sleeves, a turtle-neck undershirt, shin-length pink pants, black legging and socks, and straw-sandals. She also wears black arm guards that cover her forearms.

Secured regularly at her hip is a sword with a black cloth hilt, and scabbard with the hilt shaped like two opposite-pointing arrows. While travelling, she wears a traditional umbrella-shaped bamboo hat and a pink cloak.

Abilities

Trained personally by the general of the Land of Iron, Tsubaki is a very skilled warrior. Despite her young age, she was easily able to defeat two wanted criminals in the
Bingo Books
. Konoha leadership considers Tsubaki's skill in comparison to a shinobi of
chūnin
-level.

Tsubaki quarrels with Wasabi.



When
Sumire Kakei
 of
Konohagakure
 was transferred to the
Scientific Ninja Weapons Team
, this left her genin team of
Team 15
 shorthanded. The
Seventh Hokage
 contacted the Land of Iron, asking them to send a replacement for the team as way to close the gap between samurai and shinobi. Tsubaki was selected. Upon arriving in Konohagakure, she was quickly displeased by the apparent lack of disciple the village had. She soon met her new team, consisting of
Hanabi Hyūga
,
Wasabi Izuno
, and
Namida Suzumeno
. Tsubaki made no attempt to connect with her new team, believing it would only impair her own abilities. Later, by chance Wasabi and Namida stumbled upon a wanted criminal. Tsubaki quickly caught up to her new team-mates, impressed by their devotion to protecting their allies. Seeing the shinobi world in a new light, Tsubaki was determined to help the two genin and quickly defeated the criminals. Afterwards, Tsubaki met Sumire, who voiced her approval in Tsubaki as being her replacement, much to her appreciation.

Tsubaki exhausts herself from overusing her chakra.



Later, Tsubaki found to her dismay that since joining Team 15, its overall performance had declined. Furious at the idea of being the weakest genin team, she convinced Wasabi and Namida to treat each mission as a challenge between each other, seeing who was the best for the mission. This ultimately backfired, as this overly-competitive made them lose sight of their true objective and fail in high assignments. Ultimately, Hanabi decided to suspend Team 15 until they learned to better cooperate. As Tsubaki pondered over this, she met with Boruto. Finding it ridiculous that she would only eat fries, he offered her his drink and burger, leaving her amazed at how good the combined flavors were.

The following day, after seeing Team 5 off with a merchant for a boar-hunt, the Team 15 students found that the real merchant was tied up and replaced with a bandits' leader. Realising that their friends were in danger, Tsubaki and her team rushed to help. Amazed at how well-coordinated Team 15 was and remembering her experience with new food mixtures, Tsubaki realised that the key to victory was team-work. Tsubaki trusted her team-mates to hold off the enemies long enough for her to ready her ultimate technique, swiftly defeating most of the foes and leaving leader for her team-mates to defeat. With the mission successful, Tsubaki was happy to have made friends she could trust.

Tsubaki taking part in the Chūnin Exams.



Following
Isshiki
's attack, Naruto decided to host another Chūnin Exam to boost morale and promote more chūnin. Despite not being a shinobi, Tsubaki took part of the exam to prove her might as a samurai. She and her team passed the first exam, a written test. During the second exam, Tsubaki had to rescue an injured ally within the
Forest of Death
 within an allotted time limit. She was one of 10 exam takers to pass the test, and for the final exam, she would have to go against one of 9 other genin in an one-on-one fight.

The following day after finishing a sparring session, Tsubaki received a letter from the Land of Iron, calling her back to fill in a leadership position. She was overjoyed at the chance to help promote growth for her country from an official position. Planning to use what she learned during her time in Konoha to help her country, Tsubaki was now even more determined to win in the finals.

Before the second match, which involved her team-mate Wasabi, she and Namida noticed that Wasabi was unusually reserved, and how flustered she became when her family came to cheer on her. She listened as Wasabi explained her clan's background to her, and how pressured she felt to meet her family's expectations of her. Before the third match, between Sarada and Chōchō, Tsubaki and her team checked on Sarada, concerned about her having to fight her best friend. Sarada insisted to them she was ready.






Tsubaki fighting Denki.



Tsubaki and Denki were the last names left at the end. Before her match, she overheard her team-mates discussing their conflicting feelings about her departure, and felt ashamed for not taking their reaction into consideration. During the match, Tsubaki didn't think much of Denki's
Lightning Release Suit
 and made the first strike. However, the suit allowed Denki to avoid her attacks and make strong attacks of his own, pressuring her. She eventually realised the suit had a motion sensor that analysed and predicted her movements, so she destroyed it. As the fight continued, the suit began to overheat. She offered Denki the chance to forfeit, but he refused, so she attacked. Denki chose to sacrifice the suit to block her attack, giving himself an opening to land a Lightning Release which knocked her out, costing her the match. When she woke up in the infirmary, she revealed to Namida and Wasabi that she chose to pass on the leadership position, feeling that she still had much to learn in Konoha. Later, she joined her team and
Team 5
 in celebrating Wasabi and Denki's promotions to chūnin at the Lightning Burger.

Later, Team 15 was assigned Kawaki as an extra for a mission to test him as a potential genin. Despite completing the mission, Kawaki's efforts were excessive as he traumatised the runaway child, leading to the client being furious with the team, much to Tsubaki and her team-mates dismay.






Tsubaki fighting Sazanka.



During a mission to investigate attacks on merchants, Tsubaki discovered her former fellow pupil Sazanka was among the bandits. She was initially unable to draw her sword against him, as she still felt guilty about her role in putting him on the path to becoming a criminal. Her team-mates encouraged her to face the challenge, reminding her she would regret it for the rest of her life if she didn't. Tsubaki overcame her guilt, and was able to cut Sazanka down, who acknowledged her strength as a samurai just before dying.
