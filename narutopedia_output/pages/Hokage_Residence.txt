The Hokage's Residence.



The
Hokage Residence
 is a large mansion occupied by the
Hokage
 during their tenure, and is located close to both the
Academy
 and
Hokage Rock
.
 Circular in design, it is also one of the largest buildings in
Konohagakure
, towering over most other buildings. There is also the kanji for "Fire" (
火
) painted on the roof of the building. It is filled with many forbidden
scrolls
, in which lie the secrets to many techniques. Built during the reign of the First Hokage,
Hashirama Senju
, the Hokage mansion was last occupied by
Tsunade
, the Fifth Hokage, before it was destroyed by the
Deva Path
's large-scale
Shinra Tensei
 during
Pain's assault
 on Konoha. It, like many of the other structures in the village was presumably reconstructed during the village's rebuilding.

Trivia

The Hokage's residence has often been confused as being what is actually the administrative part of the Academy because the Hokage's office is located there. According to official releases, however, they are in fact two separate places.

Minato Namikaze
 and
Naruto Uzumaki
 never moved into the Hokage Residence. While it is unknown why Naruto never moved in and instead stayed at his family home, Minato did so in order to keep
Kurama
 away from the village, as his wife
Kushina Uzumaki
, Kurama's
Jinchūriki
 at the time, would soon have her seal weakened due to her being pregnant with Naruto.
