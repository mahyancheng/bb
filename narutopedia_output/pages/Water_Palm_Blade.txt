Tobirama attacks the opponent with a combination of taijutsu and Water Release. He begins with a simple punch followed by three kicks and then lifting the opponent into the air where with his mastery of the Water Release, Tobirama materialises from his palm, a blade of water that he uses to blast the opponent through the air.
