The
Uzumaki Clan
's Mask Storage Temple
 (
うずまき一族の納面堂
,
Uzumaki Ichizoku no Nōmendō
,
Viz:
 Uzumaki's Clan Noh Mask Hall) is a shrine belonging to the Uzumaki, located somewhere along the outskirts of
Konohagakure
.
 At the entrance of the temple is a giant replica of the clan's symbol. Within the temple at the centre is a podium of sorts where hangs several
oni
-masks hung beneath three connected symbols of the clan, under all of which are ornate, black flames. Putting on one
specific mask
 amongst these actually invokes the
Shinigami
 from the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
 technique. The shrine has since fallen into ruin from the wear and tear of time, though the masks all stayed intact.

Trivia

When written as 能面, "Nōmen" means "
Noh
 Mask".
