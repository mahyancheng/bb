The
Assimilate All Creation Technique
 enables the user to take on the properties of a nearby object, material, or substance, and any of its special characteristics.

Overview

Upon taking on the properties of the targeted object, the user himself becomes completely comprised of the material, while gaining any special characteristics and weaknesses attributed to it. They are also able to manipulate any substance similar to what was absorbed, allowing them to mould it into different forms to create various techniques of their own, while also allowing use of jutsu involved with said substance. Should the need arise, they are able to generate more of the emulated substance from their bodies.

Usage

Nagare
, who once took on the properties of a rock, was able to create various imitations of other techniques, like
Assimilation: Rock Blizzard
 and
Assimilation: Sand Waterfall Funeral
. He was also able to turn his skin to rock, either entirely or partly, and could even survive being blown to bits by simply assembling himself.

In the anime, during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, the
White Zetsu Army
 were seen using this ability as well; allowing them to take on the property of the
red soil
 around them. This gave them
poisonous qualities
, that made them into even more formidable soldiers. However, they were also susceptible to adverse effects, gained by the soil's high conductibility to
lightning
-type attacks.

Trivia

Shinra Banshō
 (
森羅万象
,
literally meaning:
 All-Covering Forests and Ten Thousand Things) is a Buddhist idiom which has come to mean "All of Nature" or "All of Creation".
