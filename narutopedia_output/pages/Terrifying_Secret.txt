Osorubeki Himitsu
) is episode 85 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Kakashi
,
Chōji
,
Ino
 and
Shikamaru
 survive
Kakuzu
's attack, with Chōji wondering how Kakuzu survived being struck in the heart by Kakashi's
Lightning Cutter
. Shikamaru correctly deduces that Kakuzu has five hearts - one in his body and the others in his four masks, one of which was killed by Kakashi. Realising that the only way to defeat the duo is to split them up, Shikamaru offers to take
Hidan
 away while leaving Chōji and Kakashi to deal with Kakuzu. Using his
Shadow Sewing Technique
 along with his
Shadow Shuriken Technique
 to try and trap Hidan, Shikamaru resorts to rushing at him face to face to link their shadows using his
Shadow Imitation Technique
 after punching him. Now in control of Hidan's body, Shikamaru has him drop his
Triple-Bladed Scythe
 on the ground and runs away into the forest, with Hidan being forced to follow him.

Meanwhile, Kakuzu merges two of his masks into one in order to combine their
Fire Release
 and their
Wind Release
. Kakashi realises that each mask possesses a natural chakra affinity that Kakuzu has access to. Kakuzu decides to take their hearts in order to replace the one Kakashi destroyed and attempts to kill Kakashi. In the forest, Shikamaru sets up various traps using
kunai
 and
explosive tags
, but is unable to maintain the
Shadow–Neck Binding Technique
 on Hidan. Free to move once again, Hidan unveils his
Retractable Spear
 and seemingly cuts Shikamaru's cheek with it. Ingesting the blood, Hidan draws a
Jashin
 circle and stabs himself in the heart.
