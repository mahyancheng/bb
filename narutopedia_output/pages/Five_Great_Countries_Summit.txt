A
Five Great Countries Summit
 (
五大国会談
,
Godaikoku Kaidan
) is a formal gathering of the
daimyō
 of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
. Although the daimyō have different ways of contacting each other that they use when necessary, an actual Summit is incredibly rare; prior to
Shikamaru Shinden
, there hadn't been a Summit since the time of
Shikamaru Nara
's great-grandfather.

In
Shikamaru Shinden
, a Five Great Countries Summit is convened at the request of
Ikkyū Madoka
, the
Land of Fire
's daimyō, in response to the
Land of Earth
's plans to invade the
Land of Flowers
. Such an invasion would end the peace of the
Shinobi Union
 that their respective country's
hidden villages
 have established through years of hard work. The Earth's daimyō,
Danjō
, doesn't feel this should matter and that, if anything, the hidden villages should be grateful for the opportunity to rediscover what it means to be
shinobi
: death in battle. The
Land of Lightning
's daimyō,
Tekkan
 - whose country is allied with the Land of Flowers - feels this is poor justification for war, but he and Danjō are unable to reach a compromise.

Because Danjō desires the Land of Flowers' fertile lands, Ikkyū proposes turning over some of the Land of Fire's territory to the Land of Earth as a compromise; the offered lands previously belonged to the Land of Earth, so its inhabitants would not protest. Danjō dislikes the idea because he's already invested a great deal of money in the invasion and doesn't want it to go to waste. Such a transfer of lands would require the approval of the surrounding countries anyway, so Ikkyū suggests letting the Land of Flowers' fate be decided at the first ever
Continental Summit
. Tekkan, the
Wind
 daimyō, and
Water
 daimyō approve of this. When Danjō continues to dither, Ikkyū raises another option: war between the Lands of Fire and Earth. Danjō finally agrees.
