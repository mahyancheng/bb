Yōton
.

Lava Release
 (
溶遁; 熔遁
,
Yōton
,
English TV:
 "Corrosion Style" or "Lava Style") is a
nature transformation

kekkei genkai
, a combination of
fire
 and
earth
. Whereas most kekkei genkai are largely identical between users, Lava Release has a variety of forms depending on who's using it.

Forms

Molten rock, both in solid and liquid states, is created by

 and its

.

Acidic mud is created by
Mei Terumī
 of
Kirigakure
,
 and

. In the anime, it is initially depicted as molten rock.

Corrosive
quicklime
 is created by several
Iwagakure
 shinobi.
 In the anime, it is also used by

 of
Amegakure
.

Trivia

There is a subtle difference in the meaning of the kanji used for this kekkei genkai. Although both mean "to melt", the kanji with the "fire" (
火
)
radical
 (熔) is outdated and means "melting with fire", whereas nowadays the kanji with the "water" (
水
) radical (溶) is normally used. Mei Terumī's
Lava Release: Melting Apparition Technique
 and Boro's
Lava Release: Planet-Branding Blast
, which both utilise strong acidic fluids, are the only Lava Release techniques written with 溶. This, along with
Jin no Sho
 stating that Mei's Lava Release kekkei genkai can only be used by her,
 indicates a difference between 溶遁 and 熔遁.

In
Sha no Sho
, the "water" kanji is used in
Rōshi
's entry, whereas in the glossary, the "fire" kanji is used. In
Jin no Sho
, only the "fire" kanji is used for Rōshi's Lava Release.

In
Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu
, both versions are specified separately in the description of "
Sage Art: Super Tailed Beast Rasenshuriken
" and its
variations
.

In Viz's English translations of the series, this nature is initially referred to as "Corrosion Style" when it is first mentioned in
chapter 353
 and
Naruto: Shippūden

episode 121
. In subsequent appearances, it is instead translated as "Lava Style". However, some video games use the two translations interchangeably.
