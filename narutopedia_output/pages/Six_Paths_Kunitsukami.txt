Asura creates a gigantic
chakra
 avatar, which is powerful enough to do battle with
Indra
's
Complete Body — Susanoo
. Asura is able to equip the avatar with
Truth-Seeking Balls
 that can be used as a means of offence, or the avatar can serve as a defensive structure, similar to Indra's Susanoo.

Trivia

While unnamed in the manga and anime, this technique was named in
Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu
.

In
Shinto
, the Kunitsukami (
国津神
) are the
deities
 of the earthly realm, in contrast to the Amatsukami (
天津神
) of heaven.

This technique's appearance is a reference to Asura's namesake, the
Asuras
 of Hindu and Buddhist mythology, which are often depicted with three faces and six arms.

Using the
Shadow Clone Technique
 in conjunction with his
Tailed Beast Mode
,
Naruto Uzumaki
 was able to create a similar chakra avatar by merging three
Kurama
 avatars into one construct.

Despite having seemingly no relation to Kurama, Kunitsukami also has nine tails.
