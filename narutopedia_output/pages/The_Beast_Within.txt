"
The Beast Within
" (
野獣炸裂!弾けろ吹っ飛べ突き抜けろ!
,
Yajū Sakuretsu! Hajikero Futtobe Tsukinukero!
) is episode 124 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

In his drunken form,
Lee
's movements are too unpredictable and unorthodox for
Kimimaro
 to match. Lee manages to block and counter every one of Kimimaro's attacks. Lee resorts to feigning tactics such as falling asleep spread-eagled, and he manages to land a hit with his eyes closed and even managed to overpower him. Realising that Lee is drunk and is using the
Drunken Fist
 and possesses high levels of speed, Kimimaro resorts to using his
kekkei genkai
 in order to snap Lee out of it. Kimimaro's tactics work, as Lee sobers up after having his face cut by one of Kimimaro's bones.

Back in the forest,
Shikamaru
's
Shadow–Neck Binding Technique
 starts to slowly give way as his chakra runs out. Shikamaru likens this to the previous time his chakra ran out (during the
Konoha Crush
), in which he was saved by
Asuma Sarutobi
. Thinking there is no one to save him now, Shikamaru prepares himself for the worst. Meanwhile,
Kiba
 and the wounded
Akamaru
 make their way out of the river and hide behind the trees. However,
Sakon
 disguises his scent using Kiba's jacket and catches the two. At the same time, the now sober Lee decides that he needs to resort to hard-hitting tactics to take down Kimimaro, and decides to open the
First Gate
 and use the
Front Lotus
; Kimimaro manages to use the density of his bones to absorb the full effect of Lee's Lotus kick.

Kimimaro then attempts to drill his bones into Lee, only for his bones to be blocked by sand, which dispels Lee backwards. The sand manages to cushion Lee's fall. Kimimaro demands who his new opponent is, and Lee is shocked to see that it is none other than
Gaara
. In the forest,
Tayuya
 is about to finish off Shikamaru when she is hit by a powerful gust of wind, caused by none other than
Temari
. Meanwhile, Sakon is about to kill Kiba with a
kunai
 when his attack is blocked by
Kankurō
, who used
Karasu
 to shield Kiba. The
Three Sand Siblings
 announce themselves as shinobi allies of
Konohagakure
 and prepare to help their former enemies in combat.
