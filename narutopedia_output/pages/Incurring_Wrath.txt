Incurring Wrath
" (

,

Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

On their way to Garaga's nest, the genin explain to
Chōchō
 what a reverse scale is.
Sarada
 thinks back to their lesson on the
Summoning Technique
 in the Academy. They find very large snake tracks on the ground, and follow it to an open area that has seen damage. The genin recall the Sage's explanation of
Garaga
 going into frenzies over having lost an eye in battle. They get startled when coming across some snake statues, and find Garaga, who attacks them.
Shikadai
 tries
paralysing
 him, but Garaga is too big for him and breaks through his jutsu.
Boruto
 spots Garaga's reverse scale, but Garaga moves before he can attack. Sarada is thrown aside by Garaga's movement, and is almost eaten, but another snake intervenes, biting Garaga, giving the genin a chance to escape. At Konoha,
Moegi
 arrives alone for her report, and gives
Shikamaru
 the shōgi piece Shikadai left behind, which confirms his suspicions something is amiss with Mitsuki's departure.

Uō
's condition is stabilising, so
Sakura
 has
Yurito
 deliver
Naruto
 a report.
Tsunade
 discusses the situation with Naruto and Shikamaru, when Yurito delivers the report. Sarada thinks the blue snake was trying to protect her. The blue snake finds them, and introduces himself as
Aoda
, a summoning snake who has pledged loyalty to
Sasuke
. Garaga has a fit over Aoda's interference. The genin explain their situation to Aoda. Shikadai notices Aoda doesn't have a reverse scale, and asks if Garaga's the only one who does. Aoda explains most violent snakes have them, and that they become milder once their reverse scale is removed. Aoda wants to escort them back to Konoha, but Sarada insists on their task. Shikamaru speculates on who would have knowledge to target
Mitsuki
. Teams 5 and 15 worry about Boruto and the others. Yurito steals something from the room where Uō is recovering.
Hinata
 and Sakura meet on the office's entrance, where Hinata apologises for Boruto taking Sarada with him, but Sakura says Sarada is responsible for her own decisions. Shikadai has devised a plan involving Boruto, Chōchō, and Aoda. An enlarged Chōchō challenges Garaga, creating a distraction for
Inojin
 to cover his remaining eye with ink. Shikadai pins Garaga with his shadow, aided by Aoda and Chōchō to hold him in place. Boruto and Sarada try to get the reverse scale, but Garaga manages to dodge them, and hits Chōchō with a venom that petrifies her.
