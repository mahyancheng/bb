Synopsis

At night, someone releases several animals at the Fire Park.
Sumire
 finds
Team Konohamaru
 arguing while on the way to receive her next mission.
Team 15
 is tasked with recapturing the zoo animals. Suika is pleased with their excitement for the mission.
Hanabi
 thinks the girls can perform the mission alone, as she determines there are no dangerous animals on the escaped animals list.
Sai
 checks in with Hanabi about Sumire. They discuss Sumire, and the fact
Wasabi
 and
Namida
 still don't know the whole story about Sumire and
Nue
. Sumire ponders telling Wasabi and Namida about it. The next day, Sumire provides her team with clothes to mask their scent, making it harder for animals to smell their approach. They capture several animals, but an argument begins after a miscommunication between Wasabi and Namida.
 A monkey that they're supposed to retrieve steals their lunch, and it also has the keys to the animal enclosures. Wasabi chases it with her
Cat Covering
, but tires herself before catching up to the monkey. Wasabi wants to try again, and puts Namida's suggestion to come up with a strategy together down, causing her to cry. Hanabi makes her way to the team, having been made aware of another list of missing animals. Namida manages to catch the monkey on her own, but also comes across a giant wolf. Sumire and Wasabi hear Namida scream, but only Sumire goes to help. Sumire protects Namida, and tries having Nue absorb the wolf's chakra, with little effect. Wasabi arrives, and tells Namida she'll lure it so Namida can hit it with her jutsu. Wasabi plants explosive tags on the wolf, which are triggered by Namida's sonic jutsu, knocking the wolf out. Wasabi and Namida make up, and Sumire comes clean about the Nue. They say they already knew and were just waiting for Sumire to tell them herself. Hanabi approaches them and congratulates them on their teamwork. Later, the three eat together and discuss the upcoming
Chūnin Exams
.
Boruto
 and
Mitsuki
 have heard of their mission. The monkey steals their food again, much to the girls' shock.
