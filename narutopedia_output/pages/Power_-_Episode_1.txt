"
Power - Episode 1
" (
「力-Chikara-」episode1
) is episode 290 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Tonika Village
, a small town in a location known as "
the Hole
", is attacked by several
reincarnated
 shinobi. Two young children,
Leo
 and
Miina
, are rescued from their burning home by their teacher
Dokku
, who leaves them in the forest outskirts while he attempts to rescue more survivors. While the two hide,
Kabuto Yakushi
 walks through a nearby clearing, controlling the reincarnated shinobi using a portable wooden
go
 board and several white stones. After a moment he grins and withdraws the board and pieces into his cloak, then leaves. In the morning, the two children set out for
Hachō Village
 as Dokku instructed. That evening, a severely wounded Dokku catches up with them, with three orphaned survivors in tow:
Faz
,
Lando
, and
Sora
.

Some time later, the reborn
Team Kakashi
 is sent out on a mission by
Tsunade
 to investigate the incident. Regretting that she could not assign more people to the mission because of recent incidents elsewhere, the team sets out nonetheless. While there, they split up into two man teams, with
Yamato
 and
Sai
 encountering officers from the neighbouring Hachō Village where
Shiseru
 and her team, after finding out who the Konoha shinobi were, escorts them to their village leader
Disonasu
. Elsewhere,
Sakura
 and
Naruto
, who are at the Hole's water spring, encounter Kabuto. Kabuto reveals that he had
reconstructed

Hidan
 and reincarnated a small army of shinobi, and is using the water of the Hole to conduct experiments on genetic reconstruction. A fight ensues between the two sides as Yamato and Sai rejoin with their team-mates, and Naruto is dragged deep underwater by Kabuto's
giant Clone Snake serpent
.

Trivia

The DVD version of this episode is a director's cut, which differs significantly from the original TV broadcast version. When originally broadcast the episode's structure was altered so that it opened with Team 7 departing for their mission, while the destruction of Tonika was presented as flashback during the latter half of the episode, after Naruto was dragged underwater by the giant serpent.

The director's cut includes a scene that was removed from the TV broadcast, in which Kabuto controls the reanimated shinobi destroying Tonika using a
go
 board and stones while Leo and Miina hide nearby. Despite it not being used in the broadcast episode, shots from this scene were still featured in the preview aired alongside the previous week's episode.
