Summary

Obito
 asks
Rin
 to wait just a little bit longer, noting that he wanted to help
Kakashi
 who was currently unable to contribute to the ongoing battle. Promising Rin to come back, Obito
teleports
 into the
core dimension
, manifesting as
chakra
 and inhabits Kakashi. Inside his consciousness, Obito explains that he had come back to give Kakashi an early present. Declaring that he told
Naruto
 to become
Hokage
, he states that Kakashi should become the Sixth before him. Reminding his comrade of his moniker which was feared across nations, Kakashi opens his eyes and reveals that not only he is once again "
Kakashi of the Sharingan
", but also in both eyes.
 Meanwhile,
Black Zetsu
 is pinned down by two
rods
, and
Sasuke
 is knocked back by
Kaguya
's
chakra arms
. Giving Kaguya no time to relent, Naruto draws on the power of all the
tailed beasts
 and uses
nine unique Rasenshuriken
 against Kaguya, resulting in a massive misshapen mass of the combined tailed beasts chakra pouring out of her body when she tries to transform. The mass begins pirouetting numerous arms, one of them absorbs one of Naruto's
shadow clones
. Seeing one of the arms go after
Sakura
 who attempts to flee, Naruto tells Sasuke to use his
dōjutsu
 to
save
 her and sees Sakura being saved by
Susanoo
. To everyone's shock, it is revealed that it was Kakashi that was inside the Susanoo, declaring to Obito in his mind that he will protect their comrades and the world.

Trivia

In one panel, after using one of his three remaining
Truth-Seeking Balls
 as a foothold for Sasuke, Naruto is mistakenly depicted with a fourth ball. This was not corrected in the tankōbon version.
