" (
最期の言葉

Saigo no Kotoba
) is episode 80 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Before
Hidan
 and
Kakuzu
 can finish off
Shikamaru
,
Kotetsu
 and
Izumo
, they are saved by the arrival of
Aoba
,
Raidō
,
Chōji
 and
Ino
. The latter two take
Asuma
 to the safety of the roof along with Shikamaru while Aoba and Raidō prepare to fight off the
Akatsuki
. However,
the leader
 of the Akatsuki makes a telepathic call to Hidan and Kakuzu, telling them to retreat as the sealing of the
Two-Tails
 is top priority. The two Akatsuki members leave, although Hidan promises to return soon.

On the roof, Ino attempts to use her medical ninjutsu to heal Asuma, but is unable to due to him having four of his vital spots punctured. Knowing he is about to die, he decides to impart his last words to his students. He tells Ino that while she may be bossy, she can be a compassionate caregiver and asks her to look after Shikamaru and Chōji. He also tells her not to lose to
Sakura
, whether it is in terms of skill or romance. He tells Chōji that he has a caring heart and can be the strongest
shinobi
 if he only puts in more effort, and advises him to lose a few pounds. To Shikamaru, he decides to tell him who the "king" of
Konoha
 is and whispers his last words in Shikamaru's ears. As
Team 10
 reminisce on their past with Asuma, Asuma passes away, and it begins to rain. As Ino and Chōji cry over Asuma's dead body, Shikamaru takes his lighter and claims that he can still feel Asuma's cigarettes stinging his eyes, and proceeds to cry himself.

Trivia

This episode had the
Rinnegan
 redesigned from its last appearance during the
Kazekage Rescue Mission
 arc because the Rinnegan's coloured manga design had not yet been released at that point.
