"
Words of Inspiration
" (
背中を押す言葉
,
Senaka o osu kotoba
) is chapter 10 of the
Konoha Shinden
 manga.

Summary

Despite having no meaningful experience with cooking,
Mirai
 prepares a batch of potato chips. She afterwards presents them to
Chōji
, who compliments her for their quality as he eats them. This gives him enough energy to now lend assistance: he approaches the large rock blocking the hotspring, uses
Super Multi-Size Technique
, and begins to push. Mirai joins in, insistent on helping in whatever way she can, even if that help amounts to very little. Her words inspire
Guy
,
Kakashi
, and the
Yugakure
 ninja to push as well. With their combined effort, as well as a boost from Chōji's
Butterfly Mode
, they succeed in moving the rock out of the way, allowing the hotspring to flow once more.

Mirai sees Chōji off as he departs from the village. She thanks him for his help, regretful that, even with her ninja training, she was not able to make much of a difference. Chōji disagrees, pointing out the motivational effect her words had on everyone. He notes that she reminds him of
her father
, who gave him the same kind of encouragement when he was younger; Mirai smiles from the comparison.

That night, Mirai relaxes in the now-restored hotspring, where she is joined by
Tatsumi
, a traveller around her age. As they become acquainted, Tatsumi tells Mirai that her mother died recently, and she's now visiting various hotsprings in her mother's memory; Mirai confides that her father died before she was born. Tatsumi shares a rumour that there's a hotspring in the nearby mountains where visitors can meet the dead and invites Mirai to come with her. Mirai is doubtful that such a thing is even possible, so Tatsumi mentions the dead being
revived
 during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. Having heard about that before, Mirai is tempted to join her if it means she can meet her father.
