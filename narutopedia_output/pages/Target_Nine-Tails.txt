Target: Nine-Tails
" (
狙われた九尾
,
Nerawareta Kyūbi
) is episode 247 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Kushina
 tells
Naruto
 that she loves him, he becomes calm and filled with happiness and thus is able to negate the
Nine-Tails
' negative emotions. Spurned by his mother to defeat the
tailed beast
, he uses his
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 and has each pair of
shadow clones
 form a
Rasengan
. On the outside,
Yamato
 is shocked as Naruto's
transformation
 completely subsides while
Killer B
 remarks that Naruto is succeeding; Yamato also notices that Naruto has entered into
Sage Mode
.

Using the
natural energy
 gathered as his real body is sitting still, the Naruto shadow clones expand their Rasengan into the
Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan
. The
senjutsu
-enhanced shadow clones then simultaneously attack with their
Sage Art: Many Ultra-Big Ball Spiralling Serial Spheres
, knocking the fox backwards. As the fox prepares to fight back, Naruto comes rushing in and hits it head-on with his
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
. As the fox is completely suppressed by the Rasenshuriken's tremendous power, the shadow clones begin drawing out its
chakra
. Naruto then dispels the clones and absorbs the chakra himself, immediately entering into
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
.

Naruto notices that his
Four Symbols Seal
 has evolved into a
Torii Seal
, and locks the improved seal, restraining the fox with ease. As the fox curses Kushina for her involvement (as she had used the
Adamantine Sealing Chains
 to aid Naruto), Naruto returns to where his mother is. Knowing she does not have much time left with him, she notifies him that she was the
jinchūriki
 of the Nine-Tails before he was. Naruto is outraged and demands to know how she ended up as a jinchūriki, and she agrees to tell him everything, including the truth about the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
.

She reveals that the
Uzumaki clan
 hailed from a village known as
Uzushiogakure
 and were renown for their
proficiency
 in
fūinjutsu
, as well as their heightened chakra levels and their lifespan longevity. Their prowess made them a target and so the village was destroyed, with the survivors scattering across the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
. Both Konohagakure and Uzushiogakure had been allies from the very beginning, with Konoha adopting the latter's crest on their
flak jackets
. After the
First Hokage
 defeated
Madara Uchiha
, the First gained possession over the Nine-Tails, and his wife,
Mito Uzumaki
, sealed the beast into her. When Mito was nearing the end of her life, Kushina was brought to Konoha to be the Nine-Tails' next jinchūriki, due to the fact that she possessed chakra strong enough to subdue a tailed beast. Mito had told her that if she filled herself with love, then the burden and loneliness she would suffer would be greatly lessened. Kushina admits to Naruto that despite being a jinchūriki, she was truly happy with Minato, who filled her with love, and recalls how she first found out she was pregnant and how she shared the news with Minato.
Biwako Sarutobi
, the wife of the
Third Hokage
, had then notified the two parents-to-be that the
Eight Trigrams Sealing Style
 would weaken during childbirth and thus Kushina would have to give birth outside of the village, under the protection of a barrier. On the way to the secret location, she came across
Mikoto Uchiha
, who had just recently given birth to a baby
boy
 that she had named after the Third's father,
Sasuke Sarutobi
.

On October 10, Kushina began giving birth, as Minato struggled to keep the seal in place as he was too concerned with Kushina's well-being. Kushina remarks to Naruto that somehow, the
masked man
 whom Minato had told Naruto
earlier
 about, had managed to find out the secret location of the birth as well as the fact that childbirth was a female jinchūriki's weakness. While Biwako and
Taji
 served as midwives and helped Kushina successfully give birth, the masked man killed all the
Anbu
 guards stationed outside.

Trivia

When the
Adamantine Sealing Chains
 trips the Nine-Tails, ten tails are shown.
