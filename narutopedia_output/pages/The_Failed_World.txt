"
The Failed World
" (
失敗した世界
,
Shippaishita Sekai
) is chapter 661 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

With
Kurama
 extracted from his body,
Naruto
 falls unconscious as he hurtles towards the ground.
Gaara
 uses his
sand
 to cushion his comrade's fall while the
tailed beasts
 are resealed into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
. As
Madara
 criticises himself for his lack of power, he soon turns his attention to the talkative
White Zetsu Army
 clone, noting that they were nothing but failed experiments. Unaffected by these harsh words, the clone soon tells Madara that all was being taken care of on their side.
 Narrowly escaping
Tobirama
's
attack
, Madara seemingly gains the upper hand on the Second
Hokage
 only for him to disappear from sight before launching a follow up attack, giving Gaara enough time to escape with Naruto. Madara ultimately pins down Tobirama, and the two exchange words of contempt with one another. Meanwhile,
Sasuke
 prepares to reenter the fray atop
Garuda
 and recalls
Hashirama
 noting that he would give him a technique that would work against Madara in his current state. Though somewhat hesitant at first, Sasuke eventually presents himself to the incapacitated God of Shinobi, who gives him what is left of his chakra to stop Madara. As Madara berates Tobirama, who was once renowned as the fastest shinobi in the world, driving one of the stakes into the Second's head, the Uchiha shares his viewpoint once again before Tobirama makes a last-ditch effort to attack Madara, providing Sasuke with an opening to swoop in. However before Sasuke can land any kind of attack, the young Uchiha finds himself suspended in midair. Ignoring Tobirama's cries to stop, Madara drives the sword through Sasuke's chest, expressing his disappointment in the young Uchiha whom he deemed to have had given more than enough time to do something.

Trivia

The jutsu Hashirama supposedly gave Sasuke is never revealed.
