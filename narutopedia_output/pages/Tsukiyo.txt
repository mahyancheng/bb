Tsukiyo
 (
ツキヨ
) was the lieutenant and the second-in-command of the
Mujina Bandits
.

Background

Tsukiyo became a member of the Mujina Bandits, working his way up to second-in-command. At some point however, when both Tsukiyo and his boss,
Shojoji
, were cornered by a group of shinobi, Shojoji consumed Tsukiyo's brain through the
Corpse Clone Technique
 to take his form in order to preserve the gang's reputation by preventing the boss' capture from being publicised.

Personality

While unknown personally, based on Shojoji's performance as the man, Tsukiyo was shown to be very vicious and callous man, and someone who places emphasis on one's luck.

Appearance

Tsukiyo is a man of fair complexion, excluding a long scar running down the right side of his face and over his lips. He has green short hair with thick black eyebrows, pronounced cheekbones, and a broad nose. His eyes are blue with tear-lines under them.

Abilities






Shojoji, disguised as Tsukiyo, using Moon Shadow Technique.



While Shojoji assumed his form, he seemingly used techniques that belonged to Tsukiyo. This included skill with
Lightning Release
, able to launch bolts from his fingertips, which can instantly kill a target and shatter rocks. This lightning is similar in appearance to Kumogakure's Black Lightning, but with a pink glow instead. He could perform one-handed handsigns. He also could use a variety of
shadow-manipulation

techniques
 similar to the
Nara Clan
. His Moon Shadow Technique gets stronger depending on how big the moon is.

Legacy

Tsukiyo's identity was put to use by Shojoji, hiding the fact that the Mujina Bandits' leader was captured to maintain his organisation's reputation. However, this became moot as Shojoji eventually admitted it openly and was recaptured.

Trivia

"Tsukiyo" (
月夜­
) means "moon night".
