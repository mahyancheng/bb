Shikamaru Shinden: A Cloud Dancing in Forlorn Falling Petals

Tekkan attended the
Five Great Countries Summit
, convened in response to the looming invasion of the
Land of Flowers
 by the
Land of Earth
. Because the Land of Lightning has an alliance with Flowers, Tekkan was opposed to the invasion and believed the justification offered by the Earth's daimyō,
Danjō
, was insufficient. Danjō retorted that the Land of Flowers was not worth debating over nor protecting from invasion, and alluded to the
Raikage
,
Darui
, feeling the same way. Tekkan admitted that Darui was "insolent", but otherwise did not respond to Danjō's claim.

As an alternative to the invasion, the
Land of Fire
's daimyō,
Ikkyū Madoka
, offered to surrender some of his country's territory to the Land of Earth; the Earth would gain the fertile lands it desired, and war would be averted. Tekkan was intrigued by the idea, especially when Ikkyū proposed allowing all countries - not just the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 - to offer their opinions at a
Continental Summit
. Tekkan and the other daimyō agreed to this letting the Land of Flowers' fate being decided there.
