Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
 is the seventh instalment of the
Ultimate Ninja Storm
 series developed by CyberConnect2 and published by Namco-Bandai games for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam.

Gameplay changes

Here have been some of the confirmed gameplay changes so far:

Ninja items with the D-pad are now infinite in usage.

Idle chakra regeneration rate has notably increased.

Hitstun times are now more generalized across the cast, which may or may not interfere with intended hit effects of attacks from prior games.

The counter returning from
Storm Revolution
 now inflicts a crumple instead of a ground slide.

Hitting a victim during crumple state, ground slide (mainly with a chakra dash) or with a tool throw when they are downed causes a re-stand state.

Damage scaling is implemented, but the game is unable to properly register it at times if the combo is desynced enough.

Mid-ranged tilt moves are removed, and is replaced with a second chakra technique/jutsu/U1, and for some characters, they now also have essentially 3 chakra techniques usable on-hand.

The input for the second jutsu is the same as the original input for chakra tool throw. As a result, chakra tool throws have been removed.

Trivia

The characters they use
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
 and
Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique
 and
Poison
 will be aligned with the movement of throwing shuriken.

The feature to customise the appearance of playable characters, first introduced in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
, finally makes a reappearance after being omitted in the
previous game
.

It is unknown where in the timeline the Special Story takes place - it appears to at the least follow after
Boruto: Naruto the Movie
, as Boruto is clearly shown with his
Kāma
.

The developers were accused by the English voice actors from the game to have re-dubbed over their lines with AI. The developers revealed that the questionable voice work was just the result of poor editing, and that it will be fixed in a later update.
