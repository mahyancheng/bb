Summary

Investigation into the Incident





The Hole.



The reborn
Team Kakashi
 is sent out on a mission by
Tsunade
 to a location known as "
The Hole
" to investigate an incident where
Tonika Village
's people had been killed. Regretting that she could not assign more people to the mission because of recent incidents elsewhere, the team sets out nonetheless. While there, they split up into two man teams, with
Yamato
 and
Sai
 encountering officers from the neighbouring
Hachō Village
, consisting of
Shiseru
 and her team. After finding out who the Konoha shinobi were, the officers escort them to their village leader,
Disonasu
. Elsewhere,
Sakura
 and
Naruto
, who are at
The Hole
's water spring, encounter
Kabuto Yakushi
, who uses
tiny, specially-created snakes
 to
create a clone
 of
Hidan
 using his DNA and the water of The Hole, which possesses special properties. Kabuto then reveals that he had
reincarnated
 several shinobi. A fight ensues between the two sides as Yamato and Sai rejoin with their team-mates.

A flashback of the destruction of the village shows two young siblings,
Leo
 and
Miina
, conversing with their grandfather, when the village is attacked by Kabuto's reincarnated shinobi. With the aid of their teacher,
Dokku
, the children are able to escape their burning house and are left in the nearby forest. The village head gives two steel bars to Dokku, instructing him to keep them secret. The two children,
Dokku
,
Faz
,
Lando
, and
Sora
 survive the attack and make their way to Hachō Village.

Unexpected Meeting





Naruto saves Dokku and Miina from falling.



As Team Kakashi continues to battle Kabuto, Hidan and the reincarnated shinobi, Naruto gets swallowed by a
giant snake
 created by Kabuto, but manages to escape using
shadow clones
, accidentally ingesting Kabuto's clone snakes in the process. When Naruto resurfaces, Kabuto retreats, using the reincarnated
Deidara
 as a diversion, after revealing a village guard's corpse in the mouth of a snake. Meanwhile, Dokku takes care of the orphans, while Miina, due to trauma, becomes mute. After the attack, Naruto and Sakura join up with Shiseru, Yamato and Sai in going with the rest of the guards. While Yamato and Sai investigate Kabuto's motive for destroying the village, Sakura and Naruto follow Shiseru to Dokku's house. When Dokku and the orphans see them, noticing that Naruto wears the same forehead protector as the reincarnated shinobi, Leo kicks Naruto and they run until they reach a broken bridge. Leo crosses first and when Dokku and Miina run, they fall down the ravine, but are saved by Naruto. Yamato and Sai ask Disonasu for information, prompting him to show them a book revealing the origin of The Hole; a great power known as the Ama no Hoko resided within many years ago and nearly consumed the world, but one of the dead picked up a shard of its power, turning crimson, being enveloped in flames, and sealing the Ama no Hoko in the form of seven sounds, the Saezuri. In his sleep, Naruto sees himself in front of the
Nine-Tails
' cage within his subconscious as he is surrounded by the snakes he had previously ingested. Naruto and Dokku discuss Dokku's failure to save a girl in his prime and all his failures in life, unlike Naruto, who became famous even in the Hachō Village, a rural area. Kabuto, while testing the effects of his talismans on Hidan and Deidara in a graveyard, converses with an unknown individual that communicates to him through a scroll.

A Hidden Ability





A clone of four-tailed Naruto is created.



After having what was seemingly a bad dream,
Miina
 runs to
Dokku
 in the night to seek comfort. Elsewhere, in a graveyard,
Kabuto Yakushi
 prepares to
reincarnate
 another individual. When day breaks the next morning, Leo, Faz and Lando are eager to start their
ninjutsu
 training with
Naruto
, who is feeling under the weather. However, after being chided by the boys since he had made a promise to them, Naruto emphatically begins the training, which even
Shiseru
 decides to partake it, having found it interesting. While elsewhere a reincarnated Deidara and Hidan's genetic clone argue over their predicament, having killed several members of the Hachō Village militia, and are later confronted by several more members along with Yamato and Sai. Plagued by vivid images all day, Miina approaches Naruto and begins repeatedly saying "
get out
". Thinking that Miina was simply being rude, Shiseru slaps her and Miina runs off. Later,
Disonasu
 visits their home and, to everyone's surprise, the Tonika Village Head is with him. Greeting his grandchildren, he notes that he had injured his eyes but presses on past that, asking Dokku for the piece of the treasure he had given to him the night of the invasion of the village. However, Miina alerts everyone to the fact that there was something strange about her grandfather and it is revealed that he had been reincarnated. As a fight subsequently breaks out when Kabuto makes an appearance, Naruto soon begins writhing in pain. Rushing towards him, Miina once again begins shouting "
get out
", eventually forcing the tiny snakes out of his body. The snakes then form into a clone of Naruto in his
four-tailed Version 2
 state, which attacks all present individuals, including Kabuto, who is unable to gain control of it through a talisman. As the creature continues attacking indiscriminately, everyone looks on in fear.

The Beast Invasion






The Nine-Tailed Naruto clone destroys the Hachō Village.



The
Nine-Tailed Naruto clone
 tries to attack
Dokku
 and the orphans, when
Might Guy
 and
Rock Lee
 arrive to repel it. While they fight the beast,
Kabuto
 tries to control it, but to no avail. The rest of
Konoha 11
 arrive.
Team Asuma
 helps
Sakura
 and
Kakashi
 and
Team Kurenai
 helps
Naruto
.
Tenten
 and
Neji
 arrive, but are cornered by the
reincarnated
 puppets.
Kakashi
 chases Kabuto. The beast grabs Naruto to absorb
chakra
, which the
Nine-Tails
 gladly shares.
Hinata
 tries to defend Naruto, but is sent flying. After the beast absorbs Naruto's chakra, it grows in size and starts to devastate the
Hachō Village
, even firing a
Tailed Beast Ball
 in far away, missing
Yamato
,
Sai
,
Deidara
 and
Hidan
 who are fighting outside the village. Dokku tries to save Naruto, who is still unconscious. Moments before the beast tramples them, Kabuto
summons
 a snake to swallow both of them alive and retreats. While inside the underground
hall
 in the
Tonika Village
, Naruto, unconscious and strangled by snakes, meets the Nine-Tails again in his subconscious.






Disonasu releases the Saezuri.



The
Konoha
-nin investigates Kabuto's intention in the meanwhile.
Shiseru
 remembers an earlier conversation between her and Dokku about the pros and cons of them adopting the kids. While the Nine-Tails tries to control Naruto, Dokku calls him, but gets shouted instead. Dokku asks Naruto what burden a powerful person carries and made Naruto choose the reason why he desires to be powerful, seeing flashbacks of his comrades of Konoha and also
Sasuke
, leading to the seal inside Naruto to gain strength again. Dokku gives Naruto his
forehead protector
, stating that he believes in him. Meanwhile,
Leo
 decides to save their teacher by giving the mysterious iron bars which were mentioned earlier by the
Tonika Village Head
. While inside the hall, Kabuto, along with two reincarnated puppets, approaches with
Disonasu
, revealed to have engineered Tonika's destruction. Disonasu pulls out a scroll from which emerges the item that he desired: the
Saezuri
.

The Saezuri Revealed

While the Saezuri is revealed, learning that
Disonasu
 employed
Kabuto Yakushi
 to wipe out the residents of
Tonika Village
,
Dokku
 tried to attack Disonasu, but stopped by a
reincarnated
 puppet and restrained by a resurrected
Takigakure
 shinobi. Disonasu also praised
Naruto
 about defeating
Pain
, the one who scarred him and left him powerless, before kicking the boy repeatedly.
Miina
 and the orphans came to
The Hole
 to give the iron bars, but Kabuto's clone intercepted them. Meanwhile, the rest of
Konoha 11
, along with
Kakashi
,
Shiseru
,
Yamato
 and
Sai
 moved out to the area. Disonasu prepares the summoning of the "power" by putting the remaining iron bars while Naruto enters
Sage Mode
. Miina hums to the sound as the Saezuri is activated, causing the area Naruto is on, the Ama no Hoko, to rise above ground. Kakashi arrived on the scene, revealing Disonasu's past as a bloodthirsty murderer and former
Akatsuki
 subordinate whose speciality is the field of
Summoning Technique
, having researched
Impure World Reincarnation
 with
Orochimaru
. Kabuto summons his puppets, the
Nine-Tailed Naruto Clone
,
Hidan
, and
Deidara
. Naruto faces off with the clone, while Deidara uses
Explosive Clay
 to create a diversion and chase Naruto.






The Nine-Tailed Naruto Clone's Hydra-like form.



Disonasu escapes and Hidan faces
Shikamaru
. Deidara activates the Explosive Clay on the bodies of the resurrected individuals, as Hidan uses his ritual against
Team Asuma
, and
Sakura
 got restrained by
Hayate
 and the others. While Naruto relentlessly attacked the clone, he learned there is more than power. As Yamato restrained Disonasu, he activated the Saezuri, opening the area where Naruto faces the clone, draining the lake as an obelisk rises and creates a storm. After Hidan's clone body breaks down due to the shorten life spans of the snakes composing his body, Deidara is controlled by Kabuto to escape Kakashi. A lightning hit the area where the orphans are running, Miina pointing to the obelisk. When the storm expands towards
Konoha
,
Tsunade
 goes out as the storm engulfs the
Land of Fire
. Naruto tried to stop Disonasu from ascending the tower, only to face his clone after he absorbed some of the tower's power and transformed into a Hydra-tailed fox monster.

The Power of the Family






Naruto transforms into an incomplete Tailed Beast Mode.



Absorbing the power within the
Ama no Hoko
, the
Nine-Tailed Naruto Clone
 mutated into a hydra-tailed version of the Nine-Tails while seemingly sending
Disonasu
 to his death. Overpowered, Naruto almost gave in to the Nine-Tails' offer for power when Minato's voice urges the boy to control the tailed beast as Naruto is engulfed in
a six-tailed chakra cloak in the Nine-Tails' image
. Over time, as he starts to lose against the clone, the Nine-Tails starts to take control over Naruto's body and assumes a seven-tailed
jinchūriki
 state with
Yamato
 trying to restrain it. At the same time, though followed by
Kakashi Hatake
,
Kabuto Yakushi
 manages to take his leave in midst of the ensuing chaos.
Dokku
 and
Shiseru
 decide to deactivate the Ama no Hoko and say good-bye to the children. On their way there, they confess their love for each other and decide to get married if they survive before portions of the ground start to sink, with Dokku keeping Shiseru from falling.






Miina saves Naruto from Kurama's influence.



By that time,
Miina
 is able to get through Naruto, regaining control as he assumed a
new form
 to save Shiseru after telling Dokku to go forward and stop the Ama no Hoko. As Dokku realises Miina's melody could stop the Saezuri, he attempts to recall the tune Miina hummed to change the sounds in the
Saezuri
 to deactivate the tower, Naruto uses his new power to destroy his clone as the Ama no Hoko recedes into the ground. The children celebrate with Naruto. The group's celebration coincides with Kabuto having Tonika Village Head executed Disonasu who revealed to survive Nine-Tailed Naruto Clone albeit severely crippled, killing him once and for all as well as allowing the former to pass on.

As Naruto, Sai, and Sakura receive a letter and pictures sent by Dokku which reveals developments since the battle (Dokku and Shiseru's marriage and subsequent adoption of the orphans, Saezuri's resealing in the Hole, and the surviving villagers performed a funeral ceremony of the victims of the Tonika Village massacre); Kabuto completes his transformation before moving on, shedding away a skin and growing a white serpent underneath his cloak in process.
