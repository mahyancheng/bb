"
Nine-Tails
" (
九尾
,
Kyūbi
)

Jura
 is surprised to find
Himawari
 instead of
Naruto
.
Shikadai
 reports contact to the
sensor team
 and requests backup. Jura
pulls out
 a book from his cape to confirm information on Shikadai's identity. Shikadai asks if they want to leave a message for the
Hokage
, but Jura shocks them by telling them they were on Naruto's trail by follow the
Nine-Tails
' chakra signature. Shikadai stops
Inojin
 from sharing info on Naruto's supposed death. Jura is confused about it as well, delight that the world keeps raising more questions for him. He attempts to ensnare Himawari in a tree, but Shikadai
stops it
, allowing Inojin to pull her out, and
Chōchō
 to catch her. Jura is impressed by their team-work, and makes it clear they have no ill-intent with
Team 10
, but will attack if they keep interfering with Himawari.
Shikamaru
 contacts Shikadai, who updates him on the
God Trees
' goals. Himawari is confused by their interest in her.
Amado
 worries about
Kawaki
, and wonders what Jura is.
Koji
 notifies Boruto that the trees made a move, signalling to which
toad
 he should
teleport
. Jura confirms why they're after Himawari, confusing everyone because they thought the Nine-Tails was dead, and intends to get answers by devouring her.
 A toad contacts Shikamaru, notifying him of Boruto's arrival, and instructing him to have
Ino
 establish communications again. Kawaki wakes up,
Delta
 complaining she couldn't face
Ada
 if something happened to him. He dismisses it on account of his regeneration ability, but she counters that he still shouldn't be reckless. Delta gives him the coordinates of the invaders, but he's focused on Boruto's arrival. Boruto confirms it's the God Trees on account of their
Wood Release
 jutsu. Shikamaru contacts him, informing him of the trees' focus on Himawari and the Nine-Tails' chakra. Kawaki reports Boruto's presence to the sensor team, and asks if the invaders are his friends. Boruto puts Shikamaru on hold, and criticises Kawaki for focusing on him instead of Konoha's enemies. Kawaki attacks him, but Boruto dodges two
Sukunahikona
 attacks, and knocks Kawaki down in one move, admonishing him for insufficient training. Delta wonders how much Boruto has trained instead. Kawaki activates his
Kāma
, causing Boruto's to resonate in response. The toad urges Boruto to retreat, else he might lose control. Boruto flies away, leaving Kawaki puzzled about the lack of control. Inojin takes Himawari onto his bird while Shikadai holds Jura in place. Jura charges a
Tailed Beast Ball
 through his eye. Chōchō knocks him off balance, causing him to miss Shikadai.
Sarada
 and
Sumire
 rush towards the explosion. Inojin grabs Chōchō and Shikadai, and leaves.
Hidari
 finds them fools for not delivering Himawari under threat of death, but Jura deems finding out what motivates them past survival instinct to be a crucial piece of information as well. Team 10 discusses what to do, and Himawari requests to be dropped off to escape on her own. She is concerned about their safety, and suddenly finds herself in a mental plane, where a miniature Nine-Tails complains about being detected by the
Ten-Tails
. Himawari recognises the tailed beast as the Nine-Tails.

Chapter 10

"
Kernel
" (
因子
,
Inshi
)

Jura
 wonders if
Team 10
 is running away to avoid damage to the village.
Konohamaru
 arrives with back-up, and is informed by
Shikamaru
 that they have fled with
Himawari
, who is the
God Trees
' target. Shikamaru wants
Kawaki
 to let
Boruto
 free, because he also considers the God Trees as enemies. Kawaki is more concerned about Himawari's safety, and flies off, followed by a complaining
Delta
. Shikamaru checks in with Boruto, who downplays his situation.
Hidari
 wonders why they're being interfered with, Jura telling him to ask them while he goes after Himawari. Hidari can't comprehend the
Konoha
 shinobi's attitude. Konohamaru checks with the
Konoha Barrier Team
, and is confused by their claim that the one in front of him has
Sasuke
's chakra signature.
Sarada
 and
Sumire
 arrive, Hidari immediately rushing to Sarada through
Claw Marks
 and striking her with
Chidori
. She dodges him and lands one of her own, puzzled by his use of Chidori.
Kurama
 introduces itself to Himawari, who asks if it's the one who existed inside her father, and where they are. Kurama explains they're nowhere real, exchanging words mind to mind because they're a single body and soul. In reality, Himawari is passed out. Jura is catching up to Team 10. Kurama confirms to Himawari that its previous self existed inside
Naruto
, but its life was extinguished, and explains that death isn't permanent for
tailed beasts
, a kernel of them eventually remanifesting somewhere.
 Kurama says there's no knowing where this might happen, or how long it might take, intrigued that it happened so soon, and in Naruto's daughter. It speculates if it was due to her being born with a fraction of its chakra, or a fate brought upon by being born of
Uzumaki
 and
Hyūga
 blood, but places more importance in that it happened, rather than on how. They are pleased to meet each other. Himawari wakes up, to Team 10's relief, and asks Kurama for help. Jura cuts off one of the bird's wings with a
Tailed Beast Ball
.
Chōchō
 has everyone grab onto her,
expands herself
, and bounces safely to the ground. Jura lands near them, complimenting their team-work once again, lamenting having to kill them. Kurama admonishes Himawari asking for help, saying she's the only one in a position to do anything, whether she squanders its chakra or not, noting that her affinity for it surpasses that of any of its previous hosts, even Naruto's. Encouraged by Kurama's words, Himawari attacks, but Jura casually breaks her right ankle.
Inojin
 attacks with a
beast drawing
, but it is also easily destroyed. Jura begins creating a tree around Himawari, which will turn her into nourishment for him. Inojin attacks, against
Shikadai
's warning, but is kneed in the gut, falling to the ground, Himawari asking him to stop. When Inojin still reaches to stop Jura, he creates a
tree
, which pierces Inojin's torso, to everyone's shock. Jura wonders if this is the "aesthetics" he read about. Himawari breaks free of the tree, her hair swinging out, thicker whisker marks, and eyes like Kurama's, more forcefully telling Jura to stop. Chōchō and Shikadai are intrigued, while her intensity piques Jura's interest. Kurama notes she has snapped, and looks forward to running amok some with her.

Chapter 11

"
True Power
" (
本気
,
Gachi
)

Though attributing
Himawari
's power to
Kurama
's chakra,
Jura
 remains intrigued.
Shikadai
 notices she can walk fine, her leg healed. Himawari removes
Inojin
 from the
tree
 with her hair, healing his injury as she places him down. She isn't sure if he healed right, and tells the others to take Inojin to a medic. Shikadai and
Chōchō
 ask about her power, but she isn't sure about that as well, intending to take Jura down. Chōchō doesn't want to leave Himawari behind, but Shikadai agrees with her assessment, earning Jura's praise. Himawari agrees with Chōchō that she's not comfortable fighting alone, but feels that what her
father
 and brother would do. Chōchō holds her to a promise of trying a new pancake house later, and leaves with her team. Jura remains puzzled by what influences their decision-making. He wonders how what Inojin did might have sparked the power in Himawari, who punches him quite a distance. He flies up in the air, charging up a
Tailed Beast Ball
 in response to Himawari's.
Team 10
 notices the explosion. Jura is curious about her rapid development, and begins putting a bit of effort in the fight, inspired by her power.
Sarada
 believes
Hidari
's wound to be fatal, and offers to ease his suffering in exchange for telling her about himself and how he can use
Chidori
.
 Hidari moves through
Claw Marks
, emerging healed. He asks if her eyes are
Sharingan
, recalling that Jura told him about them, realising those are required for his attack to be properly controlled.
Konohamaru
 asks what his connection to
Sasuke
 is, but Jura doesn't know, clarifying he came to
Konoha
 to learn who he is.
Sumire
 yells to everyone that his target is Sarada. Putting his hand through his cloak, he strikes Sarada with
Lightning Release
 through a Claw Mark. One of the shinobi attempts to attack with an
Earth Release
, but Hidari burns him with
Fire Release
. Konohamaru attempts a
Rasengan
, but Hidari slips behind him through another mark. Konohamaru blocks his Chidori with a
Wind Release barrier
 of his own. Hidari knocks Sumire out as she tries to help Sarada, who remains paralysed by the Lightning Release. Jura has the upper hand against Himawari, noting that her regeneration ability is closer to a
tailed beasts
' than that a
jinchūriki
's.
Kurama
 begrudgingly admits they're outmatched.
Kawaki
 and
Delta
 are flying on route, Delta asking him what he thinks he can do when Jura already outclassed him.
Boruto
 overtakes them, rescuing Himawari. Hidari doesn't know who he is, but has some awareness of Sarada, and wants to consume her to learn who he is, and begins turning his arm into wood to encase her. She notices a
toad
. Another confirms Sarada's position to Boruto, who
teleports
 with Himawari to her location. He cuts through Hidari's arm. The God Trees are annoyed by Boruto, referring to him as an
Ōtsutsuki
.

Chapter 12

"
Thornsoul
" (
棘魂
,
Togedama
)

Boruto
 arrives to save
Sarada
 and the other
Konoha
 ninja. He leaves the unconscious
Himawari
 in
Konohamaru
's care when suddenly,
Hidari
 attacks him. Boruto
blows
 him away, but Hidari retreats into one of the laid out
Claw Marks
. Boruto explains to Konohamaru Hidari's origins, revealing he is a result of
Sasuke
 being devoured by a
Claw Grime
. Upon hearing this connection to
Moegi
, Konohamaru decides to assist Boruto. The God Tree summons several Claw Grimes. Hidari is then shown in an unknown location, atop a
Daihakoten
, healing. After healing quickly from presumed
Divine Tree
 roots, he reappears behind Sarada and Boruto. Boruto prepares his
Uzuhiko
, while Sarada defends him from Hidari's surprise attacks through the Claw Marks. Konohamaru uses
Spiralling Barrier
 to thwart the ambush. After Boruto strikes Hidari with his new Rasengan,
Kawaki
 appears to finish him off, completely obliterating him. Boruto then finds Hidari's Thorn Soul Bulb, which he explains can save Sasuke. Suddenly,
Jura
 snipes Boruto down with a
blast
 and retrieves the bulb, deciding that Boruto must be eliminated as a threat and Kawaki will be preserved for consumption.
