Summary

As he was about to leave the village,
Naruto
 asks
Shikamaru
 to say sorry to
Boruto
, and heads off towards
Orochimaru
's hideout. Just as Naruto leaves, Boruto arrives together with
Mitsuki
, with the intent to bring Naruto his lunch.
Sarada
 offers to help bring the food to Naruto and though he is hesitant at first, Boruto later hands it over to Sarada and she heads off together with
Chōchō
. Unbeknownst to them, however, the two are being watched by a
tiny figure with a single Sharingan
. At a remote clearing,
Shin
 is ordered by his
father
 to capture Sarada.
 Sarada and Chōchō continue to pursue Naruto to deliver his lunch, to which Naruto notices using
Sage Mode
 and hurries back to them in order to avoid wasting time. Stopping momentarily as they catch their breath, Sarada and Chōchō are intruded by Shin. Sarada remarks on his Sharingan as her
mother
 had told her that aside from
Sasuke
, they were the
last
 of the
Uchiha
. Shin quickly engages and overwhelms the girls in their brief scuffle, until Naruto intervenes in the end and saves them.
