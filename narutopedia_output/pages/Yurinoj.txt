Yurinojō
 (
百合之丞
) is a ninja from the
Land of Vegetables
.

Background

He is skilled in the use of his clan's secret flower-oriented techniques. He grew up and trained alongside his friend
Kikunojō
, with whom he shared a friendly rivalry. When still kids, he and Kikunojō developed a huge crush on
Tsunade
 and fought for her affection (at least according to Tsunade).

Personality

Yurinojō is a more insecure person than Kikunojō, but at the same time he is not afraid to contradict
Haruna
, with equal respect to his comrade. Respect for the princess is especially evident in the moment when Yurinojō protects Haruna from being hit by
Naruto
 with himself, receiving a blow in the face, and apologised to him for the princess's behaviour. He has great respect for Kikunojō and honours him as the stronger one, regretting that he will not be able to surpass him due to the latter's death.

Appearance

He is a medium height man with black eyes, thick eyebrows, and short dark grey hair. He wears a light-coloured jacket with a turquoise vest over it, darker pants, sandals, and a sword on his back. While disguised as a merchant, he wore a grey suit with orange trim, a light-coloured beanie, and a shoulder bag.

Abilities

Yurinojō specialises in
Flower Ninja Art
; a subset of
ninjutsu
 and
genjutsu
 involving flowers. He can turn
flowers
 into
shuriken
 or have the flowers
ignite into flames
 to surround and kill the opponent.

Part I

Peddlers Escort Mission

Peddlers Escort Mission

When the infamous
Janin
 attacked the Land of Vegetables, the
daimyō
 sent Kikunojō and Yurinojō to protect his daughter,
Haruna
. Fearing that their combined skills would not be enough, Kikunojō hired
Konoha
 for assistance. Unfortunately, due to little money, they could only be offered assistance at a C-rank level mission under the guise of escorting merchants. To further this deception, Kikunojō, Haruna, and Yurinojō disguised themselves as merchants as well. When it later became clear that the Criminal Brothers saw through their deceptions, Kikunojō went off to face them head-on.

After learning of Kikunojō's demise, Yurinojō assisted
Naruto
 and
Chōji
 in defeating
Ruiga
, one of the Criminal Brothers. He figured out that Ruiga was using his
tonfa
 as dowsing rods to find water sources for his techniques to work. He helped trick Ruiga into following them to a rocky area where water was scarce, preventing him from using his water-based techniques.
