This group of
kunoichi
 are spies from
Takigakure
. Initially the group had four members, but they lost a member that apparently had been gathering intel during a battle. This deceased member managed to hide gathered intel on
Konoha
's border patrol procedure on a
kunai
 attached to a bird's nest. They possessed some skill, possessing
multiple shuriken oriented
 techniques, wielded
swords
 and had enough skill in
nature transformation
 to perform a
cooperation

Fire Release

technique
.

After looking for the intel paper, they eventually stumbled into
Naruto Uzumaki
 who had found what they were looking for, however they were unable to retrieve it. They were easily defeated by
Kakashi Hatake
 using a combination of his
Earth Release: Earth-Style Wall
 to defend and his
Lightning Cutter
 for offence. They were most likely taken in for questioning after as they were seen bound and gagged afterward.

Out of the three remaining members the one with the silver grey hair acted as a leader of sorts. Tough and harsh, she gave orders with decisiveness and had no quarrels about killing Naruto and Iruka when they didn't hand over their objective.
