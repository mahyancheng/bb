 gives his arguments.

 becomes suspicious and uses his
Byakugan
. In the
Konoha
, the members of
Team 8
,
Team 10
, and
Team Guy
 decide that
Sasuke
's recent actions will only drag the village into a war. On behalf of the group,
Shikamaru
 approaches
Team 7
 with plans to eliminate Sasuke before he can become more of a burden. This, combined with
Sai
's claims that making

 happy causes

 more pain than Sasuke does, causes Sakura to agree. Back at the Summit, thanks to his Byakugan, which comes from a defeated member of the

, to
manipulate
 Mifune. Before Danzō can be questioned about this,
Zetsu
, on
Tobi
's order, infiltrates the Summit and tells the
Kage
 that Sasuke is nearby.
