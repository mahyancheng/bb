The
Ama no Hoko
 (
天の矛
,
literally meaning:
 Spear of Heaven) is a massive tower-like structure concealed beneath
The Hole
.

Description

A massive, three-segmented, black tower, the Ama no Hoko can collapse onto itself to be concealed beneath the ground. When active, channels across its surface glow bright red with its energy. Panels of its middle section move out on beams, revealing a solid red core, and a shaft of red light is emitted from its top. It is controlled by sound patterns produced by the
Saezuri
.

History

Hidden for many years beneath
Tonika Village
, the village's militia was tasked with protecting its activation device. While the
village's leader
 was seemingly the only one aware of the full details of his village's "treasure", when attacked, he dispersed the metal bars which produced the notes for controlling the Ama no Hoko amongst the rest of the militia, ordering them to be disposed of. This clearly displays that he, at least, was aware of the danger posed by the weapon.

Effects

An ancient super weapon of some kind, the tower's purpose is unknown. From what was shown, it could release massive amounts of energy that caused adverse weather effects. When empowered by this energy, the
Nine-Tailed Naruto Clone
 was warped and transformed into a massive
Kurama
 and
Orochi
-like hybrid creature with immense powers. The tower's energy output could be controlled by the sound patterns produced by the
Saezuri
.

Trivia

The name Ama no Hoko is most likely a reference to the
Amenonuhoko
 (
天沼矛, 天之瓊矛, 天瓊戈
,
literally meaning:
 Heavenly Jewelled Spear),
a naginata
 wielded by the god
Izanagi
 which he used to churn the seas and raise a large amount of earth that formed the very first island that would later become his and his wife's home.
