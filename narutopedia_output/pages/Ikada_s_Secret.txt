"
Ikada's Secret
" (
イカダの秘密
,
Ikada no Himitsu
) is episode 241 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Seiren
 and her subordinates arrive at an island, where traitors who once followed the
Funato
 attempt curry favour by offering treasures after learning of
Araumi
's return. Furious, Seiren kills their elder. At the shipbuilders' island,
Kajiki
 praises
Ikada
's work, who estimates the repairs will be complete in two or three days.
Boruto
 and Ikada eat together at sunset, and Ikada talks what he has yet to learn to fulfil his dream. At night, the
swordsmen
 discuss the prospect of their reduced sentences. In the morning, Seiren disguises herself and visits Ikada. She wants him to go back, but he claims there's nothing he can do. She refutes it by saying he has the power everyone in the Funato clan possesses. They think back to when their father held a ceremony to determine Ikada's powers. Ikada was scared, and
Tenma
 thought little of him. Araumi threw Ikada at the stormy sea, and the sea threw him back on land. Seiren says he displayed more power than anyone in their clan, and that Araumi acknowledged him. Ikada claims no memory of displaying any sort of power, and that he left after Araumi was imprisoned so he could become useful to their clan. He points out she reasoned with everyone, allowing him to leave, but she reveals she did so he'd witness how corrupt the
Land of Water
 had become, and come back on his own.
 She says he has power as a Funato, and should use it for the Funato. Ikada refuses, wishing to follow his own dream. She asks if he knows what their clan has been through, and says she'll come back from him at night. Boruto comes to see Ikada, and Seiren notices his
Konoha

forehead protector
, recalling Tenma's testimony of their interference with their plans. She finds it a good opportunity to show what happens to their enemies.
Kagura
 checks on
Kawaki
, and tells him he wants to be for the swordsmen who Boruto was to him.
Sarada
 arrives with a message for Kagura.
Hebiichigo
 overhears their sentences have only been reduced by three years, and leaves before hearing Kagura plans to appeal on their behalf. She informs
Kyohō
 and
Buntan
, and plans to runaway. Buntan points out their
juinjutsu
, and Hebiichigo decides to neutralise it by killing Kagura. Buntan and Kyohō are still uninterested, pointing out they'd be on the run for the rest of their lives, and would likely be captured again. She tells Hebiichigo to run away by herself if she's so interested. Seiren returns to her ship at sundown, and prepares for a night attack, wishing for a single survivor to tell of the power of the Funato. Hebiichigo attempts to kill Kagura in his sleep, but he was prepared for an attack. Despite his intention of making another appeal, she has no interest in going back to jail, and flees. Hebiichigo spots Seiren's ship approaching.
