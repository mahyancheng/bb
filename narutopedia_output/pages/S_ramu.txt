 (

) was the mother and predecessor of
Sāra
 as the Queen of
Rōran
.

Background






Sēramu and her daughter, Sāra, singing while playing with her harp.



Sēramu lived a happy life with her daughter as the Queen of Rōran. They usually sang together while she played her harp. One day, a man who introduced himself as
Anrokuzan
 convinced her to use the power of the
Ryūmyaku
 and his technology to make Rōran grow with thousands of towers for the sake of the people. However, Sēramu realised she was being used by Anrokuzan. Refusing to help him any further in his ambitions, she was murdered by Anrokuzan, who used his chakra strings to send a blade into her back from afar. Sāra replaced her as the new Queen, unaware of the truth behind her mother's death.

Personality

Sēramu from what has been seen is a very caring and loving mother that would sing and play with her daughter Sāra. She, unaware of what was actually happening, would do just about anything for the sake of her people. Upon discovering that Anrokuzan was using her, Sēramu refused to help him any further.

Appearance

She was a young woman with long black hair, green eyes, and fair skin. As the Queen of Rōran, she wore purple and pink robes, a golden necklace with a red jewel around her neck, and brown sandals. She also used bright red lipstick.

Abilities

As the Queen of Rōran, Sēramu had the power to control the Ryūmyaku, an ancient
chakra
 flow located deep beneath the kingdom.
