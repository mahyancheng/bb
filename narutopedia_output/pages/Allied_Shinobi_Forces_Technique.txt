Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Despite the swell in numbers of their opponents,
Madara
 and
Obito
 note that their efforts were still futile and that even after this war, history would only repeat itself and they would end up in this very same predicament.
Naruto
 chastises them both noting that when there was a difference of opinion in a group, the majority should rule. Accepting his premise, Obito simply notes that they would make their decision after exterminating the Alliance. Using this time
Shikaku
, through
Inoichi
's
telepathic
 ability, is able to relay the strategy he had formulated with the entire Alliance. With this, the Alliance launch their strategy, the first step being to slow down their targets by blinding them, which was executed by the
Kumo
-nin, with
C
 and a few others using the
Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar
 technique followed by
Darui
, and other
Storm Release
 wielders using the
Storm Release: Laser Circus
 technique to create a cloud of dust. Secondly the
Suna
-nin use the
Wind Release: Air Current Wild Dance
 to manipulate said dust to obscure their opponent's vision once again, adding it to what remains of the
Insect Jamming Technique
 and
Hiding in Mist Technique
 from earlier to completely impair the opponents'
sensory
 skills. Following this,
Kitsuchi
 and a group of
Iwa
-nin
sink
 the beast into a hole allowing
his daughter
, and other
Lava Release
 users to cover the beast in
quicklime
 which was mixed with
water
 by the
Kiri
-nin. Finishing off, members of
Konoha
's
Sarutobi clan

hardened
 the mixture using
Fire Release
. This leads Madara to state how surprised he was that
shinobi
 from different countries were able to pull off such a perfect combination. Shikaku informs them that they have to defeat Madara and Obito while the
Ten-Tails
 was still restrained recommending the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
 to coordinate with Naruto to exploit Obito's weakness and telling all shinobi who were skilled in
taijutsu
 to deal with Madara. As the Allied Ninja Forces bear down on them, Madara and Obito stare disdainfully as Obito notes that they clung onto hope that did not exist and that the Ten-Tails had finally reached maturity.
