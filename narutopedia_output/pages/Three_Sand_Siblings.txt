The
Three Sand Siblings
 is the collective name for the children of
Sunagakure
's
Fourth Kazekage
:
Temari
,
Kankurō
 and
Gaara
. Having undergone the gruelling training of their village, these three are regarded as elite shinobi of their village that excel in long-range combat.

In Part I, they took part in the
Chūnin Exams
 in
Konoha
, with
Baki
 serving as their
jōnin
 commander. Although meant to appear as prospective
chūnin
, they were actually waiting for the
Konoha Crush
 to begin. They were later sent to aid the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 as a sign of goodwill between the now allied nations after what happened during the would-be invasion attempt.

In the anime, during the
Sunagakure Support Mission
, the Sand Siblings chased after the
Four Celestial Symbols Men
 who had kidnapped Gaara's student
Matsuri
.
Kujaku
 battled Temari,
Ryūgan
 battled Kankurō, and Gaara battled
Suiko
. They each were almost killed until
Shikamaru
,
Ino
,
Kiba
,
Chōji
,
Rock Lee
, and
Naruto
 saved them, to pay them back for the Sasuke Recovery mission.
Hōki
 eventually got Gaara to unleash the
Shukaku
 and revive
Seimei
, but Gaara destroyed him.

Some time after the Konoha Crush failed, its members were promoted: Gaara became the
Kazekage
, Kankurō and Temari became jōnin, Temari also becoming an ambassador.

In Part II, Temari and Kankurō attended Gaara to the
Five Kage Summit
 as his bodyguards.

Following the end of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Gaara remained the Kazekage and Kankurō his bodyguard. Temari at some point emigrated to Konoha after marrying
Shikamaru Nara
, and eventually had a son named
Shikadai
. In the
epilogue
, Gaara and Kankurō visited their sister and nephew before attending the then-upcoming Five Kage Summit meeting.
