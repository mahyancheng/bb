Dosu Kinuta
 (
ドス・キヌタ
) was a
shinobi
 of
Otogakure
 and also the unofficial leader of
Team Dosu
. He participated in the
Chūnin Exams
 under covert orders from
Orochimaru
.

Personality

Dosu was demonstrated to be a very alert and logical ninja. He rarely rushed into anything before first observing and analysing the situation. Dosu seemed very loyal to Orochimaru's cause, to his village, and to a lesser degree, his teammates. When he heard
Kabuto
 claiming their country and village less prestigious, he considered retaliating, but apologised to
Ibiki Morino
 when he threatened his team with failing the exam. Although he claimed that Oto-nin are willing to sacrifice their own teammates for their cause, he promised to avenge
Zaku
 after his debilitating defeat by
Shino Aburame
. At first, he showed dedication to Orochimaru's task of killing
Sasuke Uchiha
, but later became disillusioned after learning that Orochimaru had given Sasuke a
cursed seal
. Realising that he and his team were actually pawns used to determine Sasuke's worth, Dosu's outlook changed as he lost any and all loyalty as well as respect towards Orochimaru and vowed to kill Sasuke for the purpose of undermining Orochimaru. Because of this, he would attempt to take down
Gaara
 prior to the actual match to lessen the obstacles beforehand, a rather rash decision that ultimately cost Dosu his life. He was also described as courteous and reliable.

Appearance






Dosu's full appearance.



Dosu had bandages covering most of his face, leaving only his left eye and eyebrow uncovered. He also wore a large poncho with long sleeves, a snake patterned scarf around his neck,
a straw raincoat
 protruding from the back of his scarf, and a large amplifier on his right arm for most of his attacks. His back was hunched, which made him look smaller than he actually was. He had short black buzzcut hair.

Abilities






Dosu using Resonating Echo Drill.



Dosu's battle style revolved around his ability to manipulate sound. He had a very keen awareness and understanding of sound-waves. During the first round of the Chūnin Exams, he simply listened to the strokes of other ninja's pencils to determine what they were writing for the written test.
 His main attack was done with help from the
Resonating Echo Speaker
 on his right forearm, which he used to
generate sound
 for his attacks. His abilities attacked the inner ear, directing his sound deep into it, which would cause great pain, disorientation, vertigo and nausea. During their match, Chōji attempted to block his attacks by pulling his head inside his
Human Bullet Tank
, only to be thwarted by the fact that, by directing sound through the water in his body, Dosu could still generate the effect, instantly defeating Chōji.
 Dosu was also quite intelligent, perceiving Sakura's traps and Orochimaru's plan to test Sasuke.

Dosu and his team before the exams.



Team Dosu travelled to and arrived in
Konohagakure
 to participate in the Chūnin Exam. Before the exam started, Dosu and his team overheard
Kabuto
 dismissing their village as unimportant and decided to attack him because of it. After Zaku threw
kunai
 to distract Kabuto, Dosu ambushed him and attacked with his
Resonating Echo Speaker
, damaging Kabuto's hearing. To prevent the situation from escalating, the exam proctors, led by
Ibiki Morino
, appeared and settled things down. After Dosu passed the written portion of the
Chūnin Exams
 by interpreting the sound of others' pencil markings, he moved onto the second phase of the exam alongside his teammates. During the second phase in the
Forest of Death
, Dosu initiated his team's real mission; killing
Sasuke Uchiha
.






Dosu fighting Lee.



With Naruto and Sasuke unconscious due to their previous battle with Orochimaru,
Sakura Haruno
 is left to fend on her own. Seeing an opportunity to kill Sasuke, Team Dosu leave their position and attack Sakura, who activates the traps she laid out. Dosu announces that they want to fight Sasuke and tells Sakura to wake him up with Sakura stating that she knows that a man named Orochimaru was pulling the strings which leaves Team Dosu stunned. After getting past the traps, Team Dosu was intercepted by
Rock Lee
. Dosu recklessly attacked Lee and ended up the victim of his
Front Lotus
 technique. Seeing that his teammate was going to be killed, Zaku softened the ground, leaving Dosu to survive the attack. Suffering from the side effects of using the Front Lotus, Dosu effortlessly defeated Lee. With Lee out of the way, Team Dosu once again advanced towards Sakura, leading to
Team 10
 intervening. After the fighting began between the two teams, Dosu tried giving aid to Zaku who was fighting against
Chōji
 but was caught in
Shikamaru
's
Shadow Imitation Technique
. With Shikamaru's jutsu coming to an end, Lee's teammates arrived. After noticing
Neji
's
Byakugan
, Sasuke woke up. Looking on in fear after witnessing Sasuke's
curse mark
 he had received from Orochimaru activate, Zaku attacked the Uchiha before Dosu had the chance to warn him of the situation. After dodging Zaku's attack, Sasuke quickly defeated him and turned his attention towards Dosu. Seeing the predicament his was in, Dosu handed over his scroll to Team 7 and fled with his teammates.






Dosu charging at Gaara.



During the preliminaries, Team Dosu reunited with Orochimaru, who was disguised as their Otogakure sensei. After watching Zaku lose his fight against
Shino
, he vowed to avenge him. During the last match of the preliminaries, he was matched up against Chōji Akimichi. Chōji used his
Human Bullet Tank
 technique with the assumption that he was safe from Dosu's sound technique, but Dosu attacked and defeat him with one blow. After winning his fight, he was assigned to fight Shikamaru Nara during the first round of the finals.

In an effort to make sure that Sasuke survived until they could fight so that he could kill him personally, Dosu challenged
Gaara
, Sasuke's first opponent, on the roof top of
Kikyō Castle
 to a fight.
 Despite Dosu's confidence, Gaara promptly killed him, while
Baki
 and
Kabuto Yakushi
 witnessed it.
