Synopsis

The Nine-Tails attacking Konoha.

Twelve years before the start of the series, the
ninja
 village of
Konohagakure
 was
attacked
 by the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
. The village was only saved from complete destruction by the actions of Konoha's leader, the
Fourth Hokage
, who sacrificed his life to seal the Nine-Tails into a newborn:
Naruto Uzumaki
. Orphaned by the attack, Naruto grew up shunned by most of the villagers, who hated and feared him because of the Nine-Tails trapped within him. Unaware of the monster he contained, Naruto longed for acknowledgment, and so vowed to one day become the greatest
Hokage
 the village had ever seen.

Bet Your Life On It

Sarada Uchiha
 and
Sumire
 are held captive by
Daemon
, but he suddenly releases his grip on their necks. When Daemon states that he has the ability to kill them before they can even react, as he just demonstrated, Sarada questions why he did not do so.
Ada
 ponders why Sarada and Sumire would be immune to
Omnipotence
. It is not due to them falling in love with
Boruto Uzumaki
, an
Ōtsutsuki
, as there are other girls in the village who have crushes on Boruto and
Kawaki
. Ada figures out that it is due to her unconsciously providing an exception for the two of them. Ada reminds the two of a past conversation where Ada openly spoke about wanting to be friends, and one of her deepest desires is to have normal, genuine relationships with others. Ada admits that even if Sarada and Sumire did display an intention to kill her, she would accept it as long as they are the ones to. Moved by Ada's words, Sarada grabs Sumire's hand and the two rush to give Ada a hug. When Ada questions this, Sarada states that she is showing the proof of her resolve and a symbol of their genuine friendship. Ada thanks the two of them while Daemon grins.

Naruto
 goes to the entrance of the stadium where there's a banner announcing that the
Chūnin Exams
 will be the next day. He eats at the

 gave him a big bowl of ramen on the house, since his match will be tomorrow. The

Temari
 and
Kankurō

Neji
 and
Tenten
 are shown to be practising, as well as
Shino
. The next day, Naruto meets
Hinata
 where
Team 7
 had their
bell test
. Hinata concludes that he may defeat Neji, adding that Naruto's words of encouragement during her match with Neji made her a better person. This prompts Naruto to say that he likes people like Hinata and invites her to watch his fight against Neji. Hearing fireworks, he rushes to the stadium so he could make it in time. On his way, he sees
Konohamaru
 who tells Naruto that he knows the shortcut to the stadium, but Konohamaru just brings him to the other side of the village. He then tells Naruto to ride the daimyō's bulls to the stadium; Naruto kicks the bull, causing a stampede. Despite the trouble, Naruto finally arrives to the stadium, just in time for his match.
