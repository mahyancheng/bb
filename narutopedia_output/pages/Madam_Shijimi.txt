Madam Shijimi
 (
マダム・しじみ
,
Madamu Shijimi
) is the wife of the
daimyō
 of the
Land of Fire
.
Team Kakashi
 in Part I and
Team Ebisu
 in Part II are assigned to find her lost cat,
Tora
, soon after becoming
genin
.

Personality

She has been described as spendthrift, vain, and philanthropistic. She also loves her cat a lot, although the cat clearly does not share the same degree of affection to her.

Appearance

Madam Shijimi is a corpulent woman with dark brown hair that she keeps in three separate poofs. She wears pink lipstick, pink nail-polish and purple eyeshadow. She also wears many different coloured rings.

Part I

Prologue — Land of Waves

She has a cat named Tora that runs away a lot and she hires Team 7 of
Konoha
 to find Tora for her. Tora is later returned to her.

Part II

Kazekage Rescue Mission

Main article:
Kazekage Rescue Mission

In the anime, Tora runs away again and she hires
Team Ebisu
 to catch her cat. Tora is captured once again and returned to her.

Video Games

Her character was further explored in
Naruto: Uzumaki Chronicles
 and she is portrayed as devious, dishonest, and unfair. She hired bandits to stage an attack against her Villa just so she can cover up the fact that her cat was the one who broke valuable treasures. She wanted to take advantage of
Naruto
's ignorance and lied to him saying that she favoured him after he helped found her cat last time. She also did not pay the bandits who she hired even though she promised them the money they needed to support their families. Since they failed their mission last time, she did not give them their due payment. She was a burden on Naruto and
Shikamaru
 in the game.

Trivia

"Shijimi" (蜆) is the Japanese name for the "
basket clam
", a clam that can be used as an ingredient for Japanese food like, for example,
miso soup
.
