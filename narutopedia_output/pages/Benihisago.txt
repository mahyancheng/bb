The
Benihisago
 (
紅葫蘆
,
literally meaning:
 Crimson Gourd) is a giant brown-coloured gourd with a red cloth around it. It is able to  take a person's
word soul
 (
言霊
,
kotodama
,
English TV:
 spirit word) hostage by saying the verbal command "record" (
録音しろ
,
rokuonshiro
,
English TV:
 record them). After the word soul has been drawn out by the
Kōkinjō
 and then severed from their body by the
Shichiseiken
, it is absorbed into the gourd. Completing these conditions "curses" the victim; if they utter the word they have said the most during their life, they will be sucked into and trapped within the Benihisago. Saying a
homophone
 of their most frequently spoken word, or even saying nothing at all for a certain amount of time, will also trigger the gourd's suction. If a victim starts to be sucked into Benihisago, the suction will stop if their most-used word changes. Kurama noted that whatever was sucked into the gourd was sealed away and could not come out, no matter what.
 It can even keep those brought back with
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 sealed after the summoner releases the technique. Despite this,
Darui
 managed to release
Samui
 and
Atsui
 after attaining the gourd,
 along with the
Kōkinjō
 that was captured alongside its wielder.

The Benihisago is revered as one of the
treasured tools
 of the
Sage of Six Paths
. All five of the tools consume enormous amounts of
chakra
 when used, so much so that normal humans would die after using the tools for only a short period of time. When the tools later came into the possession of
Kumogakure
, only the
Gold and Silver Brothers
, due to their large chakra reserves, were able to wield the treasures without fatal repercussions. When not in use,
Ginkaku
 used the Kōkinjō to tie the gourd around his neck for easier transportation. When the rope is removed for combat, he must carry the gourd.

Tobi later steals it and allows the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 to devour it in order to acquire the
Nine-Tails
' chakra from Ginkaku. After
Madara Uchiha
 became the
Ten-Tails
' jinchūriki, with both Gyūki and Kurama's Yang half fully instilled as part of the Ten-Tails, he spat out both the Benihisago and Kohaku no Jōhei from his body, deeming them useless. They landed on top of
Might Guy
 and
Rock Lee
.
 Tenten now keeps it within one of her scrolls.
 After the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Tenten placed the Benihisago, the Kōkinjō and the
Bashōsen
 on display in her weapons shop.

Trivia

The Benihisago is based on a tool from the Chinese classic "
Journey to the West
". In this story; there are two demon king brothers, known as the Great King Kinkaku (
金角大王
,
Kinkaku-daiō
) and the Great King Ginkaku (
銀角大王
,
Ginkaku-daiō
). The siblings possess five treasured tools, one of which is called the Crimson Gourd (
紅葫蘆
) and has the ability to suck in their opponents, melting them once they are trapped within.
