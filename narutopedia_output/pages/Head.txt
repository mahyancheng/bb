Summary

As various shinobi as well as techniques bear down on the two
Uchiha
,
Madara
 realises that they were being targeted this time. He notes, however, that in order to do that, the Alliance would have had to stop the
Ten-Tails
 first. With this, a powerful blast sends the incoming shinobi flying away and the further-matured Ten-Tails emerges from the pit. While the medical teams move out to tend to the injured,
Shikaku
,
Inoichi
,
Ao
 and the others discuss what was happening on the battlefield. Now finding it even harder to control the beast,
Obito
 and Madara use
Hashirama
's cells in order to fortify their control over the beast as the former agrees with the legendary Uchiha that it was time they showed the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 true despair. As the beast fires off a
Tailed Beast Ball
,
Kitsuchi
 is able to deflect its course using
Earth Release
 underfoot the beast. A second Tailed Beast Ball is launched which detonates in a nearby lake and a third which
Hiashi
 notes, destroys an entire town in an instant. Initially believing that the towns where the civilians were, was now unsafe, the fourth Tailed Beast Ball which is launched is noted to be heading straight for HQ as Shikaku surmised. As Inoichi asks for directives, Shikaku tells him that the only thing they could do was what they were assigned to until the very end, and for what appears to be the final time, Inoichi patches Shikaku through to the entire Alliance as the genius
Nara
 passes on his final strategy to defeat the enemy. Meanwhile, on the battlefield, Madara exclaims that they were finally able to get them with the Tailed Beast Ball, noting that it was a simple war tactic to take out the "
head
" of their opposition.
