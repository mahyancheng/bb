Never Give Up
, performed by "Jeremy A. Sweet" and "Ian C. Nickus", is the English theme song of the movie
Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow
. It is sometimes called the "Lost" Naruto theme song because some have claimed to have found it hard to find, online or elsewhere. The English adaptation replaced
Home Sweet Home
 with this theme due to licensing restrictions.

Lyrics

Force of nature! Unrelenting! Can never fall!

Supersonic! It will charge! Invincible!

Here we go!

There's always something steering the path I lead

There's always someone ticking and kicking inside of me

I...I...will never give up!

I...I...never give up!

Ever changing and evolving, life renewed

From a fire flies a phoenix born into...

Here we go!

The days of darkness, trawling the battlefields

Remember your true friend, call him and put your trust in me...

I...I...will never give up!

I...I...will never give up!

(will never give up, yeah!)

(In like a hurricane...)

(like jerks...in like a hurricane...)

(left tracks...in like a hurricane...)

(in like a hurricane...)

(lightning fast...like a hurricane)

(in like a hurricane...)

(lightning fast...)
