Overload
" (
オーバーロード
,
Ōbārōdo
) is episode 199 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 instructs
Boruto
 to take care of
Kawaki
 and
Himawari
.
Delta
 lashes at Kawaki for endangering a body that, as a Vessel, isn't his. She doesn't answer Naruto's questions, so he dares her to kill him. The two trade several blows as Boruto, Kawaki, and Himawari watch. Naruto reminds her of his threat, saying it's too late now that she hurt Kawaki, so he'll go after everyone in
Kara
. He gets close to her, so she fires her eye beams, which he blocks with a
Big Ball Rasengan
. Delta begins
absorbing
 it, so Naruto ups the ante by growing it into an
Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan
. Boruto realises his strategy. Delta mocks Naruto for thinking she can't absorb bigger jutsu. Kawaki finds the strategy futile, but Boruto corrects him that's not what Naruto is doing. Delta realises Naruto's plan, and Boruto explains to Kawaki he's trying to overtax her absorption. Her
shinobi-ware
 overheats, her eyes ceasing to function. Naruto explains he realised that when she fired back his
Rasengan
, it meant it was stored somewhere, and such storage would have a limit. Naruto boasts about his chakra reserves, and Delta tries physically attacking him. Naruto dodges it and grows his jutsu into a
Super-Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan
, landing it on her.
 It carves a crater on the ground, where Delta lays defeated. The children celebrate. Naruto expresses his desire to have her questioned, so Kawaki urges to have her killed immediately. Delta's body sounds off, and self-destructs. Naruto takes the kids out of the blast radius. Delta's
drone
 retreats, witnessed by
Koji
 through his
toad
, who comments that Naruto's power still isn't enough. He's convinced the key will be uncovering the secrets of the
Kāma
 through Boruto. Elsewhere, a couple argues over doctors being unable to treat their sick son. The village is visited by
Boro
 and his followers, where he
cures those who are sick
. Boro talks them into believing that salvation can be achieved through the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
, bringing them into his cult. Later,
Code
 visits Boro and delivers him
Amado
's message telling him to come in for maintenance. Boro claims he's busy, and grows aggravated when Code asks if it's fun to deceive people. Code is willing to use force to bring Boro for maintenance, so he relents. At Kara's headquarters,
Jigen
 finishes recharging, Amado noting it's become more frequent. He reports that there have been no news about the Vessel from either Koji or Delta. From his reaction, Jigen concludes he still hasn't uncovered their mole, which Amado vows to do.
