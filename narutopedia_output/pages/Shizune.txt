Shizune
 (
シズネ
) is a
jōnin
 of
Konohagakure
. An apprentice of
Tsunade
, Shizune became a talented
medical-nin
 under her tutelage. She accompanies Tsunade during her years-long sabbatical from active shinobi duty, only returning to Konoha once Tsunade becomes its Fifth
Hokage
. She assists Tsunade in the duties of Hokage, a role she has continued to serve for both the
Sixth
 and
Seventh Hokage
 as well.

Background






Shizune prepares to perform surgery on Karai.



Shizune is the niece of
Dan Katō
, a renowned shinobi of Konoha. Some time after her uncle's death, Tsunade, his lover, left Konoha and Shizune went with Tsunade as her attendant and apprentice. The bond between Tsunade and Shizune is strong and, above all, the latter sees caring for Tsunade as one of her main priorities.

During their time away from the village, Shizune often worried about Tsunade's constant gambling, losing money and then borrowing more. In the anime, on one such occasion when they were at a gambling den, they were approached by the
Fourth Raikage
 and
Amai
 who beseeched Tsunade to help their
injured comrade
. After Tsunade complied, Shizune was actually the one to conduct the surgery, and when she told the Raikage of her master's two great losses (the deaths of Dan and
Nawaki
), upon hearing his response that her master was unhinged, she chided the Raikage, throwing the
Exploding Insect
 at his feet. Recomposing herself, she told Amai, who had been aiding in the surgery, to finish up.

Personality






Shizune's usual tendency to freak out.



Shizune is always level-headed, practical and a rational thinker. As a result, she is the one who tends to stress over details, such as Tsunade's tendency to gamble frequently, and to think with her heart. She often gets comically worked up over any irrational decision Tsunade makes. Shizune also looks after
Tonton
, Tsunade's pet pig. She is a very kind and calm person but will immediately rush to Tsunade's aid and in contrast, will become fierce and somewhat ruthless; a testament of her loyalty to Tsunade, including losing her temper when anyone insults her. At the same time however, she is not afraid of objecting to Tsunade's decisions or voicing her opinion as seen when she even alerted the
Konoha Council
 to Tsunade's intention to send Naruto on a mission that Shizune thought would put him in great peril, which would at times strain their relationship. A running gag regarding Shizune is her tendency to let out a frightened and rather exaggerated screech of terror whenever someone yells at her, usually Tsunade, or when she comes across something scary and/or inappropriate.

She has a great sense of morale and ethics, as she tried to persuade Tsunade from accepting
Orochimaru
's offer to heal his arms in exchange of reviving Dan and Nawaki, believing the said two would not be happy to return at the cost of innocent lives. Her morale went as far as following
Jiraiya
's lead and possible scenario that they should eliminate Tsunade to prevent her accepting Orochimaru's offer. Likewise, she takes her role as a medical-nin very seriously, which led her to look down on
Kido Tsumiki
 for his immoral idea of giving traumatised children prescriptions for the sake of revenue over Sakura's and Ino's highly effective yet low-cost therapies.






A drunk Shizune's insecurity of her figure.



She is not the type to tire easily and is very energetic and efficient while acting in her capacity of Hokage's Assistant, often urging Tsunade to finish the paperwork in order to avoid mountains of unsigned documents later on. She is often seen asking Tsunade questions about what to do with the village and the shinobi on missions. In the
anime
, she is shown to be insecure about her figure and wary of still being single past the perceived marriageable age, being unable to find a suitable mate due to her extensive travels with Tsunade. Under the influence of alcohol, Shizune openly expresses some minor jealousy of
Kurenai
's ample bust and relationship with
Asuma
.

Appearance

Shizune as a child.
Shizune's usual appearance.
Shizune's shinobi attire.
1/3

Shizune is a fair-skinned woman of average height and slender build with onyx eyes and jet-black hair; her hair is straight and shoulder-length with bangs that cover her ears and frame her face. Normally, Shizune is seen in a long bluish-black kimono with white trimmings, held closed by a white obi, and open-toed sandals with low heels. Shizune has also been seen wearing the standard Konoha shinobi outfit complete with
flak jacket
, when deployed on missions which has distinct, extra-long sleeves. She, however, doesn't wear a
forehead protector
. Shizune also has the tendency to pin her hair up when working; a trait also shared by Sakura.

During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, she donned her standard shinobi attire, albeit with shorter sleeves this time. She also wore the forehead protector of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 and a band around her right arm signifying her position.

Years after the war, Shizune had gained vaguely noticeable creases around her eyes. She wears a black, one-sleeved kimono held closed with a with a sash. Beneath this, she wears mesh armour, which is partially exposed on her sleeveless left-hand-side.

Abilities






Shizune using the Poison Mist technique.



As a
jōnin
 and apprentice of Tsunade, Shizune is undoubtedly a very capable kunoichi.
Jiraiya
 had enough faith in her abilities to leave her to fight
Orochimaru
's right-hand man,
Kabuto Yakushi
.
 A further testament to her credibility is being put in charge of the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
 of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

Ninjutsu

In the anime, she could perform the
Shadow Clone Technique
,
 able to create at least 36 clones at once. She also demonstrated capabilities in
fūinjutsu
, able to lead
her team
 in the process of
sealing
 the
Three-Tails
.

Medical Ninjutsu






Shizune leads the Healing Resuscitation Regeneration Technique.



Shizune is a very talented medical-nin. Her prowess set a high standard for Tsunade's other disciple,
Sakura Haruno
.
 Shizune's refined
chakra control
 allowed her to perform even the most complex medical ninjutsu, such as leading a team to
regenerate
 a person's injured body with new cells, while the slightest mistake could be fatal.

Poison Techniques and Weaponry

Shizune's main tactic in battle involves incorporating
poison
 into her attacks. She can emit a
poisonous gas
 from her mouth that is fatal even if only a whiff of it is inhaled, as noted by Kabuto in the anime.
 Shizune also imbues her
senbon
 and
kunai
 with a poison that can debilitate and paralyze someone with a scratch.
 She can either
fire senbon
 from a concealed
wrist-mounted device
, or from her mouth in quick succession.

Intelligence

Shizune is quite observant and has a keen intellect. She was able to figure out the secret behind the
black receivers
 embedded in Pain's
First Animal Path
 during an autopsy with her team after just a short amount of time.
 Likewise, during the Fourth Shinobi World War, she could find out the DNA-similarities between the
White Zetsu Army
 and the
First Hokage
, something that she already presumed before.

Shizune and Kabuto clash.



When
Orochimaru
 came to Tsunade years later in an attempt to get her to heal his arms, Tsunade turned him down and when Orochimaru refused to leave in Tsunade's count, Shizune clashed with
Kabuto Yakushi
 for a brief moment. Orochimaru bribed Tsunade that if she helped, he would bring her
brother
 and
lover
 back to life and was given a week to think about it, but Shizune attempted to persuade Tsunade against it, even trying to convince Tsunade to kill him with her assistance. When all attempts to persuade Tsunade failed, Shizune tried to use force to stop her from helping Orochimaru, although Tsunade easily defeated her. Later, she fought Kabuto again in an effort to protect an incapacitated Tsunade and
Naruto Uzumaki
. Despite Shizune's efforts, Kabuto proved too much for her, as he managed to dodge her attacks and incapacitate her as well. Shizune was able to heal her legs, and left the field of battle with the unconscious Naruto as the three
Sannin
 prepared to conclude their battle. She then returned to Konoha with Tsunade after she accepted the office of the Fifth
Hokage
.

In the anime, the group stopped in a hot springs town. When
Senta
 and
Bunzō
 had stolen the First Hokage's necklace which was currently worn by Naruto, the two plot to blackmail Tsunade to give them the money she owes their boss. When Shizune found the note, she couldn't find Tsunade anywhere which left her the choice to use the
Transformation Technique
 to pose as Tsunade. When Naruto and the Akagi brothers stole the bag, Shizune in Tsunade's form goes after them. After Shizune took down Naruto, the Akagi brothers discovered that there's no money in it. Just then, the real Tsunade arrived and recognised Shizune in disguise. With help from
Jirōchō Wasabi
 (whom Tsunade encountered in the casino), Tsunade explained that she already paid her debt to the Akagi the year before.

When Tsunade took on the title of Hokage, Shizune led a team consisting of
Genma Shiranui
,
Raidō Namiashi
, and
Iwashi Tatami
 to compensate for the lack of manpower caused by the
Konoha Crush
. While in a forest recuperating from the seemingly tiring mission, they detected a
presence
 close by. Raidō and Genma decide to go to see what it is, leaving Shizune and Iwashi to wait for their return. When the duo took too long to return, Shizune and Iwashi went to see what was taking so long. Upon their arrival, she is shocked to see Genma and Raidō injured on the forest floor. Acting immediately, Shizune gave them medical attention but noted that they needed to be hospitalised. Later, when the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 returned to the village, Shizune led a team of medical-nin including
Kitō
 and
Mogusa
. As the operation went on, Shizune noted that even though they were using Neji's hair as a medium to heal the wounds, that every strand of hair had to be affected by
chakra
 control. Later, though visibly tired, she happily reported the success of the operation to Tsunade.

About two years after Naruto and Jiraiya left the village for training, Tsunade decided to host an early
Chūnin Exams
 to restore Konoha's reputation amongst the other villages. During a meeting between Konoha and the Suna in hopes of getting their support, Shizune presented the files from the previous exams. As Tsunade made her true intention revealed of luring out the Akatsuki,
Gaara
, now the
Kazekage
, insisted that the exams be held within his village. After it was decided to host the first exam in Konoha and the second in Suna, Shizune later voiced in privacy her concerns of using Naruto as a jinchūriki as bait for the Akatsuki, to which Tsunade said Gaara has by luck offered to do that himself.

Ultimately, the Chūnin Exams were ended early before starting the finals due to controversy happening in the second exam. Instead, it was decided by Gaara that a report on each participant would be sent to their respective village leader for them to decide if they would be promoted. Shizune then aided Tsunade in deciding which of the Konoha-nin would be promoted.

Still worried about Naruto's safety she tries once again to plea with her not to send him unbeknownst to her that he was eavesdropping on the conversation until Tsunade acknowledges his presence. Later when the
Konoha Council
 asks to speak with Tsunade, it is revealed that Shizune had shared her uneasiness with Naruto constantly going up against members of

Shizune leading the Logistical Support and Medical Division.



Shizune was appointed captain of the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
 of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. As she introduced herself and Tonton to the division, she explicitly told them that Tonton wasn't to be eaten. She later splits up her division in order to effectively aid all the wounded shinobi on the battlefield. When night fell, Shizune along with all the other medical-nin relocated to the medical compound where she later requested the aid of two jōnin-level medics in resuscitating one of the patients, before later healing Tonton's right front leg that had been sprained due to the piglet carrying too many heavy crates in her zeal to help.






Shizune and Sakura autopsying White Zetsu.



After the
transformed intruder
 that had infiltrated the compound and was killing medics had been uncovered by Sakura, the whole compound was locked down and strict orders given that no-one should go near Shizune nor enter without their identities being confirmed by HQ. Meanwhile in a tent Shizune and Sakura, guarded by an
Akimichi
 conducted an autopsy on the White Zetsu Army clone that had been captured and realised the similarity in its DNA to those of
Yamato
 and by extension,
Hashirama
's had gotten even closer since the events at the
Kage Summit
. They then began to piece together the truth behind the clones and later sent information to Tsunade at the headquarters.

The following day, Shizune and Sakura were approached by two Iwa-nin — one badly injured and the other begging them to save her husband. The Akimichi stationed at the gate however, told them to stay back because they were unable to tell who was who at the moment, and as such, he was wary of everyone. As she pleaded with them not to let her husband die in her arms, Sakura told them to come. The two are revealed to be White Zetsu Army
imposters
 as they prepare to attack the two medics having slipped past the guard. As Shizune moved to aid Sakura who was being targeted first, the imposters are taken out by Naruto's
shadow clone
 who had just arrived.

Guy
 while the other members of her division tended to the other wounded shinobi in their ranks. She later stood alongside the other members of the Allied Shinobi Forces and prepared to face their opposition as Naruto vowed that the world would not end, with
Obito Uchiha
 vowing otherwise.

When Team 7 reunited following the arrival of Sasuke and the previous Hokage, Shizune watched in amazement as Sakura revealed the
Strength of a Hundred Seal
, stating that such a technique requires tremendous chakra control and that even she was not able to achieve the Strength of a Hundred Seal. She later watched on, beaming with pride alongside
Hashirama
 who commented that Sakura's strength might be greater than Tsunade's. As Sakura summoned
Katsuyu
 and the pair began
healing
 the wounded, noting to herself how skilled Sakura was to be able to use this technique after just forming the seal. When a shinobi within range to her reacted warily to Katsuyu's presence, Shizune simply informed them that the slug was there to help them.

As Shizune was passing by, she saw
Sarada
 where she called her out. Sarada was frightened by Shizune as she was about to climb the house roof so Sarada just started talking randomly in which Shizune asked her if something is wrong. So Sarada excused herself as she has something to do. Shizune took care of her fellow disciple,
Sakura Uchiha
, after Sakura fainted and was sent to Shizune by Sakura's daughter, Sarada. Shizune told Sarada that her mother had fainted many times before. When she later talked to Sarada, who was looking at a photo of her father with team Taka, the girl talked about her doubts on her parentage. Shizune insisted her doubts were false. When Sarada called her on it, saying that she knew there were no records of her birth, Shizune merely kept quiet with a seemingly sad look on her face. She questioned Sarada to why she brought this on, to which Sarada showed her the picture of
Taka
 and particularly
Karin
 and how she wore the same glasses as her.

Later, while discussing with Naruto and Shikamaru preparations for the upcoming Academy graduations, a letter was received from Sasuke, learning of a young boy with the Sharingan attacking the Uchiha. While Naruto decided to go handle things personally while leaving a shadow clone behind, Shizune was concerned on how this would conflict with the graduation exams.
