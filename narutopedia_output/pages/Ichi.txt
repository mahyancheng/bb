Ichi
 (
壱
) was an antagonist that appeared in
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
. He was a shinobi and one of
Hiruko
's three followers, along with
Ni
 and
San
.

Personality

Ichi was very overconfident in his abilities. He would talk down to and mock his opponents during battle. Like his comrades, he would not hesitate in using the
Chimera Technique
 to merge with others, even if it meant distorting his own body.

Appearance

Ichi had light-coloured eyes and brown hair. He was a tall, gaunt man that greatly resembled San, with the exception that he only had a single violet-coloured rectangular mark on his forehead, his bangs on his left side, and that while Ichi wore his cloak on the right side of his shoulder and straps from the left shoulder going down, San wore them the opposite direction. He had
a mark
 on his back that was the same as the one in Hiruko's left palm. It is unclear if he and San were related.

Abilities






Ichi using Spinning Snake Thorn.



Ichi had considerable skill in

Chimera Technique
. Using said snakes, Ichi could use the
Summoning Technique
, augment his arms, form
nets
 and fire
powerful projectiles

Ichi was noted to have larger-than-normal chakra reserves. He was also quite durable, being able to survive Neji and Rock Lee's combined Revolving Heaven and Front Lotus techniques head on.
