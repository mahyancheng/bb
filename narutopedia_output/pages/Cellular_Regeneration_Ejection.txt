As the originator of
Orochimaru's Juinjutsu
 and the possessor of a
unique clan ability
, Jūgo is able to give his flesh to those that are compatible with said cursed seals, thus healing any injuries they may have received. Because he is transferring his cells to the recipient, Jūgo's own body regresses in age, becoming younger in appearance. The effects, however, are temporary and can be reverted using the
counterpart
 for this technique.

Trivia

In the
Fourth Shinobi World War
,
Kabuto Yakushi
 revived
Sasuke Uchiha
 in a similar manner, by connecting his navel snake with Sasuke's torso and apparently using
Hashirama Senju
's cells, along with a
certain someone
's advice.
