A Signature of Fear
" (
恐怖のサイン
,
Kyōfu no Sain
) is episode 172 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Team 5
 visits a hospitalised
Boruto
,
Iwabee
 trying to wake him up with his favourite
Lightning Burger
.
Denki
 heard he exhausted himself trying his
new jutsu
 against
Shojoji
, and
Metal Lee
 heard that
Sarada
 has been getting special training from her
father
. They also wonder about
Mitsuki
, and recall who his parent is. They investigate a scream from another room, and Iwabee is hit with ketchup by another patient. The patient flees, and a nurse apologises for Nattō's attitude. Iwabee finds
Nattō
, who has his snack privileges revoked. Nattō claims he's actually training to be a shinobi, and noticing they're shinobi, tries to have them take his
Orochimaru
 card to be autographed. They refuse at first, but change their mind after the nurse explains his acting out is due to an upcoming surgery he hasn't come to terms with and doesn't want to have. Denki and Metal are apprehensive, given Orochimaru's history, but they agree to go as Iwabee is determined to do it, besides wanting to visit Mitsuki. Team 5 goes through the village records where Denki manages to access Orochimaru's files to discover his location. They meet up with a jōnin keeping surveillance on Orochimaru while
Yamato
 has gone to make his report to
Naruto
. The jōnin allows them to go forward, but his attitude makes them even more nervous. They find
Suigetsu
, who tries to dismiss them when they say they want to see Orochimaru.
 Suigetsu shrugs off their attacks, but they manage to trick him into attacking a damaged power line. The shock isn't enough to paralyse Suigetsu, only annoying him, but Orochimaru interrupts the fight before Suigetsu can hurt anyone. Orochimaru asks what they want, and they managed to say they want an autograph, much to Orochimaru's shock. Orochimaru signs the card, and they ask about Mitsuki. Orochimaru says Mitsuki is undergoing critical treatment, but will be fine. Leaving, Orochimaru is pleased that Mitsuki made friends other than Boruto. Team 5 gives Nattō the autographed card, and admit they were scared to do it. Boruto wakes up and finds
Kakashi
, who warns him that the more he compresses the
Rasengan
, the greater the recoil on his arm, so he shouldn't use it often. Sarada meets Boruto at the
hospital
, and they exchange how their training has gone. Boruto shows her
Anato
's ring, so they decide to return it to
Mia
.
Konohamaru
 and
Mugino
 watch as
Deepa
 arrives at Victor's company.
Victor
 asks about the puppet, but Deepa says he had interference, so he couldn't bring it. Victor mentions an upcoming inspection by the
Land of Valleys
'
daimyō
, and they discuss the final stages of certain experiments. Konohamaru and Mugino want to take advantage of the inspection to interfere.
