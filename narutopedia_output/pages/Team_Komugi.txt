This team was one of the many
genin
 teams that participated in the
Chūnin Exams
 that were held in
Konohagakure
. During the written portion,
Komugi
, afraid of the tenth question, dropped out, which led his teammates,
Gennai
 and
Inaho
, to be disqualified.

In the anime, the three genin participated in the joint Chūnin Exams between Konohagakure and
Sunagakure
. With the help of
Neji Hyūga
, they figured out how to solve the first problem of the written test. They also managed to solve the second problem by turning in a blank paper (which means "not to abandon their comrades"), leading them to pass the first round.

They were eventually amongst the first 30 teams to arrive at the
Demon Desert
, thus allowing them to continue on to the second round.

After the second round was complete, and the third round cancelled prematurely due to controversy,
Tsunade
 failed Komugi, Gennai and Inaho because their performances failed to show their rights to be promoted, much to their dismay as they were the only team from Konoha to fail.
