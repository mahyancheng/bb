Tōu and the other Twelve Guardian Ninja revived.



Hers, Kitane's, Seito's, and Nauma's corpses are stolen by
grave robbers
, and later were revived using lightning. After being revived they were all approached by
Asuma Sarutobi
 who had figured out the scheme of the robbers. There he tries without luck to stop the three who seem to have become mindless puppets. She started walking towards an unknown point emitting large amounts of lightning, only to arrive and prepare her part of the Limelight technique. When Kitane was killed by Asuma,
Kazuma
's plan failed and he decided to release the summoned Nauma, Tōu, and Seito.
