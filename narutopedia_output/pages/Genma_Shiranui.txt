Genma Shiranui
 (
不知火ゲンマ
,
Shiranui Genma
) is a
tokubetsu jōnin
 of
Konohagakure
 and an
elite bodyguard
 to the
Hokage
.

Background






Team Chōza competing in the chūnin exams.



When Genma became a genin, he was put on a
team
 with
Might Guy
 and
Ebisu
, under the leadership of
Chōza Akimichi
.
 During part of their chūnin exams, his team confronted
Team Minato
.
 At one point, they were confronted by a generation of
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
, only to be saved by
Might Duy
.
 Other than that, not much is known about Genma's background except for the fact that he is an elite guard to the Hokage. During his time serving under the
Fourth Hokage
, he was taught the
Flying Thunder Formation Technique
.

Personality

Genma is shown to be very calm, impartial, collected, proud and casual on his actions. He is never seen being boisterous or lost in difficult situations and is confident enough to take charge of large groups of ninja. It was also stated that he hates
Orochimaru
 for power-playing.
 He is also a jovial person, prone to wisecracking at times. When
Shikaku Nara
 contacted him, he made it a point to first tell Genma not to make fun of the situation.

Appearance






Genma's full appearance.



Genma has brown, shoulder-length hair which hangs about his face and brown eyes. He wears his forehead protector like a bandanna, and the standard
jōnin
 outfit and always has his trademark
senbon
 in his mouth. As a
genin
, he wore a dark, baggy outfit with a hooded red and black jacket. He also wore a black choker, a strap around his leg, and a senbon in his mouth.

Abilities

As a well noted veteran shinobi, Genma is known for taking part in difficult missions because of his skills.
 He was able to hold his own against an elite jōnin like
Baki
, as seen when he threw two kunai to stop two of the latter's mid-air. While physically fatigued due to a prior mission, with the assistance of
Raidō Namiashi
, he was able to force the
Sound Four
 into activating the second stage of their
cursed seals
.
 His abilities are further attested by the fact that he was placed in the
Hokage Guard Platoon
.

During the
Fourth Hokage
's reign, he was taught the
Flying Thunder Formation Technique
 in order to teleport to the
Hokage
's side when needed. He performs this technique in collaboration with his fellow guards, Raidō and
Iwashi Tatami
.
 He is also able to spit a senbon from his mouth with enough force to deflect a
kunai
.

Genma as a proctor during the Chūnin Exams.



Genma was called to a meeting along with the other jōnin by the Third Hokage, where he discussed the opening of the Chūnin Exams with them. During the meeting, Genma asked Third if the other land's
daimyōs
 are informed. After
Hayate
's death, Genma proctored the final round matches of the Chūnin Exams. After
Neji
's battle with
Naruto
, Genma tells him that even a caged bird can eventually free themselves.

As the invasion is launched, he inquires on whether or not Orochimaru was leading the assault as he faces off against Baki. After
Gaara
 retreats from the arena, he advises Sasuke to chase after him, telling him that he was already at the
chūnin
 level and to do what he must in order to protect Konoha. His fight is, however, interrupted when the invasion is called off.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Mei and her team confront Black Zetsu.



Genma along with Raidō were tasked with
guarding
 the daimyō at their safe house during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. While on duty, he and Raidō conversed about the daimyō and their medal-naming argument that was going on. He told Raidō not to make fun of them as it was their job and that without medals, they wouldn't know what was honourable and what wasn't. He then told him that if he just stood around thinking of medals, he'd never get one though, and to stay alert as they were going to relocate soon.

After
Black Zetsu
 located the daimyō he was intercepted by
Mei Terumī
. Genma alongside Raidō,
Chōjūrō
 and the rest of her team arrived shortly after. When Naruto's
shadow clone
 arrived on the battlefield, and crashed head first into a tree after Black Zetsu sidestepped him, Genma agreed with Raidō's sentiments that Naruto had not changed much and still rushed into a fight without thinking.

Genma prepares to transport Mei.



While battling Black Zetsu, he marvelled at Chōjūrō's skill with his sword. He was later contacted by
Shikaku
 who before beginning immediately told him not to makes any jokes because they were in dire straits. However, after telling him that the real
Madara Uchiha
 had been
reincarnated
 to the battlefield, Genma claimed that he couldn't help himself this time. As he,
Raidō
 and
Iwashi
 prepared to transport Mei using
Minato
's
Flying Thunder God Technique
 as per Shikaku's orders, he explained to her that he was part of the Hokage
bodyguard
 detail and as such was taught how to use the technique by the Fourth during his rule. As soon as Tsunade — who was marked with the technique's seal — had been transported to the battlefield, they performed the technique and stood behind the other Kage as they confronted Madara.






The Hokage Guard Platoon and Dodai pursue Mū.



As Mei and
A
 engaged Madara in battle, Iwashi prematurely anticipated his defeat, Genma however, noted the extent of damage inflicted upon the surroundings by the enemy and warns his partner to stay focused while Raidō commented that there is no way to just force their way through.
Dodai
 then enlisted their help to go after the
Kabuto
-controlled
Mū
 who had began to emerge from the debris. The four men then give chase to the Tsuchikage but their target is soon slapped away by A during the Raikage's assault on Madara. As the battle between the Kage and Madara waged on, they continued to give chase to the evasive Mū.

With the Impure World Reincarnation released, Genma watched alongside his comrades as Mū was enveloped in a light of sorts before beginning to deconstruct.
