Sōshūga
 (
双襲牙
,
literally meaning:
 Twin Attacking Fangs) is the name of a fighting style employing a pair of
nunchaku
 by
Might Guy
. Guy wields these with great dexterity, utilising all of his limbs at times, making use of them particularly during situations where direct physical contact must be avoided.
 Making use of his own impressive strength, he can even crush large boulders using this technique.

Guy's nunchaku

Each handle of these weapons is intricately carved into the shape of a
Chinese dragon
-like creature, with scales engraved along their length and a head near the handle's base, while appearing to be linked together by a length of twisted cord.

The weapons are first seen in use during the later stages of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 but, during the course of the confrontation with
Tobi
, they were soon
absorbed
 by the former.
 After the war, Guy wields a pair of nunchaku once again.

Trivia

In episode 40 of
Naruto SD: Rock Lee no Seishun Full-Power Ninden
, Guy can be seen holding a nunchaku with a similar looking design to the ones used for Sōshūga, but with a black colouring.
