With the help of a
musical instrument
 and a
fūinjutsu

formula
 on their chest, the user produces a stream of
chakra
 that forms into many purple-coloured chains that are launched from the formula into the target. The chains move very fast, able to bypass
Gaara
's
Shield of Sand
, which is known for its speed. Once latched on to the target's body and
chakra network
, the chains will use the
tenketsu
 located at the navel to reach their way to the
tailed beast
 and constrict their neck, pulling the beast from the inside of the
jinchūriki
. The continued forceful use of the tenketsu for the extraction damages the jinchūriki's chakra network contributing to the targeted jinchūriki's immobilisation and causing them pain. Others who attempt to touch the chains will be struck with a powerful electrical shock. However, if another jinchūriki touches the chains, then their chakra will be drained for the duration of the physical contact.

The technique can be countered. Techniques that suppress
chakra absorption
 such as a
cocoon
 made up of a network of highly refined chakra threads can slow down the rate at which the chakra is drained. The chakra absorption can be stopped completely by
closing
 the particular tenketsu the chains are using to extract the tailed beast.

There is a dangerous drawback to this technique, however. If the chains are removed before properly absorbing all the tailed beast chakra, they will turn on the nearest target with that chakra, with it being the caster, ultimately sealing them. Despite that, the seal can be broken if all tenketsu of the target are blocked, after which they will still be in need for immediate treatment.

Trivia

This technique is most likely named after a Japanese historical figure, known as
Sen no Rikyū
.
