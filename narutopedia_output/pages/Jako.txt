Jako
 (
ジャコ
) is a leader of a gang of thieves.

Personality

Jako was a self-admitting "rotten person". He is a very cruel man, as he told
Sakura Haruno
 that he would kill her, along with
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
, as soon as he got his treasure back.

Appearance

Jako has black eyes, brown, spiky hair which he ties into a short ponytail, and a small goatee. He wears a blue coat with yellow lining over a white top and dark-coloured pants underneath. He also wears a light blue scarf around his neck.

Abilities






Jako using his "liquidised" chakra.



Jako's main ability is that he can shoot
"liquidised" chakra
 from built-in cannons in his wrist to attack his enemies, or to defend himself. This liquid can be shot at high pressure to cause injury, or can harden around the targets to immobilise them. He could also manoeuvre while in mid-air, using his chakra as a sort of rope. With the hardening ability, the liquid chakra can also become solid after taking the shapes of swords and be used as melee weapons.

Part II

Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha

He, along with his group of bandits, were travelling with treasure stolen from the
daimyō
's sister. However, as they're travelling, one of the bandits almost accidentally drop the treasure, and Naruto snatched the treasure. Instead of trying to get the treasure back from Naruto and Sasuke, he and his gang kidnapped Sakura. The treasure was later recovered by Naruto and Sasuke, who later defeated him and his team.
