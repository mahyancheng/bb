Synopsis

Team 7
 look for
Kawaki
, and
Mitsuki
 suggests he might have escaped to outside.
Sumire
 notices the blood trail. Facility personnel are given a description of Kawaki. At Mitsuki's suggestion, Team 7 goes to look for Kawaki at the
Thunder Rail
 station. Weakened from blood loss, Kawaki wants to eat so his arm can regenerate faster. He considers stealing from food stalls, but decides against so as not to draw attention from security personnel after him. He grabs a loaf of bread that falls from a delivery stall, and subdues a stray dog that attacks him for the bread. Kawaki notices the dog is injured, bandages the wound, and lets the dog have the bread. Sumire and
Nue
 follow the blood trail, and Sumire thinks back to his words.
 The stray dog keeps following Kawaki despite his antagonism. Unable to find Kawaki at the station, Team 7 decides to go get intel from Sumire.
Naruto
 and
Sai
 discuss the concerns about having Kawaki in the
village
. The stray dog steals meat from a butcher. Sumire sees the dog, and recognises the bandage as being from this hospital gown Kawaki is wearing. The butcher pushes Sumire aside pursuing the dog. The dog brings Kawaki the food, but the butcher wounds him. Sumire finds Kawaki by following the butcher, whom Kawaki intimidates over mistreating the dog. He also threatens Sumire, who helps treat the dog instead, and apologises for Nue hurting him. She compares his attitude towards the dog with his own self-image. She shares her past with Kawaki. He gets agitated by the sight of an injection, and attacks Sumire. Team 7 and the facility personnel find them. The personnel attack him, but Kawaki flees.
Boruto
 tends to Sumire while
Sarada
 and Mitsuki chase Kawaki. Naruto and Sai arrive at Ryūtan, and notice the commotion of the fight. Boruto informs him of Kawaki's escape, and Sumire argues on Kawaki's behalf, noticing the similarities between them. The facility personnel attack Kawaki, who absorbs their attack with his
Kāma
, and unleashes a blast of his own. He changes his aim to avoid hitting a child, and Naruto blocks his blast. Naruto tries talking Kawaki down, and says he'll look after him. Kawaki passes out.
