The Forest of Bewilderment.



The
Forest of Bewilderment
 is a location within the
Land of Forests
. It is said that when someone gets lost in the forest, they may never find their way out due to the fog, sweeping winds, and extreme magnetic fields that make a person lose their sense of direction. Due to these conditions, the
Shinobazu
 used the forest to their advantage to serve as a hideout.
Gantetsu
 used the forest to hide the orphans he saved from the Shinobazu's attacks. Venomous snakes are also known to live in the forest.

During the
Gantetsu Escort Mission
,
Naruto
 and
Todoroki
, who were escorting Gantetsu, get lost in the forest after escaping from the Shinobazu. Gantetsu offers to lead them out of the forest. Eventually, the Shinobazu are defeated and Gantetsu peacefully lives in the forest with the orphans.
