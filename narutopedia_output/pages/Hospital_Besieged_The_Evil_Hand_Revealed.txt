Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Baki
 knocks aggressively on the door of
Kankurō
 and
Temari
’s room, lecturing them about not watching over their brother
Gaara
. They go to Gaara's room and are surprised to find him missing. Naruto wakes up and learns that he has been asleep for three days, and the Chūnin Exams finals are the next day.
Shikamaru
 gives Naruto a fruit basket originally intended for
Chōji
, who has been hospitalised for indigestion, having eaten too much.
Sakura
 goes to
Lee
's room and replaces the flower. As Chōji complains of his hunger,
Ino
 walks in with a fruit basket for him.

Gaara enters Lee's room and attempts to kill him while he is unconscious, but Naruto and Shikamaru immediately stop him. Incapacitated by Shikamaru's
Shadow Imitation Technique
, Gaara divulges a little bit about his past, revealing he has a sand demon named
Shukaku
 sealed within him from birth, and was created solely as a weapon for his village. Though he became too unpredictable, and his father sent assassins after him regularly, to put an end to the threat. He failed at the very purpose he was given life, and can now only hurt others.  Naruto sympathises, as he also has a
demon
 within him. He attempts to kill the two of them, but
Guy
 steps in and demands Gaara to leave at once. Gaara has no choice but to do so, but before doing it, he promises that he'll kill them all.
