Anko and her team investigate the corpses.



While following a trail of corpses left by Kabuto, Tokuma wonders if it was a deliberate action on Kabuto's part as well as his intentions. As the trail seemingly stops outside a desolated area, at Anko's request he scouts ahead with his Byakugan. With shock he alerts the team that he observed Kabuto and
a masked man
 from Akatsuki conversing with each other, before the pair walked towards what seemed to be an underground passageway.

Omoi frees Tokuma and Ranka.



He and his team were later seen scouting out the remainder of the
Mountains' Graveyard
, where he discovered the
Zetsu
 army concealed deep underground, right before the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 began. After seeing they were now on the move, Anko ordered them to report back to base immediately in order to inform the rest of their army, while she remains behind and attempts to infiltrate the hideout.

Tokuma, while reluctantly fleeing, identifies an approaching enemy
team
 closing in, provoking him to tell his teammates to continue their retreat while he holds them off. Tokuma is captured by the Akatsuki team and is
forced
 by
Sasori
 to fight his allies. He was however, later freed by
Omoi
 who
cuts
 Sasori's chakra threads and then carried to
Kiri
 to be healed.

Trivia

Tokuma's name could mean something akin to 'period of benevolence' (
徳間
).

In his anime début, his outfit and forehead protector cloth were black. However, when he is seen again, they are blue.
