This technique is a
Space–Time Ninjutsu
 used by the
Ōtsutsuki clan
. The user creates a rift, which allows anyone enveloped to transfer to a chosen location including foreign dimensions. The rift's formation is fast enough to catch targets off guard and transport them alongside the user, as well as to evade attacks from enemies at the last moment.

An Ōtsutsuki can synchronise the technique to a recipient of their
Kāma
, allowing the member to transport themselves to the host's location through the mark.
 Two Kāma recipients can collaboratively manifest the rift from their marks to bypass
fūinjutsu
.
 Even if the target recipient does not possess Kāma, if the user can track down the chakra of the target, it is possible for them to create the rift to drag said target to their location, as Isshiki teleported Kawaki via Naruto's chakra, which was being used to powerup the latter's artificial arm.

Trivia

While being controlled by
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
,
Jigen
's body could perform this technique.

In the anime, each rift is shown to have a variation in colour. Jigen and Kawaki's are red, while Boruto's is blue.

After Amado restored his Kāma, Kawaki has created a rift without activating the Kāma, instead seemingly using it through the
Kokugan
.

A White Kāma user cannot use this technique.

In
Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker
, this technique, called "
Time Space Hop
" (
時空間移動
,
Jikūmaidō
), is equated with
a similar space-time ninjutsu
, which, however, requires the Rinnegan and therefore cannot be the same.
