The
Analysis Team
 (
解析班
,
Kaisekihan
) is a team from the
Konohagakure Intelligence Division
 who work closely with the
Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force
 to extract information from their detainees. This division was headed by
Inoichi Yamanaka
.

This team specialises in extraction of information directly from an unwilling target's mind if they're, for example, unwilling to divulge information or else unable because they've either been rendered unconscious, or if barricades such as the
Genjutsu Protect
 technique have been used to seal away information.
