The Garden of Ryūmyaku.



The
Garden of Ryūmyaku
 is the place where
Naruto Uzumaki
 appeared twenty years ago after he went back in time due to Mukade's
time travel technique
. While looking around the garden, he stumbled into the Queen of
Rōran
,
Sāra
, though she ran from him in fear. In the garden, the power of
Ryūmyaku
 has no effect. Sāra takes the people of Rōran there to protect them from
Mukade
's attacks. This was also the place where they held
Sēramu
's funeral.
