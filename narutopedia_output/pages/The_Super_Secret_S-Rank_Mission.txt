turtle
 that is currently swimming. However, due to the fact that Naruto would rush into the battlefield carelessly if he knew that the

S-rank
 mission is to recruit all of the island animals in order to form an animal combat unit for the war.

At the
Mountains' Graveyard
 hideout,
Kabuto
 offers to go to the island to capture the
Eight
 and
Nine-Tails
, citing that he would like to acquire
Yamato
 as well, since the latter contains the cells of
Hashirama Senju
. Kabuto asks to experiment on
Zetsu
 as well, claiming that
Black Zetsu
 can go without
White Zetsu
 for a while and that it wouldn't delay
Tobi
's plan to resurrect the
Ten-Tails
, shocking Zetsu and Tobi, since the knowledge of Zetsu and the Ten-Tails were kept hidden. Kabuto smirks as he responds that
Orochimaru
 had done his research, and Tobi agrees to allow Kabuto to venture forth on his quest, promising him Zetsu if he can capture the two
jinchūriki
. Before Kabuto departs, Tobi shows him the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, as well as
Hashirama's Artificial Body

his
 fight with the
Hokage
 at the
Valley of the End

White Zetsu Army
 underneath the lake, hidden amongst the roots of a gigantic, flowering tree.

Content with being disclosed with classified information, Kabuto sets off to the island with a
resurrected

Deidara
, who
creates
 a
clay bird
. Kabuto tells Deidara that he has tweaked the reanimation technique and thus Deidara would be able to use nearly his full power, unlike when Orochimaru would use the technique. Deidara displays his gratitude towards Kabuto for bringing him back to life as well as Kabuto's assertion that he respects Deidara despite not comprehending his explosive art. As the two fly towards the island, Kabuto is attacked by Ōnoki, the Third Tsuchikage. However, Kabuto is revealed to be a
Clay Clone
, with Ōnoki's fist being stuck inside of him. The real Deidara and Kabuto are flying near the clones, and Deidara sends his clay self as well as the clay bird towards his former leader and detonates it, seemingly killing the
Tsuchikage
.
