 manga.

Summary

Soon after entering the
Forest of Death
,
Naruto
 breaks away from the rest of
Team 7
 to go to the bathroom. When he returns he is immediately attacked by
Sasuke
.
Sakura
 is shocked, but Sasuke explains that this Naruto is missing the scratch on the cheek he received from
Anko
 and must be an impostor. The
ninja
 removes his disguise and tries to take their scroll by force, but he is injured by Sasuke and forced to retreat. Once finding the real Naruto, Sasuke decides that they should have a password only they will know in case they are separated again. Sasuke's suggested password is very long, leaving Naruto to request something simpler. Before they can modify the code, the three are attacked by
another ninja
 and separated. Sasuke finds Sakura, who confirms her identity by reciting the password. Naruto locates them soon afterwards and also repeats the password without error. Sasuke once again attacks him, pointing out that the real Naruto would never have remembered such a complex password.
