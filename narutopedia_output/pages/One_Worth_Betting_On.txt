Kakeru ni Ataisuru Mono
) is episode 287 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Tsunade
 listens on to the events of what happened to
A
,
Karai
, and
Nigai
, who had stolen a scroll with ninjutsu from the
Sugi Village
, she realises the nature of the insect and that it was also inside of A. After explaining this and having A make a promise to her, Tsunade catches and destroys a bug which had been hovering near A for some time — unbeknownst to them that the
Nokizaru Group
 had been using it as a method to spy on them. Preparing to operate, Tsunade has her pupil
Shizune
 lead the surgery while she oversaw it. Though A initially protested, believing that Tsunade should perform the surgery, the
Sannin
 allays her fears somewhat. As Shizune, aided by
Amai
 begins the surgery, blood is splattered on Tsunade. Still
haemophobic
, a terrified Tsunade excuses herself from the room. Seeking an explanation, Shizune tells the two of Tsunade's
two

great loves
 and loss which led up to her current state. Hearing this the Raikage states that he would not have placed the lives of his subordinates in the hands of someone in that mental state, an indignant Shizune speaks out against his chastisement of her master, throwing the extracted exploding bug at his feet. Meanwhile in present time,
Naruto
 and
B
 continue to the battlefield while A and Tsunade continue the journey back to headquarters.

Trivia

While talking about
Nawaki
, Shizune mistakenly states that he died in the
Third Shinobi World War
, while it in fact happened during the
Second Shinobi World War
.
