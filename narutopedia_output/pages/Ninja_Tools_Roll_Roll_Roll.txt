Ninja Tools Roll Roll Roll.



Ninja Tools Roll Roll Roll
 (
忍具転転転
,
Ningu Tententen
) is a weapons shop in
Konohagakure
 run by
Tenten
. The shop is intended to display and, ideally, sell weapons from Tenten's extensive collection, notably three of the
Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths
. Because of the peace created after the end of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, the shop gets very few customers.
 In
Naruto Shinden: Parent and Child Day
, Tenten suggests that business wouldn't be so bad if she could at least sell to the
Konoha Military Police Force
 or the
Ninja Academy
, but both already have weapon suppliers. As it is, Tenten can only hope that one of the store's occasional visitors will take pity on her and buy something and/or fall prey to her very persuasive sales pitches.

Trivia

When the store's inventory of iron weapons becomes too large, the locals complain about disturbances in the
magnetic field
 around the store.
