 (
大蛇丸探索チーム

Orochimaru
's bases. Originally composed of
Kakashi Hatake
 and the members of
Team 8
, it is reinforced twice: first, the remaining members of
Team 7
 are sent to help with
Team Guren
, and then several miscellaneous
Konoha
 personnel are sent to help seal the

Sub-teams

Because of how much larger the team grows and how many tasks it has to worry about, the members are split into three smaller teams, each with their own objectives.

chakra
