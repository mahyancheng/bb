With this technique a translucent
string
, both elastic and highly durable, is attached to a shuriken, making it possible to alter its path after having thrown it. An expert will have the ability to freely glide the shuriken in any direction with just a single movement of their fingertip. The first attack, challenging the enemy, is avoided and after a time-lag of several seconds, it will come from behind. Depending on the performance, the possible tactics can be infinite. In the anime, this has also been applied to various other weapons, as
Tenten

manipulated a myriad of pojectiles
 simultaneously.
