After Shino releases a swarm of
kidaichū
, Kiba transforms into the
three-headed wolf
 and
rapidly spins
 towards the enemy along with Shino's bugs. Hinata then jumps into the spinning vortex and uses her
Byakugan
 to lodge the bugs onto the opponent's tenketsu. As the opponent is thrown back, Shino's kidaichū grow rapidly, eating them from the inside out.
