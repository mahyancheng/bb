Kinetsu
 (
Kinetsu
) is the boss of a certain organisation that has requested a mission from
Konohagakure
.

Personality

He apparently doesn't care much about his own dignity, as he never once corrected
Naruto Uzumaki
 for calling him
Kitsune
 instead of Kinetsu. However, he cares about his organisation as he hired
shinobi
 to deal with the bandits. Naruto mentions that he was quite cocky.

Blank Period

At the time when
Kakashi Hatake
 had just taken over as
Hokage
, Kinetsu's organisation began to be attacked by bandits. He requested help from Konohagakure, Naruto,
Sakura
,
Kiba
 and
Shino
 being assigned the mission. While discussing the mission directly with the customer, Naruto constantly called him by a different name, but Kinetsu never corrected him, and Naruto only learned of his mistake when Sakura told him.
