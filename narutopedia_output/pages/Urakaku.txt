Urakaku
 (
ウラカク
) is a
samurai
 from the
Land of Iron
 and one of
Mifune
's right-hand-men alongside
Okisuke
.

Personality

Urakaku can be described as a very solemn and dutiful individual as see from him carrying out his assigned tasks to the letter without hesitation.

Appearance

He has black hair which he wears in a traditional
chonmage
 style, thick, black eyebrows and similarly coloured eyes. He also has a prominent scar located just above his right eyebrow.

His attire during the
Kage Summit
 consisted of a simple grey
kimono
-like outfit, with a purple scarf encircling his neck that obscures the lower half of his face and conceals a communicator.

Abilities

Since Urakaku is a
samurai
, it can be assumed that he is skilled in
kenjutsu
. He has great reflexes, seen when he already reached the grip of his sword before Zetsu even finished emerging out of the ground, while the present shinobi did not react at all.

Part II

Five Kage Summit

When the
Fourth Raikage
 requested that the
Kage

convene
, the
Land of Iron
 is selected as the site of the Summit, with
Mifune
 chosen to act as the meeting's mediator. Assigned to the general's personal protection detail, Urakaku, alongside
Okisuke
, watched over Mifune as he greeted the
Kazekage
 and his delegation upon their arrival.

As the assembly commenced their discussions, Urakaku assumed his position to the rear of his leader, where he remained for the entirety of the meeting despite the Raikage's various violent outbursts. However, when the meeting was abruptly concluded due to
White Zetsu
's intrusion, Urakaku is ordered to inform the other
samurai
 to locate the invading
Sasuke Uchiha
 and make preparations for battle. In response to this instruction, he immediately established contact with one of the senior officers, directing them to mobilise three platoons to the intruder's suspected location.
 Attempting to ascertain if
Danzō Shimura
's
ability
 was still in effect, Urakaku requests
Ao
 to provide confirmation on the matter, who affirmed that it was no longer being used.
 It is from this position that he observed Sasuke's succeeding confrontation with the Kage, before becoming ensnared by one of Zetsu's clones, when the
Black Zetsu
 activated his
Spore Technique
. Freed from the technique through
Kankurō
's intervention, Urakaku listened to
Tobi
's
scheme
, and upon the
Allied Shinobi Forces
' formation, he departed.

Creation and Conception

Kishimoto
 noted that he wanted to make Urakaku the typical, straight-laced character who would give the first impression of having a serious air of gravity. He also noted that there was no seeing his mouth, because it was always concealed.

Trivia

Both Urakaku and his partner Okisuke have a scar on the right side of their face.
