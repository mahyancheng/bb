Setsuna Uchiha
 (

,
Uchiha Setsuna
) was a member of the
Uchiha clan
 during the reign of the
Second Hokage
. He was also a member of the
Konoha Military Police Force
.

Background

Setsuna was a shinobi who had doubts about the Second Hokage. He planned to reclaim power from the
Senju clan
.

Appearance

He had spiky, dark hair and dark eyes. He wore the typical Uchiha outfit consisting of a black, high-collared shirt and a pair of pants. He also wore a face guard that only covered the right side of his forehead and the right side of his face and a brown sash over his shoulder which held his rather large sword strapped to his back.

Abilities

Being part of the Konoha Military Police Force, he was a fairly skilled shinobi and was probably skilled in
kenjutsu
 due to the sword he wielded. He also managed to awaken his clan's
kekkei genkai
, the
Sharingan
, which granted him many benefits like the ability to see the
chakra
 flow or copying techniques he witnessed.

Trivia

Setsuna can mean "moment" or "instant" (
刹那
), or "painful", "trying" or "oppressive" (
切ない
