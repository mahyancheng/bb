Demonic Illusion: Cajolery of Glamour
 is a speech-induced
genjutsu
 of
Gengo
's creation. It allows the user to put their opponent under an illusion using only words and speech. By infusing
chakra
 into the tongue of the user, any target within auditory range of the user will become easily swayed in a post-hypnotic trance of their will and self-assurance; forcing them to face their innermost trauma as realised by the user's words in an effort to mentally break their spirit. Once told to look behind their back the genjutsu becomes complete, causing them to
awaken
 (
覚醒
,
Kakusei
) as an obedient follower of the user.

The illusion itself cannot be easily broken, even when the person is under realisation that the genjutsu is in effect, but strong emotional connections, like love, can help in dispelling it. Hearing also plays a major factor for the illusion to take effect; as hearing loss makes the target immune to the genjutsu entirely. Likewise, echoes and acoustics that enhance the user's voice can make the genjutsu more effective to sway the target.
