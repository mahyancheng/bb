Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 556

"
Gaara vs. the Mizukage!!
" (
我愛羅VS水影!!
,
Gaara Bāsasu Mizukage!!
)

The
Second Mizukage
 comments on how he wasn't defeated despite divulging his weaknesses.
Gaara
 pants and notices how the Mizukage's
oily water
 seeps into his sand and makes it unusable. The Mizukage angrily resents Gaara for trying to defeat
Mū
 first. Gaara acknowledges the Mizukage's strength. Gaara
detects
 the
Giant Clam
's location,
showing

Ōnoki
 where to shoot his
Dust Release
, but since he has used up too much chakra against Mū, he can't use it. Instead, he decides to
punch
 it. The punch closes the Giant Clam but doesn't dispel the
genjutsu
. The Mizukage says that if the Tsuchikage that if he doesn't put more strength into it, straining his back, his attack won't do a thing to the clam, noticing him to have stopped using Dust Release due to his chakra use. Ōnoki
increases the weight
 of his fist on the Giant Clam and smashes it, throwing his back in the process. The genjutsu is broken. The Mizukage
strikes
 the Tsuchikage, but it turns out to be a
decoy
 placed by Gaara. Gaara immobilises the Mizukage with
great amounts of sand
 so the oily water can't seep through it all. The
Sealing Team
 starts to work, but the sand
explodes
 before they can finish, the Mizukage's visage appearing in the steam. Ōnoki tells Gaara this isn't genjutsu, but the ninjutsu not even Mū knew how to counter.

Chapter 557

"
Steaming Danger Tyranny!!
" (
蒸危暴威!!
,
Jōki Bōi!!
)

The
Allied shinobi
 look up to the steam in the sky and it begins to hail.
Ōnoki
 notes that the steam is being cooled down at the high altitudes and becoming hail. The steam condenses itself into the shape of a boy. The Tsuchikage explains the Mizukage's technique. The clone begins attacking, and it's able to dodge
Gaara
's sand. Ōnoki tells Gaara to ignore the clone and go after the
Mizukage
, who should be weak due to the technique. A sensor shinobi detects the Mizukage. The clone moves very fast, attacking all in its path. Back-up shinobi arrive. Ōnoki's back still isn't good. Gaara begins trapping the Mizukage in sand again, but the
Sealing Team
 is interrupted by the clone, which rips the
sealing tags
. The Mizukage's head emerges from the sand, telling Gaara that as long as he has oil, his sand won't be of use. The Mizukage presses on them to defeat them, and Ōnoki suggests he keeps giving them advice. The Mizukage refuses on the grounds that if they can't defeat him by their own skill, they have no chance against those who summoned him, and confesses himself disappointed with Gaara. His clone explodes again.
Naruto
,
Temari
 and other shinobi pick up their pace towards the location. The Allied shinobi are protected by Gaara's
shield of sand
. Gaara attacks the clone, which dodges his sand again. The clone strikes Gaara, who is revealed to be a
sand clone
. Gaara reveals himself from the ground and is able to capture the clone with his sand, much to the Mizukage's surprise. The clone explodes again, but the sand merely falls apart, revealing a gold shell. Gaara explains that he hid some of his father's
Gold Dust
 in the sand clone, putting it in the Mizukage's clone, slowing it down and dissipating the heat, melting the gold and making the shell. The Mizukage is impressed by Gaara's strategy and with Gaara.

Chapter 558

"
Kabuto's Trump Card…!!
" (
カブトの切り札…!!
,
Kabuto no Kirifuda…!!
)

Kabuto
 ponders that it was fortunate that
Mū
's
half
 was sealed before it could alert the Allied shinobi, and notes the reincarnated shinobi will need time to regenerate. Mū is disappointed that
Ōnoki
 failed to noticed his splitting, despite being his pupil, and praises the
fūinjutsu
 restraining his other half. Kabuto figures that since Mū's power was also split, it'll take him longer to perform a certain summon.
Naruto
 arrives at
Gaara
's location, informing him of the
Third Raikage
's sealing, while Gaara replies he's almost finished with the
Second Mizukage
, who despite viewing Naruto as being awkward and less composed than Gaara, sees that they form a good team. As he's sealed, the Mizukage is pleased with how much fun he had. Gaara orders that the HQ be updated on their situation.
Temari
 tell those injured to go for the medical team, including the Tsuchikage. Gaara confirms that the Naruto with them is a clone, and asks where the original is.
Killer B
 catches up with the original Naruto, telling him he was contacted by one of his clones. Naruto says that his clones should be reaching the battlefields. At the coast, the Allied shinobi devised a strategy so they don't fight each other trying to find
impostors
, but are left vulnerable to new attacks. A Naruto
shadow clone
 arrives, much to their relief. A
restrained

Dan
, intrigued by Naruto's resemblance to
Nawaki
, asks who he is. He's told of Naruto's status as the Nine-Tails'
jinchūriki
, his dreams of becoming
Hokage
 and
Tsunade
's faith in him by
Chōza
 and
Shikamaru
. At the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
 compound, two disguised White Zetsu almost strike
Sakura
, but are defeated by a Naruto clone. At another battlefield, another Naruto shadow clone identifies disguised White Zetsu, and saves
Hinata
 from three of them.
Neji
 and
Kiba
 notice how different Naruto is. Mū begins performing a
summon
.

Chapter 559

"
Reinforcements Arrive…!!
" (
増援到着…!!
,
Zōen Tōchaku…!!
)

Mū
 finishes summoning Kabuto's trump card, whose power makes the coffins lid burst open. The figure gets out of the coffin, figuring
Nagato
 grew. Mū is impressed that someone would bring this person back with Impure World Reincarnation. The summon is confused, thinking it had been brought back with
Outer Path: Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
.
Naruto
 finishes off the White Zetsu attacking
Hinata
.
Neji
 and
Kiba
 notice how Naruto is different, and wonder if it's really him. Hinata is convinced it's Naruto, and has her confidence shaken by the fact the one she wishes to protect ends up protecting her instead. Naruto reassures her that she's strong, and begins fighting the White Zetsu.
Kakashi

cuts
 through
Fuguki Suikazan
, creating an opening for
Sai
 to
seal him
.
Guy
 says there are three more reincarnated shinobi to be sealed.
Lee
 says he'll cover for Sai. Many White Zetsu arrive at the
Third Division
's location, but so does one of Naruto's clones. Naruto decides to go for quality instead of quantity. Another clone reaches
Mifune
's division, preparing to fight
Kimimaro
 and
Chiyo
, who notice his growth. A clone reaches Mei's group and begins fighting Black Zetsu.
Inoichi
 receives reports from all divisions, that Naruto is identifying and defeating all White Zetsu.
Shikaku
 thinks they should focus their efforts on finding and capturing Madara.
Ao
 detects a presence near
Gaara
's division. A local sensor detects Mū's split double,
Ōnoki
 is impressed he managed to do that just before being sealed. Mū is joined by a reincarnated
Madara Uchiha
, causing all to wonder who is the man behind the mask, leading the opposing side in the war.

Chapter 560

"
Madara Uchiha
" (
うちはマダラ
,
Uchiha Madara
)

Madara
 questions
Mū
 about the user of the technique which brought them back to life.
Kabuto
 takes full control of Mū to talk directly with Madara, explaining he brought him back in a special manner that makes him stronger than his prime.
Gaara
 attacks Madara but he dodges his sand and moves to counter-attack using a
widespread Fire Release
, which is countered by many Alliance shinobi using a water wall. Moving in to general melee he wreaks havoc on the Alliance forces until
Ōnoki
 raises the ground below him to capture him against
Naruto
's Rasengan. Madara defends himself with
Susanoo
. As Naruto prepares to go into Sage Mode, Ōnoki lightens Gaara's sand allowing him to pull Madara out of his Susanoo just in time to be hit by Naruto's
Rasenshuriken
. Madara activates the
Rinnegan
 and absorbs the Rasenshuriken, and Kabuto rejoices that his suspicions about the evolutionary chain of the Sharingan were correct. Madara replies that this power is not of Kabuto's creation, and using his Susanoo to weave hand-seals, draws a
meteorite
 towards the battlefield.

Chapter 561

"
The Power of That Name
" (
その名の力
,
Sono Na no Chikara
)

As the giant meteorite descends,
Ōnoki
 tells the Allied Shinobi not to give up before even trying. He flies towards the meteorite intending to
lighten
 it.
Gaara
 orders everyone to retreat, as he stays behind to help Ōnoki.
Kabuto
 speaking through
Mū
, surmises that Madara intends to destroy everything with the meteor, and Madara states that he is correct as they will simply regenerate. Ōnoki successfully lightens the meteorite, as Gaara catches it with his sand. Madara asks what they will do about the second one, as it collides it with the first. At the
Allied HQ
,
A
,
Tsunade
 and
Shikaku
 discuss why the
masked man
 would falsely claim that he is Madara. Tsunade says he used the name because the world would always fear the name. It got the world's attention and that it was enough to drag them into war. The shock from the second meteorite's impact reaches HQ. They receive intel about what happened, and they determine that it must be Madara's attack. Tsunade states that she will be heading to the front. Back at the battlefield there are barely any survivors left.
Dodai
 protected Naruto's clone due to him being a valuable asset. Ōnoki was severely injured by the attack. Madara and Mū regenerate, and speak about Madara's plans. They notice survivors and Madara attempts to summon the
Nine-Tails
, but fails due to it being sealed. Kabuto points out that the
jinchūriki
 is Naruto Uzumaki. Madara uses Hashirama's
Wood Release Secret Technique: Nativity of a World of Trees
 to attack the remaining Allied Forces. The Nine-Tails gives Naruto some of its chakra without any of its will, preferring to help Naruto over being controlled by Madara again. Naruto rushes towards the approaching forest and creates many shadow clones. The clones create multiple
Big Ball Rasengan
 and destroy the advancing forest. Naruto says that he used up all of the Nine-Tails chakra and that he feels like he could disappear at any moment. Ōnoki tells Naruto to rest while they finish the battle. He proclaims that it's finally time to pick himself off the ground and that there's no opponent more worthy than Madara Uchiha.

Chapter 562

"
The Place Where We Pick Ourselves Up
" (
己を拾う場所
,
Onore o Hirou Basho
)

Ōnoki
 decides to tackle both
Madara
 and
Mū
 with the assistance of the remaining
Fourth Division
.
Tsunade
 and
A
 decide to head to Madara's location through
Mabui
's
Heavenly Transfer Technique
, a technique that only transports objects as transporting a living being will surely rip them apart. However, Tsunade decides to take the gamble using her
Yin Seal: Release
.
Shikaku

telepathically
 communicates to
Genma
 to have him,
Raidō
 and another
Konoha
 shinobi to perform the
Flying Thunder God Technique
 to transport
Mei
 to Madara's location as well after
Chōjūrō
 defeats
Black Zetsu
 with a single slash. The other three
Kage
 arrive at the battlefield and prepare to fight both Madara and Mū.

Chapter 563

"
The Five Kage Gathered…!!
" (
五影集結…!!
,
Gokage Shūketsu…!!
)

As
Tsunade
 heals
Gaara
 and
Ōnoki
,
A
 and
Mei
 engage
Madara
.
Dodai
, along with the
Hokage Guard Platoon
 chase after the
Kabuto
-controlled
Mū
. Madara attacks them with
Yasaka Magatama
 but the attack fails because of Gaara's
Shield of Sand
 and Ōnoki's
rock golem
 protects them. Ōnoki joins the Kage and develops a new strategy. Employing Mei's
Hiding in Mist Technique
 to obscure Madara's field of vision, he first
lightens
 A, increasing his speed. Seeing this, Kabuto positions Mū in front of Madara but he is knocked away easily. Ōnoki then
enhances
 A's attack, breaking into Madara's Susanoo and sending him flying away. Naruto insists on helping fight Madara but Tsunade tells him to leave Madara to them while he fights the
other Madara
. As the clone disperses they leave one word with him "win". Elsewhere, the real Naruto and
B
 encounter Tobi and Naruto headbutts him head-on.

Chapter 564

"
The Man Who isn't Anyone
" (
誰でもない男
,
Dare demo Nai Otoko
)

Naruto
 clashes with
Tobi
, who is unfazed by Naruto's headbutt. Tobi states that with the
power
 of the
Nine-Tails
, he'd expected more from him. Tobi's
Six Paths of Pain

jinchūriki
 begin battling Naruto and
Killer B
 with their unique and powerful moves. Naruto states Tobi's changes and how he is going to stop both him and the other
Madara
. Upon hearing the real Madara's reincarnation, Tobi curses Kabuto. Tobi says he can be called Tobi or Madara but he could care less any more since the war has started. Naruto asks who he really is but Tobi claims he is just no one, and only cares about accomplishing his
Eye of the Moon Plan
. Tobi states that the world is worthless and there is nothing but misery and says Naruto and B would understand, due to their childhood. However, Naruto admits his life with a
tailed beast
 inside him wasn't bad. Naruto says all the things that the "no one" has said are nothing more than lies. The two jinchūriki become dedicated in unmasking him but Tobi says they will have to fight for it first. The
deceased
 jinchūriki grow a tail of their former tailed beasts and Tobi declares he will capture Naruto and B and fulfil his plan.

Chapter 565

"
Jinchūriki vs. Jinchūriki!!
" (
人柱力VS人柱力!!
,
Jinchūriki Bāsasu Jinchūriki!!
)

Naruto
 states they won't hand over the
Eight-Tails
 and the
Nine-Tails
.
B
 questions if the jinchūriki had their tailed beasts removed, and the Eight-Tails concludes that they must have been resealed, as it can sense them in their hosts, though different. B begins attacking despite Naruto's call to wait. B attacks
Fū
 with
Samehada
, but she dodges it by flying. B launches swords coated in lightning chakra from her blindspot, but she dodges it. The other jinchūriki watch the two. B wonders how she could dodge from a blindspot, so Naruto tells him about the
Rinnegan
's shared field of vision.
Rōshi

coats himself in lava
 and attacks Naruto, who narrowly evades it, the heat burning his cheek.
Yugito
 launches her
guided attack
, and clashes with B, cutting his scarf. B and Naruto take cover, and B is surprised by her speed, and the Eight-Tails points out that the
Sharingan
 allows them to react faster, while the Rinnegan coordinate attacks. Naruto tells B and the Eight-Tails about the Paths of Pain and the
black receivers
. B points one in Yugito's chest, from a hit he landed earlier. Naruto goes in the open and tries destroying a receiver in Rōshi while being attacked, but is stopped by
Han
. The Eight-Tails says that the forest will hinder their field of vision, so B transforms into the Eight-Tails to level the forest.
