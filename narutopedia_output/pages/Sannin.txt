The
Sannin
 (
伝説の三忍
,
Densetsu no Sannin
,
literally meaning:
 Legendary Three Ninja) were three renowned
ninja
 from
Konohagakure
, hailed as the greatest of their time.

History






Hiruzen and the young Sannin.



As
genin
, the three were teamed together under the leadership of
Hiruzen Sarutobi
, the Third
Hokage
.
 For one of their earlier training exercises, Hiruzen gave them a
bell test
: Jiraiya failed to get a bell - he repeatedly fell for Hiruzen's traps - and was tied to a stump as punishment.
 During their time as Hiruzen's students, they all learned to use the
Summoning Technique
,
[

 which they perform with their left hands.
 Despite being a team and having accomplished great things together, the three members were always in constant disagreement with one another, which Tsunade referred to as a "three-way deadlock".
 Once they became skilled ninja able to look after themselves, Hiruzen's team disbanded.






Hanzō names the "Sannin".



Despite the official dissolution of their team, the three continued to work together during the
Second Shinobi World War
. During one battle with
Amegakure
's
Hanzō
, they were the only Konoha ninja to survive Hanzō's attacks. As a reward for this, Hanzō dubbed them "Konoha's Legendary Sannin".
 However, that same battle was the last one the three fought together: Jiraiya afterwards decided to remain in Ame, to
repent
 for his part in the war;
 the horrors of the war badly affected Tsunade as well, prompting her to abandon the life of a ninja;
 Tsunade had left Konoha by the time of Jiraiya's return to Konoha,
 and Orochimaru would eventually leave the village as well, a consequence of his criminal activities;
 Jiraiya tried and failed to convince Orochimaru to return,
 and subsequently dedicated himself to monitoring Orochimaru's activities, a task that took him away from Konoha for long periods of time.

Because of their skills, each of the Sannin have been considered for the position of Hokage at one time or another:

When Hiruzen decided to retire, Orochimaru applied to replace him as Fourth Hokage. He was declined for the position,
 as Hiruzen felt that Orochimaru lacked understanding of what it means to be a ninja of Konoha.

Following the death of the
Fourth Hokage
, Hiruzen wished for Jiraiya to become the Fifth,
 but Hiruzen was unable to locate him.

Following Hiruzen's death, the
Konoha Council
 selected Jiraiya to be the Fifth Hokage, but he declined out of lack of interest. He proposed Tsunade for the position instead,
 which she is ultimately convinced to accept.

When Tsunade was rendered comatose following
Pain's Assault
, the
Land of Fire
's
daimyō
 remarks that he would have liked Jiraiya to replace her as the Sixth, but Jiraiya was already dead.

Despite the rivalry that existed between Orochimaru and Jiraiya, the constant arguing between Jiraiya and Tsunade,
 and Orochimaru's defection from Konoha placing him at odds with both Jiraiya and Tsunade,
 the three nevertheless remained attached to each other: when rumours of Orochimaru's death reached Konoha, Jiraiya and Tsunade discussed it together with disbelief and sadness;
 Tsunade anticipated she would have a similar reaction were anything to happen to Jiraiya,
 and did indeed cry following his death.
 When Tsunade learned that Orochimaru was still alive, she blamed him for Jiraiya's death, believing Jiraiya would still be alive had Orochimaru not betrayed Konoha. Orochimaru, though he noted remorse for Jiraiya, argued it was better that things happened as they did, otherwise Jiraiya may not have remained the quality-shinobi that he was.

Trivia

The Sannin are named after the characters in the Japanese folktale
Jiraiya Goketsu Monogatari
, however, only Jiraiya's kanji in his name are different than his source inspiration.

One of the earliest Japanese
sansukumi-ken
 was "Slug, Snake, Frog", more commonly known as
rock, paper, scissors
. In this variation, the Frog is afraid of the Snake, the Snake is afraid of the Slug, and the Slug is afraid of the Frog. This is influenced by the
Sansukumi way of thinking
, where it keeps the three objects in a deadlock.

Each of the Sannin has trained one member of
Team Kakashi
:
Jiraiya
 trained
Naruto
,
Tsunade
 trained
Sakura
, and
Orochimaru
 trained
Sasuke
.

Team Konohamaru
 has a direct relationship with Team Hiruzen. In the case of
Sarada
 and
Boruto
, one or both of their parents were trained by a Sannin. In the case of
Mitsuki
, his parent was a Sannin. Their team leader,
Konohamaru
, is Hiruzen's grandson.

Several years prior to the events of
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
, Hiruzen assigned the Sannin to assassinate
Hiruko
 for conducting
illegal experiments
. This failed, as Hiruko escaped with his research by the time the Sannin reached his lab.
