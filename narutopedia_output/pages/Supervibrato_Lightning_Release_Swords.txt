Supervibrato Lightning Release Swords
 is a form of chakra flow used by
Killer B
, often alongside his
signature kenjutsu
 and his
preferred blades
.

Even when applied to a pencil, the channeling of
lightning
-natured chakra increases its vibrating frequency and hence its piercing and cutting power, to an extent that exceeds those of standard
Wind Release
 techniques.
 A sword empowered by this chakra flow proved capable of blocking
another sword
 even
imbued with the Chidori
,
 which was considered impossible to defend against.
 However, if the chakra flow is absorbed before the flowed object pierces, the added potency will have no effect.

Trivia

Although the name of this technique implies a sword,
Jin no Sho
 indicates this is the method of chakra flow, used even on other objects.
