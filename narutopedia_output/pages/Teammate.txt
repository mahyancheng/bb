"
Teammate
" (
チームメイト
,
Chīmumeito
) is episode 62 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Team Asuma
 returns to
Konoha
 from their mission, with
Asuma
 reporting to
Tsunade
 that various villages in border towns located in the
Land of Fire
 have been destroyed, with only an insignia of
Amegakure
 left. Tsunade theorises that the massacres might be a false flag attack meant to incite a war or a response from the
Fire Daimyō
 himself; she then tells Team Asuma to remain on standby for further instructions.
Shizune
 recalls that Asuma was one of the
Twelve Guardian Ninja
 tasked to protect the daimyō. As Asuma leaves,
Yamato
 enters, ready to give his mission report. Yamato notifies Tsunade that the defiled tombs contained the corpses of four of the Guardian Ninja, and Shizune believes that the techniques those ninja possessed may be confined within their corpses. Yamato also reports that due to
Sai
's injuries, he has taken
Sora
 from the
Fire Temple
 as his replacement. He also adds that
Chiriku
, a head monk, was not the target of their attacks, leaving
Naruto
 or Sora as their intended target.

Outside, Asuma sees
Team Yamato
, and seems to recognises Sora.
Sakura
 and
Naruto
 berate Sora for his rudeness towards Asuma and warn him not to do the same to Tsunade. However, mere seconds after they enter her office, Tsunade kicks Sora out of her office, destroying the door and the wall, attempting to pummel him for insulting her; Asuma mentally remarks that it has been a long while since he had seen Sora. As they exit her office, Sakura takes Sai to the
hospital
, telling Naruto to stick with Sora. Sora, however, rebuffs his companionship, stating that he would take over the village in no time. Naruto heeds his words moments too late, and attempts to find and stop him. By the time he does, he finds Sora locked into a staredown with
Akamaru
, the latter having barked at Sora suspiciously. Naruto sighs in relief that
Kiba
 himself is not there, only for Kiba to appear. Sora asks Kiba to keep Akamaru on a leash and to teach him to not bark at strangers. The insinuation that Akamaru is a pet angers Kiba, and the pair get into a scuffle.
Chōji
 and
Shikamaru
 arrive, with Chōji telling the two to get along. However, after Sora calls him fat, Chōji enters the battle himself.

Due to the fact that Sora is a member of their team, Naruto does not feel right leaving Sora to fight two opponents at once and attempts to back Sora up. Sora does not want Naruto involved, but is slightly touched when Naruto says that he is doing so only because he sees Sora as his comrade.
Rock Lee
, who witnesses the fisticuffs between the four, views it as a bout of friendship and inserts himself in the fight as well. Shikamaru sighs in disbelief as he witnesses the scene, and tells Asuma, who had just arrived, that he is not into such childish things. Sora unleashes his
Beast Tearing Palm
 while Kiba transforms Akamaru into his
Beast Human Clone
 while he himself uses his
Four Legs Technique
; Lee prepares his
Leaf Great Whirlwind
 while Naruto uses
Shadow Clone Technique
, followed by Chōji, who jumps into the air and uses his
Multi-Size Technique
. Wanting to end the fight, Asuma stops their attacks with his mere hands while Shikamaru freezes them in place with his
Shadow Imitation Technique
; however, Chōji, who was mid-air, is unaffected by it and ends up hitting Shikamaru in the face. Asuma then tells the team to go have some barbecue after their bout. Sora attempts to refuse the invitation by claiming that he is not hungry, but his grumbling stomach betrays him.

At
Yakiniku Q
, Sora attempts to ask Asuma if he knew
Kazuma
, his father. Asuma attempts to steer the conversation in another way, and Naruto takes the opportunity to ask Asuma to teach Sora his technique, since all three of them possess
Wind Release
. In the woods, Asuma unveils his
chakra blades
 and, infusing his chakra with his
wind nature
, has his blades go through a tree and strike the boulder behind it. Using their
kunai
, Naruto and Sora decide to attempt the same thing. Outside the village, Furido and his
team
 decide to attack another village, one housing the
Kohaku Clan
, with Furido stating that their deaths would be a great sacrifice as it would benefit the Land of Fire as a whole.
