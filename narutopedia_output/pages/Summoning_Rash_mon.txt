The user
summons
 a large gate;
Sakon and Ukon
 can only summon it together. The gate itself is designed to look frightening, with the gate's doors having a demonic face upon them; this is to intimidate onlookers, potentially warding them off. The gate's doors are tightly shut and solidly built, making it useful as a shield against most forms of physical attack. The stronger the attack, the more damage the attacker will do to themselves when they try and fail to break through the gate.
 Sakon and Ukon praise
Kiba Inuzuka
 and
Akamaru
 for being able to dent the gate, which they say is
Orochimaru
's strongest defence.
 Despite this, Orochimaru can also use a
three gate variant
, and beyond that is a
five gate variant
.

In the anime, this gate possesses offensive capabilities, with launchers installed in the roof-tiles that fire swarms of blades via a chain mechanism. However, launching too many of them near its base will cripple its foundation and the gate will collapse.

Trivia

The summoned Rashōmon is based off the
main gate
 of old
Kyōto
 with the demonic face inspired by the legend that Kyōto's Rashōmon was the home of an oni named
Ibaraki-dōji
.

In some
Naruto
 video games, this technique is used offensively, the gate being summoned directly beneath the target. Some games depict the gate
opening and dropping the target in another dimension
.
