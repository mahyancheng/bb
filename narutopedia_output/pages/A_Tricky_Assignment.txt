"
A Tricky Assignment
" (
厄介な宿題
,
Yakkai na Shukudai
) is episode 255 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

In
Konoha
,
Naruto
 congratulates
Team 7
 for their success in the
Land of Water
, having already been filled in by
Chōjūrō
.
Katasuke
 was impressed by
Boruto
's willingness to risk his life to end the conflict, which has bolstered Konoha's reputation.
Shikamaru
 explains that the
Funato
 lost much influence and have been placed under surveillance by
Kirigakure
.
Gokai
,
Kobuna
, and his mother visit
Funamushi
's grave. Gokai promises to raise Kobuna into someone Funamushi would be proud of. Kobuna wants to be strong to protect everyone.
Jibiki
, still distraught about
Isari
's death, as well as
Araumi
, have been imprisoned. Boruto asks about
Ikada
, Naruto telling him that Chōjūrō made no mention of him. Naruto and Shikamaru speculate that due to his position and involvement, he's likely to face charges. Boruto wants to contact Chōjūrō to confirm Ikada's status.
Kawaki
 sees nothing wrong with Ikada facing punishment, as he was a commander. Boruto points out that Ikada stopped the fighting, and that resentment over punishing him despite that might spark the conflict again.
 Kawaki reminds him that Araumi aimed the
Chakra Cannon
 at both Boruto and Ikada, finding Boruto's outlook too naive. Boruto and Kawaki keep arguing over the cycle of hate and revenge. Kawaki leaves and comes across
Team 5
.
Iwabee
 deduces he fought with Boruto based on his mood.
Denki
 has to stop things from escalating, and they recall
Kagura
's wishes. Kawaki finds them naive as well. In Kirigakure,
Misuno
 hands Chōjūrō damage reports, which they'll need a lot of time to recover from. They also discuss the great loss of lives as well, including the
daimyō's son
. The
daimyō
 has requested harsh punishment for ringleaders Araumi and Ikada. Chōjūrō understands it but is concerned about further antagonising those who supported the Funato, concluding that the Land of Water modernising too quickly created the strain that led to this conflict. Naruto and Boruto talk about what he went through in private. Naruto relates to how Boruto feels, having gone through something similar. He tells Boruto to patch things up with Kawaki.
Mitsuki
 checks up on Kawaki, feeling that Kawaki had mixed feelings during his argument with Boruto. He thinks Boruto has influenced Kawaki, so much so that Kawaki didn't kill Araumi.
Buntan
 and
Kyohō
 visit Kagura's and
Hebiichigo
's graves, recounting how the conflict ended. Buntan will return to Kirigakure, while Kyohō decides to stay and protect the village. He asks her about
Shizuma
. She hasn't forgotten her grudge, but no longer wants revenge. Instead, she intends to capture him and make him pay for his crimes. Buntan tells him to take care of their friends' graves. Shikamaru informs Naruto of a follow-up communication from Chōjūrō, which Naruto wishes to inform Boruto about. Chōjūrō informs Ikada they've decided what to do with him and informs him that the
Shinonome
 Project has been halted, in a bid to get proper popular support before developing the nation. This smoothed things over with most Funato supporters, who were against it. However, they're still concerned that someone might want to organise another movement around Ikada, who is the only Funato heir left. Out of gratitude for his decision to stop the conflict, Chōjūrō decided not to imprison Ikada, but instead to put him under surveillance, under
Kajiki
.
Sarada
 tries to get Boruto and Kawaki to talk to patch things up, but they end up fighting. Sarada is concerned, but Mitsuki and Naruto join her, tell her not to worry and let them fight. They tire themselves out, so Naruto helps them up, deciding to treat them to ramen. He also informs them of Chōjūrō's decision regarding Ikada.
