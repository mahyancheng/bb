Mecha-Naruto gets within range and forms a
hand seal
 which then makes an unknown type of
chakra
 rush out of his hands and into his opponent; in turn switching their minds. The user of this technique is able to sound exactly like and use any technique that the original could. The user is also able to use this technique even when inside the opponents body.

Trivia

This technique resembles how Ginyū from
Dragon Ball Z
 switched minds with Gokū. It even further resembles this because of the similar hand seals and the reason the user switched back to their original body.
