The user must first prepare the technique, causing a complex anachronism that the user creates in one's chakra changing their perspective to others. Afterwards, the user will be able to change one's chakra signature, make it seem larger, smaller, emanating elsewhere, non-existent, even able to imitate other people's signatures.

Also, in the anime, the user can use the technique in conjunction with a
transformation
 of the target, making them a near-copy to
Sensor Type
 shinobi. However, the disguise can be seen through if a sensor can detect disturbances in the chakra signature.
