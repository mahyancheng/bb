Chapter 28

"
Flowers
" (
花
,
Hana
)

Kawaki
 finds it strange that
Naruto
 can be leisurely walking around. They run into
Sarada
 in a taiyaki shop, and Sarada recognises Kawaki. Naruto orders a taiyaki for himself, and confuses Kawaki when telling him to pick a flavour for his, because he has no concept of snacks. Sarada recommends a safer option, but Kawaki picks another, annoying her. Kawaki is impressed with snack food. Sarada asks for a bite of his chocolate taiyaki, having never tried that flavour, and Kawaki curses at her. A running child bumps into Kawaki, who transforms his arm to attack the child, but is stopped by Naruto, who censors him. Kawaki tells the child he has to be on guard because there are dangerous things in the world. Sarada makes sure the child is fine and apologises. Sarada and Kawaki argue over his outburst. Naruto criticises Kawaki's lack of sociability. Naruto points he'll have trouble getting
Boruto
 to cooperate with him if he keeps that attitude. The three arrive at
Yamanaka Flowers
.

Ino
 greets Naruto and Sarada, and recognises Kawaki from earlier talks with Naruto. Naruto discreetly informs her the enemy will come for him, and asks for continued support from the Sensing Division. Naruto explains they're there for a flower vase, and tells Kawaki to pick one, explaining he has to do it because he broke the flower vase. He picks one randomly, and is criticised by Sarada, and Naruto defuses the argument before it can escalate. Naruto tells him to be sincere in his picking. He picks the same vase, pointing out the design and that it'll fit Naruto's house. Ino offers to add some flowers, but the sight of the stems triggers Kawaki, reminding him of the lab tubes and
Jigen
, causing him to drop the vase. Kawaki's
Kāma
 begins to activate, but Naruto hugs him, telling him he's safe. Kawaki calms down, and they leave the shop. Sarada splits from them, telling Kawaki that since her goal is to become
Hokage
 like Naruto, he can also count on her. Naruto and Kawaki return, Naruto telling Boruto they went to buy a new flower vase. Boruto recognises Kawaki's sincerity, but hands a tube of glue to repair the broken vase instead. Just outside the main gate,
Koji Kashin
 explains to
Delta
 that the
Yamanaka clan
 has historically headed a division that senses the chakra of those entering and leaving the village, who are still active, and work by sensing if the chakra is registered in Konoha or not. Delta takes it they'll have trouble infiltrating, but Koji enters the village without setting anything off. He tells her to stay put while he retrieves Kawaki.

Chapter 29

"
Shadow Clone Technique
" (
影分身の術
,
Kage Bunshin no Jutsu
)

Koji
 enters
Konoha
 undetected. Thinking back on his words,
Delta
 believes Koji deceived her so he could continue the mission without her surveillance. Koji releases a toad to search for
Kawaki
. Kawaki stares at the glue tube, thinking about Boruto's attitude.
Naruto
 offers to spar with
Boruto
, who despite trying to play it down, is excited about it, earning Himawari's teasing. Naruto invites Kawaki to watch, as it might turn into research on
Kāma
. Boruto asks Naruto not to go easy on him, as
Himawari
 cheers for him. Boruto attacks with
taijutsu
 and shadow clones. The clones spark Kawaki's interest. Naruto defeats Boruto's clones. Kawaki tells Boruto to stop playing and use Kāma so they can learn more about it. Assuming Boruto still can't activate it at will, Kawaki activates his own so Boruto's will activate in resonance. Kawaki says Boruto will simply be stronger with it. Naruto agrees that sparring would be a preferable way of learning more about it to actual combat.
 Boruto attacks with taijutsu, trading more blows with Naruto than before. When Boruto attacks with a
Lightning Release
, Naruto uses a shadow clone to block it, using its dispersion as a diversion to move behind Boruto, kicking him aside. Naruto recognises that Boruto is stronger not only because of Kāma, but also from his own training. They finish the sparring with the
Seal of Reconciliation
, which Himawari explains to Kawaki as a salute. Kawaki thinks back to when he sparred with
Jigen
, who would constantly beat and demean Kawaki while trying to get him to use Kāma. Later, Kawaki asks Naruto if Boruto is always like he is when sparring, saying it seemed fun. Naruto asks if Kawaki is interested in
ninjutsu
 training, but Kawaki explains he can't use
chakra
, as he's not a shinobi. Naruto concedes shinobi use chakra for ninjutsu, but adds that everyone has chakra, and that it's something that connects people. Kawaki doesn't understand it, and asks about the
Shadow Clone Technique
. Naruto comments on its usefulness for multitasking, but Kawaki is only interested in it being able to be used to beat oneself up when frustrated, which he believes to be a form of venting fitting for him. Naruto says it doesn't work like that, admitting to having tried it long ago, and that Kawaki would be better off against an actual opponent, pointing out the value of having a rival. Kawaki says it sounds like a lie, but once again Naruto says he's proof of it. Kawaki goes outside to retrieve Himawari's broken vase, and is spotted by Koji, who sees him through the eyes of his toad.

Chapter 30

"
Confrontation!!
" (
対峙!!
,
Taiji!!
)

Himawari
 watches as
Kawaki
 struggles to repair her flower vase. Kawaki considers it a waste of time, and Himawari tells him that going out to buy a new vase was enough for her.
Boruto
 listens to them. Through his toad,
Koji
 watches Kawaki, and determines that while Kawaki is under the
Hokage
's watch, he can't interfere carelessly, but he doesn't really want to, preferring to see how things unfold between Kawaki and Boruto. Losing her patience,
Delta
 deploys a drone from her back to look for Kawaki, something that doesn't have chakra, so the
Yamanaka clan
 can't sense it. Boruto approaches Kawaki, and offers to help him research their
Kāma
, though they still exchange insults. Under
Naruto
's supervision, Boruto and Kawaki both activate their Kāma to fight, while Himawari cheers them both. They fight, and Naruto explains to Himawari about Kawaki's scientific ninja tool body. Satisfied with Kāma's effects on Boruto's physical performance, Kawaki wants to test his absorption capabilities, and fires at him.
 Boruto dodges the first strike, but is forced to try absorbing the second, and injures his hand in the process. The two continue arguing while watched by Koji through his toad. Naruto says that if they're over, they should end the session with the Seal of Reconciliation. When they do it, they both experience pain in the hand they have Kāma, and Boruto has a vision of
Momoshiki
. Koji observes that Boruto's hand heals. Naruto asks him about what happened, and he explains the Kāma occasionally just hurts. Koji ponders if Boruto's healing was due to his Kāma or something unique to him, and considers the possibility of sharing
Jigen
's ability worrisome. Delta's drone finds them, and she decides to go after Kawaki herself even if she's detected. She flies through the village with jets in her legs.
Ino
 senses Delta, and after confirming it with the
Barrier Team
, alerts Naruto, who instructs her to not mobilise the
military police
, and that he'll deal with the intruder himself. Koji sees Delta flying through the village disapprovingly. Naruto tells Boruto, Kawaki, and Himawari someone is coming their way, probably someone who's after Kawaki, and tells Boruto to take his sister away to safety, as he prepares for battle. Delta arrives before they can leave, and wonders how Kawaki should be punished this time.

Chapter 31

"
Monster…!!
" (
怪物…!!
,
Bakemon…!!
)

At Naruto's request,
Kawaki
 confirms Delta's identity as an Inner from
Kara
.
Delta
 is aware of who
Naruto
 is, and asks him to stand aside so she can deal with Kawaki. Kawaki warns Naruto that all Inners are monsters.
Boruto
 notices Kawaki's change of attitude as a sign of how dangerous they are. Naruto refuses to hand Kawaki over, and Delta decides to kill Naruto. Naruto tells Boruto to protect
Himawari
, and Kawaki to defend himself. Delta strikes first, trying to kick Naruto, but he dodges her attacks, grabs her by the leg, and slams her on the ground. Naruto uses a
Rasengan
 against her, but Delta absorbs it with her Shinobi-Ware eye. She attacks Naruto from below by transforming her leg in a way similar to Kawaki's body transformations, but Naruto dodges it as well. Delta confirms she has been extensively modified with scientific ninja tools. She attacks Naruto again, who activates his chakra mode.
 Naruto blocks her kick, but Delta transforms her leg upon impact, causing it to grow spikes, one of which pierces Naruto. Naruto creates chakra arms, crushing Delta's leg, causing her to retreat while considering him to be a monster himself. Delta's leg regenerates, and she taunts Naruto's performance. Boruto tries intervening, but Naruto warns him to stay back. Delta is indifferent, content with killing them both. Naruto threatens Delta, who kicks him and steps on him. Delta reiterates she's only interested in Kawaki. Delta is baffled by Naruto's commitment to stranger who brought him only trouble, and Naruto is likewise interested in how desperate she must be to come alone into enemy territory. Delta questions his curiosity considering his situation, and Naruto admits being worried is in his nature. Delta twists the spike on Naruto's abdomen, removes it, and admonishes him for his attempt at deceit while his wound heals. Naruto admits to trying to get intel from her while pretending to be weakened. Angry at the deception, Delta activates a chakra cloak of her own, promising to tear Naruto apart. Naruto warns the kids to get further away, and begins trading blows with Delta again. When the two are locked in place, Delta releases the Rasengan she absorbed before back at Naruto, who dodges it. Boruto watches in awe.

Author's Note

“

It was about 18 years ago, back when I was living in a one-bedroom apartment in a certain part of Tokyo. I had woken in the middle of the night, hearing sounds in the kitchen. When I lifted my head to look toward the kitchen door, I saw two whitish, leglike objects through the frosted glass. They were stomping around my narrow kitchen. I froze in fear for an instant, but then lowered my head bock onto my pillow, quietly so that they wouldn't realise I was awake. I then closed my eyes and pretended to be asleep. It got quiet after a little while, so I cautiously checked...and they were still in my kitchen, standing at attention. I was wide-awake now, but so scared that I couldn't leave my bed. I couldn't do anything, so I went bock to sleep, and when I came to it was morning. Had I just been really tired? Had it all been just a dream? All I think now is that I'm glad it wasn't human. I'm glad it had been just a harmless ghost.

I visited the outskirts of London in the beginning of spring. I strolled through the city where I'd spent a summer during my high school years, entering fondly remembered stores and walking through parks. About 20 years have passed since then, but I had a lot of fun. That was all fine and good, but London meals were so delicious that I regained 3 kg! Gah... I'm gonna follow Boruto's example, and put some effort into working out. The basics are important!
