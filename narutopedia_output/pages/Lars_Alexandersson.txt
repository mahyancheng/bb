Lars Alexandersson
 (
ラース・アレクサンダーソン
,
Rāsu Arekusandāson
) is a bonus playable guest character in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2
.
Lars
 is part of a crossover with the
Tekken
 franchise
 and was originally introduced in
Tekken 6
, where he received an extra costume design created by
Masashi Kishimoto
; this design formed the basis of his appearance in
Ultimate Ninja Storm 2
.

Background

Lars' background in the
Naruto
 universe is never explained and left unknown.

In
Tekken 6
, Lars is a half-Swedish, half-Japanese soldier within the Tekken Force, and is the illegitimate son of Heihachi Mishima, half-uncle of Jin Kazama, half-brother to Kazuya Mishima, and adoptive brother of Lee Chaolan. He travels the world for a time, then leads the Tekken Force in a rebellion against the Mishima Zaibatsu and the G-Corporation, military forces controlled by his half-nephew, Jin Kazama and half-brother, Kazuya Mishima.

Appearance






Concept art of Lars by Masashi Kishimoto.



Lars is a man with green eyes and blond hair that features fringe bangs with upturned spikes in the back and a topknot in the shape of a crescent moon. He wears a patterned red kimono, decorative white obi, and golden armour adorned with a lion, spiral designs, and clawed gauntlets. His outfit includes golden accessories, including a hair pin, rings fastened to the collar of his kimono, and an accessory on the knot of his obi. The back of his kimono features a stylised "46" design as his clan symbol.

Personality

In
Tekken 6
, Lars is a warm-hearted and disciplined military man, in sharp contrast with the fierce and vengeful Mishima family members to whom he is related. He is a serious and focused fighter, but allows his emotions and sense of righteousness to determine the outcome of his battles.

Abilities

Tekken 6
, in his alternate costume by Masashi Kishimoto.



In
Tekken 6
, Lars uses the fictional Tekken Force fighting style and has many attacks named after military terminology, weapons, and technology. He can perform Dynamic Entry (a stance where Lars dashes forward, unlike
Might Guy
's
Dynamic Entry
), as well as a technique known as Silent Entry (a stance where Lars dashes forward while in a crouching position). Compared to several other
Tekken
 characters, Lars' style involves heavier acrobatics and some various chopping attacks akin to karate.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2
, Lars is shown to be his exceedingly skilled in taijutsu and, as such, is his main arsenal. He mainly combined his attacks with
Lightning Release
, by
flowing chakra
 through his body at the point of contact (when in reality, the lightning is mainly the qi/ki/chi that anyone of the Mishima Bloodline takes the form of as Lars himself is later revealed to be a half-Mishima). In addition, he is capable of using a minigun designed with motifs similar to his outfit; however, in keeping with the series' trend of not using any true firearms, the minigun fires
kunai
 instead of bullets at a pretty impressive rate.

Trivia






Lars as he appears in
Tekken 6
.



The golden lion on Lars' right shoulder is a stylised representation of
Pac-Man
,
Namco's
 most famous video game character. Namco is the developer of the
Tekken
 series and, as Namco Bandai Games, the publisher of many
Naruto
 video games.

Lars' clan symbol is a stylised
46
,
Sweden's

country calling code
, referring to his half-Swedish nationality.

One of Lars' victory quotes from
Tekken 6
 are used in the game, such as him speaking on his cell phone, saying "We have injured, send a medic."

In keeping with his appearance in
Tekken 6
, where characters kept their respective international voices in the English versions (whilst Lars spoke Japanese), Lars does not have an English voice actor, and therefore, no English voice in his appearance in
Ultimate Ninja Storm 2
, instead keeping his Japanese voice, no matter what language the voices are set to. Until the release of Capcom's crossover with Namco,
Street Fighter X Tekken
, he is given an English voice by Zach Hanks in the game only.
