Ninja Info Cards
 are a type of ninja tool where information can be burned on it by using
chakra
. The cards look blank to the naked eye with the kanji for "shinobi" (
忍
) on the back, but when chakra is applied, various categories of data ranging from information about the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 to the ninja that inhabit them are displayed on the card, even in 3-D; however, only the person who originally burned the data onto the card is able to retrieve it.
