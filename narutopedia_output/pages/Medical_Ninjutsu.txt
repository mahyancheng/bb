Rin
 using medical ninjutsu.



Medical ninjutsu
 (
医療忍術
,
Iryō Ninjutsu
,
literally meaning:
 Medical Ninja Techniques) is a branch of
ninjutsu
 associated with healing, as well as the manipulation of their own, or another's body, practised by shinobi categorised as "
medical-nin
". The use of medical ninjutsu requires very advanced
chakra control
, as well as extensive knowledge
 on such things as herbs, medicines, the human body and even poisons.

The knowledge of medical ninjutsu can be used for a variety of purposes apart from simply healing. It can be used to create
poisonous gas
,
deranging the target's nervous system
, or directly attacking a target with
chakra scalpels
.
Tsunade
, renowned as the greatest medical-nin in the world, was able to apply the extreme chakra control required for medical ninjutsu to create
chakra-enhanced strength
, an ability she taught to her student,
Sakura Haruno
.

Trivia

The
Creation Rebirth
 technique is considered to be the absolute pinnacle of all medical ninjutsu, and the ultimate regeneration technique.

The cells of
Hashirama Senju
 possess an immense
Regeneration Ability
 that requires no hand seals; a feat initially believed to be impossible even for Tsunade, though she was able to emulate it through the use of her
Ninja Art Creation Rebirth — Strength of a Hundred Technique
.

In the manga, medical ninjutsu has been shown to be coloured blue, described as bluish white (
青白く
,
aojiroku
),
 as opposed to the anime which depicts them as green.

According to
Yamato
, medical ninjutsu uses either
Yin
 or
Yang Release
.

Suggestive of their alignment, all medic-nin with revealed
Nature Transformation
 lists possess Yang Release, which manipulates physical energy and can grant life.
