Deidara releases a glob of
explosive clay
 from both his hands that he forms into deformed human-like figures. Deidara then uses them to fight his opponent in close combat. Their body structure allows them to extend their body parts and not be sliced by normal means, however, a
lightning
-infused
chop
 or
sword
 will suffice. If a clay figure loses a body part, Deidara can simply attach a clay cord to it and form another clay figure. As the clay figures are made from explosive clay, Deidara can also detonate them at any moment while they are fighting the opponent.

Trivia

While unnamed in the anime, it was named in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
.

Until sufficiently cut down, these clay minions did not adhere to Deidara's usual aesthetic designs, appearing misshapen and clumsy.
