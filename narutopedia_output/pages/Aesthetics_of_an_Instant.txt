Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 begins to shroud himself with the
Nine-Tailed Fox
's
chakra
, entering his
Version 1
 form, sprouting a single chakra tail. He attempts to locate
Deidara
, but to no avail.
Kakashi
 recalls
Jiraiya
 warning him about Naruto's "Nine-Tailed Cloak Form", telling him to stop the transformation before Naruto grows a second tail. In order to halt the transformation, he gave Kakashi a
seal
 that would suppress all the chakra in Naruto's body. Naruto then begins to grow a second tail, the additional chakra causing his
shadow clones
 to feel a burning sensation, with the shadow clone near Kakashi dispelling itseld out of pain. Naruto rushes towards the woods, destroying the trees in his vicinity. Kakashi leaps down and attempts to calm him down, only for Naruto launch an attack at Kakashi. Kakashi dodges it and stamps the seal on Naruto's
forehead protector
, shutting down his chakra and reverting him back to normal.

As Naruto's transformation subsides,
Sakura
 and
Chiyo
 arrive, where the pair announce that
Sasori
 has been dealt with. Surprised that the two
kunoichi
 killed Sasori, Deidara attempts to slither out of the bush he is hiding in and to escape, only for his path to be blocked by
Team Guy
, who had used
Neji
's
Byakugan
 to locate him. Deidara is impressed with the
Hyūga Clan
's
kekkei genkai
, wondering how it compares against the
Uchiha Clan
's
Sharingan
, but adds that he does not have the time to stick around and find out. Team Guy attempts to stop his escape; despite having no arms, Deidara swiftly dodges Tenten, Guy and Lee. Neji, however, manages to hit with his
Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm
. Deidara survives the attack and heads towards the body of his giant clay bird, using his teeth to bite off a chunk of the clay and converting it to
explosive clay
 using his mouth. Deidara then swells up and
seemingly self-detonates
; Team Guy attempts to escape the blast radius, but the range of the explosion is too big. However, the explosion is countered by Kakashi's
Kamui
, which is able to warp it to a
different dimension
 just in time, although the usage of his
Mangekyō Sharingan
 causes Kakashi to collapse.

Naruto's shadow clones, carrying
Gaara
's body, regroup with the others. Naruto asks Sakura if there is anything she could do to save Gaara, still clinging on to the hope that he may be resuscitated. Sakura attempts to do so, but fails. Naruto cries out in anger over Gaara having being killed despite just recently reaching his dream of being
Kazekage
. He begins to weep, claiming that he was not able to save
Sasuke
 and despite training for three years, he was unable to save Gaara. When Chiyo tells him to calm down, he lashes out of her, blaming her and the rest of
Sunagakure
 for sealing
Shukaku
 inside Gaara. He holds them responsible as they did not take Gaara's feelings or life into consideration, and detests them to sealing
tailed beasts
 inside of people to create
jinchūriki
, claiming that they had no right to alter that person's life or fate in anyway whatsoever. Naruto's words cut deep wounds for Chiyo, as she was the one who sealed Shukaku inside of Gaara. Wanting to atone for her past, she decides to
resurrect
 Gaara at the cost of her own life.
