Summary

In the era before the creation of the ninja villages, the
Uchiha clan
 was in constant competition with the
Senju clan
, earning renown for both clans across the entire world. Remembering what
Itachi
 told him,
Sasuke
 asks if fame and power were
Madara
's reasons for taking his younger brother's eyes. Tobi confirms, but says that his brother willingly gave up his eyes in order to preserve the Uchiha's future. For this reason Madara did not want to accept the Senju's eventual offers of peace, but was forced to by the rest of his clan.
Konoha
 was created and the title of
Hokage
 was given to
Hashirama Senju
, not Madara. Fearing that the Senju would ruin the Uchiha, Madara tried to take control of Konoha. He failed and was believed to have died, but the Uchiha were thereafter regarded with suspicion in Konoha. When the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 attacked Konoha sixteen years earlier, Konoha suspected an Uchiha's involvement. Sick of not being trusted, the Uchiha began plotting to overthrow Konoha, beginning Itachi's tragedy.
