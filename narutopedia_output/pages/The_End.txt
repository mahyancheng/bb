Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As the thunder clouds begin to form above them,
Zetsu
 realises that
Sasuke
 had created them from the heat of his
Fire Release: Great Dragon Fire Technique
 along with the heat of
Itachi
's inextinguishable
Amaterasu
. Harnessing the lightning in the clouds with his
chakra
, Sasuke uses his new jutsu,
Kirin
, in an attempt to kill Itachi and ends up completely obliterating the
Uchiha Hideout
.

Sasuke believes he has finally won, only for Itachi to stand up, having survived Kirin's impact due to his
Susanoo
, a colossal chakra guardian exclusive to those who possess the
Mangekyō Sharingan
 in both eyes. As Itachi begins to make his way towards Sasuke, who is out of chakra, the repressed portion of
Orochimaru
 that Sasuke had absorbed begins to take over his body. Using the
Eight Branches Technique
, Orochimaru's eight white snakes burst out of Sasuke's
cursed seal
 as Orochimaru himself exits from one of the snake's mouths, thanking Itachi for lowering Sasuke's chakra enough to the point where he could break free and grateful that he has another opportunity to take over Sasuke's body.

Using his Susanoo's
Sword of Totsuka
, which has the ability to seal any soul and trap it forever in a
genjutsu
, Itachi decapitates seven of the eight snakes and manages to seal Orochimaru away, removing Sasuke's cursed seal in the process. However, this takes too much chakra, and Itachi's Susanoo is reduced to its most basic form. Itachi, coughing up blood, slowly makes his way towards Sasuke, who is unable to move away from him. As Itachi comes close to Sasuke, he whispers his last words to Sasuke and proceeds to
poke his forehead
 before collapsing down to the floor, dead. Sasuke contemplates Itachi's last words and stares at his brother's corpse before collapsing next to him out of sheer exhaustion.
