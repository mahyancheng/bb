Trivia

In the original Japanese version,
Itachi Uchiha
 could be fought in a dōjō in the
Academy
 after clearing the game. In the later English DS port, this option became inaccessible. However, Itachi is still seen during a flashback before Naruto fights Gaara and his sprite and voice actor's name appears in the end game credits, suggesting that this was either a programming error, or he was removed to prevent spoilers.

In this game, the movie poster of
Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow
 can be seen outside of the Konoha Theatre saying "coming soon summer 2007".

In 2004, a special Naruto-themed GBA SP came out to promote this game. The system came with a copy of this game, along with a charger.

Naruto can unlock the
Rasengan
 as a secret move by using a cheat card that came with a vintage Shonen Jump magazine.

The English version's box back has an error. In the French copyright section at the bottom, it uses the copyright from the DS port of
Ben 10: Protector of Earth
.
