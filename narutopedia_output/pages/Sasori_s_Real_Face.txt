"
Sasori's Real Face
" (
サソリの素顔
,
Sasori no Sugao
) is episode 21 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

With
his puppet
 destroyed,
Sasori
 reveals himself to
Chiyo
 and
Sakura
, looking no older than when he left his village over twenty years ago. Chiyo and Sakura are both unable to believe that Sasori has not aged in two decades. Meanwhile,
Temari
's team, along with
Kankurō
 and
Ebizō
, decide to make their way towards the
Land of Rivers
, in order to support the
Kazekage Rescue Team
. Kankurō tells Temari to take a break, which Temari protests, until Kankurō points out the members of her team are exhausted and unable to continue. Although Temari is able to persuade them to push themselves past their limits in order to save their
Kazekage
, Ebizō tells the others to take notice of where they have stopped. Looking around, the team realise that they are standing on the same battlefield where
Team Kakashi
 fought
Itachi
. Ebizō claims that since they are in
Akatsuki
 territory, blindly rushing in, and to do so exhausted, would result in swift and sudden annihilation. While the team decides to rest, Ebizō tells them the tale of the strongest ninja in
Sunagakure
's history, the
Third Kazekage
, and how one day he was mysteriously kidnapped. He tells the Suna ninja that the village searched for him for years, with the
Anbu
 even searching in secret. However, they were unable to find his corpse or even how he was kidnapped. Ebizō states that during the time that Suna searched for the Third Kazekage, the village entered into a state of panic that allowed enemy ninja from a rival village to invade Suna and cause a war. Believing that such bloodshed could have been avoided had Suna dealt with the crisis in a calm fashion, Ebizō tells the team not to repeat Suna's mistakes from the days of the Third Kazekage.

Back in the Akatsuki hideout, Sasori uses Hiruko's head to launch another round of
poison
-tipped
senbon
, only for Sakura to dodge them all once more. However, this time he realises that it is Chiyo who is pulling the strings,
using Sakura as her own human puppet
. He then
summons
 a new puppet to battle with, revealed to be none other than the
Third Kazekage
. Chiyo realises that it is Sasori who kidnapped and killed the Third around a decade ago, and is appalled to learn that he transformed the Third into a
human puppet
. While she finds his association with Akatsuki regrettable, she finds his betrayal to his village the most despicable, holding him responsible for the murders of the last three Kazekage - the Third, the
fourth
, and
Gaara
, the Fifth, despite
Orochimaru
 killing the Fourth. Sasori claims that it was
one of his spies
 that was complicit in the murder of the Fourth, but admits that the Akatsuki and Orochimaru have some shared history. Wanting some answers, Sakura tells Sasori that he will tell her what she wants to know. Not wanting to drag out their fight, as he needs to aid
Deidara
 outside capture
Naruto
, Sasori uses the Third Kazekage puppet to launch more poison senbon towards Sakura; Chiyo manages to have Sakura evade the attack successfully. Using the Third Kazekage's poison blades, Sasori tries to stab Sakura, but the attack is blocked by Hiruko's tail, which Chiyo controls with her
chakra threads
. However, the blades are powerful enough to break Hiruko's already powerful tail. Having no other method to protect Sakura, Chiyo is unable to block Sasori's
Thousand Hands Manipulation Force
. However, she is able to masterfully control Sakura to avoid any damage and pull her out of harm's way. Sasori counters by releasing poison gas, knowing that despite Chiyo controlling Sakura, there is no way she could prevent Sakura from inhaling the fumes.

On the outside, Deidara flies away with Gaara's corpse, prompting Naruto to follow him. Since
Team Guy
 is occupied and Deidara was strong enough to beat Gaara,
Kakashi
 decides to follow Naruto, leaving Sakura and Chiyo to defeat Sasori on their own.
