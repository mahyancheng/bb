Attacking the opponent with a series of punches and kicks to force them backwards, Tobirama then creates a small pool of water from which a clone of himself emerges. The clone, alongside Tobirama then buffets the target with a series of more kicks and punches before delivering a final kick and the clone then dissipates back into water.
