Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Kaguya
 voices her hatred for her sons. Outraged by
Black Zetsu
's claims,
Naruto
 frees himself and
Sasuke
, disagreeing with him about those who shape shinobi history and how mothers should feel about their children. Sasuke surmises they need to create an opening to seal Kaguya, Naruto decides to use a certain jutsu, and starts filling Sasuke in on it. Black Zetsu dismisses them, pointing out Kaguya can absorb all jutsu. From afar,
Sakura
 observes them, relaying the information to
Kakashi
, who is still in awe of Kaguya's power. Naruto's
shadow clone
 heals
Obito
.
 Sasuke is dubious about Naruto's strategy involving a jutsu he practiced in secret even more than the
Rasengan
, but agrees to try it. He engulfs Kaguya with
Amaterasu
, which she effortlessly absorbs. Naruto moves in and transforms into a
group of naked men
, stunning Kaguya. Sakura is irate that Naruto would try that on someone so powerful, but is shocked when Naruto lands a hit on Kaguya. Kakashi wonders if
Jiraiya
 is watching Naruto save the world with perverted ninjutsu. Sasuke
teleports
 Kaguya between himself and Naruto, almost making physical contact, but Kaguya
teleports
 everyone to her
ice dimension
, locking them in place with ice.

Naruto's shadow clone, Sakura, and Kakashi discuss Kaguya's jutsu. Kaguya escapes the ice, and moves in to absorb their chakra again. Sasuke frees himself and Naruto with Amaterasu and
Kagutsuchi
. At Black Zetsu's suggestion, Kaguya splits them up, throwing Sasuke in her desert dimension. Naruto tries to keep the
portal
 open, to no avail. Naruto evades Kaguya, who causes the surrounding landscape to attack Naruto. Obito wakes up, and is brought up to speed on the situation. They decide to assist in the battle. Sasuke wanders through the desert dimension. Naruto's clone finishes explaining the situation to Obito. They watch the original Naruto dodging the terrain, before finally allowing himself be captured to draw Kaguya out. Obito notices Kaguya's use of
Space–Time Ninjutsu
, and is certain that he can sync his
Kamui
 with it, and bring Sasuke back if he is in another dimension. Due to the great chakra cost it would require, Sakura volunteers her
stored
 chakra. Obito is prepared to die if he has to. In the real world, the four
Hokage
 converge on
Madara
's severed lower half, and discuss what has happened and how to proceed.
Hagoromo
's chakra manifests itself from Madara's lower half, and introduces himself to the four.
