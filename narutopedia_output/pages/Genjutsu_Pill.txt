These special
Genjutsu Pills
 (
幻術屋久
,
Genjutsu Yaku
,
literally meaning:
 Illusion Technique Pills) were developed by Orochimaru. Once ingested, the pills will cast a
genjutsu
 on the target that paralyses the body. The drugs also affect the target's mind to some degree as
Gyūki
 had troubles remembering his last rampage after
Blue B
 took the pills.
