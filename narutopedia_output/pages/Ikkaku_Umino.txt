shinobi
 from
Konohagakure

Background

When
Kohari
 was injured while protecting him during the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
, he offered to look after her. Ikkaku said he would look after her since it was the parent's job to protect their child, not the other way around. He instructed Iruka to flee. Iruka did not listen, forcing other Konoha ninja to drag him away from the battle. His parents were killed by the
Nine-Tails
. Their names had been added to Konoha's
Memorial Stone
 when they died.

Personality

He seemed to be a very stern, but loving man seen from his refusal to let his son stay on the battlefield during the Nine-Tails' attack while readily defending his family and village.

Appearance

Ikkaku had brown hair which he tied back into a ponytail, dark eyes and a thin moustache. He wore the standard attire of the Konoha-nin inclusive of
forehead protector
 and
flak jacket
 under which he wore mesh armour that showed past his sleeves. He also carried a large scroll on his lower back.
