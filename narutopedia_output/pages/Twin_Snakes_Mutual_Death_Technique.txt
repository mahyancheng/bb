This technique was taught to
Anko Mitarashi
 by
Orochimaru
. The user grabs one of their intended victim's hands and forces it to assist in performing the necessary
hand seals
. Once this is done, the user and the victim die, which
Rin no Sho
 likens to a lovers' double-suicide.
 It's not actually clear how death occurs because the technique has never been seen performed successfully: when Anko uses it on Orochimaru, she stabs his hand to hers to prevent him from escaping as she performs the hand seals. When she realises he's merely a
shadow clone
, the technique is aborted.

Naruto: One Decade, One Hundred Ninja
 illustrates this technique as two
snakes
 coiling around Anko and Orochimaru.

Trivia

In
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3
 and its sequels, when Anko performs this technique, two summoned snakes wrap themselves around her and her opponent. The snakes lock themselves together by biting each others' necks and then detonate. For gameplay reasons, Anko is left unharmed.

This technique also activates Anko's
Cursed Seal of Heaven
, but only if it's used against Orochimaru.
