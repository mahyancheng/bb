The
Konoha
 Archive Library
 (
木ノ葉古書所
,
Konoha Toshodokoro
,
literally meaning:
 Tree Leaf Ancient Book Place) is built into the same mountain that has the
Hokage Rock
. Information on its ninja — past and current — is stored there, as well as other points of interest such as
Akatsuki
 as well as other sensitive village information.

Because it is located inside the Hokage Monument mountain, it was one of the few buildings to survive the giant-scale
Shinra Tensei
 cast during
Pain's assault
 on Konoha.
