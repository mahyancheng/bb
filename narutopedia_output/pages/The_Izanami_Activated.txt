Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Casting aside
Itachi
's lectures to him,
Kabuto
 reveals to the siblings that he had injected himself with the DNA of various
shinobi
, namely the
Sound Five
, also including
Orochimaru
. He then begins to
attack them

with

their

signature

techniques
. Although easily countering Kabuto's attacks at first, Itachi and
Sasuke
 find themselves trapped in
Tayuya
's
genjutsu
. Bringing forth Orochimaru afterwards, Kabuto has him transformed into the white snake form to assault the two brothers.
 However, through their
combined

effort
, Itachi and Sasuke are able to escape the genjutsu. Kabuto surprises Itachi and
bisects
 him all the while shedding tears and told Itachi that a genius like him would not understand him, declaring that no one shall stand in his way. As his body
reforms
, Itachi called out to Sasuke as he threw his
sword
 at Kabuto, only to be caught by his navel-
snake
. Sasuke launches a
fireball
 at Kabuto, however, the latter easily
counters
 with a
water
 technique. Kabuto then attacks Itachi with the sword and claimed that his genjutsu cannot affect him. The sequence of events repeats itself as Kabuto notices the déjà vu. It is later revealed to be happening all in Kabuto's head as he is trapped within the endless loop of
Izanami
.
