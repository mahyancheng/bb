Shodai Hokage no Isan Shi o Yobu Kubikazari
) is episode 91 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 tries to hit
Tsunade
 with his not yet perfected
Rasengan
. Tsunade punches the ground, creating a fissure that Naruto is trapped in, negating his attack. She then berates
Jiraiya
 for trying to teach Naruto a technique that he couldn't possibly master. Naruto insists that he could, and bets that he could master it in three days. Naruto's personality reminds Tsunade of her deceased loved ones, so she accepts the bet, giving Naruto a week to master it. If Naruto won, she would accept that he could become
Hokage
, and would give him her incredibly valuable
necklace
 that had originally belonged to the
First Hokage
. If he loses, then she would get to keep
Gama-chan
, his purse full of money. Naruto accepts her terms and decides to begin training. Later that night, Jiraiya comes to sit next to Tsunade at a shop, and the two discuss
her lover
,
her brother
, Naruto, and
Orochimaru
. Jiraiya reminds her that her loved ones all died for the village, and that if she helps Orochimaru, their deaths would be in vain. Meanwhile,
Shizune
 talks to Naruto about Tsunade's past and about the history of the necklace. Shizune explains that the necklace wasn't an ordinary necklace, and that if anyone except Tsunade wore it, that person would die. While Shizune was talking to Naruto, Tsunade is sitting on top of the gate of Tanzaku Quarters, thinking back on her brother and her lover, both of whom died and whose deaths she could not prevent.
