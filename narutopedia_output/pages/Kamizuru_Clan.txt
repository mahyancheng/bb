The
Kamizuru Clan
 (
上水流一族
,
Kamizuru Ichizoku
) was a
clan
 of
bee
 users from
Iwagakure
 who were once very well-known and revered.
Suzumebachi
 claims that the
First Tsuchikage
 was a member of the clan.

History

Years before the start of the series, they led an attempted invasion by Iwa of
Konohagakure
, only to be repelled and largely killed by Konoha's more experienced
Aburame clan
. The Kamizuru were so badly defeated that they lost their status and respect in Iwa and their numbers began to dwindle.

Years later, the last surviving Kamizuru tried to restore their former status by locating the First Tsuchikage's secret scroll, which is full of
forbidden techniques
 for bug user ninja. To that end, they set out to find the
bikōchū
. Konoha's
Bikōchū Search Team
 were also looking for the bikōchū, and thus the two eventually battled. All three of the Kamizuru were defeated by
Hinata Hyūga
 using her recently perfected
Protecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
 technique. Suzumebachi attempted one last-ditch attack with a
summoned

Giant Bee
, but was defeated by
Naruto
's
Rasengan
.

Trivia

The members of this clan do not use the generic hand seals used for the Summoning Technique. Instead, they stick their right thumb into the palm of their left hand.

In
Konoha Hiden
, the
beekeeper
 is heavily suggested to be from the Kamizuru clan: they use bees, wasps, and hornets and are descended from an Iwa clan destroyed many years earlier.
