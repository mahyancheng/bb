"
Battle of Valley of Clouds and Lightning
" (
雲雷峡の闘い
,
Unraikyō no Tatakai
) is episode 142 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As the
Eight Man Squad
 stand on the ruins of the
Uchiha Hideout
,
Kakashi
 orders them all to fan out and track
Sasuke
's lingering scent. However, the scent is too faint and, unable to locate Sasuke and their
mission to find Itachi
 being a failure, Kakashi decides that they should all return back to
Konoha
.

Elsewhere,
Tobi
 finds Sasuke staring up at a full moon, the latter claiming that every time he does so, he is reminded of that
fateful night
. Sasuke tells him that he is able to access repressed memories of that night, including awakening his
Sharingan
 for the first time and chasing after
Itachi
, who looked back at him as tears fell down his face. Sasuke had believed that he had imagined it, but the memory of the tears convinces him that the story he heard was true. Meanwhile, Tobi manages to locate
Kisame
, who had decided to leave the
Akatsuki
 following Itachi's death. Tobi, however, changes from his goofy voice and demeanour to a more serious one and removes his mask, and Kisame recognises him as
Madara Uchiha
, the former
Mizukage
 himself. Surprised that Tobi is actually Madara and that Madara is pulling the strings, Kisame decides to rejoin the Akatsuki.

In their hideout, Tobi asks Sasuke what his intentions are, and Sasuke responds that he plans to kill the elders of Konoha to avenge Itachi and their clan but does not care what happens to the villagers. Tobi then proposes to Sasuke and
his team
 that they work together to find the
tailed beasts
 in order to achieve their goals. Madara explains that there are nine of them, whom the
First Hokage
 used to control and use to settle conflicts. As a sign of the nations' alliance, the First Hokage had given a tailed beast to every nation. Madara asks Taka to join the Akatsuki since they are low on manpower, following the recent deaths of their many members, and tasks Taka with capturing the
Eight-Tails
 while the Akatsuki capture
Naruto
, the
jinchūriki
 of the
Nine-Tails
.

Outside, Madara has a conversation with
Zetsu
 and expressed his gratitude that Itachi is dead, since without him around to stop them, they may finally invade and destroy Konoha. Zetsu inquires as to why Itachi would have
passed down
 his
Amaterasu
 to Sasuke if he did not know that Madara knew the truth, to which Madara responds that it was most likely to prevent Sasuke's induction into the ranks of the Akatsuki. Madara claims that with Itachi gone and Sasuke taking his place, his plans are finally coming to fruition.

On their sojourn to find the Eight-Tails, Sasuke uses his
Mangekyō Sharingan
's
genjutsu
 to interrogate
Kiyoi Yotsuki
, a
shinobi
 from
Kumogakure
, who reveals that the Eight-Tails' jinchūriki is a man with a
tattoo
 on his right shoulder and numerous blades in his possession, and that he is at the
Valley of Clouds and Lightning
. After arriving at the valley, they find themselves face-to-face with a rapper named
Killer B
, who is the jinchūriki of the Eight-Tails.
Suigetsu
 attempts to attack him with his
Kubikiribōchō
, only for Killer B to use his strength to pry the blade away from him;
Jūgo
 attempts to attack as well, but Killer B uses the Kubikiribōchō to defeat him. Seeing his defeated teammates, Sasuke decides to step up and handle the jinchūriki himself, claiming that he wishes to acquire the tailed beast in order to use the Akatsuki in his quest to destroy Konoha.

Trivia

In this episode Kisame stated that there were 3 tailed beasts left to capture, which was changed from only 2 left stated in the manga. This retcons Pain's earlier words when referring to the number of tailed beasts captured; to allow for a filler arc to focus on the
Jinchūriki
 of the
Six-Tails
,
Utakata
.
