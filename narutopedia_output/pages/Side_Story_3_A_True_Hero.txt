found by

enemy ninja
 looking for
the ninja
 the team had encountered earlier. They kidnap Rin to see what she knows. Obito immediately tries to go after her, but Kakashi stops him, saying they must complete their mission first as the
Shinobi Rules

. He also says that
Sakumo Hatake
, despite being disgraced when he abandoned a mission to save his team, was right to do so.
