Naruto
 manga.

Summary

After imparting his final words to
Sasuke
,
Itachi
's soul is released from the
Impure World Reincarnation
. On different battlefields, all the other reincarnated shinobi's souls are being released, as the five
Kage
 realise what was happening, they wonder who had released the technique with
Ōnoki
 noting that whomever it was, was a hero to the shinobi world. Regaining dominion over his movements,
Dan
 asks
Chōza
 to have them remove the
barrier
 which sealed him. When the barrier is released, Chōza notes the
hand seals
 Dan used, realises his intentions and tells him to hurry and go to
Tsunade
. Using his
Spirit Transformation Technique
 to take control of his then-ascending soul, Dan flies to Tsunade's location in time to take over her body and save her from
Madara
 — who though was being released from the Impure World Reincarnation, was still making a desperate attempt to kill the Kage. Speaking with Tsunade in her subconscious, before disappearing Dan tells Tsunade that he would wait for her in the afterlife but not to follow after him just yet and leaves her with the remainder of his chakra, thus restoring her
Strength of a Hundred Seal
. After returning to the real world, Tsunade and the other Kage watch in some confusion, wondering why Madara hadn't stopped moving as yet. He then explains that if the reincarnated know the seals to end the summoning contract of the Impure World Reincarnation, they could sever ties from the summoner. With this, Madara performs the seals to sever the contract and tells them to tell his
summoner
 that he shouldn't use
kinjutsu
 so arbitrarily.
