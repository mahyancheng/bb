"
Multiple Traps! Countdown to Destruction
" (
多重トラップ　崩壊のカウントダウン
,
Tajū Torappu, Hōkai no Kauntodaun
) is episode 201 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 pursues
Gennō
 to the mountains at the back of town, and hears that he plans to detonate explosive tags there, burying
Konoha
 in a massive rockslide. Before he can do so, Naruto's friends arrive,
Hinata
 having informed them where he was going. They combine their efforts to prevent him from detonating tags, and manage to save the village. Gennō dies after saying that he wanted his son to enjoy another scavenger hunt, and the group realises that while he had initially intended to destroy Konoha, because Naruto reminded him of his son, he made his traps into a scavenger hunt. Hence, Konoha was actually in no real danger.
