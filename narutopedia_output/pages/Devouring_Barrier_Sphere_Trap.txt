At some point, the user of this technique will set up an array of
barrier tags
, which are camouflaged by surroundings. If the target is not aware of the camouflaged tags, the presence of the target will ignite the trap automatically. Once activated, a dark red
chakra
 sphere will form, trapping the target inside. Anyone caught in the trap as it activates will be compressed in its container, devoured, and crushed.

The trap was dispelled by
Shikamaru
 via
Shadow Sewing Technique
 before it could do so. When it is dispelled, it will be shattered like broken glass and disappear.

Trivia

This technique is somewhat similar mechanics to the
Curse Mandala
 technique, as both allow to manipulate the size of a shape composed of chakra and crushing the target inside the container. The difference is, the Curse Mandala needs some hand seal to activate, but this technique is running automatically.
