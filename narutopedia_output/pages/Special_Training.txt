Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Kakashi
 explains that, although combining
shape transformation
 and
nature transformation
 usually takes years, Naruto will be able to do so in a fraction of the time by training with
shadow clones
. Kakashi then demonstrates how shadow clones transfer what they learn during their existence back to the originator when they disperse. Having never noticed this before, Naruto asks if training with hundreds of clones to learn things a hundred times faster is how Kakashi became so strong. Kakashi replies that only Naruto can do this sort of training because he has access to the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
's
chakra
.
Yamato
 joins them to help Naruto keep the fox in control. Before Naruto can start on his new technique, they must first determine his nature affinity; it is
Wind Release
.
