Dust Release
 (
塵遁
,
Jinton
,
Viz:
 Particle Style) is a
nature transformation

kekkei tōta
, a combination of
earth
,
wind
, and
fire
. To perform Dust Release, users form a small three-dimensional object (e.g. a cube, a cone, etc.) out of
chakra
 in their hands. The object expands once released by the user and moves astonishingly fast at its target; anything that passes through it (or that is passed through by it) is disintegrated on a molecular level.
 Because of the sheer destructiveness of Dust Release, its users are usually unmatched in a fight and they can easily fend off countless enemies. For this reason, the best way to combat one Dust Release user is with a second Dust Release user.

Dust Release techniques seem to require a certain amount of preparation time, making it possible to prematurely halt the technique before it is completed. The hands also play a crucial role in the preparation, so interfering with the user's arms can hinder the technique.
 Dust Release techniques seem to be rather chakra-taxing.

Trivia

Dust Release is the only known nature transformation to be a combination of more than two other already existing nature transformations. It is also the only known example of a
Kekkei Tōta
.

Ōnoki
 stated that
Mū
 passed the secrets of Dust Release on to him,
 possibly suggesting that these techniques are not genetic.

Kū
 and
Kakō
, both
fabrications
 who were created with Ōnoki as their genetic template, were able to use Dust Release.

Dust Release shares the same romanisation as
Swift Release
.

The kanji for "dust" (塵) also appears in the word for particle, atom, or little piece (微塵,
mijin
,
Literally meaning:
 minute dust). Additionally, the on-reading
jin
 can refer to "one-billionth" (10
−9
) as well as the Buddhist term for defilement, impurity, or affliction.
