The
White Light Chakra Sabre
 was a
tantō
 that originally belonged to
Sakumo Hatake
, who passed it on to his son,
Kakashi
. It was a straight-bladed tantō with a small, circular hand-guard. It gave off a white streak of
chakra
 when it was swung, thus earning Sakumo his title of "Konoha's White Fang" (
木ノ葉の白い牙
,
Konoha no Shiroi Kiba
,
English TV:
 White Fang of the Leaf,
literally meaning:
 Tree Leaf's White Fang). This blade was destroyed during the
Third Shinobi World War
 during Kakashi's fight with
Kakkō
. In the anime, it was later shown repaired with Kakashi still using it for missions.

Trivia

In
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
, during the flashback right after the Battle of
Kannabi Bridge
, Kakashi is seen with the White Light Chakra Sabre sheathed, despite the blade having been destroyed at the time.
