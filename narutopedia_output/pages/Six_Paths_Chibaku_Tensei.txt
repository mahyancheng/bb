The
Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei
 is a powerful
fūinjutsu
 which can only be used by those who have awakened the
Six Paths Senjutsu
.
 It combines the
Six Paths

Yin
 and
Yang
 powers.

Usage

This technique is activated when users of the Six Paths Yin and Yang Powers simultaneously place their palms upon the target's body. The target is then made into a centre of attraction, causing the surrounding earth to be forcefully pulled onto their body and formed into a sealing stone far larger than what is created by the standard
Chibaku Tensei
. The technique can also seal away the target's
Rinne Sharingan
, as images of the Six Paths Yin and Yang seals appear within their eye and overlap,
 as well as forcibly extract their
chakra
 from their body.

 The only known method of breaking this seal is for a wielder of the
Rinnegan
 to
summon
 the core out of the resulting
satellite
.

History






Hagoromo and Hamura sealing the Ten-Tails.



Hagoromo
 and
Hamura Ōtsutsuki
 used this technique on the
Ten-Tails
, sealing its
body
 within the newly-created
moon
. Centuries later, the spirit of Hagoromo passed on the seals required to activate this technique to
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Sasuke Uchiha
, who went on to perform the same feat, resealing
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 — alongside
Black Zetsu
 — inside of a new moon contained within her
core dimension
.

Trivia

In
chapter 681
, the
fourth databook
, and
Naruto: Shippūden

episode 459
, it is stated that Hagoromo and Hamura used this technique to transform the Ten-Tails into the core of the moon. However, in
episode 462
, they are instead depicted using this technique on Kaguya herself, while Ten-Tails' body withers away like a tree. Later, in
episode 464
, Hagoromo claims he sealed both Kaguya and Ten-Tails inside the moon.

In the anime, when Hagoromo and Hamura used this technique to seal Kaguya, the Six Paths Yin and Yang seals did not appear in her
third eye
, and her chakra was not extracted from her body.
