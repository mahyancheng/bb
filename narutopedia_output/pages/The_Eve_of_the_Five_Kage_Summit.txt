Summary

While
Taka
 is heading to
Konoha
 they are met by
Tobi
. Tobi informs them that they are wasting their time since Konoha has already been destroyed. What's more, they failed to capture the
Eight-Tails
 and thus are still indebted to
Akatsuki
. To reach a compromise, Tobi sends them to the approaching
Kage Summit
 so that Sasuke can kill
Danzō
, the new
Hokage
 and a conspirator in the
Uchiha clan
's assassination. In Konoha,
Sakura
 is brought to tears by
Team Samui
's requests to give them information that will be used to kill Sasuke.
Naruto
 offers to tell them what they need so that Sakura doesn't need to, adding that they can still save
Killer B
 if they act soon.
