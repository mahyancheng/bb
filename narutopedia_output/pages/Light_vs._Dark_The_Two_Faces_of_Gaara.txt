"
Light vs. Dark: The Two Faces of Gaara
" (
光と闇　我愛羅という名
,
Hikari to Yami Gaara Toiu na
) is episode 77 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Gaara
 continues to reminisce about
Yashamaru
, he remembers Yashamaru's defeat and attempted suicide bombing. Yashamaru tells him that Gaara's father,
The Fourth Kazekage
, ordered him to kill Gaara. He also adds that while he could have refused the order, he wanted to kill Gaara because he hated Gaara for causing
his sister
's death. Yashamaru then opens his
flak jacket
 and reveals
explosive tags
 on his torso, which detonates. Although he was able to survive the blast, Gaara lost the only person who he thought ever cared for him, who revealed that he never did love him at all. From that point on, Gaara came to love and care about only himself, and starting living off of killing others, believing that to be the purpose of his existence.

Returning to the present day, Gaara quickly restrains
Sakura
 with a claw made of sand and slowly squeezes her. He detaches the arm holding Sakura and regenerates it, and continues to transform further into
Shukaku
. Now having no more humanoid features, Gaara resolves to kill
Naruto
 as well, all the while telling Naruto that he must fight for himself and not for his friends. Determined to save
Sasuke
 and Sakura at all costs, Naruto attempts to summon
Gamabunta
, but ends up summoning
Gamakichi
, a smaller toad who is unable to fight. Gaara then launches
Sand Shuriken
 at them; Naruto manages to save Gamakichi as the shuriken pummels him. Naruto realises that Gaara is lonely, just like how he used to be before he met Sasuke, Sakura,
Kakashi
 and
Iruka
, and wonders if he would have ended up like Gaara had he not met them. Thinking back on how meeting his friends gave him happiness and saved him from darkness, Naruto resolves to save them from Gaara, even at the cost of his own life.
