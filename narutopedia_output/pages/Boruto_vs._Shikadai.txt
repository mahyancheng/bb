"
Boruto vs. Shikadai
" (
ボルトVSシカダイ
,
Boruto Bāsasu Shikadai
) is episode 59 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

The fight between
Chōchō
 and
Shinki
 begins. Shinki talks down on Chōchō, dismissing her potential as a shinobi. Chōchō attacks with enlarged fists, which Shinki catches with his iron sand. When fighting up close doesn't work, Chōchō attacks from a distance, using her enlarged fists to
toss debris
.
Kurotsuchi
 is impressed with Shinki, and asks
Gaara
 where he found him. Gaara thinks back to when he found a troubled Shinki and told him he could teach him to use his power. Shinki blocks all of Chōchō's attacks, and throws her to the ground, telling her to give up. Chōchō refuses, and prepares her next attack.

Chōji
 recognises her hand seal, and is surprised that she is resorting to a jutsu she hates using. Chōchō uses the
Human Bullet Tank
. She manages to pressure Shinki a bit, changing his demeanour for a moment, but still loses. As her friends carry Chōchō out of the arena, Shinki tells
Mitsuki
 he'll defeat him, and continues to talk down on the Konoha genin. Chōchō's parents check on her.
Shikadai
 and
Boruto
 talk before their fight, and Shikadai's parents talk to him. During their fight, Shikadai tries pinning Boruto with his shadow, but he and his clones keep dodging it. When Boruto almost lands a hit on Shikadai, he fans out his shadow, capturing Boruto and all four of his clones. Thinking back on his father, Boruto uses the
Kote
 to create one more shadow clone, forcing Shikadai to dodge, and allowing his other clones to close in on him. Boruto wins to match.
Katasuke
 congratulates Boruto on his win and use of the Kote, and hands him a new scroll to use. Shikadai's teammates console him over his loss. Meanwhile, Boruto is unhappy despite his victory.

Trivia

As opposed to the
movie version
, Boruto did not utilise a
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 to defeat Shikadai, but instead produced a single clone. As such, he was not revealed to be cheating during this match as he did in the movie.
