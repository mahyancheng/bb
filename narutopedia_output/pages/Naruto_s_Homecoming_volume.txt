Naruto's Homecoming!!
 (
ナルトの帰郷!!
,
Naruto no Kikyō!!
,
Viz:
 Homecoming) is volume 28 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 245

"
Naruto's Homecoming!!
" (
ナルトの帰郷!!
,
Naruto no Kikyō!!
)

After two-and-a-half years of training,
Naruto
 returns to
Konoha
.
Kakashi
 greets him soon after his arrival and receives
Icha Icha Tactics
 as a gift from Naruto, the only book
Jiraiya
 has had time to write these past few years. Jiraiya leaves Naruto's training up to Kakashi once again while he goes to investigate
Akatsuki
. Naruto also runs into
Sakura
 and
Konohamaru
 soon after getting back. Konohamaru demonstrates his
Sexy Technique
, which Naruto is unimpressed with, claiming to have invented even more
perverted techniques
. Sakura demonstrates the monstrous strength gained from training with
Tsunade
 by hitting Naruto in disgust. Naruto and Sakura reform
Team 7
 under Kakashi's leadership, who suggests they have a
bell test
 just like they did when the team was first formed years ago.

Chapter 246

"
The Pair's Growth!!
" (
二人の成長!!
,
Futari no Seichō!!
)

Naruto
 and
Sakura
 must once again take one of two bells from
Kakashi
. Since there are only two of them this time (a fact that devastates Naruto and Sakura), there are no underlying lessons of teamwork. Because Naruto and Sakura are no longer fresh
genin
, Kakashi does not read his new
Icha Icha Tactics
 book and immediately uncovers his
Sharingan
. Naruto once again attacks before being given permission, though he is not as easily subdued by Kakashi this time. The contest continues into the night but Naruto and Sakura cannot get close enough to Kakashi. Naruto opts for a trick; he threatens to spoil the ending of
Icha Icha Tactics
, forcing Kakashi to shut his ears to avoid hearing it and his eyes to avoid reading Naruto's lips. This creates an opening for Naruto and Sakura to take a bell.

Chapter 247

"
Intruders in Suna
" (
砂への侵入者たち
,
Suna e no Shinnyūsha-Tachi
)

Sakura
 takes
Naruto
 for a tour of
Konoha
 to reacquaint him with the village. They run into
Shikamaru
 escorting
Temari
 from the village, the two working together in anticipation of the next
Chūnin Exams
. They inform Naruto that he is the only member of their group to still be a
genin
, everyone else now either a
chūnin
 or, in some cases, a
jōnin
, and
Gaara
 has become the Fifth
Kazekage
. In
Sunagakure
, Gaara has a meeting with the village's council as they discuss rumours of an impeding
Akatsuki
 attack.
Yūra
 begins acting peculiar following the meeting just as cloaked individuals approach the village. He eliminates Sunagakure's border guards to grant the
Sasori
 and
Deidara
 passage. Sasori is glad to see Yūra has remained a loyal sleeper agent, and Deidara prepares to capture Gaara for the
tailed beast
 sealed within him.

Chapter 248

"
Suna's Welcome Attack…!!
" (
迎えうつ砂…!!
,
Mukaeutsu Suna…!!
)

Deidara
, riding a clay bird, eliminates
Sunagakure
's scouts keeping and eye out for him or other
Akatsuki
 personnel. When he infiltrates the village he is immediately confronted by
Gaara
, who knew that the bird was not a native of the area. Gaara wastes no time in attacking Deidara, dedicating great volumes of sand to try and crush him. Deidara's attempts at counterattacks are ineffective since Gaara's
Shield of Sand
 protects him from all incoming attacks. Although he is initially successful at avoiding Gaara, Deidara's left arm is ultimately crushed by Gaaras' sand.

Chapter 249

"
As Kazekage…!!
" (
風影として…!!
,
Kazekage Toshite…!!
)

While freeing himself from
Gaara
's sand,
Deidara
 notices that Gaara seems to have two sand sources: the sand of the desert surrounding them and a special kind used for defence and precision attacks. The
Sunagakure
 villagers watch the battle from the ground below,
Kankurō
 remembering Gaara's desire to protect the village and its inhabitants with his life. The villagers, no longer fearing Gaara as they once did, encourage him to defeat his opponent. Taking advantage of their presence, Deidara drops a
C3
 explosive on the village. Gaara shields the village from the explosion but, in his preoccupation, is almost hit by one of Deidara's clay explosives. His
Shield of Sand
 blocks it in time, but Gaara finds that Deidara has managed to hide explosives in this special sand. After they detonate, Gaara uses the last of his energy to make sure that the sand from their battle should not fall on the entire village before Deidara captures him.

Chapter 250

"
New Team, First Mission!!
" (
新チーム、初任務!!
,
Shin Chīmu, Hatsuninmu!!
)

Deidara
 takes
Gaara
's unconscious body and flies off.
Kankurō
 follows him while the other
Sunagakure
 forces regroup and send word to
Konoha
 of what has happened. Soon after Deidara reunites with
Sasori
 they are confronted by Kankurō, who is determined to save his brother. He brings out his three
puppets
, but Sasori has no difficulty blocking his first attack. In Konoha,
Naruto
 argues with
Tsunade
 over what kind of mission the reformed
Team 7
 should go on. When they hear of Gaara's kidnapping, Tsunade immediately assigns them to go to Sunagakure to assist in the rescue of the
Kazekage
.

Chapter 251

"
To Suna…!!
" (
砂へ…!!
,
Suna e…!!
)

Kankurō
 has been defeated, his
puppets
 destroyed. He makes one last attempt to strike
Sasori
; however, having created the puppets years ago, Sasori easily stops Kankurō. Having managed to poison Kankurō during the battle, Sasori leaves with
Deidara
, knowing Kankurō will die in three days' time. Kankurō loses consciousness and is collected by
Sunagakure
 forces sent to provide backup. Suna's
medical-nin
 can't cure him, but are able to learn that Kankurō's injuries were Sasori's doing. In
Konoha
,
Team 7
 prepares to depart.
Jiraiya
 speaks with
Naruto
 before he leaves, reminding him not to use
that technique
. As they head to Suna they encounter
Temari
, also on her way back to Suna.

Chapter 252

"
Feelings, Running Wild…!!
" (
想い、駆ける…!!
,
Omoi, Kakeru…!!
)

Team 7
 informs
Temari
 that
Gaara
 has been kidnapped by
Akatsuki
, so she joins them in rushing back to
Sunagakure
.
Naruto
 voices his disgust with Akatsuki for pursuing both Gaara and himself because they are
jinchūriki
, a horrible punishment for those who have been ostracised by others for their whole lives. Temari is glad that Naruto at least can relate to her little brother.
Sakura
 also notes that
Itachi
, who
Sasuke
 joined
Orochimaru
 in order to kill, is part of Akatsuki. She concludes that stopping Akatsuki is in the best interest of both Naruto and Sasuke. In Sunagakure,
Baki
 tries to get
Chiyo
 to cure the poisoned
Kankurō
. She has no interest until she discovers that the one who poisoned Kankurō was
Sasori
, her grandson.

Chapter 253

"
Reliable Reinforcements…!!
" (
頼れる加勢…!!
,
Tayoreru Kasei…!!
)

Despite her best efforts,
Chiyo
 can do nothing to help
Kankurō
. She suggests that only
Tsunade
 would be able to counteract
Sasori
's poison.
Team 7
 and
Temari
 arrive in
Sunagakure
 shortly afterwards and are informed of Kankurō's condition. Temari goes to see him and
Sakura
, Tsunade's disciple, offers to cure him. She removes the poison from his body and asks Chiyo to help her find ingredients for an antidote. Tsunade, meanwhile, is concerned that Team 7 may have difficulties with rescuing
Gaara
 so sends
Team Guy
 as backup.
