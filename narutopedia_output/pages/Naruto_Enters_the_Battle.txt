 anime.

Synopsis

With
Naruto
 and
B
 cleared to enter the war, the duo rush to the battlefields and quickly encounters
transformed
 members of the
White Zetsu Army
. They make short work of the opposition thanks to Naruto's
new ability
. Naruto sends several clones to the battle fronts. Naruto and B then arrive just to save
Musai
 and
Nonota
 from a reincarnated
Toroi
, who is promptly sealed. Meanwhile, the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
's compound is at a standstill with no one allowed to go near the central tent where
Shizune
 and
Sakura
 were conducting their autopsy. Through research they were able to gather more information which they pass along to HQ.

Elsewhere on the
Fourth Division
's battlefield, the
reincarnated

Kage
 draw ever closer to
Gaara
 and
Ōnoki
's location.
Alerted
 by
Mū
, that two persons were approaching, the Kage are greeted by an
enormous torrent
 of sand which the
Second Mizukage
 animatedly comments about. Believing it to be the work of
Shukaku
, the
Fourth Kazekage
 quickly stops the sand using his
Gold Dust
, causing the
Third Raikage
 to acknowledge him as a
Magnet Release

kekkei genkai
 wielder. Shocked to not see the beast before him but actually his son, three of the four Kage are captured by sand arms created by Gaara. Mū who was able to avoid capture, is however soon set upon by Ōnoki using the
Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique
 to which the previous
Tsuchikage
 responds in kind, the effects of which leaves a giant crater in the middle of the battlefield. Questioning his son as to where the One-Tail was as the rest of the Fourth Division lingered a ways back awaiting the signal, Gaara informs his father that he was no longer the
jinchūriki
 he had made him.

Trivia
