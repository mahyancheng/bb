Summary

Gaara
's defence proves stronger than
Kimimaro
's attack. Defeated, Kimimaro finds solace in that, when he dies, he will continue to live on in
Orochimaru
's heart. Gaara tells him he has been brainwashed and buries him underground. Kimimaro attacks again as he sinks, sprouting a field of bones from the ground, but Gaara protects himself and
Lee
 from damage. Kimimaro emerges from one of the bones, telling them he was not brainwashed and preparing another attack. He succumbs to his illness before he can follow through. Lee and Gaara discuss Kimimaro and how strong he was, which Gaara observes to have been because he fought for Orochimaru. Even if someone is evil, people who consider them precious will always fight for them. At the
Valley of the End
,
Naruto
 finally tracks
Sasuke
 down.
