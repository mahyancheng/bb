Fūka
 (
フウカ
) was a
kunoichi
 from the
group
 of grave robbers who had dug up four of the dead
Twelve Guardian Ninja
.

Personality

Fūka was portrayed as a seductive vixen as a way to lure her prey in and kill them with an
Execution by Kiss
. She would further speed up the process by giving her targets a choice between a French or traditional kiss. Her most preferable victims were those with a natural affinity for
wind

chakra
. She took great pride in her appearance and would become infuriated when any harm came to her physical being, especially her hair, the very casing of her soul. During her second fight  against
Naruto Uzumaki
, she showcased a sadistic side when she delighted in Naruto's anguish. She has shown an intelligent side as seen when she thought that Sora and Naruto were connected somehow.

1/2

Fūka was a fairly tall and beautiful woman of curvaceous form. She sported a light complexion, blue-eyes, and a beauty-mark under the left side of her lips. She had flowing maroon-coloured hair that reached her hips with bangs that parted slightly to the right of her forehead and framed the sides of her face. Like the rest of her team, she dressed in a qípáo-like garment. However, unlike her team-mates, who's attire was loose and full-bodied, her wardrobe was rather scantily-clad, revealing her shoulders and upper back while the rest was form fitting. Her attire was dark-pink colouring with a lining of purple, grey, and yellow, and a matching disconnected arm warmers that reached down to her light-purple spandex shorts. She wore a pair of black low-heeled boots that reached her calves.

Also, when angered enough, her body's face took on a more ghoulish nature with pronounced canine teeth. Her young and attractive form was seemingly nothing but a façade as her soul is housed within her hair; when void of an actual form, her hair becomes a floating mass and black faceless centre with two glowing yellow eyes. Upon sustaining injury, the sudden loss of body-control would result in a fragile, dull and considerably aged visage; this implies that she is much older than she portrays herself.

Abilities






Fūka using her Execution by Kiss technique on Naruto.



Fūka was a very powerful kunoichi, enough to attract
Kazuma
's attention as a subordinate. Alongside her allies, she easily broke through the outer defences of Konohagakure (albeit the main forces were tricked to being relocated elsewhere).

Physical Prowess






Fūka switching bodies in battle.



Because her body can only house just so much chakra, she has separated her consciousness from her actual body and stored it in her hair. At the same time, she has obtained five separate and identical bodies, each housing a different skill set. However, should one of the bodies be destroyed Fūka will completely lose access to the chakra and techniques stored within it. She can also take over the body of a live person to replace any bodies she lost, as she attempted to do so with Naruto's once she lost most of her spare vessels. From her consumption of countless ninja, she amassed a vast amount of chakra. In her second battle against Naruto, she showed considerable skill in taijutsu, able to initially knock him out with her assault.

Ninjutsu

Fūka possessed a strange artillery of techniques. She could make her hair
expand and constrict
 her foes. She could also
paralyse
 her targets through
simple eye contact
. She can also
camouflage
 herself to better sneak up on her foe. Her most fearsome ability is her
Execution by Kiss
. Once making lip-to-lip contact, she can suck the chakra and ultimately the very soul of her victim. This also affords her greater efficiency in her various techniques as well as access to the victim's techniques.
 In battle, she will seamlessly
switch
 between her different bodies stored in a scroll, which can also create the illusion of instantaneous healing and have access to a myriad of techniques at once.

Nature Transformation






Fūka unleashes powerful wind bursts.



Fūka's most noteworthy trait was her ability to use all five basic elements, a feat only few individuals have accomplished. By absorbing an individual's chakra through her kiss, she augments her own natural affinity for a said element by through the victim's own. This gives her a diverse array of ninjutsu. Using
Water Release
 she can unleash
assaulting water streams
 and
crashing waves
.






Fūka strengthening Earth Release with Water Release.



With
Earth Release
 she can generate
mudslides
,
erect spears
, and
move through the earth
. She can unleash a barrage of
fireballs
, unleash powerful
electrical streams
, or create powerful
wind bursts
. She also is skilled in combining the various elements to produce more potent assaults.

Part II

Twelve Guardian Ninja

Twelve Guardian Ninja






Fūka, Fuen, Fudō and Furido carrying out the grave robbery.



As part of
Furido
's plan to destroy Konoha, Fūka, along with her team-mates
Fuen
 and
Fudō
, proceeded in stealing the corpses of
Seito
,
Nauma
,
Kitane
 and
Tōu
. The four were part of the Twelve Guardian Ninja and were masters of the
Limelight
 technique. Their revival was crucial in Furido's plan to destroy Konoha, for their technique had enough potential to decimate ninja villages within seconds.
Team 7
, however, on their mission to the
Fire Temple
, were quickly informed by
Chiriku
 that his graves had been robbed. In turn, they ventured out into the landscape and began to chase down the robbers.

The grave robbers quickly caught onto their persecutors, which prompted them to
imprison
 and separate them to later dive in and head for the kill. With haste, the four scattered out into the labyrinth of pillars and found themselves against a set opponent. In due time, Fūka faced Naruto, and displayed her prominent use of all nature elements. Much to Naruto's surprise, Fūka offered to kiss him, and allowed him to choose between French and soft. Eventually, after successfully incapacitating Naruto, she
kissed him to steal his chakra
; however, she quickly pushed him away due to the evil chakra of the
Nine-Tails
. From there, she, along with the rest of her team, retreated.






Naruto killing Fūka with a Rasengan.



Days later, her team, along with the bodies of the four ninja guardians, made their way into the village. Once again, she is placed against Naruto. As they battled, Naruto noticed that Fūka was constantly switching bodies to perform different elemental techniques, and that her hair was of more importance to her than her body. In turn, he continuously attacked her hair (which destroyed her bodies) and left her in her purest state — a soul. As the battle came to a close, Naruto charged at her with a
Rasengan
 in hand, and she at him with her hair. The former managed to land his attack first, resulting in her quick demise from a blow to the head.
