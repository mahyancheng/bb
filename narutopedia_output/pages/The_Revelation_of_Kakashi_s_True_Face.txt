,
Nambā Sha no Sho: ~Kakashi Sugao Gokaichō
) is a manga-
omake
 included with the
Sha no Sho
.

Summary

Naruto
 secretly meets with the
ninken
 to ask them what
Kakashi
 looks like beneath his mask.
Pakkun
 is surprised by the secrecy, all of the ninken having seen it before and thus finding it unremarkable. Since Kakashi doesn't like to be photographed they have nothing to show Naruto, so they instead offer to describe Kakashi's face for him. Each provides wildly different descriptions until finally deciding that Pakkun's version is the most accurate. Elated, Naruto runs off to tell
Sakura
. After he leaves, Kakashi comes to see the ninken without his mask on. Seeing his face, they realise that the description they gave Naruto was completely wrong.

Trivia

This omake is the second of
three

omake
 about Kakashi's face.

As it turns out in the third omake, Kakashi's face resembles Pakkun's version the most, despite the ninken thinking it looks completely different.
