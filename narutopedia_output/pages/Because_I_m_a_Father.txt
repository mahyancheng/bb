"
Because I'm a Father
" (
父親だから
,
Chichi Oya Dakara
,
Viz:
 I'm His Father) is chapter 664 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

As the mysterious person makes their way closer to
Sasuke
, neither
Tobirama
 nor
Karin
 can recognise them, nor their
chakra
 signature. Worrying that the mysterious person intends to do harm to Sasuke, Karin presses on ahead. Meanwhile,
Guy
 is ready to continue fighting, though he is obviously extremely worn out. Suddenly,
Gaara
 and
Sakura
 fly overhead. Guy deduces that they will head for
Kakashi
's location, and gets even more determined to go, exasperating
Tenten
.
 While
Madara
 flies towards his destination, he gets rid of both the
Kohaku no Jōhei
 and
Benihisago
 noting that the tools were bogging him down. The tools land on Guy and
Lee
 and Tenten then recognises the tools. On the other side of the battlefield, Kakashi and
Minato
 still fight
Black Zetsu
 until Minato's
half
 of
Kurama
 urges him to
sense
 around. As the Kazekage's group arrives, Minato asks Kakashi to fight Obito alongside Gaara as the Hokage starts transferring his
tailed beast
 in
his son
, all the while remembering a conversation with his
wife
 over protecting their then-unborn child. Before he completes the ritual, however, Black Zetsu manages to extend his body and absorbs Kurama's power in Naruto's place. As he laughs over finally getting his hands on Yin-Kurama, Madara arrives to where Minato and the others are and states that Black Zetsu was taking too long so he decided to come himself.

Trivia

Tobirama is mistakenly depicted without the
black receivers
 in his back or head. However, this was not corrected in the tankōbon version.
