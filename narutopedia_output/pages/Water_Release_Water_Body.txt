This technique transforms the user's entire form into water and back at will, granting the user free control of their shape, including slipping through small cracks. This technique allows for high-level infiltration and stealth. By travelling down a target's mouth, even a recently deceased one, the user is also able to possess them, controlling the body's full range movements and actions as if their own personal body, even talking. Due to this form's fluid and malleable nature, physical attacks will harmlessly pass through them. However, this technique is very vulnerable to
Lightning Release
 and still vulnerable to chakra disruption by an opponent.
