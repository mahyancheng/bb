A secret technique of
Takigakure
 that allows the user to manipulate water into the form of a sword. While usually used for
close quarters
, this technique can, as demonstrated by Shibuki, be used for ranged assaults as well. This sword is also shown to be very resilient as it is able to withstand and cut through most
Fire Release
 techniques.
