 anime.

Synopsis

After
Rock Lee
 falls into a river during their training,
Tenten
 has a flashback of her youth, while waiting for him to surface. When she was a child, she had dreamed of becoming a strong kunoichi like her heroine:
Tsunade
, and thanks to
Guy
's guidance she initially began her path towards becoming a legendary
medical-nin
. However she failed during her training, while trying to
heal
 a fish. So she attempts to sign a contract to summon a creature like Tsunade's famed
slugs
, but without success because of the quarrel with
Ningame
, Guy's summon. After many failures, Guy notes that she had a talent for
Space–Time Ninjutsu
 and began honing her unique fighting style. After that she realised that she was a weapons specialist and vowed that instead of becoming just like Tsunade, she would still become a legendary kunoichi.

Trivia

In a scene where
Team Guy
 is eating fish, there are lanterns in the background with a pattern resembling the
Cursed Seal of Heaven
.
