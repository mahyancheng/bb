Naruto
. Boruto and Sasuke intend to return home the day after.
Sakura
 arrives and asks Sasuke about the blurred letter she recovered. Jiraiya lies and says they're fans of his books, the letter actually being a memo with information they gathered about him, and since he has connection to their group, the letter had Sasuke's name, and he knew Sakura's name. A mortified Sasuke goes along with the lie. Sakura leaves, and Naruto arrives, and is told of Boruto and Sasuke's imminent departure. The next day,
Karasuki
 emerges from its shell, ready to work again. Boruto hides it when Naruto arrives to say goodbye. Naruto gives him a farewell gift, but tells him not to open it yet.

 While in transit back to the present, Karasuki explains it's able to go to another era again, having absorbed some of the
Nine-Tails
' chakra when it leaked to recharge. It takes Boruto's suggestion of doing something it wants as a command after they leave. Back in the present, Konohamaru finds them. Sasuke informs Naruto of Urashiki's defeat, and credits Boruto with determining Urashiki's real target, which allowed them to intervene. Naruto tells Sasuke he should stay in the village a bit more, and despite still having to further investigate
Kaguya
