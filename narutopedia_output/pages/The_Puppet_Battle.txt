Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Kankurō
 battles
Urashiki
's
puppets
 to buy
Shinki
 and
Boruto
 more time. As the puppets increase in numbers, Kankurō summons
more

puppets
 to battle his foes. He is overwhelmed and decides to self-destruct his puppets to destroy the remaining enemies.
Temari
 and
Shikadai
 arrive at
Sunagakure
 where Temari dreads something bad has happened.

Boruto and Shinki see an explosion where Kankurō was fighting. Boruto fights with Shinki that they should go back and see if Kankurō is okay and assist him but Shinki advises against it as he states that
shinobi
 from
Sunagakure
 will do anything to protect one another even self-destructing their bodies to destroy the enemy for good. Boruto is angry that Shinki is cold about Kankurō's well-being and Shinki is angry about Boruto not being able to prioritise the mission first before lives.
Shukaku
 appears and tells Boruto how Shinki was similar to
Gaara
 until Gaara was saved by
Naruto
 who gave him a different path of instead of fight for hatred to fight to protect people and never give up on that. This surprises Boruto, who decides to go see if Kankurō is okay.

Temari and Shikadai meet up with
Yodo
 and
Araya
 where they inform them that Urashiki
teleported

Sasuke
 to another dimension and Shukaku was targeted. Temari orders them to continue escorting Gaara back to Sunagakure. Temari and Shikadai meet with Boruto, who is also there to find Kankurō. Temari deduces that Shinki and Boruto had an argument. She is touched by Boruto's dedication for Kankurō but reminds him that a shinobi must not let their emotions get the better in the mission. Shikadai notices a pile of the destroyed puppets and a hole next to it burrowing down in the sand. Temari, Boruto, and Shikadai go to search for Kankurō, but also fear something bad is happening to Shinki as well. Shinki is attacked by one of Urashiki's puppet where he goes out on full battle. Urashiki escapes from his
seal
, which Gaara senses.
