Miru
 (
美瑠
) was a kunoichi from
Kirigakure
 and a part of the village's
Cypher Division
.

Background






Miru falling victim to Kisame's blade.



Miru joined Kirigakure's Cypher Division in order to protect her fellow Kirigakure shinobi.
 During a mission,
Kisame Hoshigaki
 was tasked by his superior
Fuguki Suikazan
 to guard the division. Despite the protests of the other division members, Miru tried to establish a friendly relationship with Kisame, inviting him to eat with them. However, when the group was cornered by
Konoha
-nin under
Ibiki Morino
, she and the rest of the Cypher Division members were killed by Kisame to keep their intel from being leaked out through Ibiki's interrogation, as instructed by Fuguki. The horrified Miru was the last member to be killed by him, trying with her last breath to inquire the reason of his treachery.
 In the anime, she survived long enough for him to explain his actions, leading her to pity him before he gave her the final blow.

Personality

Miru has been described as being very protective of her dispute-loving fellow
shinobi
.
 She was a very kind and nice person in general, seen when she offered Kisame to eat with them despite the rest of her comrades seeing him as no more than a bodyguard. In the anime, she also invited him to eat with her after the mission and apparently bore no ill will for him after he explained his real mission, commenting with a faint smile on her face what a "terrible life" he's living.

Appearance

Miru was a young woman with long, brown hair and dark pupil-less eyes. Attire wise, she wore the same outfit as the other Cypher Division members — consisting of a dark green kimono with an undershirt and tied with a sash. She also wore the village's standard
forehead protector
.

Trivia

The kanji "美" in Miru's name means "beauty", while "瑠" is a part of the Japanese word "
ruri
 (
瑠璃
,
ruri
)", which means "
Lapis lazuli
".
