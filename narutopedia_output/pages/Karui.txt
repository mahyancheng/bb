Karui Akimichi
 (
秋道カルイ
,
Akimichi Karui
) is a
kunoichi
 from
Kumogakure
, and a member of
Team Samui
. She would later marry
Chōji Akimichi
 and immigrate to
Konohagakure
, thus becoming a member of the
Akimichi clan
.

Personality

Karui seems to have a somewhat comedically antagonistic relationship with her teammate
Omoi
. During their début, they argued over the possible reasons that the Raikage could have called them. She assumed that he wanted them to get him more protein shakes. However, the argument started with Omoi, implying that she is flat-chested in comparison to their other teammate,
Samui
. Like the rest of her team, she highly respects Killer B and was steadfast in her pursuit of revenge against Sasuke.

Karui is also quite combative, outspoken, stubborn, and impulsive, allowing her emotions to come out, as she angrily yelled at
Team Kakashi
 for allowing the renegade Sasuke to run loose. She came to a violent point when she took out her rage on
Naruto Uzumaki
 and beat him without hesitation,
 though Omoi later said she felt remorse for doing so.

As a mother, Karui seems more laid-back when it comes to her daughter
Chōchō
's training, questioning the necessity for her to learn techniques in times of peace.

Appearance

Karui is a dark-skinned kunoichi with long spiky red hair and amber eyes. As noted by Omoi in Part II, she was flat-chested. She wears a long, short-sleeved dress with frilly edges complete with the Kumogakure
flak jacket
, two simple yellow earrings, fishnet stockings, thigh-high boots with white soles and a
forehead protector
 which she wears like a bandanna. She also carries a long sword on her back.

As an adult, Karui sports a more feminine figure and her hair has grown fairly longer. Her attire now consists of a long sleeveless dark dress held closed by a white obi. She also no longer wears her forehead protector, and sets her hair in a more neat, back-comb style. Karui has dangling earrings in the same colour as her previous ones. In the anime, however, Karui does not wear earrings.

Abilities






Karui using Lightning Release.



As a
chūnin
, Karui is undoubtedly a capable kunoichi. She has demonstrated great teamwork skills, able to coordinate attacks with her partner Omoi without either needing to communicate.
 In terms of fighting style, Karui mainly relies on
kenjutsu
, wielding a long katana in battle. Being trained by Killer B, she is quite skilled in kenjutsu. She could effectively defeat several
White Zetsu
 clones with a
frontal slash
. In the anime, she can use
Lightning Release
.

Team Samui preparing to depart to Konoha.



In her first appearance, she and Omoi argued over the possible reasons that they could have been summoned by the Raikage. Omoi thought he was going to be scolded for putting mayonnaise on his potatoes; the argument started, however, when Omoi suggested that Samui's back problems stemmed from her large breasts, something Karui doesn't need to worry about, due to her being flat-chested. Karui and her teammates are tasked with getting intel on Sasuke and Akatsuki from Konoha.

Later, after Naruto's victory over
Nagato
, Karui and her team were seen travelling to Konoha, when Omoi worried that, once they got there, a girl would fall for him and, once he had to leave, she would commit suicide out of loneliness. During that short argument with him, Karui threw a rock at him. While Omoi worried that she could have buried Konoha had she caused an avalanche, Karui angrily yelled that he overreacted too much. After they arrived at Konoha, they were shocked to find a giant crater in its place (caused by Pain's
Shinra Tensei
 shortly before his battle with Naruto). Omoi blamed Karui for the crater being there, while Samui said they should ask someone for information on what had happened.

Karui and Omoi overheard Naruto,
Sai
 and
Sakura Haruno
 talking about
Sasuke Uchiha
, so they attacked Naruto, Sakura and Sai. Later, they explained that Sasuke had attacked and captured their sensei, and that he is an Akatsuki member. Karui then insulted Sakura and asked her what Sasuke is to her. Unable to find an answer to the question, Sakura cries, but Karui was stopped by Sai pointing out that they should not pressure and blame her, before Naruto managed to calm them both down by saying that their master is most likely still alive.






Karui assaulting Naruto.



Later, Karui and Omoi attempted to get Naruto talking about Sasuke, but Naruto refused, not wanting to sell him out and cause chains of hatred. Wondering what to do with their hatred, Naruto told them to take out their hatred on him by beating him up, which Karui did. Karui continued beating up Naruto until Sai interfered. She then threatened to beat up Sai too, but was stopped by Omoi. Samui arrived, and asked Karui and Omoi to help her copy down all of the Konoha's information on Akatsuki and Sasuke.

Once they left, Omoi wondered if Naruto was alright. Karui angrily told him to be quiet, through which Omoi could tell that Karui cared as well. She watched when Naruto pleaded with the Raikage not to go after Sasuke. Karui is seen welcoming back the Raikage,
Killer B
,
C
 and
Darui
 after the
Kage Summit
, and she is relieved that her master is safe.

new form
, which greatly angered him. As Tatewaki recognised Naruto from three years ago, he asked what became of the
two

children
 he was protecting. Naruto and the reincarnated samurai clash, Naruto tells him that the children survived and are living happily. Relieved to hear this, Tatewaki suddenly dropped his sword. Now free of regrets, Tatewaki no longer had any emotional bonds to this world, letting him break the summoning contract and return to the afterlife.

After B had regained enough chakra and flew towards the
Ten-Tails

Later, Karui begrudgingly watched her husband and daughter eat in a food competition. When the dumplings began growing endlessly, Karui joined her family in fighting them off to no avail.

There's nothing wrong with him eating what he wants. People die when the time comes anyway. I think the proper question is why we're eating this sort of thing so early in the morning.
