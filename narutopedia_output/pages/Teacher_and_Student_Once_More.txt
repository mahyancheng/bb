 manga.

Summary

Sakura
 tries to convince
Sasuke
 to let her accompany him, even if it means destroying
Konoha
. He agrees if she will finish off
Karin
. Sakura approaches her and tries to come up with a good way to kill Sasuke, but Karin alerts her to Sasuke's own attempts to kill her. She is saved by
Kakashi
. Kakashi, as Sasuke's teacher, offers to kill him so that Sakura doesn't need to and to redeem himself for not stopping the situation sooner, remembering how
Hiruzen
 had to do the same with
Orochimaru
. Sakura heals Karin while Kakashi makes one last attempt to convince Sasuke to give up on revenge. He refuses, so they prepare for battle.

Trivia

Sasuke and Kakashi had not seen each other since Kakashi left for his mission after lecturing Sasuke in
chapter 177
, which means that the two went the longest without reuniting amongst the members of
Team 7
.
