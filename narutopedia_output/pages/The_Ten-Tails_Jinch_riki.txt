Summary

With
Obito
's cry resounding throughout the battlefield,
Madara
 muses that he had once told Obito that eventually, he would have to repay the legendary
Uchiha
 for saving his life. Noting Madara's intentions,
Hashirama
 tells both
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 to deal with Obito since they were the closest to him. As a contingency plan, Hashirama and
Tobirama
 create
wood
 and
shadow clones
 respectively to take on Madara in case it was too late to stop Obito. Meanwhile, Obito — whose hair was beginning to become thinner, and greyer due to the
Outer Path: Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 — begins to reminisce his life as part of
Team Minato
. Sasuke, riding atop
Aoda
, begins to slither on the
Ten-Tails
 to get close to Obito, and launches a
black arrow
 only to be retaliated by the
chakra receivers
 jutting out of the latter.
Minato
 — having formed a shadow clone himself —
teleports
 to Obito, who was reminiscing about the advice of his former sensei, and cuts him down. With shock, Minato realises that Obito had been the one who orchestrated the
destruction
 of
Konohagakure
. As Sasuke notes that only Madara was left to be sealed to end the war, Obito simply smirked at their plan as it is revealed he had prevented Madara's control much to the surprise of Naruto, Sasuke and Minato, who had regrouped after witnessing the escape of the Ten-Tails and Obito's transformation as he became the Ten-Tails'
jinchūriki
.
