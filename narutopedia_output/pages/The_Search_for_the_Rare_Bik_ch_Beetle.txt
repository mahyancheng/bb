"
The Search for the Rare Bikōchū Beetle
" (
超追尾力に赤丸も嫉妬!幻の微香虫を探せ
,
Chō-tsuibiryoku ni Akamaru mo shitto! Maboroshi no Bikōchū o Sagase
) is episode 148 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Hinata
,
Shino
 and
Kiba
 visit
Kurenai Yūhi
 at the hospital and Hinata faints after getting too close to
Naruto
 who was frustrated by
Mizuki
's inability to lead him to either
Sasuke
 or
Orochimaru
. Naruto began pestering
Tsunade
 to allow him to go look for him. Hinata sympathised with Naruto, and suggested trying to find a way to help him. Shino commented that a
bikōchū
, a very rare insect, would be able to track down Sasuke if it smelled his scent. As Kurenai was hospitalised for injuries that she had suffered during the prison break, Shino was tasked with leading
Team 8
 to find the bikōchū, and Naruto joined with them as the fourth member. It was also revealed that Hinata was practising a new defensive technique, having nearly mastered it, and was seen training completely nude at a waterfall by Naruto at night, though he did not recognise her. He falls into the water, and Hinata vanishes before he can identify her. The next morning Naruto told Kiba about the "ultra-pretty" girl he saw, embarrassing Hinata greatly. As they arrived at the location where the bikōchū is, they were unaware that the
enemy group
 were also searching the bikōchū.
