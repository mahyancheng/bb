The
Bikōchū Search Team
 (
微香虫探索チーム
,
Bikōchū Tansaku Chīmu
,
literally meaning:
 Minute Scent Insect Search Team)
 was a
genin
 team, assigned to locate the rare
bikōchū
 beetle, which could track any target as long as it had the target's scent, in hopes of locating
Sasuke Uchiha
.

History

The team was made-up of all members from
Team Kurenai
, with the exception of
Kurenai Yūhi
, who was replaced with
Naruto
 due to her being hospitalised from a previous
mission
, giving the leadership of the team to
Shino
. During their mission, the team clashed against
Jibachi
,
Kurobachi
 and
Suzumebachi
 — members from the
Kamizuru clan
, who were also in search for the beetle. Even though the team successfully located their target, Naruto accidentally farted, causing the beetle to memorise the latter's scent and making the
mission
 a failure.
