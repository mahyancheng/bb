Eye Mind Reading
 is a technique that allows the user to read another's mind.

Usage

By subtly weaving signs with their eye, the user can delve into the mind of their target without them noticing — even on a target that is currently
infiltrating
 the user's mind. The user is also able to perform this on themself to dive deeply into their own memories and restore or remove information in their own mind and others.

Trivia

While he was not actually seen using it, Hanare offered to let
Kakashi
 use it on her to see if she was telling the truth.
