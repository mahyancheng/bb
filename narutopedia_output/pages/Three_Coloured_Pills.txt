The
Three Coloured Pills
 are secret medicines used by the
Akimichi clan
. As the name suggests, there are three pills, each with a different colour. First is the green
Spinach Pill
 (
ホウレン丸
,
Hōrengan
),
 next is the yellow
Curry Pill
 (
カレー丸
,
Karēgan
), and last is the red
Chilli Pill
 (
トンガラシ丸
,
Tongarashigan
).

By forcibly converting the body's fat reserves into chakra, each successive pill ingested gives a tremendous power boost. The Chilli Pill is even said to increase one's power a hundred times. However, the pills have a drawback. Each pill damages the body, poisoning it, and since the third pill converts all of one's fat reserves, the user will become dangerously emaciated. It is said that after the third pill, death is imminent.
 However, the
Nara clan
 has apparently done
extensive research
 on the pills, and that knowledge allowed the
Fifth Hokage
 to neutralise the poison and repair the damage to
Chōji Akimichi
, after he took all three pills to fight and kill
Jirōbō
. The pills allow for easier use of the Akimichi clan's
calorie control
.
