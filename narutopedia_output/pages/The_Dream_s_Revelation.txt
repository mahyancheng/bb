Boruto
,
Denki
,
Shikadai
, and
Iwabee
 watch a movie about Kagemasa. The four discuss the movie at dinner, and compare it to actual life as a shinobi. Riding the train, Boruto and Shikadai discuss the
spectre
 only Boruto can see. At home, Boruto creates a few shadow clones to overview the incidents so far. Boruto still doesn't want to tell Naruto about it. Boruto goes out to eat and meets Shikadai, who suggests maybe he's awakening the
Byakugan
.
Mitsuki
 reveals himself, agreeing that Boruto should find out more about the Byakugan.
 That night, Boruto has a dream, where the star-gazing figure tells him his eye will be important, with promises of an awesome fate. When he wakes up, remembering the dream, Boruto notices his sight is different, and manages to catch a glimpse of his eye on the mirror. Boruto gets excited about it.
Shikamaru
 hands
Naruto
 a report about the incidents, and they wonder if Boruto, who was near every one, is involved or is a target. Tired, Naruto goes home. There Boruto is confident he's awakened the Byakugan. The others are sceptical of it, angering Boruto.
Hinata
 tells him to talk with his grandfather, who will know if Boruto really has the Byakugan. Shikadai, Denki, and Mitsuki discuss the possibility of Boruto having the Byakugan. Naruto takes Boruto and
Himawari
 to the
Hyūga
 compound, where
Hiashi
 and
