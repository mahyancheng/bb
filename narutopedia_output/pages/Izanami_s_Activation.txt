Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Regenerating,
Itachi
 called out to
Sasuke
 as
Kabuto
 moved to implant his talisman to rewrite Itachi's mind. Responding, Sasuke threw his
sword
 at Kabuto. Kabuto caught the sword with his navel-snake, and dodged the grasp of Sasuke's
Susanoo
. Sasuke launched a
fireball
 at Kabuto who countered it with a large
torrent
 of water which swept Sasuke off his feet. Through the mist created from the two clashing techniques, Kabuto noticed that Itachi, whom he stabbed with the sword for him disappeared into a flurry of crows and attack Kabuto with the sword he took from him. Chastising him for using the same attack pattern he had used before to cut his horn off, to which Itachi rebuffs that he cannot be harmed also refuting Kabuto's claims that
genjutsu
 cannot affect him, stating that it already had. This sequence of events repeats itself once again until Kabuto begins to notice the
déjà vu
, regardless of what he did differently. It was ultimately revealed that the entire battle was taking place within Kabuto's head, as he was trapped within
Izanami
.
