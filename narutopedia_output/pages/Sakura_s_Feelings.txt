"
Sakura's Feelings
" (
サクラの想い
,
Sakura no Omoi
) is episode 206 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As the
Five Kage Summit
 comes to a close,
Mifune
 decides to appoint A, the
Fourth Raikage
, as the leader of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
.
Gaara
 and the
Fifth Mizukage
 do not protest the decision, and shortly after, the
Third Tsuchikage
 decides to acquiesce. They decide to tell their respective
daimyō
 about the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 that has been launched as well as the news regarding their alliance. Gaara heads out to find
Naruto
 and
Kakashi
, whom A tells him are still in the
Land of Iron
, while A himself leaves with
C
 and
Darui
 to find his brother,
Killer B
.
Kurotsuchi
 secretly suggests that
Iwagakure
 kill B and Naruto, in order to remove two essential pieces from
Madara
's plan, while crippling the military power of
Konoha
 and
Kumo
 simultaneously. However, to her surprise, the
Tsuchikage
 tells her that Gaara had reminded him of who he used to be and thus he does not wish to resort to sneaky, conniving tactics and instead intends to cooperate with the other nations.

Elsewhere,
Sakura
 professes her love for Naruto, shocking
Yamato
 and
Lee
. She tells Naruto that she has grown to love him and has given up on
Sasuke
, who is nothing but a mere criminal who has joined the
Akatsuki
. Recalling how Sakura had
told him
 that she was desperate for Sasuke's love, how she cried when she thought Sasuke was
dead
, and how she
tearfully asked
 him to bring Sasuke back home, Naruto realises that Sakura is lying to him and admonishes her for her sense of humour. Sakura attempts to convince him that she truly does love him, citing that she, along with the villagers, stopped viewing him as a mischievous annoyance when he became their hero after defeating
Pain
. Naruto hisses that he hates people who lie to themselves and forcefully tells her to stop. Irritated, Sakura states that he cannot tell her how she feels and that he does not need to honour the promise between them anymore and that he should give up on Sasuke. Naruto attempts to tell them the truth behind
Itachi
 to justify Sasuke's actions, but is stopped by Kakashi. Naruto merely states that he understands Sasuke's pain now and that he is making it his personal ambition to save his friend. Defeated, Sakura walks away, ordering
Kiba
,
Sai
 and Lee to follow her back to the village; however, once of earshot, she asks Kiba to track Sasuke down for her. Unbeknownst to Sakura, Sai creates an
ink clone
 that he leaves behind with Naruto, Yamato, and Kakashi.

Meanwhile, Killer B attempts to train in enka with
Sabu
, but their session is crashed by
Kisame
, who had been sent to retrieve the
Eight-Tails
'
jinchūriki
. B
infuses
 his
Lightning Release

chakra
 into his pencil as well as his
swords
, but Kisame's sword
Samehada
 devours the chakra, rendering the attacks useless. Transforming into his
four-tailed form
, B
headbutts
 Kisame, but the latter is unaffected by it.
