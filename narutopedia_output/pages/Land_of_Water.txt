The Land of Water.



The
Land of Water
 (
水の国
,
Mizu no Kuni
) also known as the "Land of Mist" (
霧の国
,
Kiri no Kuni
).
 It is composed of many islands, with each having its own unique traditions. The country's weather is typically cool and the islands are usually covered by mist. The islands themselves also feature many lakes. In some places, like the area where
Haku
 grew up, it is very cold and snows quite a bit. The nation is oriented towards the element of
water
. Its government leader is the
Water Daimyō
.

Little is currently known about the country and it apparently leaves itself out of most political affairs, which is understandable considering that it is composed of vast islands relatively remote from the continent containing the other four major countries. What is known, however, is that the country used to be ravaged by many civil wars, during which clans with
kekkei genkai
 were used extensively, causing many to view them as harbingers of war and death, leading to purges and genocide to the point of parents killing their own children. Many clans went into hiding, such as the
Yuki clan
. The
Funato clan
, one of the oldest clans of the Land of Water, has always been at odds with the country and Kirigakure in regards to their goals to pacify the seas, leading to many plunders and internal conflicts. Fifteen years after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, the Land of Water grew uneasy with the
Land of Waves
 and
Land of the Sea
 over their continued expansion, to the point of not wanting to sign a treaty that would give them further stability, even against the wishes of Kirigakure, who would also benefit from more stability.
