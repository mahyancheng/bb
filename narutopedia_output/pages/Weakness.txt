 manga.

Summary

With
Sasuke
 immobilised in clay,
Deidara
 traps him in a sphere of
C4
 bombs. Sasuke manages to escape but quickly starts to disintegrate. This is, once again, a
genjutsu
, and the real Sasuke attacks Deidara. Sasuke explains that he earlier discovered that
lightning
 neutralises Deidara's explosives. By using
Chidori
 on himself, he removed the threat the microscopic bombs he inhaled posed. Sasuke owes his survival to the Sharingan.
