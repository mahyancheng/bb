Third Hokage
 considers disqualifying him, but the
Fourth Kazekage
 suggests postponing the match since so many members of the audience are looking forward to it. The fight between
Shino
 and
Kankurō
 is to take place but Kankurō, having expected the
Konoha Crush
 to begin before his match, forfeits so that he doesn't need to reveal his

 takes place instead. When Shikamaru shows little enthusiasm, Temari attacks him.
