Hebihime
 is a
shinobi
 of
Otogakure
, and one of the recruitable characters in
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Online
.

Personality

Hebihime is notably confident, while she was surprised at the player's ability to break out of her genjutsu, she was still sure of her ability to eliminate them. She is shown to be somewhat delusional, upon meeting her a second time, she states that her enemy ran away last time despite having actually defeated her in their previous encounter.

Appearance

A woman with long black hair, wearing a formal yellow and purple kimono, Hebihime has dark eyes and pale skin.

Abilities

Hebihime seems to possess potent
genjutsu
 abilities.

Plot Overview

First encountered in the mission "Maid's Genjutsu", Hebihime is a guard at one of
Orochimaru
's bases. Having thought nobody would ever find the base, she still readily defends it with powerful genjutsu, summoning images of
Hashirama
 and
Tobirama Senju
 to hold off the
Konoha
 ninja infiltrating. When these illusions failed, she entered the battle herself with a pair of guards but was ultimately defeated.

She later reappears in the mission "Orochimaru's End", where she is once again set to guard a
Otogakure
 base, this time accompanied by multiple giant snakes. She is once again defeated.

Trivia

Her name literally means "snake princess".

Before being encountered in the story, multiple Hebihime-type enemies are encountered as generic foes in the game.

Hebihime bears a strong resemblance to the anime-only character
Kotohime
, likely being inspired by her design.
