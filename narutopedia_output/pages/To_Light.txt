Lyrics

Rōmaji

Rou takaku noboru hikari,

Wakitachi taru omoi,

Mamorubeki ryuu no michi yo,

Shiraha sasu sora wo aogi.

Suna, kaze, arabu tomo,

Sakihokoru kou no hi yo hana ni maichiran.

Rasen ni tsutau hikari,

Ryuu no te wo tatsu niwa e,

Arishi hi no omokage yo,

Towa no uta wo kokoro tsunagi.

Ten, ran, madou tomo,

Moe sakaru ware no hi yo yami wo kirisakan.

Rou takaku noboru hikari,

Nagaruru toki kioku,

Ayumubeki ikiru michi wo,

Yue ni ikiru sora o aogi.

English

The light rising above the tower,

Thoughts boil and run high,

Dragon path to be protected,

Pierce with shining blade look at the sky.

Sand, wind may rage proud blossoming,

Bright sun dance in flowers and never will it die.

The light flowing in spirals,

To the garden where the dragon's claws ends,

Shadows of the olden days.
