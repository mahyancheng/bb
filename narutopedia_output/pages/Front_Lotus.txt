The user delivers an upward kick to their opponent, sending them high into the air. The user
follows
 the opponent along their upward trajectory, taking tight hold of them so that they can't move or escape;
Rock Lee
 wraps opponents with the bandages he wears to help in this regard. Once they've reached the peak of the initial kick's arc, the user begins a spinning motion and propels them headfirst towards the ground.
 The user releases the opponent right before impact and retreats to safety, leaving the opponent to collide with the ground alone. Because the Front Lotus requires at least one of the
Eight Gates
 be opened, users are likely to be fatigued afterwards and thus vulnerable to attack. For this reason,
Might Guy
 mandates that Lee only use the Front Lotus to protect something or someone important.

Trivia

In the anime, Lee was eventually able to perform this technique without any strain on his body.
