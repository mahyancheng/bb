The user first infuses a target's shadow with their own
chakra
. The user then flattens themselves to paper-like thinness and merges with the target's shadow, giving them complete control over the target's mind and body. The user must hold their breath in order to maintain this control.

Jiraiya
 uses this technique on
Ryūsui
 with the intention of exploring
Amegakure
 and gathering intel, but he is quickly spotted by
Konan
 speaking to a
toad
. Although Konan immediately knows that it's Jiraiya because of what she overhears, she focuses her attacks on Ryūsui's body, evidently believing him to be Jiraiya in disguise despite her prior knowledge of this technique.
 In this way, the controlled body is useful as a shield,
 and while it's taking attacks meant for the user, the user is able to prepare their own attacks unnoticed.

To release this technique, users inhale deeply, causing their body to inflate back to its normal thickness.
 Their targets simultaneously regain control of their body and senses, with no apparent memory of what happened while they were being controlled.

Trivia

Jiraiya maintains his original outline while posing as Ryūsui's shadow, with the large scroll he carries on his back still plainly visible.

Jiraiya has also been shown flattening his body in order to hide against a wall.
