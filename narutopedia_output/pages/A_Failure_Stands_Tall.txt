Synopsis

Pulling back
Hinata
's sleeve,
Neji
 reveals that he has hit several points on her arm called
tenketsu
, special pressure points that produce and maintain the flow of chakra, during their close combat. With all of them tapped, Hinata's chakra flow to her hand is effectively cut off and her blow to Neji's heart has no effect. Neji continues his assault, but Hinata continues to stand up, inspired by
Naruto
. She tells Neji that she believes he is suffering more by fighting his destiny. Angered, Neji attempts a fatal blow, but four observing
jōnin
 halt him. Hinata collapses into cardiac arrest shortly after, and Naruto vows to avenge her.
