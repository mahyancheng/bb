"
Hot-Blooded Confrontation: Student vs. Sensei
" (
涙の激突!　熱血師弟対決
,
Namida no Gekitotsu! Nekketsu Shitei Taiketsu
) is episode 196 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Guy
 is trapped inside a pagoda made out of
kung fu training dummies
 while
Naruto
,
Neji
,
Tenten
 and a recently arrived
Lee
 fight off the dummies outside. It is revealed that the
impostor student
 and his two brothers want revenge for Guy defeating their
father
 and badly wounding him, causing him to be unable to train or take
missions
 and eventually die. Lee enters, and is trapped in a
technique
 that causes him and Guy to mistake the other for a hostile training dummy. The two see through the technique, and simultaneously use the
Hidden Lotus
 to destroy their own dummies without harming each other, wrecking the pagoda. Guy then tells the brothers that their father respected him and wanted another match for him, and that he wanted them to fight him fairly, allowing them to understand their father's dying wish.
