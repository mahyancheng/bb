Nemui
 (
ネムイ
) is a
genin
 of
Kumogakure
.

Background

During the finals of the
Chūnin Exams
, Nemui was pitted against
Itachi Uchiha
 in the semi-final round. His fighting style gave Itachi trouble, as it allowed him to dodge his attacks and made
genjutsu
 ineffective. Eventually, Itachi found an opening in which to cast genjutsu on Nemui. After using genjutsu during each opening, Nemui becomes too traumatised to continue the match, granting Itachi a victory.

Personality

True to his personality and nickname, he is presumed to be a lazy shinobi, or just a sleepyhead. However, he is also cowardly in nature, and that fear renders him unable to fight effectively while awake.

Abilities

Nemui's core skill is his ability to fight while sleeping. In order to fight effectively, Nemui intentionally falls asleep during battle. While asleep, he is able to fight with such proficiency that even Itachi had difficulty keeping up with him. Also, he is immune to any jutsu involving eye contact, such as
Sharingan-based genjutsu
. Nemui's fighting style has one major weakness: he must wake up periodically to maintain awareness of the battle. During those periods, opponents have an opening to attack.

Trivia

"Nemui" (
眠い
) means "sleepy" or "drowsy", alluding to his fighting style and nickname.
