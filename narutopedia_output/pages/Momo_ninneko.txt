Momo finds
Kiba Inuzuka
,
Akamaru
, and
Shino Aburame
 wandering around Sora-ku. He observes them unnoticed for a while before finally confronting them to find out their intentions. He immediately disapproves of them because Kiba smells like a dog, Akamaru
is
 a dog, and Shino is dressed suspiciously. Momo suggests that they leave. When Kiba and Akamaru try to capture him, he stops them with his
Flea Shuriken
. When Kiba tries to attack him again, Momo escapes using a
Cat Food Clone
.

Momo offers to help them find what they're looking for in exchange for
matatabi
, expecting that they won't have any. While it's true that they have none, Kiba has some
soldier pills
 that produce an effect similar to matatabi. Embarrassed by his body's reaction to the soldier pills and determined to not be helpful, Momo runs away. He ends up running into
Tamaki
, caretaker of Sora-ku's cats. She scolds Momo when she finds out how inhospitable he's been and escorts Kiba, Akamaru, and Shino to the
beekeeper
 they've been looking for. Momo disapproves of how friendly Kiba is towards Tamaki, and takes some comfort in the fact that they will probably become lost in the grove where the beekeeper lives.
