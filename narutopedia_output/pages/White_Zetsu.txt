White Zetsu
 (
白ゼツ
,
Shiro Zetsu
) was half of the
Akatsuki
 member
Zetsu
 (
ゼツ
,
Zetsu
), the other being
Black Zetsu
. He was one of the first victims of
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
's
Infinite Tsukuyomi
, and was eventually pulled from the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 by Black Zetsu,
 and infused with the
DNA
 of
Hashirama Senju
 by
Madara Uchiha
.

Background






White Zetsu and Tobi overseeing Obito's rehabilitation.



White Zetsu was originally one of the victims of Kaguya Ōtsutsuki's Infinite Tsukuyomi, who was transformed after being
tethered
 to the
God Tree
 over the course of years and ultimately stored within the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path. After Madara Uchiha
summoned
 the statue and cultivated Hashirama Senju's DNA into a
large flowering tree
, Black Zetsu removed White Zetsu and the other victims from inside the husk, leading Madara to believe they were artificial humans created by the statue's
chakra
 and Hashirama's DNA.
 White Zetsu and other mutated humans were then tasked with intelligence gathering before he and a
spiral-patterned Zetsu
 were entrusted with looking after the rehabilitating
Obito Uchiha
. Over time, the duo became friends with the young Uchiha.

When Obito's rehabilitation was near completion, White Zetsu returned to the
base
 and informed Obito that
Kakashi Hatake
 and
Rin Nohara
 were being attacked by
Kirigakure
 shinobi. When the spiral-patterned Zetsu offered to help Obito by encasing himself around the young Uchiha in order to enable him to leave the cave, White Zetsu served to guide Obito telepathically with the information he received from other Zetsu stationed outside.
 When they returned to Madara, White Zetsu assured him that no one had seen them and relayed information on what had happened after the arrival of
Konoha
 reinforcements, noting that Obito didn't kill Kakashi.

When Madara was on the verge of death, he
imbued
 Black Zetsu into White Zetsu's right half, believing the former was a manifestation of his
will
.
 Zetsu later accompanied Obito to
Amegakure
 to locate
Nagato
, who had unknowingly been given Madara's
Rinnegan
 as a child, and watched as Obito introduced himself using Madara's identity.

Personality

Unlike Black Zetsu, White Zetsu, nicknamed "Chatterbox" (
饒舌
,
Jōzetsu
), was carefree and playful with a habit of teasing others, traits shared by his clone siblings.
 In the Japanese version of the manga, White Zetsu used
kanji
 and
kana
 regularly. This was often conveyed in the anime through a higher-pitched voice. While he and Black Zetsu sometimes had differing opinions, the two halves were still able to function as a single entity.

White Zetsu appeared to be extremely trustworthy, obedient and loyal, being entrusted with Akatsuki's secrets and knowledge of Madara's
Eye of the Moon Plan
, which he believed to be beneficial to mankind.
 Because of his ties to Madara, White Zetsu worked with Obito for a long time, originally helping him find and convince Nagato to join them. He was shown to be quite friendly to most Akatsuki members, indicated by how he was saddened that so many had died in a conversation about them with Tobi; in the anime, one of his clones freed a captured Deidara, saying he was a fun guy to be around in Akatsuki. Though he annoyed Obito at first, White Zetsu eventually won the boy's friendship.
 Like
Tobi
, White Zetsu believed Madara was a good man at heart and saw no harm in helping Obito without Madara's permission.

Zetsu's main role within Akatsuki was to function as a spy, with other duties that were similar to those of a
hunter-nin
. He was able to control his body and take part in the
tailed beast

sealing ritual
 simultaneously, which, in addition to being unique to him, allowed him to act as a lookout while the sealing took place.
 When an agent of Akatsuki, or possibly even a member, died, Zetsu was sent to devour their bodies so as to not have their secrets revealed, further adding to his nature as a half-
plant
 creature.
 Zetsu was also the one sent to retrieve the rings of dead Akatsuki members.
 Due to the role he played, Zetsu was the only member of Akatsuki to act without a partner on a regular basis. He operated on his own, often moving between the different locations where the other Akatsuki members were located. This resulted in other members reporting directly to him, rather than the figurehead leader,
Pain
. Zetsu would in turn report directly to Pain as well as Obito, the organisation's benefactor and eventual leader.

When together, the two Zetsu were easily distinguished by the two
Venus flytrap
-like extensions that emerged from their sides, enveloping their head and upper body as a shell, which they were able to open and close. Beneath these extensions, White Zetsu had short green hair and a single yellow eye. The right half of his body was covered by Black Zetsu, whose leg was originally White Zetsu's own right leg. Under their Akatsuki cloak, they wore blue pants and sandals, and had both legs wrapped in bandages. Zetsu's green Akatsuki ring, which bore the kanji for "sign of the boar" (
亥
,
gai
), was worn on Black Zetsu's little finger. In the anime, Zetsu's fingernails were painted pink and his toenails, as seen in his
début
, were blue.

Unlike Black Zetsu, White Zetsu had human-like facial features and a proper eye, as well as unusually rounded teeth. When he was first awakened by Madara, his Venus flytrap-like protrusions were not fully formed, being white in colour as well as sticking out all along the right side of his body. When the two halves split apart, their plant-like extensions would separate and hang from the waists of both. Any clothing they were wearing, including their Akatsuki mantle, would split along with them, usually causing them to discard their torn clothing. When either of the halves
emerged
 from the ground while split, their plant-like extensions would surround them in a circular formation. The two also demonstrated the ability to grow an additional leg, though deformed, from their white body mass to substitute for their missing half while split.

Abilities

White Zetsu was described by Obito as not being a "front line fighter"
 and thus never directly participated in battles. However, by using several supporting abilities, he proved to be of great use for his
allies
 and
master
.

Ninjutsu

In addition to functioning as a single entity with Black Zetsu by communicating through thoughts, White Zetsu was able to split his body in two, allowing them to act independently. While separated, the two halves could extend roots underground to communicate with each other over long distances.






Zetsu physically splitting in two.



He was able to create and remotely communicate with near-identical
clones
 of himself, which could
absorb
 a person's chakra. With his
Spore Technique
, White Zetsu was able to plant these clones on the bodies of others in the form of spores, which were undetectable even to
sensor type
 and
Kage
-level shinobi. Once activated, these spores would grow into a white mass which surrounded the individuals they formed on and absorb their chakra while restricting their movements. The clones could also use this stolen chakra to
replenish
 an ally's chakra supply by attaching themselves to him or her.
 Obito had White Zetsu attach several of these spores to
Sasuke Uchiha
 in order to monitor and even assist him when necessary.

Substitute Technique

White Zetsu claimed to have the best transformation technique and was able to freely alter his form and chakra signature.
 Doing so allowed him to become or create a completely indistinguishable
substitute
 of another individual, even becoming suited with their tools. By manipulating the nature of his chakra, he was also able to emulate techniques of which is known to him. Because White Zetsu was typically weaker than the one he was imitating, he mainly used this technique through his clones to serve as decoys or for infiltration and assassination.
 Even after suffering tremendous damage, or even death, the technique would not cancel until he chose to release it.

Despite not being suited for prolonged battle, White Zetsu showed considerable skill in emulating the personalities and battle tactics of his target. It was because of this characteristic that the entire
Allied Shinobi Forces
 was forced to be in constant paranoia and sometimes turned on one another. Though with keen analysis, one could exploit his lack of knowledge on certain subjects. Those who could
sense negative emotions
 could also take advantage of his true intentions.

Nature Transformation






Zetsu merged with the ground.



White Zetsu was capable of utilising all five basic
nature transformations
 along with
Yin
 and
Yang Release
.
 Because he was tethered to the
flowering tree
 grown from Hashirama Senju's DNA, White Zetsu's genetic material and chakra was identical to that of the latter's. Like Hashirama, he was able to use
Wood Release
, albeit on a much weaker scale.

Zetsu's signature technique was
Mayfly
, which allowed him to merge with the ground to quickly travel to a new location, though not as quickly as Obito's
space–time travelling
.
 This technique was ideal for Zetsu's function as a spy, as it erased his presence and prevented him from being sensed.

Other Skills

Being a mutated human, White Zetsu was able to survive without food or water and did not need to carry out normal human bodily functions.
 He could, however, quickly devour another individual completely, as he was normally tasked to dispose of dead Akatsuki members or allies that way.
 Doing so also serves to supplement its own chakra reserves.
 Befitting his role as a spy, White Zetsu was able to put up a warning system, allowing him to monitor a vast area.

Being almost entirely composed with the cells of Hashirama Senju, White Zetsu had the capacity to
heal nearly any wound
, even without the use of hand seals.
 It's because of this that White Zetsu was able to aid his companions by grafting his body parts onto them, should they lose any major portion of their anatomy. Those aided in this way are also gifted White Zetsu's healing capabilities.

Yura
, finding Mukade a delicious meal.

After
Sasori
 and
Deidara
 were defeated, Zetsu and
Tobi
 were sent to retrieve their rings, and dispose of their corpses. However, he was unable to eat Sasori due to him being a puppet, but was amazed to finally see what the real Sasori looked like. Tobi found Sasori's ring, wishing to take his place. Black Zetsu thought this was a bad idea, but White Zetsu thought otherwise, noting that Tobi was a good person.
 They later found Deidara's severed right arm and believe him dead until he arrived and proved them wrong. This caused Black Zetsu to wonder why Deidara hadn't captured
Naruto Uzumaki
, to which Deidara replied that he had already fulfilled his quota either way.

Kakuzu, disagreeing stated that money was all one could count on. White Zetsu agreed that money was important, however Black Zetsu stated finding the next
one
 was much more important. Zetsu is later seen sealing the
Two-Tails
.

He later appeared near Tobi while he was engaged in combat with the
Eight Man Squad
, to report to him the result of the fight.
 They then led Tobi to where Itachi and Sasuke were, with Black Zetsu confirming to Tobi that he had indeed
recorded
 the fight.
 After a meeting with Taka and Kisame, Tobi met with Zetsu on a bridge where they discussed the fact that Itachi — who had been hampering their plans — was dead and Zetsu lamented on the fact that so many Akatsuki members had died. Tobi said their deaths were worth it because Sasuke was in his hands now.

 Upon Nagato's death and Naruto returning to the village crowned as a hero, Zetsu revealed himself to have hidden inside a tree, watching the entire fight between them, hardly believing Pain to have been defeated, but decided to relay the information to Tobi. He then returns to Tobi and Kisame, reporting Nagato's death and betrayal, also mentioning that Konan wouldn't be returning either.

Five Kage Summit

Five Kage Summit

Zetsu finds Tobi after the latter had encountered Taka, revealing that Konoha had already been destroyed, and that
Danzō
 had been named the acting
Hokage
. He then mentioned to Sasuke that Naruto had defeated Pain, and was probably stronger than him. When Taka agreed to go to the
Kage Summit
, Zetsu split in half, and White Zetsu proceeded to lead Sasuke and his team to the Kage Summit.






White Zetsu interrupts the Summit of the Five Kage.



White Zetsu stayed with Taka in the
Land of Iron
, observing the meeting of the Five Kage and trying to figure out a way to successfully assassinate Danzō. After identifying Danzō, White Zetsu managed to slip away from Taka unnoticed. White Zetsu later emerged in the conference room, telling the five Kage that Sasuke was somewhere around. After revealing himself, the
Fourth Raikage
 grabbed the white Zetsu's neck, asked him about the whereabouts of Sasuke, and threatened to use force. Zetsu mockingly replied that he would give a hint, which prompted the Raikage, angered, to tighten his grip on Zetsu's neck. With his neck snapped, the White Zetsu collapsed on the floor and was presumed to be dead by everyone in the vicinity.






White Zetsu's spores attacking Mei.



After Sasuke had been struck by the
Fifth Mizukage
's
Boil Release: Skilled Mist Technique
, Zetsu's Spore Technique, which had secretly been implanted on everyone in the meeting hall before the Raikage's attack, activated. The spores leached some of the Mizukage's chakra while binding the samurai guards,
Mifune
,
Ōnoki
 and everyone else. One of the spores then jumped onto Sasuke and gave him the absorbed chakra, allowing him to use an arm of
Susanoo
 to escape from the Mizukage. The spores were later successfully neutralised by everyone present at the time of their release.






White Zetsu prepares to fight Team 7.



After Naruto and Sasuke clash, the aftermath of which sends Sasuke hurtling towards a wall, a clone of White Zetsu appears and wraps himself around Sasuke to cushion the blow. Revealing that Tobi had told him to keep an eye on Sasuke,
 the clone contacts the real White Zetsu, who alerts Tobi. Upon Tobi's arrival, the White Zetsu clone, prepared to fight and capture Naruto, created
several more copies
 of himself. Before he could engage in combat however, Tobi tells him not to as he wasn't a 'front line' fighter, and instead gives him the task of checking up on
Kisame
 and rejoining with Black Zetsu.






Kisame and Zetsu switch places.



White Zetsu and Black Zetsu meet up at the site of
Killer B
 and Kisame's battle only to reveal that Kisame's decapitated body was actually one of White Zetsu's

Kumogakure
 while inside
Samehada
 which was being carried back to Kumogakure by Killer B who intended to use it as his own weapon. Black Zetsu then stated that it was their feeding time and that they should merge once again.

daimyō
. Upon being told they didn't matter White Zetsu lamented that Black Zetsu was fighting the Mizukage for nothing, to which Tobi responded that by stalling the Mizukage and her allies, they were effectively splitting up her forces. White Zetsu asked about what Tobi was going to do, in which he revealed he was going to join the battle, by stealing the
"substitute"
.

Creation and Conception






Concept design for Zetsu.



In
Naruto Hiden: Sha no Sho Character Official Data Book
, Kishimoto revealed that he had originally planned for Akatsuki to be a group of monsters, "with almost no human characteristics", and that Zetsu's design was modelled after an insectivorous plant. He also stated that he had decided to make Zetsu half black and half white to "better show his split personality".

Trivia

The name "Zetsu" (
舌
) means "tongue". A fitting name, as White Zetsu was referred to as "Chatterbox" (
饒舌
,
Jōzetsu
) based on his personality.

According to the
databook
:

Zetsu's hobby is observing unique shinobi.

Zetsu wishes to fight people who are likely to leave behind a corpse that will make a good meal.

Zetsu's favourite food is
"chewy" people
, while his least favourites are
konnyaku
 and jelly.

Zetsu's favourite phrase is "Independence unbending" (
独立不撓
,
Dokuritsu Futō
), which roughly means "The only one you can count on is yourself".

Wherever Tobi is, Zetsu is never far behind.

In the
fourth databook
,
kekkei genkai
 is not listed among White Zetsu's special characteristics, despite his usage of Wood Release through
Hashirama's cells
 in the manga.

White Zetsu and his clones are not dissimilar to the legends told of the
mandrake
 plant used to create
artificial men
.

When White Zetsu is killed by Sasuke, his flytrap appendages are missing in both anime and manga.

In the anime, White Zetsu's eye occasionally has a pupil not present in the manga.
