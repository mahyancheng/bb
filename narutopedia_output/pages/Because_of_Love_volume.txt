"

" (

,
Mōjū no Kodomo
)

Sarada
 thinks back to
Sumire
's feelings regarding
Boruto
.
Ryū
 and
Matsuri
 observe the
toad
, which the latter believes Boruto had placed there according to underground trees. Yodo uses her superior hearing to eavesdrop on their conversation, revealing to the others that they are looking for Boruto and Matsuri has
sensory abilities
, stating that it is a matter of when, not if, they are exposed. Konohamaru prepares to go through with the plan, but he notices Sarada's uneasiness. Sarada dismisses it and promises that she will focus. Yodo confirms with Konohamaru that they will be able to rescue Shinki if they recover Ryū's
Thorn Soul Bulb
. Yodo promises to do her best, but Araya warns her not to do anything reckless. The two bicker for a bit, and Konohamaru tries to get their heads back in the game.

Konohamaru, Sarada and Mitsuki casually walk up to Ryū and Matsuri, pretending to not know them and warmly greeting them. As Matsuri lays eyes on Konohamaru, her heart begins beating faster. Konohamaru reveals that they are following Boruto's trail. Konohamaru remembers his conversation with Shikamaru, who is giving him intel. Konohamaru learns from Shikamaru that defeating the Human God Trees will reveal their Thorn Soul Bulbs, and if they are returned to their respective trees, the devoured individuals can be saved. Conversely, if they are unable to retrieve the Thorn Soul Bulbs, they will be used to continue resurrecting Ryū and Matsuri. Hearing this, Konohamaru conjectures that
Hidari
 may have been resurrected as his Thorn Soul Bulb flew off somewhere after he was killed. Konohamaru asks where Shikamaru received this intel, as this is way more information than they would have cobbled together after Boruto's interrogation. Shikamaru simply states that he cannot tell him as it is beyond his clearance. As a toad is secretly revealed under Shikamaru's cloak, Shikamaru reveals a strategy in fighting the Human God Trees. Shikamaru explains that despite the Human God Trees' high combat strength, there is no evidence that they are born inherently evil, comparing them to wild beast cubs that simply react on instinct. Shikamaru orders Konohamaru to befriend the Human God Trees, and then betray and kill them. Konohamaru's heart reels, and Shikamaru tells him to not allow this, as if he considers them nothing but an enemy, he should be able to do this. Knowing that
Naruto
 would advise against this, Shikamaru states that he is not Naruto, and he is simply acting to save humanity.

Konohamaru introduces himself and his team to Ryū and Matsuri, and the two Human God Trees do the same, albeit Matsuri is visibly shy. Since they have a common goal, Konohamaru advises they join forces. While Konohamaru inspects the fallen toad, Mitsuki finds one of Boruto's metal symbols on the ground. Konohamaru suggests combing the area for more evidence, telling Sarada and Mitsuki to check elsewhere. Konohamaru asks the visibly shaken Matsuri if she's feeling sick, and she remains quiet, mentally confused at herself. Ryu teams up with Sarada and Mitsuki while Konohamaru and Matsuri leave to inspect another area. As Ryu walks with Sarada and Mitsuki, he is relieved to learn how friendly they are, stating that
Jura
, his boss, has high respect for Konohagakure for a reason. Ryu expressed his desire to slaughter any shinobi he ran into, so he is glad they started talking first. In their past conversation, Shikamaru informs Konohamaru of his reason to choose him to head to Sunagakure: Matsuri bears romantic feelings towards him, and it is an emotion she is not aware of, which will leave her in a state of turmoil, which will allow Konohamaru the opening to kill her. He orders Konohamaru to take charge of the situation with the goal to separate Ryū and Matsuri should they appear together, as it is not favorable for them to fight them together. Konohamaru is watching Matsuri internally battling herself, offering to have a seat with her to talk about it. Matsuri is confused at the emotion she is feeling.

Koji asks Ada to update him on the current events with her
Senrigan
, assuring her that
Mamushi
 will not see her as he is currently at their base. Ada does so as Boruto and Koji remain on standby in a separate location. Koji updates Boruto on Konohamaru successfully separating Ryū and Matsuri. The most ideal plan would be if Sarada, Mitsuki, Yodo and Araya take down Ryū while Konohamaru is distracting Matsuri, and they all team up to take down Matsuri. Boruto asks what the probability of them failing is, and Koji snidely answers that they will likely not fail. Boruto knows Koji is lying, but Koji forbids Boruto from involving himself, as just like with
Himawari
, if he were to become involved, Jura will make a move, which will result in Boruto's death.

Jura is seen inside a Konohagakure bookstore, casually shopping as the store clerk nervously stares at him. Shikamaru is alerted of Jura's presence, but he orders them to not panic and treat him as a regular civilian. Jura sets a large pile of books on the store counter with
Ryo
, telling the clerk to keep the change as an advance for his future purchases. Visibly nervous, the clerk agrees and wishes Jura a good day.

Meanwhile,
Amado
 is inside his office putting a cigarette in his mouth. Before he can light it,
Kawaki
 swipes it from his mouth, immediately pinning Amado to the wall. Amado expected Kawaki to visit him, having eavesdropped on his conversation with Boruto, and Kawaki orders him to draw out all of his powers.

Chapter 18

Only Babble in Your Sleep
" (

)

Sumire
 enters
Amado
's lab to find him pinned against the wall by
Kawaki
. Kawaki says he is only having a talk with Amado. He demands that Amado upgrade his settings or else he will be killed, forcing the latter to use his shutdown for Kawaki.

Meanwhile in the
Land of Wind
,
Mitsuki
 introduces
Ryū
 to
Yodo
 and
Araya
. Araya warmly greets Ryū, but Yodo simply glares at him, which Ryū notices. Araya whispers to Yodo to calm down.

Konohamaru
 and
Matsuri
 continue to talk, as Matsuri realizes she is beginning to act more normal. Matsuri asks if she can call Konohamaru Konohamaru-chan. Thinking back at the many times
Moegi
 called him that, Konohamaru begins to grow stressed, but he keeps it confined. Ryū continues to look for clues with Sarada, Mitsuki, Yodo and Araya. Using his
Iron Sand
, Ryū begins to search the area, explaining that his Iron Sand is his detection ability and he can learn a lot with it. As the Iron Sand surrounds everyone, Ryū points out Yodo's intense bloodlust, but Yodo simply states that all ninja are like this. Mitsuki quickly changes the subject, asking Ryū why he is looking for Boruto. Ryū states that he doesn't fully understand why himself, but Boruto knows too much about them, including about their
Thorn Soul Bulbs
, and Jura decided to kill him for being too much of a threat. Remembering about the Thorn Soul Bulbs, Sarada suggests using one as bait to lure Boruto out.

Later, Kawaki awakes from his shutdown, and Amado agrees to modify Kawaki's ability settings to offense to stand a chance against the Human God Trees. However, Amado states that there is a condition, revealing a newly-built resurrection vessel for
Akebi Sanzu
 that closely resembles her in appearance, which is for Kawaki to implant the vessel with a
Kāma
 so Akebi can be resurrected. Kawaki can achieve this as his
Kāma
 has Akebi's data embedded into it. Proclaiming that all of his actions thus far has led to this, and this is his only purpose in life, Amado begs Kawaki to comply, in exchange for his powers being fully released. Kawaki simply declares that he will kill Amado's daughter should she be revealed to be an
Ōtsutsuki
. In the unlikely event that she is, Amado agrees, but he will fight Kawaki with everything he has to prevent this. Kawaki declines Amado's terms, as they do not have the luxury to worry about a potential new enemy, and releasing his full powers should come first. Kawaki agrees to only help with resurrecting Akebi, only on the premise that he might kill her right away, and only after he has dealt with all of the current threats. Amado pleads with Kawaki that he is currently endowed with near-immortal defensive capabilities, and if he redirects all of that to offense, his survival cannot be guaranteed, and if Kawaki dies, so will Amado's dreams, as only Kawaki's
Kāma
 can be used to revive Akebi. Kawaki simply expresses his desire to kill his enemies over his desire to survive, telling Amado to make him into an even bigger monster than them. Once Kawaki slaughters the Human God Trees,
Code
, and Boruto, he will allow Amado to reunite with his daughter.

Meanwhile, Matsuri is overjoyed at having the chance to talk with Konohamaru. Shaken, Konohamaru politely asks if Matsuri could not call him Konohamaru-chan, as that name is reserved for one person. Noticing Matsuri's expression change, Konohamaru tries to rectify his words by acting purposefully vague, but Matsuri is aware he is referring to Moegi. Matsuri asks Konohamaru what Moegi exactly means to him. When Konohamaru hesitates on answering, Matsuri angrily yells at him to answer her as she transforms her collar into
wood
 to surround him.

Ryū agrees with Sarada's idea to use his Thorn Soul Bulb to lure Boruto, willingly extracting it from his body. As the others confirm to themselves that this is the object they need to collect, Ryū keeps his Thorn Soul Bulb levitating in the air above them, waiting to see if Boruto will appear. Yodo, as an alerted Araya tells her not to, immediately jumps forward to retrieve the Thorn Soul Bulb. However, Ryū freezes her in place with his Iron Sand, aware that they were trying to fool him and the Thorn Soul Bulb was to lure them instead. Exclaiming that the shinobi need to be punished for stooping so low, Ryū begins coating Sarada, Mitsuki and Araya with Iron Sand. The Iron Sand surrounding Sarada force her to grab a
Kunai
 from her pouch and to lunge towards Yodo, with Mitsuki confirming Ryū can use his Iron Sand to
manipulate them like puppets
.

Before Yodo can be struck, the Iron Sand surrounding Yodo and Sarada was dispelled by huge sword slash from Araya, revealing his
Magnetic Iron Sand Sealing Blade
.

Chapter 19

"
Konohamaru-chan
" (
木ノ葉丸ちゃん
,
Konohamaru-chan
)

In a flashback,
Shinki
 applies his chakra on
Araya
's sword to enable him to manipulate his
iron sand
. Shinki says it is all for the purpose for protecting his
father
. Araya responds  saying he should be focusing on
Yodo
 instead.

Back in the present, Araya frees
Mitsuki
 from
Ryū
's
control
. The four shinobi rally to fight against Ryū, as Araya tells
Sarada
 and Mitsuki to launch a direct attack while leaving the Iron Sand to him. Ryū is frustrated that they are underestimating him, but it is inspiring him to fight harder, launching a huge wave of Iron Sand. As Araya dispels it with his sword, Yodo uses her hearing to warn the others of a sneak attack from their flank. When Araya dispels it, Ryū proclaims that they're not all talk. Sarada rushes forward, using
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
, but Ryū blocks it with a wall of Iron Sand. Behind him, Mitsuki, having entered
Sage Mode
, ensnares Ryū with several large snakes. When Mitsuki launches more snakes to attack Ryū, he dodges the attack by
turning his own body into Iron Sand
. As more Iron Sand surrounds the group, Yodo uses her hearing to detect Ryū manifesting himself, prompting Araya to use his blade to gather the Iron Sand in the area, leaving Ryū exposed. Mitsuki uses the opening to attack with more large snakes, and Sarada strikes him with
Chidori
. The duo deal considerable damage to Ryū, but the attacks were too shallow, and Ryū once again turns into Iron Sand.

Meanwhile, Matsuri's collar surrounds Konohamaru as she angrily yells at him about not wanting to be called "Konohamaru-chan". Konohamaru attempts to validate his feelings, calling Matsuri selfish, prompting Matsuri to begin ensnaring him with her
Wood Release
.
Ada
, watching the current events unfold with her
Senrigan
, updates
Koji Kashin
 on the situation: Konohamaru angered Matsuri and is about to be devoured, and the group of shinobi are holding their own against Ryū, but they are struggling and are in no position to help Konohamaru. Koji notices Boruto's restlessness, advising him that he has to stay.

At the
Human God Trees
' base,
Jura
 explains the newly-learned concept of love to
Hidari
 and
Mamushi
, noting that this emotion has the potential to cause even them serious problems. Matsuri begins to angrily question her emotions by looking at Konohamaru, expressing her intense desire to devour him so she can no longer have this feeling again. Jura remembers the
Ino–Shika–Chō
 team prioritizing
Himawari Uzumaki
's safety over their own, and they were aware of how foolish this is. These actions as well as
Inojin Yamanaka
 losing his composure upon seeing Himawari hurt were caused by love derailing their thinking, confirming that the concept of love appears in many tomes and it seems impossible to fully understand, but it is a feeling they must overcome.

Yodo detects Ryū in the air above them, and once again Araya uses his blade to force him to manifest. However, a cluster of
Claw Grime
 suddenly emerge from the
Claw Marks
 on Ryū's cloak. Mitsuki tries to fend off the horde with his snakes and Sarada with her
Fire Release: Phoenix Sage Fire Technique
, but they are overwhelmed by the number. A group of Claw Grime surround Yodo, who desperately tries to fend them off, but she is bitten by one of them. Araya quickly strikes with his blade, but it becomes stuck in the Claw Grime's body and Araya cannot pull it out. Suddenly, Ryū forces this Claw Grime to enter the Claw Marks on another Claw Grime, taking Araya's blade with it.

Now with no way to defend themselves against the Iron Sand, the shinobi are cornered. Matsuri also declares she will devour Konohamaru as he becomes further ensnared in Matsuri's transformed collar.

Chapter 20

"
Because of Love
" (
愛ゆえに
,
Ai Yueni
)

Konohamaru
's neck is being crushed within
Matsuri
's grasp. Thinking back to
Shikamaru
's words, Konohamaru tried to reach out to Matsuri, saying if he is devoured by her, he will die. Matsuri is conflicted by her feelings, her infatuation with Konohamaru and her instinct to devour him. She states that these conflicting feelings result in feeling compelled to devour him, using her
Wood Release
 to further injure Konohamaru.

Elsewhere,
Araya
,
Yodo
,
Mitsuki
, and
Sarada
 are having trouble fighting
Ryū
. With Araya's
blade
 gone, Ryū has no more worries about his
Iron Sand
 being countered, using it to overwhelm Mitsuki and Araya. As Mitsuki loses his
Sage Mode
, he and Araya are held captive by Ryū as Araya yells for Yodo and Sarada to save themselves. Ryū suggests the group to share any intel they have on
Boruto
, and he will agree to let them go. Mitsuki tells the others not to fall for it as Ryū may simply kill them anyway. Yodo and Sarada argue about revealing Boruto's location, and Sarada proclaims that she will not sell out a friend. Yodo becomes aware that Boruto is the cause of Sarada's conflicting behavior, thinking that he is the type of guy, despite being an enemy, that makes you want to always have his back no matter what. Yodo reveals that they have no intel on Boruto, but she offers herself instead as her detection abilities can prove useful in finding him, in exchange for the rest of them to be spared.

Konohamaru is overwhelmed by Matsuri, as a tear begins to drop from her face, much to her confusion. Matsuri wonders what is happening, and Konohamaru explains that she is feeling sad and deep inside, she does not want to kill him. At the
Human God Trees
 base,
Hidari
 notices a tear falling from
Jura
's eye. Konohamaru asks Matsuri to join hands, claiming that this is how special relationships start. Matsuri begins to comply and join hands, then Konohamaru, thinking back to Shikamaru's strategy, disintegrates Matsuri's arms and a section of her body with
Big Ball Spiralling Serial Spheres
. Jura explains that due to love, Matsuri hesitated in devouring Konohamaru, giving him the opportunity to deliver a painful counterattack. However, due to that same feeling of love, Konohamaru momentarily fell victim to his doubt, allowing victory to slip from his grasp as Matsuri attacks him.

Yodo is stabbed through her torso by an Iron Sand spear attack from Ryū, as Sarada, Mitsuki and Araya watch. Sarada runs to Yodo's side as Araya, still ensnared by the Iron Sand, curses Ryū. Sarada checks on Yodo, who states that she is aware she is finished. Sarada is ensnared by the Iron Sand as Ryū begins to claim victory. Yodo tells Sarada that she is aware of Sarada's conflicting feelings, revealing that she is hiding a secret power. As Ryū forces Sarada to pull out a
Kunai
 to finish off Yodo, Yodo informs Sarada that it is fine for her to stop holding back for not just the greater good, but to protect that special person in her life.

As Ryū prepares to end this, he is alerted by his Iron Sand peeling away from his body, Mitsuki's, Araya's, and Sarada's. He spots a
black hole
 in the sky, which is sucking in the Iron Sand. Mitsuki lays eyes on Sarada, discovering this is her doing, as Sarada has activated her
Mangekyō Sharingan
.
