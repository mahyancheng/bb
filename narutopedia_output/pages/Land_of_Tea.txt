The Land of Tea.



The
Land of Tea
 (
茶の国
,
Cha no Kuni
) is a small country near the
Land of Fire
.
Team Kakashi
 (minus
Kakashi Hatake
 who was on another mission at the time) was sent here to guard
Idate Morino
 during a race to settle the rivalry between the
Wasabi family
 and the
Wagarashi family
. It consists of two separate islands off the eastern shore,
Nagi Island
 and
Ouza Island
, where the race occurred.
 It is unknown if this country has
shinobi
 of their own as participants of the race hired foreign shinobi for protection. One reason for being named the Land of Tea could be for its tea-houses, like the one Team 7 stopped at when they first met Idate.
