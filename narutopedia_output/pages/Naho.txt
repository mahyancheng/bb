Part II

Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha

While she was playing with her ball, she dropped it and it then started to roll away. She tried to catch it, but she slipped off a cliff. Sasuke managed to save her and, like many before her, she also seems to have an infatuation with Sasuke.
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Sakura Haruno
 were assigned by
Tsunade
 to escort her to Shizume village. She rejected this, saying that she wanted Sasuke to be her bodyguard. They started their journey with Naruto transformed as Sasuke in order to fool her. They encountered
an enemy
 with an
impenetrable body
. After a fight with the criminal and other ninja, the criminal quickly defeats Naruto and Sakura and captures the three. Later that night, Sasuke locates the three and battles the criminal and he eventually defeated him with
Chidori
 but continued to beat him. Naho noted Sasuke's coldness and became scared of him; however, Naruto said that she should forgive him because Sasuke is really a good person, and that he will bring him to her as soon as he becomes his former self.
