By using their
Rinnegan
, the user is able to fully absorb the bodies of their target by turning them into chakra-filled edibles, which are shaped like
Chakra Fruit
. When eaten, they will transform into a demonic-like being, and will have access to all of the target's abilities. The user also uses this technique to absorb chakra and transform it into chakra pills to grant them immense power and temporary immortality, although one has to keep taking the pills to retain enhanced abilities and immortality.

Trivia

The pills Momoshiki creates from Chakra Fruit are specifically referred to as the Cinnabar Elixir (
仙丹
,
Sentan
) in the film novelisation and
Road to Boruto
 expansion for
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
, referring to the
elixir of immortality
 from Chinese folklore. In Chinese folklore, the
moon rabbit
 is depicted using a mortar and pestle to create the elixir of immortality, continuing the trend of associating the Ōtsutsuki clan with the moon rabbit.
