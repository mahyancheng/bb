genjutsu
. The

 are caught in an illusion and immobilised, allowing
Jiraiya
 to easily kill all three. Confident he has won, Jiraiya thanks
Shima
 and
Fukasaku
 for their help with eliminating
Pain
. Another person with a Rinnegan appears and corrects him. He attacks Jiraiya and severs his left arm. The
Six Paths of Pain
