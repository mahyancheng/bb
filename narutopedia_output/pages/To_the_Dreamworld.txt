"
To the Dreamworld
" (
夢の世界へ
,
Yume no Sekai e
) is episode 427 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

While on the move,
Tenten
 hopes to be able to seal the enemy with the
Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths
 she came across with, looking to find
Kumogakure
 shinobi who can instruct her in their use.
Madara
's forehead plating lands on the scroll with the tools, calling her attention to the sky as the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 is cast. Tenten reaches for the tools as she's
enveloped
 by the
God Tree
's roots. Tenten is confused as she suddenly finds herself back in her room, in
Konohagakure
. She goes to the streets, and is taken aback when she finds her team-mates, with different personalities from what she knows.
 Tenten tries eating with them at
Yakiniku Q
, but leaves early. She notices she doesn't recognise the
Fourth Hokage
's face on the
Hokage Rock
, and comes to the conclusion she's under
genjutsu
, though despite her efforts, she can't release it. She begins researching genjutsu, and ostracising her team-mates, causing them to grow concerned.
Hinata
 takes Tenten's scroll with the weapons, demanding an explanation for her behaviour. Tenten tries taking back the scroll by force, but before things can escalate,
Menma Namikaze
 intervenes, returning her the scroll. The commotion attracts attention of the villagers, and Tenten denounces the fake village. A merchant is intrigued by her actions.

Trivia

According to the
Studio Pierrot
's blog entry about this episode, it takes place in the
world
 of
Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie
, although it was a real dimension in the movie and only a dream in this episode.

When
Team 7
 first appears, Menma is in the middle of
Sasuke
 and
Sakura
, but in the next shot, Menma is on the left.
