Shura
 (

Shinobazu

Personality

Shura was a very greedy and cruel man. He would even beat a child if it meant he'd get what he wanted.

Appearance

Shura had long brown hair and small eyes. He has red markings on his face, one on his chin and the other going across his face over his nose. He also wore headgear, his standard clothing, and he is also seen with an
umbrella
 on his back which he
uses as a weapon
.

Abilities

Shura's weapon of choice was an umbrella, which he was rather adept in using it. This umbrella has many hidden modifications, it could fire multiple
senbon
, shoot intense flames like a flamethrower, shoot metal wires to immobilise the opponents, and had a hidden sword that can be drawn to give a final blow. Shura calls his technique, assassination techniques (
殺人術

satsujin jutsu
) instead of ninja techniques. He could also use it to glide in midair and after Naruto defeats Shura, he uses his umbrella to land on the ground.
