 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 struggles to combine his
Rasengan
 with his
wind nature
. One of his
shadow clones
 enter into its
three-tailed form
 and dispels the other shadow clones, although
Yamato
 is able to suppress and subdue it with his
Wood Release: Foo Dog Heads
. As Naruto lies down on the ground, the clouds overhead begin to start pouring rain, and Naruto remembers
Sasuke
. Not wanting to give up now, he resumes his training.

At the
Akatsuki
 hideout,
Hidan
 is outraged when he learns that he must stay in place for three days as they extract the
Two-Tails
 from its
jinchūriki
,
Yugito Nii
. Hidan tells the
leader
 that he has his own goals and does not care about the Akatsuki's; the leader, however, tells him that so long as he is affiliated with them, he will contribute to their true goal. Claiming that he's the second newest member after
Tobi
 and is unaware of the Akatsuki's plans, the leader divulges how the Akatsuki will create conflict and reap war in order to make a profit and corner the market themselves, using the
tailed beasts
 to create more wars and create their own private army consisting of mercenaries.

Izumo
,
Kotetsu
 and
Shikamaru
 return to
Konoha
, where they report
Asuma
's death to
Tsunade
. Tsunade tells the others to prepare for Asuma's funeral while she breaks the news to
Kurenai
; Shikamaru, however, offers to do it himself, as he claims he has a message from Asuma to pass on to her.

In the clearing, after Naruto explains his trouble of combining the Rasengan and his wind chakra as looking left and right at the same time, Kakashi creates a
shadow clone
 and shows how one can look in two directions at the same time. Recalling how it takes him one shadow clone just to form the Rasengan itself, Naruto decides to have a second shadow clone aid in the process, with the second clone being in charge of creating the wind chakra and applying it to the Rasengan. Naruto's attempts are fruitful, and he ends up creating his own jutsu -
Wind Release: Rasengan
. Kakashi tells Naruto that he has taken a liking to him, although Naruto misinterprets his words. Before the two can settle their confusion, Yamato reports to the two that Asuma had been killed.
