Menma Memory Search Mission

Menma Memory Search Mission

She beseeched
Neji
,
Tenten
,
Naruto
 and
Menma
 to save her village from a
group of bandits
 that were plaguing them after realising they were
shinobi
. She was initially disheartened to hear them say no as they had a current ongoing mission and could not act without permission from their village. She later watches on solemnly as her brother,
Nan
, shows the
Konoha
 shinobi the field of graves and is delighted when Naruto and Menma told her that they would help regardless.
