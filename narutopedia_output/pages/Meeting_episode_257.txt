Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

A young
Naruto
 paints the houses and shops throughout
Konoha
 as a prank and runs away, while hearing the villagers complain about who would be responsible to cover the damages and how Naruto does not have any parents to complain to. Later that day, when the
Third Hokage
 comes to his house to give him his allowance, Naruto asks him who his parents were and what were they like, stating that all he knows is that they died during the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
. The
Hokage
 refuses to answer him, telling Naruto that it wouldn't bring back the dead and thus would be meaningless conversation.

A few years later, while in the
Academy
, Naruto meets
Sasuke Uchiha
 and is continuously defeated by him. During one spar, Naruto realises that Sasuke's eyes are filled with hatred, albeit not for him. Shortly after that, he finds out that Sasuke is the only survivor of the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
. After graduating, Naruto and Sasuke are
placed
 on
Team 7
, along with
Sakura Haruno
, where Sasuke
proclaims
 that his goal is to destroy
someone
 in order to restore the
Uchiha clan
 while Naruto shares his dream about becoming the Hokage. The three manage to
pass

Kakashi
's
bell test
 and officially become
genin
. As they head to the
Land of Waves
 for their first
mission
, they are
attacked
 by
two enemies
, with Kakashi seemingly being killed, leading Sasuke to fight the two and save Naruto's life. Dismayed that he was scared and weak whereas Sasuke handled the conflict coolly, Naruto stabs his own hand with his
kunai
, proclaiming an oath on his wound that he would never be so weak as to let someone save him ever again.

Trivia

In this episode, Naruto didn't attack Kakashi before he could start the bell test.

The
Academy
 scene in this episode when Sasuke defeats Naruto was taken from chapter
538
. This episode, however, does not chronicle the events of that chapter.
