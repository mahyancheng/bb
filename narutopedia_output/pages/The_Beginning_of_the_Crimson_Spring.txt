Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Immediately beginning their attempts to dissuade
Guy
 from his decision, his comrades soon abandon this as a fruitless endeavour. Comforting his
pupil
 by telling him that this was no time to look sad, Guy dashes forward to confront
Madara
 once more, opening the
Eighth Gate
.
 Remembering his father
Might Duy
 in these final moments before the confrontation, he remembers how he had lived his life, and in turn, how Guy had loved his own life, passing on principles of unwavering loyalty and true inner strength right down to the very last moment of his life where his father Duy was able to ultimately protect him, and his team-mates
Ebisu
 and
Genma
, from a generation of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
. Though Madara tried to trivialise Guy's incoming onslaught as nothing more than leaves that fall and rot in autumn, Guy corrected him, declaring that those leaves would become
nourishment for the new leaves
 on the tree before reaching his target and attacking him with the
Evening Elephant
.
