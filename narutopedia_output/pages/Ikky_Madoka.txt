Ikkyū Madoka
 (
まどかイッキュウ
,
Madoka Ikkyū
) is the current
daimyō
 of the
Land of Fire
.

Personality

Ikkyū is a very business oriented man. His focus on work tends to make him ignore his son,
Tentō
 leaving him in the care of servants and keeping him occupied through lavished gifts. However, he still loves his son and cares for his well-being, as he was furious at learning of Tentō's kidnapping and deeply worried for his well-being. While he loves his son and was willing to pay the money ransom, he was conflicted with the other demand of releasing all the prisoners of
Hōzuki Castle
, acknowledging the dangers of having many violent criminals loose upon the world is not worth the safety of one child, even if it was his son.
 At the same time, he showed a very problematic approach, deciding to gather the money as a means to stall for time.

As Tentō noted, Ikkyū has great admiration for shinobi.
 He is also shown a very casual and humble man over all, as he does not care about formality, especially with those he considers friends, as he showed with Naruto. Unlike other daimyō, who often prioritise either their own
land
 or themselves, Ikkyū shares Naruto's genuine desire for peace and prosperity, and wholeheartedly aided Naruto and
Shikamaru Nara
 on preventing a possible Fifth Shinobi World War between
Iwagakure
 with
Kirigakure
 against the
Land of Flowers
 with
Kumogakure
 after persuading
Land of Earth
's daimyō,
Danjō
, to cancel their plan on taking over the Land of Flowers for its soil.

Appearance

Ikkyū appears to be a middle-aged man with grey hair, slicked back and stylised sideburns as well as a goatee. His ears are pierced and he has several rings on his fingers. He wears a dark, full-body suit with a simple white kimono over it and a short fur-collared haori and a hat. He also travels with a walking cane.

Ikkyū meets with Naruto.



Ikkyū visited Konohagakure to meet with the
Seventh Hokage
. After finishing a call he was approached by his son Tentō who wanted to show him the new card he had purchased. Ikkyū, however, apologised to his son stating that he had to leave before he was late for the conference with the Hokage to discuss financial matters. With that, he left him in
Yamaoka
's care. A few days later, he learned to his horror that Tentō was kidnapped by the
Mujina Bandits
. After learning of their demands for Tentō's safe return being 500 million ryō and the immediate release of all criminals in Hōzuki Castle, Ikkyū deduced that with how seamless the abduction was, they must have had spies with his entourage. Desperate to get his son back but all wanting to stall on the ransom demands, he decided to play it safe and begin getting the money together.

Ultimately, Tentō was saved by the genin of
Team Konohamaru
, who also captured the entire Mujina Bandits. Ikkyū quickly went to see his son, overjoyed to see that he was alright. As Tentō talked about what he learned from Boruto and how he insisted to become a strong man to support his father, Ikkyū was left so moved. Later, Ikkyū and his delegation left Konohagakure, with Team Konohamaru coming to see them off.
