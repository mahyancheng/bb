 manga.

Summary

Kakashi
 destroys
Zabuza
's arms, preventing him from attacking further. Seeing that Zabuza will no longer be able to assassinate
Tazuna
,
Gatō
 appears with a group of thugs to finish the job himself. Noticing Haku's body and remembering when Haku broke his arm, Gatō defiles his corpse. Although this makes
Naruto
 mad, he is even angrier about the fact that Zabuza does not seem to care. Zabuza reminds him that both he and Haku were ninja: tools of battle. They have no emotions or attachments. Naruto explains that this was not true of Haku as he cared deeply for Zabuza. Knowing that Naruto is right, Zabuza cries for never appreciating Haku. Hoping to repent, Zabuza takes a
kunai
 with his mouth and charges through the thugs to reach Gatō. He decapitates Gatō and that collapses from the combined attacks of Gatō's forces.
