Pochi
 (
ポチ
,
English TV:
 Pooch) is a dog that
Inari
 owned some time in the past.

Background

Inari thought of Pochi as his only friend. He was stolen by
Akane
, who renamed him "Shooting Star" (
シューティング・スター
,
Shūtingu Sutā
). Akane eventually decided he didn't want Pochi and threw him into the ocean. Even though dogs are usually able to swim right away, Pochi started to drown. Inari wanted to save Pochi but couldn't find the courage, so Akane pushed him in. When Inari began to drown too, Pochi found out how to dog paddle and walked off, having no loyalty to Inari after his hesitation.

Appearance

Pochi is a small dog. In the
Naruto: Colour Edition
, he is mostly beige with a darker tail and eyebrows, as well as black eyes and nose. In the anime, his eyes, ears, tail, eyebrows, and nose are all black in colour, and the rest of his fur is white.

Trivia
