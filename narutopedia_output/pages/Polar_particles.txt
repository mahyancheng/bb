Sealed polar particles.



Polar particles
 (
極粒子
,
Kyoku Ryūshi
,
English TV:
 Ultra particles) are a mysterious substance mentioned in one of the legends surrounding the
Sage of Six Paths
. Because of his time as a
jinchūriki
, the Sage developed a disease that caused his
chakra pathway system
 to start deteriorating, threatening his ability to continue using
chakra
. The Sage travelled to the
Land of Redaku
 and began charting the heavens in search of a cure. He eventually met
Janmāru-Tataru
, founder of the
Astronomy Research Institute
.

One night, while the Sage was under Tataru's care, a meteorite passed through the sky; the Sage caught this meteorite and carefully cut it in two with only his chakra. One of these halves immediately dissolved into dust, dubbed by Tataru as "polar particles". The dust enveloped the Sage and healed his body. The Sage hid some of the leftover polar particles in a lake near the Institute, leaving instructions about how to retrieve them in the guise of a game called
Hoshinarabe
.
A thousand years later
,
Sakura
 and
Sasuke Uchiha
 were able to acquire these polar particles in order to give them to
Naruto Uzumaki
, a jinchūriki suffering the same disease as the Sage.
Jiji
 also sought the polar particles for some unknown reason.
