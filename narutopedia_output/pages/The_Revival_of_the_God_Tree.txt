Synopsis

Victor
 and his
secretary
 observe the
God Tree
.
Mugino
 and
Konohamaru
 fend off against its tendrils. The God Tree absorbs the
Valleys Daimyō
's chakra, causing him to pass out. Mugino also has his chakra absorbed.
Boruto
 and
Sarada
 continue to make their way to Victor's company. Beyond the tree's tendrils, Konohamaru and Mugino also have to fight Victor's employees. Mugino gets stabbed protecting Konohamaru from one of them. Konohamaru destroys part of the tree with his
Rasengan
, earning them time to get the
daimyō
 to safety. The tree continues to grow, much to Victor's excitement. The God Tree begins absorbing the chakra of Victor's gathered employees on the ground floor. Konohamaru asks Mugino to leave with the daimyō and notify
Konoha
. The daimyō is their only witness, without whom the entire incident will be covered up. Konohamaru finds the captured employees, and begins fighting the tree again. Victor sends his secretary to take care of things. Boruto and Sarada arrive to help Konohamaru. They explain why they've come. Konohamaru fills them in on the situation, which they link to their previous fight against
White Zetsu
 in the ruins. The
Land of Valleys
 citizens begin evacuating, but
Mia
 decides to go to the company. Victor
attacks
 the Konoha shinobi. Victor reveals he cultivated this tree from a splinter of the God Tree he recovered from the battlefield during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.
 He
collapses the floor
 beneath them, separating Boruto and Sarada from Konohamaru. Sarada breaks their fall, and they notice the people Victor experimented on. Before they can do anything,
Deepa
 arrives. Deepa laughs when they decide to fight him again. Victor's secretary prevents Mugino from leaving with the daimyō. The secretary attacks, but is blocked by a hooded figure, who makes her disappear. The figure reveals to be
Orochimaru
, surprising Mugino. Another hooded figure helps Mugino stay on his feet. Orochimaru observes the situation with interest. Deepa belittles Boruto and Sarada when they think he wants more power from the tree's fruit. He reveals he just wants to eat and experience more tastes and textures. His rationale enrages Boruto and Sarada, who vow to take him down.
