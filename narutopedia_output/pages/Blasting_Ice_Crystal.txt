Haku firsts traps the opponent's feet to the ground by freezing ice onto them. He then uses a specific hand seal which causes the chunks of ice at the opponent's feet to grow into one large chunk, freezing the target completely. Quickly jumping back, he throws several senbon at the frozen opponent. It partially cracks the chunk of ice, and then shatters outward, damaging the opponent once more.
