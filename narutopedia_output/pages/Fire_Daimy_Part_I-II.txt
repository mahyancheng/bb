He is the former
daimyō
 of the
Land of Fire
.

Background

In the anime, a meeting with
Konohagakure
 was convened after
Hiruzen Sarutobi
 stepped down as the Third Hokage.
Danzō
 strongly suggested that
Orochimaru
 be made Fourth Hokage. Hiruzen, however, pointed out that Orochimaru had grown power-hungry and showed signs of sinister intent. Ultimately,
Minato Namikaze
 was elected as Fourth Hokage unanimously, excluding Danzō who detested the idea.

Personality

The Fire Daimyō has a fickle and indecisive nature and is easily swayed in his decisions through biases as well as external influences. When situations call for fast, important decisions, he makes his advisers do the work: the one who convinces him most is the "winner". He seemingly had a liking for
Jiraiya
, wanting him to be the next Hokage, and was also impressed by
Kakashi Hatake
's reputation. However, the daimyō is shown to be a conformist, as, during the emergency
Hokage
 election, he is easily swayed by
Shikaku Nara
's recommendations and, finally, persuaded by
Danzō
's ideologies.

Appearance

He has small, circular eyes and dark pupils. He also wears the standard daimyō headpiece.

The Fire Daimyō's meeting with the Konoha Council.



Following the destruction of
Konoha
 by
Pain
, the daimyō assembles a meeting to discuss how to proceed. Although he is reluctant to replace the comatose
Hokage
,
Tsunade
, he likes
Shikaku Nara
's idea of
Kakashi Hatake
 becoming Hokage, recognising him as the son of
Konoha's White Fang
 and the student of the
Fourth Hokage
.

However,
Danzō
 points out that the teachings that were passed down to Kakashi were the cause of Konoha's problems and current crisis. The
Konoha Crush
, the frequent confrontations with
Akatsuki
, the defection of
Sasuke Uchiha
, and the destruction of Konoha's infrastructure, all stemmed from the ideology that kindness and unity would lead to peace. Danzō believed the ideology simply made Konoha appear weak and left them exposed to attacks. He then nominated himself and states that he will take Konoha in a new direction, something one of the daimyō's advisers agrees with. The daimyō, persuaded by Danzō's words and reasoning, appointed Danzō as the Sixth Hokage Candidate, just in time for the
Five Kage Summit
.

After Danzō's demise at
Sasuke Uchiha
's hands, the daimyō were informed of the formation of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, and along with the other daimyō of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
, they approved of the alliance's existence. The Fire daimyō then had a meeting with the council members and was prepared to appoint
Kakashi Hatake
 as the next Hokage, but Tsunade was reported to have awakened, thus stopping the appointment.

During the
war
, the Fire daimyō, and along with the other country daimyō, have relocated to a guarded safe house. The Fire daimyō doesn't appear to be too worried about being cramped up in the safe house and instead wonders what they should name the medals that will be presented to the shinobi after the war.

While visiting a hotspring in Konoha, a kunai is thrown at and nearly hits the daimyō. He is unharmed, but because of an attack on
Homura Mitokado
 a few days earlier, the
Anbu
 guarding him are placed on alert. Later, the
Sixth Hokage
 meets with the daimyō to discuss Konoha's annual budget. The Hokage tries to secure additional funding for a children's mental health initiative run by
Sakura Haruno
.
Kido Tsumiki
 argues that, because of the attacks on the daimyō and Homura, the additional funding should instead go to the Anbu. The daimyō defers to Homura, who sides with Kido.

At some point, the Fire Daimyō was replaced by the business-oriented
Ikkyū Madoka

The Fire Daimyō as seen in the movie.



The Fire daimyō made a silhouetted appearance behind curtains in
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
, with a notable difference in his physical appearance and a much firmer mindset that might derive from a certain level of paranoia. After the
missing-nin

Hiruko
 declared a Fourth Shinobi World War against the Five Great Shinobi Countries, the daimyō, seeing Hiruko originated from
Konohagakure
, summoned the Fifth Hokage, Tsunade, to explain her attempted actions of forming a shinobi alliance against the threat of the war that Hiruko declared. Apprehensive that Konohagakure might be planning a
coup d'etat
 against the
Land of Fire
, he charged her of clearing the conflict immediately, lest Konohagakure be threatened with destruction, while refusing to listen to her excuses.
