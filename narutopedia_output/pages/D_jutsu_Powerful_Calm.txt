Itachi activates his
Tsukuyomi
 through
Mangekyō Sharingan
 to bind his opponent in an illusion where Itachi disappears and a black hole appears in the sky. As it devours all surrounding environment, it becomes larger and larger, slowly gaining the form of Itachi's Mangekyō Sharingan as it devours the opponent, leaving them unconscious in reality.
