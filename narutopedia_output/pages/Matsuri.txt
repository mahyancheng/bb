Matsuri
 (
マツリ
) is a
genin
 from
Sunagakure
. In the anime, she is part of a
team
 alongside
Yukata
 and
Mikoshi
.

Background

In the anime, Matsuri witnessed her parents' murder in the past, making her adverse to weapons and violence.

Personality






Matsuri's anger when Gaara's honour is insulted.



In the manga, Matsuri is simply a reverent admirer of
Gaara
 or any other powerful ninja;
Sha no Sho
 states that she has no interest in any other type of man.
 In the anime, by the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, her admiration extends to
Naruto Uzumaki
, whom she swoons over even in the middle of combat.
 Gaara remains her seeming preference, however, as she is offended whenever he is criticised
 and will disobey orders for his benefit.

When she's first introduced in the anime, Matsuri is a shy and quiet girl who always uses the proper
honourifics
. Under Gaara's tutelage, she becomes braver and more outspoken, to the point that she ignores even the
Third Tsuchikage
's instructions.
 While Matsuri is reluctant to use weapons in Part I, she has fewer inhibitions by the start of Part II; she will use weapons to protect her comrades and Sunagakure's reputation, but will avoid causing harm to others.

Although Matsuri is usually nice, she can also be very aggressive, such as when she hit Naruto in manga, struck Ittetsu, and hits Kiba in anime, thereby starting the fight between the participants of Chūnin Exams.

Appearance






Matsuri in Part II.



Matsuri has straight chin-length brown hair, dark eyes, and fair skin. In Part I in the anime, she wore a blue-green blouse that hung off her left shoulder, a white and pink sleeveless shirt underneath, a short yellow scarf tied around her neck, and a black short skirt. She also wore long, thigh-high stockings, brown sandals, and black gloves with a grey elbow-length arm guard on her right arm. During the
Chūnin Exams
, she wears two arm guards instead of one, a dark pink shirt with cuts over the shoulders, a white shirt underneath the other, and a black
forehead protector
 instead of her scarf. In Part II, she wears a dark shirt with a skirt of the same colour and a Sunagakure
flak jacket
.

Abilities






Matsuri using her jōhyō.



In the anime, Matsuri is trained to use the
jōhyō
, a dart tied at the end of a long rope. It is primarily a defensive weapon, used to keep her opponents at a distance and block incoming attacks. However, she can also use it
offensively
. Her skill with the jōhyō is great enough to force
Shira
, a powerful taijutsu user, to unleash his
Seven Heavens Breathing Method
 to defeat her.

The anime suggests she has some skill in
Wind Release
 techniques, as she is part of a group of Wind Release users that battle the
reincarnated

Third Raikage
.
Temari
 notes in this instance that Matsuri isn't a long-distance user.

Matsuri training under Gaara.



In the anime, Matsuri is a student of Suna's new
ninja Academy
. During a lesson about weapon-handling, Matsuri is the only member of her class to select
Gaara
 as her instructor. Gaara, sensing her hesitation about using weapons, demonstrates how to use a
jōhyō
. He tries to teach her that weapons don't need to be used for violence as they can instead be used protect comrades. Although Matsuri doesn't understand what he means, she and Gaara become close.

Because of how important Matsuri is to Gaara, the
Four Celestial Symbols Men
 kidnap her in a scheme to take the
One-Tail
's
chakra
 sealed within him. Gaara, his siblings, and the
Konoha 11
 (excluding
Tenten
) come to her aid. Once she is freed, she uses her jōhyō to save
Naruto
 from a fatal attack by
Seimei
, finally understanding Gaara's lesson about how weapons can be used to protect. She returns to Suna after Seimei's defeat, determined to continue training under Gaara.

Matsuri teasing Yukata during the Chūnin Exams.



Two years later, in the anime, Matsuri, now a
genin
, enters the
Chūnin Exams
 held jointly by Suna and
Konoha
. During the first stage held in Konoha, Matsuri and her teammates,
Mikoshi
 and
Yukata
, are seated in separate rooms for a written exam. By demonstrating excellent communication skills and commitment to each other, Matsuri and her team pass. They are sent to the
Demon Desert
 for the second stage, which they reach within three days, thus qualifying them to participate.

To pass the second stage, Matsuri and her team must acquire two scrolls within three days, one of which they are given at the start, the other of which they must take from another competing team. When, after several days, they still have not acquired a second scroll, Mikoshi suggests taking the scroll from somebody who already has two and therefore may have let their guards down. While searching for such a team they get lost in a sandstorm and fall into quicksand. They are saved and looked after by
Fū
, who offers them her scroll when they wake up. Matsuri and her team decline, following Gaara's example of persevering through struggles.

Matsuri and her team are later
captured
 by
Hōichi
. They are found and rescued by Gaara, but he ends up being captured by Hōichi instead. Gaara, now the
Kazekage
, orders them to leave him behind and escape. They ignore him and go looking for help, eventually coming across
Team Guy
. Matsuri offers Team Guy their scroll in exchange for helping Gaara, though they decide to help without payment. While guiding Team Guy to Gaara's location they run into Fū's teammates, Fū having also been captured by Hōichi. Their teams join forces and successfully rescue Gaara and Fū.






Matsuri challenging Shira.



As the end of the exam nears, Matsuri seeks out
Shira
, a fellow Suna-nin and supporter of Gaara. Matsuri proposes that they fight and that the victor will receive the other's scroll, terms that Shira agrees to. Matsuri manages to force Shira to use his Seven Heavens Breathing Method and she loses, but takes her defeat in stride. They and their teams accompany each other to the final rendezvous point for the second stage, where they are informed the Chūnin Exams have been cancelled. Instead, a report on each participant's performance will be sent to their village and their respective village leader will decide if they should be promoted.
