Jin
 (
ジーン
,
Jīn
) is a thief.

Personality

He is a rather violent yet cowardly person who immediately gave up when they were surrounded by stronger opponents. Like his leader, Jin is greedy and eager to find the Gekkōran flower due to its high black market value.

Appearance

Jin is a man of average height with medium length blond hair and black eyes. He wears a blue shirt, pants and sandals, and a white cloth draped over his shoulders.

Abilities

Jin and his comrades use traps that have knives in them, with which they even managed to injure
Shikadai Nara
. However, they are very weak and were easily defeated the first time by the forces of
Iwabee Yuino
 and
Wasabi Izuno
, and simply surrendered the second time.

New Era

Jin and his group went to search for the
Gekkōran flower
, but they failed, causing them to hunt
Tonsuke
 as only he was able to find the flower. The thieves attacked Shikadai Nara's group and tricked them, stealing the piglet and injuring Shikadai despite being beaten up themselves. At a cliff,
Konohagakure
 shinobi caught up with them, but the thieves ran away. A new attempt to find the flower was unsuccessful as Tonsuke was hungry, and afterwards, Shikadai and his team surrounded Jin and his comrades, causing them to give up and also take the pig.

Trivia

Jin and his fellow thief,
Teo
, were created as a collaboration between the
Boruto
 anime and the Japanese YouTuber duo
SKY PEACE
.
 Correspondingly, Jin is named after the member who voices him.
