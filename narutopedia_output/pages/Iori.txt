Iori
 (
衣織
) was a villager of
Green Banks
.

Background

Upon the Pale Blue Valley offering to buy the deed to Green Banks' bridge, Iori hired
Hidari
 and
Ashimaru
 under the belief they were
shinobi
 that could be trusted. Acquiring
poison
 from them, he poisoned the Green Banks'
village head
, Tofu, resulting in his death.

Personality

Iori was a very dishonest and selfish man. Loyal to only himself, he looked for the quickest way to make money. Seeing the Green Banks' bridge as his chance for a fortune, he had no qualms about killing the village head and kidnapping his daughter
Kiri
. He was also careless, having hired who he thought were trustworthy and legal ninja to assist him in committing crimes, not knowing they were actually renegades, and expecting things to go smoothly. This nature made him very naïve and would ultimately end up costing Iori his life.

Appearance

Iori was a short, stocky man with purple eyes, short brown hair, and a small goatee. He wore a grey jacket with bandaged sleeves over which he wore a green vest with yellow trim, dark green pants, and a pair of plain sandals.

Expecting
Kiri
 to handle everything herself after becoming the new village head, Iori was discouraged to learn that she instead hired
Konohagakure
 for aid. With the help of his own hired ninja, Iori was able to kidnap Kiri during a division. While gloating about how smoothly things worked out, he met with Hidari and Ashimaru, who quickly betrayed and stabbed him, horrified at his own end as he died.
