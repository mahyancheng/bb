Inabi Uchiha
 (
うちはイナビ
,
Uchiha Inabi
) was an officer of the
Konoha Military Police Force
 and a member of the
Uchiha clan
.

Background

Alongside
Yashiro
 and
Tekka Uchiha
, Inabi questioned
Itachi Uchiha
 about his whereabouts during the time when
Shisui Uchiha
 supposedly committed suicide. He told Itachi that they had all intention of duly investigating the matter and when they presented Shisui's alleged suicide note, he stated that for someone who wielded the Sharingan it would be no problem to forge such a note. They then left the note with Itachi telling him to ask the Anbu to investigate the matter as well. As the men left, they passed snide, suggestive comments about Itachi's involvement in the matter which Itachi took offence to and attacked them. Fed up with Itachi, the men asked
Fugaku
 who had just arrived, to issue the order to arrest Itachi. However after Itachi apologised and Fugaku offered the excuse that Itachi was worn out from his other duties the men left.

Inabi and the rest of the clan were later killed during the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
. In
Book of Dark Night
, Itachi killed Inabi's wife before either were aware of his presence. Inabi attempted to attack Itachi with a
fire
 jutsu, but Itachi cut his head off before the flames could leave his mouth.

Personality

Inabi was very confident in his abilities as a member of the famed Uchiha clan. Like Yashiro, Inabi was very straightforward. He referred to Itachi as an insolent child and wanted him arrested.

Appearance

Inabi had shoulder length black hair and dark eyes. He wore the standard attire of the Uchiha clan which consisted of a long sleeved, high-collared outfit with matching pants. As a member of the police force, he wore the standard Konoha
shinobi
 outfit with the symbol of the police force on his shoulder. Apparently before his demise, in the anime, he gained an x-shaped scar on his right cheek, which he retained after being reincarnated by
Kabuto
.

Abilities






Inabi with his Sharingan activated.



As an Uchiha, Inabi had rather strong chakra. He was also one of select members that was able to awaken his clan's
kekkei genkai
: the
Sharingan
,
 which granted him basic abilities such as seeing and differentiating the flow of chakra, see through and cast genjutsu, plus copying techniques and some predictive capabilities. He was also a senior member of the
Konoha Military Police
 and, in the anime,
reincarnated
 later by Kabuto Yakushi, further implying that Inabi was a very skilled shinobi. He also appeared adept in the use of
kenjutsu
. In the anime, it is shows that he is able to use
Fire Release
, spitting a stream of fire to incinerate his target.

Inabi reincarnated.



In the anime, Kabuto Yakushi
reincarnated
 Inabi for the attack on
Tonika Village
. Days later, Inabi was summoned again to battle against
Shiseru
 and the
Hachō Village
 militia and was called back to his coffin when Kabuto retreats.

Inabi was summoned yet another time to battle
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Sakura Haruno
 and soon other back up from Konoha. He was eventually constricted by
Shikamaru Nara
's
Shadow Sewing Technique
 until the latter released when the
Nine-Tails clone
 of Naruto attacked, stepping on Inabi and the other constricted reincarnated shinobi. During interrogation on
Dokku
, Dokku attempted to attack
Disonasu
 for the massacre of his village and Inabi subdued the man.
