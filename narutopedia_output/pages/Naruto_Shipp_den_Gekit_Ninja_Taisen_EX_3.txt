Naruto Shippūden: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! EX 3
 is the seventh instalment of the
Gekitō Ninja Taisen
 series.

Gameplay

The game includes three game modes that are new to the series. Naruto's transformation now has
three tails
. Another new feature is the Senzai Ninriki (translated in
Clash of Ninja Revolution 3
 as Latent Ninja Powers), where every character glows a certain colour when they hit low health/crisis mode. Similar to gaining new specials in crisis mode as of the first
Revolution
 game
 and beforehand
Naruto: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! 3
, the Senzai Ninriki is a special crisis mode that provides certain effects depending on the character, for example Naruto and Temari's backward strong attacks no longer use up chakra, Hinata can chakra cancel her attacks with no chakra cost, Kakashi deals damage through guard with all his attacks, Neji and Gaara automatically deflect projectiles while standing still, certain characters' moves become unblockable and so on. Most of the characters' Senzai Ninriki effects change in
Naruto Shippūden: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3
 onwards.

One of the game's new modes is the "Hurricane Clash Mode", which is also reworked into the new story mode which is original from the main storyline. In this mode, the player controls their character in a full 3D movement perspective and can take on hordes of ninja in a beat em' up genre fashion, with many character movesets retweaked solely for this mode. This style has not appeared in any later
Gekitō Ninja Taisen
/
Clash of Ninja
 games ever since.

Furthermore, players can now toggle off stage hazards, obstacles, and stage transitions. The very latter allows either tier of a stage to be played on, but at the cost of no stage jumping as an obvious trade-off.

Trivia

Hidan
, along with
Chōji
 and
Jirōbō
, are the only characters who do not backflip with their backdashes.

Hidan also dual-wields both his
scythe
 and his
collapsible spear
 in this series; something not seen in other media.

Hidan also does not use hand seals, as he instead does preaching/praying motions for his "hand seals" instead.
