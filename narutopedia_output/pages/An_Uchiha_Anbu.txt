Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

As word spreads that
a new member
 was joining the
Anbu
 — the youngest one ever and an
Uchiha
, the current members deem that they would test the young man's mettle. Meanwhile,
Guy
 makes a bid to
Hiruzen
 to join the Anbu after realising that
Kakashi
 was becoming withdrawn once more, however, he is rejected not only by the Third, but by
Danzō
 as well who informs him that he lacked the quality of "
darkness
".
Fugaku
 congratulates his son for his enrolment into the Anbu reminding him of his obligation to the Uchiha. Danzō, on the other hand, tasks Itachi with keeping them informed of the clan's actions.
 Danzō and Hiruzen orchestrate a two-sided mission against the
Prajñā Group
:
Might Guy
,
Kosuke Maruboshi
, and two other ninja were to exchange scrolls with the group while Kakashi and Itachi were to assassinate the group that was suspected of double-crossing
Konohagakure
. The higher-ups suspicions are confirmed when the Prajñā Group attacks the Konoha-nin; a battle ensues and the Prajñā-nin are defeated. Horrified by their real mission, Guy watches on as the two Anbu assassinate the opponents. Returning to the village, Guy is debriefed and pleads with Hiruzen to release Kakashi from the Anbu, fearing what he had become. Meanwhile, at the
Naka Shrine
, the Uchiha hold a meeting with Itachi reporting the standing of the village as
Shisui
 watches on. As he sits down, Itachi spots the
stone tablet
 behind his father and begins reading it with his
Sharingan
.
