The
Expansive Truth-Seeking Ball
 is a Kekkei Mōra ninjutsu used by Kaguya Ōtsutsuki. It is composed of all five elemental
nature transformations
 as well as
Yin–Yang Release
.

Usage

Kaguya Ōtsutsuki used the
God Tree
 to absorb chakra from all the people trapped inside the
God: Nativity of a World of Trees
 technique to create a maximised
Truth-Seeking Ball
. A vast expanding mass of chaos with power to reshape the world by obliterating it to nothing first. Unlike the standard Truth-Seeking Ball, which a user starts with a set amount of spheres that cannot be regenerated if lost or destroyed, this technique does not have such limitations and can be generated from nothing.

The sphere will continue to expand until it overwrites the previous dimension, completely annihilating it. If this happens, even previously synced
Space–Time Ninjutsu
 will be unable to return to the new dimension.

Trivia

In the original publication of
chapter 689
,
Black Zetsu
 lists
Wood
 as one of the component natures of the Expansive Truth-Seeking Balls, rather than
Water
.

Masashi Kishimoto
 confirmed this was an error in Issue #41 of
Weekly Shōnen Jump
, and stated that it would be corrected in the
tankōbon release
 of the chapter.
