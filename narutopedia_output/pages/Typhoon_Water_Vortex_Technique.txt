This
cooperation ninjutsu
 uses the wild rotation of the thrown
Wind Release: Rasengan
 to swallow up the water current created by the
Water Release: Tearing Torrent
, creating a large quantity of water vapour. Once invoked, a strong wind whirls around inside the highly concentrated mist, turning it into a solid barrier. The mist created by the violent rotation of the Rasengan also has the effect of taking away the enemy's field of vision. Of course, the mist can be used as a smokescreen when escaping, but the confusion it creates can also be used, for instance, to launch a surprise attack. If one can use multiple natures, it is possible to perform this technique alone.
