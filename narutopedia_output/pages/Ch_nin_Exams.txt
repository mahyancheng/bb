This article is about the actual exams.  For other uses, see
Chūnin Exams (disambiguation)
.

The
Chūnin Selection Exams
 (
中忍選抜試験
,
Chūnin Senbatsu Shiken
)
 are an opportunity for
genin
 to be promoted to
chūnin
. The exam structure and evaluation processes differ from one exam to the next so that genin cannot come prepared. Villages originally held their own individual exams. Following the
Third Shinobi World War
, exams that are open to all villages started being held bi-annually,
 with villages taking turns for hosting responsibilities. These shared exams improve relations between the villages, present up-and-coming ninja to clients, and create an opportunity for gambling, betting on matches, which even the
daimyō
 participate in.

Although the exams, specifically the final round matches, are designed for there to be an ultimate "winner", success does not guarantee promotion nor does failure preclude it; if the observing ninja and daimyō feel a genin displays the necessary qualities for a chūnin, that genin will be promoted regardless of how they place in the exams. For this reason it is possible for as many as all of the finalists to pass, or even for none of them to. Being victorious simply expands the participant's chances of demonstrating their qualities in the next match. Because of the requirements demanded of chunin, there are, in general observation, a handful of genin that pass, while those that have not fulfilled the requirements may return again.

Due to the extreme and competitive nature of the exams, all participants willing to enter are contracted to sign a waver in the case of permanent injury or death. There is also no "wrong" way to achieve the objectives of the exams, where trickery or force is often used between entrants. It is not considered a shame to back down from these dangers the exams present. Though with great pretense of trial by combat and survival of the fittest, not all of the aspiring ninja who participate behold noble ends, and the exams themselves in this instance may also be considered a "contained war" where younger and maturing genin who have come of age can be properly exposed to the tribulations and more difficult situations ninja will encounter in their career.

Having too many participants to advance to the next stages seems to be an undesired result, as the examiners tend to run additional preliminaries to reduce the number of finalists.

Known Exams

Konoha-Only

Konohagakure
 held one of its own Chūnin Exams around the time of the Third Shinobi World War. Genin had to enter as part of a three-man team. The three stages were not held consecutively, allowing participants to recuperate between stages.

Second Stage

Held in the
Forest of Death
, the second stage consisted of tournament battles between three-man teams. The
Third Hokage
 and the team's leader monitored the fights remotely. Loss of a match did not necessarily prevent a genin from continuing to the finals.

Known fights

Team of
Ibiki Morino
,
Hayate Gekkō
, and
Tokara
 defeated
Team Orochimaru
.

Team Minato
 fought
Team Chōza
.

Finals

The finals consisted of one-on-one tournament battles.

Known fights

Might Guy
 defeated
Obito Uchiha
.

Kakashi Hatake
 defeated Might Guy. Kakashi was successfully promoted to chūnin.

Konoha-Held

At the start of Part I,
Konohagakure
 hosts the second of the year's two Chūnin Exams. Genin must enter as part of a three-man team. Prior to the first stage,
Izumo Kamizuki
 and
Kotetsu Hagane
 (disguised as genin) try to discourage others from participating.

First Stage

Held in
Academy
 classroom 301
 and proctored by
Ibiki Morino
, the first stage is, at a glance, an hour-long written test of ten questions. However, the first nine questions are too difficult for an average genin to be able to answer. The real objective, therefore, is to cheat: either copy from one of the few genin that can answer the questions or from one of the chūnin embedded with the examinees. If a genin is caught cheating five times, they and the rest of their team are disqualified. The goal is also to force the genin to apply critical thinking. In most cases, being caught cheating means instant failure, but the two-point reduction is meant to give them a chance instead of trying again without being caught and make them realise they have to cheat. Getting the correct answer to these nine questions is not ultimately important, as it is possible to pass without answering any of them at all.

Forty-five minutes in to the first stage, genin are given the opportunity to answer the tenth question. They are first warned that, if they answer the question incorrectly, they will not be allowed to take the exams ever again; if they forfeit - which also disqualifies the rest of their team - before hearing the question, they will be allowed to retake the exams another time. This option is, itself, the tenth question; if a genin is willing to face the unknown of the tenth question, they are ready to be a chūnin. Ibiki tried everything imaginable to get as many genin to drop out as much as possible.
Naruto Uzumaki
's open determination to face this unknown inspires all of the remaining genin, causing 26 teams, a higher number than average, to pass to the second stage.

Second Stage

Proctored by
Anko Mitarashi
, the second stage takes place in the
Forest of Death
. Three-man teams are given either a Heaven Scroll (
天の書
,
Ten no Sho
) or an Earth Scroll (
地の書
,
Chi no Sho
) before entering the forest. They then have five days for the entire team to reach the building in the centre of the forest with one of each scroll in their possession; how they acquire the other scroll is up to them, by force or by trade being the most common options. Because of the natural hazards of the forest, the absence of services or outside assistance, and the likely conflict with other teams, genin must sign liability waivers before entering to release Konoha from responsibility for any injuries or deaths.

If a team loses their starting scroll they are not automatically disqualified, as they may use the remaining time to acquire another copy of the scroll they've lost. By the same extension, acquiring both scrolls does not guarantee completion of the second stage, as they still must reach the centre building in time. As the second stage goes on, teams that have lost their scroll will tend to gather around the building, hoping to prey on those with both. Alternately, teams that already have both scrolls can linger outside the building, taking scrolls from others to reduce the competition of later stages.

Genin are forbidden from opening either scroll until they have reached the central building. If they follow this instruction, the scroll will
summon
 a higher-ranked ninja to grant them advancement to the next stage. If they do not follow this instruction, the ninja will render them and everyone else in the area unconscious for the duration of the second stage.

The
Three Sand Siblings
, in particular, have broken the previous record by making it to the tower with both scrolls in 97 minutes.

Anko herself was surprised that 21 genin made it, even though less than half would make it anyway due to the nature of the test, believing that no more than 3 teams would pass.

Preliminaries





The arena for the preliminaries.



Because too many genin end up passing the second stage, a single round of randomly selected one-on-one matches is held where only the victor will get to continue on. Participants' advancement to the finals is no longer contingent upon the success of their teammates; it is for this excuse that
Kabuto Yakushi
 forfeits before the preliminaries start. Matches are refereed by
Hayate Gekkō
 while others are free to observe. Genin are encouraged to watch each others' fights carefully to help them prepare for fighting each other in the finals; indeed, after the preliminaries are finished the finalists are told who they will fight in the first round so they can plan accordingly.

Finals





The arena for the finals.



The finals are held a month after the completion of the preliminaries so that finalists have a chance to recuperate and prepare. This also allows news of the matchups to get around and attract greater publicity for the event. The finals consist of one-on-one tournament battles refereed by
Genma Shiranui
 (originally planned to be reffed by
Hayate Gekkō
 before his death).

Shikamaru Nara
 was originally scheduled to fight
Dosu Kinuta
 in the first round of the finals, and the victor of that match would then fight
Temari
. However, Dosu is killed before the finals take place, so Shikamaru and Temari are matched from the beginning.
Kankurō
 surrendered before his match with
Shino Aburame
 began in order to preserve
his weapon
's secrets for the planned coup. The finals themselves are interrupted by and cancelled because of the
Konoha Crush
. Shikamaru, though he forfeits his match, is ultimately the only participant to be promoted to chūnin by default.

Konoha–Suna Joint

In the anime,
Konohagakure
 and
Sunagakure
 hold a joint Chūnin Exam during the gap in time between Part I and Part II. Although they invite all the other respective villages to participate, only
Takigakure
,
Kusagakure
 and
Amegakure
 accept. The participating genin must enter as part of a three-man team. Although publicly meant to symbolise the growing alliance between Konoha and Suna, the exams are actually held to help restore Konohagakure's reputation after the events of the last exams being interrupted. A second hidden goal for these exams was to draw out
Akatsuki
, with the
Fifth Kazekage
 (a
jinchūriki
) being the bait.

First Stage

Proctored by
Shikamaru Nara
, the first stage is a written test that takes place in Konoha. Members from each team are split into in one of three rooms while taking the test. The goal for this test is to see how well the team-mates know each other, as each member of a team must answer one of three questions and depending on the question picked will decide whether the team passes or fails. Ultimately, the team members have to achieve a combined score of 100 points.

Along with the three question choice test, there is a bonus question that must be answered unanimously by each team which asks what member of their respective team would be chosen to be a decoy and the one picked will be disqualified. This happens to be a trick question as all members of a team must be present in order to be qualified for the second round.
 Communication between team-mates is allowed.

Second Stage





The Demon Desert.



Proctored by
Temari
, the second stage takes place in Suna's Demon Desert. Teams are given either a Heaven Scroll or an Earth Scroll before entering the desert. They then have three days for the entire team to reach the building in the centre of the desert with one of each scroll in their possession. Because of the risks involved with this second stage, genin must sign liability waivers before entering.

Because of attacks on the Kazekage and one of the exam's
participants
, the exams are cancelled at the end of the second stage. Performance reports on all participants, including those who did not acquire the necessary scrolls, are instead sent back to their respective village, with the choice to promote them left up to their village's leader.
 Known promotions are:

Five Village Co-Sponsorship

Fifteen years after the end of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, the villages of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 for the first time co-sponsor the year's Chūnin Exams, which is held in
Konohagakure
. In addition to genin of the five sponsoring villages, genin from
Amegakure
 and
Kusagakure
 are also seen. The participating genin must enter as part of a three-man team. 48 shinobi, divided into 16 teams participated in the Exams.

Although most ninja tools are permitted, the
Seventh Hokage
 forbids the usage of the
Kote
, a recent invention that enables anyone to use any
ninjutsu
 without training or
chakra
. As the Hokage explains, the Kote defeats the exams' purpose of nurturing the shinobi arts.

First Stage






Exam Venue B.



Proctored by
Sai Yamanaka
 and designed by
Shikamaru Nara
, the first stage is held at
Exam Venue B
 and is initially presented as a simple true or false question. All teams are given the same question regarding the fifth volume of a book on shinobi strategies and, as a team, are instructed to stand next to a flag representing what they believe the correct answer to be. Once all teams gather at their selected answer, they are dropped into a pit because, in truth, there is no fifth volume of that book and therefore no correct answer. Shortly before being dropped, the genin are warned that anyone who "turns black" will fail.

The actual objective of the exam is for genin, once dropped into the pit, to not get any of the ink that pools at the bottom of each pit on themselves. By not falling in the ink, genin demonstrate quick thinking and a willingness to persevere despite apparent failure, thus allowing them to continue to the second stage.

In the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime, Exam Venue B is preceded by
Exam Venue A
. Exam Venue A serves as a place where all participating genin are told by Sai that the first exam will start in another venue which involves a true or false question and to enter the next exam venue, each team would have to go through a series of traps and make it to the next venue within the allotted time limit or else they fail and are not allowed to take the exam. The participants are expected to leave while Sai is still explaining the rules, having already started the timer, and Tenten oversees the activation of traps along the way, increasing their difficulty as deemed necessary.

Eight teams made it to this round. Proctored by
Tenten
 with assistance from
Shino Aburame
, the second stage is held three days after the first. Teams are paired against each other in a game of
capture the flag
. Teams must simultaneously defend their own flag and capture the opposing team's flag in order to pass to the final rounds. The movie's novelisation adds that teams are not allowed to kill opponents, partly for humane reasons, but also in order to test genin's ability to keep and benefit from prisoners.

The stadium for the finals.



Four teams passed the previous round and made it into the finals. The finals are tournament matches held in a stadium, observed by the five
Kage
 and any other interested parties. Refereed by
Rock Lee
, the first two rounds are one-on-one matches and the third round is a three-way match between the remaining finalists.

Boruto Uzumaki
 is caught using the
Shinobi Gauntlet
 during his second match (the finals in the anime) and for that reason he is disqualified by the Hokage. The Hokage is immediately afterwards attacked by
Kinshiki
 and
Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki
 and the stadium is destroyed in the ensuing battle, thus forcing the tournament's cancellation. In the novelisation, the exams continued after Momoshiki's death.

Konoha Re-Examination

In the anime, following Isshiki's attack, Naruto decides to reorganise the exam that was interrupted by Momoshiki's attack. The exam is also reorganised in other villages, but are held separately.

First Round

A written exam. The genin are expected to cheat for answers without being caught, and they must achieve an average of 70 points per team member. Teams

Second Round

Participants must rescue proctors in the role of injured allies from the Forest of Death, while avoiding traps, wildlife, and proctors in the role of enemy shinobi within a 45 minute time limit. Instead of being graded as a team, each participant is evaluated individually. Passing or failing also depends on the performance during the entirety of the exam, not just the completion of the exam.

One-on-one matches between those who advanced to the final round. As the focus of this round is the ability to improvise and adapt to situations, the matches are only announced the day of the exam. Unlike previous exams, the use of Scientific Ninja Tools is permitted, as long as the tool in question was personally developed by the genin taking the exam. Contestants not present at the time their name is drawn are disqualified. The matches were broadcast live on KONOHA-TV.

Referenced Exams

Although only four Chūnin Exams have been depicted in the series, many others have been referenced:

Manabu Akado
 has taken and failed the exams on seventeen prior occasions.

The
Third Hokage
 remembers
Kabuto Yakushi
 dropping out before the finals during a previous exam. Kabuto's records state he has failed five other times as well.

In the anime,
Ibiki Morino
 proctored the first stage of the exams before. Each time he changed the tenth question, such as giving the choice of either quitting and having the whole squad fail or continuing and having the lowest scoring member of the squad be forced to remain a genin forever (solution is to quit, rather than sacrifice squad members for personal gain).

In the anime,
Idate Morino
 was failed during the first exam by Ibiki, and was asked by him in private to stop attempting to be a ninja.

Unlike Naruto's exam, Idate and his classmates were put against each other, where one member of their squad would be disqualified and barred from retaking the exam, while the other two would pass and be allowed to continue; in reality, this was to test the class if they were willing to sacrifice one of their teammate's future for their own, and those who chose to stay were unworthy of continuing on and failed.

Shikamaru Nara
 is in the planning stages for another Chūnin Exam at the start of Part II, the obligations of which prevent him from participating in the
Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission
.

Trivia

As the exams are an opportunity for gambling, observers who placed a wager may tend to sabotage the opposing genin participant for their own benefit, as two chūnin (
Midori
 and
Shiba
) were sent to stop
Gaara
 from competing at all against
Sasuke Uchiha
, though the two were brutally killed instead.

In
Find the Four-Leaf Red Clover!
,
Kakashi
 says that genin who went to and returned from
Akagahara
 were accepted as
chūnin
.

In
Chūnin Exam on Fire! Naruto vs. Konohamaru!
, use of
senjutsu
 is against the rules as it would give
Naruto Uzumaki
 an unfair advantage. Indeed, Naruto, who was not listening when this was explained, was immediately disqualified when he used senjutsu.
