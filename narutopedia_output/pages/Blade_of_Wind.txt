Baki emits
chakra
 from his fingertips, creating an invisible sword out of
wind
 that he attacks opponents with. Because opponents can't see it, and because of how precise Baki can be with his attacks, there is little opponents can do to defend against this technique. The Blade of Wind is to the
Sickle Weasel Technique
 what a
longsword
 is to a
kunai
.

Trivia

In the anime, the technique is seen being used in rapid succession in the form of disk-like projectiles with 'streams' of wind following its rotation. It had enough power to launch
a grown man
 several feet into the air.

In
Naruto Mobile
, Reto uses the technique in a way that is more similar to the blade version a
Sickle Weasel Technique
 than this.

In
Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 2
 and
3
, the attack takes on a drill-like shape.
