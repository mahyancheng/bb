When Haido is transformed into a monstrous humanoid, through the powers of the
Gelel Stone
, he is able to fire a giant bluish-green laser from the back of his right hand, where the stone is embedded. The blast is very powerful and can kill most people in one shot. The laser can be further augmented to fire a much larger blast.
