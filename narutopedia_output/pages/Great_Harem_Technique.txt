Konohamaru clones himself and holds his opponent in place. He then transform himself and his clones into bikini-clad girls who swarm his opponent. While the opponent is distracted, Konohamaru and a clone ram them with a Rasengan.

Trivia

When used against certain male characters such as
Iruka
,
Jiraiya
, and
Hiruzen Sarutobi
, instead of konohamaru ramming his opponent with a Rasengan, Konohamaru (in female form) approaches them and puckers up his lips, causing the latter to have a massive nosebleed that sends them flying.
