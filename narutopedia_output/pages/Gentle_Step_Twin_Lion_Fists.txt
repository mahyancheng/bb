The
Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists
 is a high-level secret
Gentle Fist
 technique taught only to the main branch of the
Hyūga clan
.

Usage

The user changes the shape of
chakra
 released from both hands into large
guardian lion
-shaped shrouds. Doing so greatly increases range and destructive power. The lion heads drain the chakra network of those they touch. It is an extremely difficult ability to learn, as the slightest mistake in chakra control will lead to failure, meaning it is a feat requiring the
Byakugan
. This technique can be used in conjunction with the
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
.

Development

In the anime, it is shown that during some time in Part II after learning from
Ino
 of
Naruto
's
new technique
, Hinata trained with
Neji
 to develop her own. By expelling chakra from the
tenketsu
 as an innate ability exclusive to the Hyūga, and using precise chakra control, Hinata was able to shape the chakra around her fists in the form of blue guardian lions, as witnessed by both Neji and
Hanabi
.

Trivia

In
Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles
, Hinata can use this technique in conjunction with the
Eight Trigrams Thirty-Two Palms
.

In certain games, Hinata can use this technique as a ranged attack by launching the chakra lions directly at her opponent.
