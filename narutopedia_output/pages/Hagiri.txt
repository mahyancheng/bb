Hagiri
 (
ハギリ
) was a friend of
Tenma Izumo
 during their time in
Konohagakure
's
Academy
.

Background

Hagiri's mother and sister died during the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
 while he watched helplessly. Because many believed the attack to have been the doing of an
Uchiha
, Hagiri joined Tenma and
Katsura
 in bullying
Itachi Uchiha
. Despite being much younger than all of them, Itachi easily defeated them once a fight broke out.

Trivia

Written as 歯切り, "Hagiri" means "gnashing the teeth," which could allude to both his bullying nature and his grudge against Itachi.
