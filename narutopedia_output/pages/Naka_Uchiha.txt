Naka Uchiha
 (
うちはナカ
,
Uchiha Naka
) was a
shinobi
 of
Konohagakure
's
Uchiha clan
.

Background

Naka was a close comrade of
Naori Uchiha
. He was able to awaken his
Mangekyō Sharingan
 and became obsessed with the technique
Izanagi
, which he used to kill some of his own clansmen. In order to save him, Naori used
Izanami
 on him to force him to accept the truth, and see reality. After struggling for a while, Naka eventually accepted his fate and broke the loop caused by the Izanami.

He presumably died at some point either before or during the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
, along with the rest of the Uchiha clan.

Appearance

Naka had grey chin-length hair,
 and wore the typical attire of the Uchiha clan which comprised of a high-collared shirt with the clan's symbol emblazoned on the back, a Konohagakure
forehead protector
, and a variation of the village's
flak jacket
 which more closely resembled the one worn by
Anbu
; it had a pouch on the left strap, and no band woven around the waist. Accompanying this was a large equipment pouch and a
tantō
 strapped across his lower back.

Abilities






Naka's Mangekyō Sharingan.



Naka was at least skilled with
kenjutsu
, considering he had a
sword
. He was able to awaken his clan's
dōjutsu

kekkei genkai
: the
Sharingan
. The dōjutsu granted him the ability to use the technique Izanagi, which he apparently used obsessively with such skills that he could survive combat against several other Uchiha. He was also able to activate the Mangekyō Sharingan, which took the form of a red, three-point pinwheel with his pupil being prominent in the centre.

Trivia

"Naka" (
南賀
) means "southern joy". Also his name read together with Naori's forms the word "nakanaori" (仲直り) meaning "Reconciliation", a possible reference to him accepting his fate trough the Izanami.

Naka's Mangekyō Sharingan greatly resembles that of
Itachi Uchiha
 insofar as it seems to be a negative form of Itachi's Mangekyō Sharingan, the only other differences being its pupil having a circle around it and the blade shapes being wider.

While not appearing in the manga, Naka and the other Uchiha featured in the episode make a cameo in the final chapter of
Sasuke Uchiha's Sharingan Legend
.
