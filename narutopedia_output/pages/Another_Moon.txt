Summary

Naruto
 wakes up and is told by
Shikamaru
 that
Sasuke
 is nowhere to be found, and that the
Anbu
 they were fighting retreated. While
Tsunade
 updates
Minato
 on the shinobi Sasuke attacked when he left the village,
Shizune
 arrives with news someone infiltrated the village.
Pain
 arrives and talks to Tsunade, vowing to cause the village pain. Pain attacks the village with a
gigantic Chibaku Tensei
. Naruto and the others arrive in the morning to find a crater where
Konohagakure
 was supposed to be, with the Chibaku Tensei floating above it.

Neji
 confirms the chakra of the villagers is inside it with his
Byakugan
. Naruto meets up with
Sakura
, who was away on a mission and is also puzzled by what happened. Sakura begins healing Naruto's injuries, and Naruto uses the time to mould senjutsu chakra. Inside the Chibaku Tensei, Minato discovers he can't teleport outside. The Chibaku Tensei begins compacting, and

Trivia

The fight between Naruto and the Deva Path far more closely resembles chapter 438 of the manga than episode 167, which was mostly anime original and had many of the scenes from the manga altered.
