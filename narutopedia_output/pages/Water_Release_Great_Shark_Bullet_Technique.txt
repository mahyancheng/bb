The
Water Release: Great Shark Bullet Technique
 is a stronger version of the
Water Release: Water Shark Bullet Technique
.

Usage

The user creates a gigantic shark out of water and, by thrusting both hands forward, sends it to attack the opponent. This technique differs from the original, since this one is able to absorb the
chakra
 from an opponent's technique and in turn, use that chakra to grow larger and more powerful. Therefore, the stronger the opponent's technique is, the stronger this technique will get.
