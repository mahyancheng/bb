Trivia

While unnamed in the manga and anime, this technique was named in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
.

When Mifune performs this technique, he exclaims something which is similar to the name of the
technique
 he used against
Ibuse
, even though the motion of the technique is different.

The naming of the attack in Japanese is likely a pun off of the term yōjinbō (
用心棒
), which literally means "bouncer" or "bodyguard".

The naming of the attack in Japanese is also likely a reference to the
1961 Japanese samurai film
 co-written, produced, edited, and directed by Akira Kurosawa and staring Toshiro Mifune.
