"
Fade into the Moonlight
" (
月光に消ゆ
,
Gekkō ni Kiyu
) is episode 307 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

With a break in the fighting, the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 tend to the dead and injured. The
Logistical Support and Medical Division
 camp is ablaze with activity as
medical-nin
 try their best to save their comrades. Elsewhere,
Kabuto
 notes the body count climbing and decides to take further action.
Summoning
 a confused
Hayate Gekkō
, Kabuto fills him in on what had happened leading up to and after his death. At the medical camp, the corpses of shinobi with
kekkei genkai
 and
clans
 deemed important are being documented and
sealed
 away to be returned after the war.
 Wanting to take the opportunity to collect samples, Kabuto reincarnates a
Suna
 and
Kumogakure
 shinobi to form a team with Hayate. This team infiltrates the medical division's camp and causes mayhem on the ground. There, they steal the KIA
scroll
 that was being formulated by the medics. As they make their escape, the medics form a team to pursue them in order to retrieve the list. With the request that
Yūgao
 join the team, she protests that she could not, as Hayate was her former lover.
