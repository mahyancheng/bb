En Oyashiro enters Futsu in the
Coliseum
 to fight against
Sasuke Uchiha
, hoping that Futsu's victory will win ownership of Sasuke for him. Because he fought a
boil-user
 in the past, Sasuke is able to easily defeat Futsu with
Great Fireball Technique
. Although this means that Sasuke can claim ownership of Futsu, he declines and instead asks only to meet with Oyashiro. During their conversation, Sasuke is convinced to try and help Futsu and the Coliseum's other competitors. He therefore asks for a rematch with Futsu, whose minor injuries have already been healed. When Sasuke defeats Futsu again, he grants him his freedom. In the novel, Sasuke asks
Yamato
 to help Futsu and the other slaves he freed settle in
Konoha
; in the anime, the slaves are taken in by
Kumo
.
