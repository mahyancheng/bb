Dark Release
 (
冥遁
,
Meiton
,
Viz:
 Shade Style) is a combined
nature transformation

kekkei genkai
 that can be used to
absorb
, manipulate, and release
chakra
 taken from an opponent.
Hiruko
 used techniques of this nature through a mark on his left hand. This mark resembles two diamonds, one overlapping the other. Chakra is absorbed through the upper square, while it is released and manipulated through the lower.
  It is unknown what elements this nature entails.

To date, this form of nature manipulation has only been used by
Hiruko
, who obtained it using his
Chimera Technique
 to steal kekkei genkai in
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
 from an unknown shinobi.

Trivia

The kanji used for "Dark" (
冥
,
kurai
) does not directly mean "darkness". It is more related to "gloomy; ghostly; night; underworld".

The mark on Hiruko's palm also appears on the back of
his three subordinates
, suggesting that it is rather related to the Chimera Technique.

It is possible that Hiruko sealed the kekkei genkai into the Chimera mark, which would explain the method through which it is used.

Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki
 can use a similar ability with the
Rinnegan
 embedded in his hands.
