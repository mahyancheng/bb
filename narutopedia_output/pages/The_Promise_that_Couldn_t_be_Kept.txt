Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Shikamaru
 points out to
Tsunade
 that a
medical-nin
 should have been assigned to the
Sasuke Recovery Team
. She agrees, but says that being a medical-nin requires "something special". Shikamaru goes to visit
Naruto
 in the hospital and gets confirmation that
Sasuke
 would not come back to
Konoha
.
Sakura
 overhears this but pretends not to, entering the room to see how Naruto is doing. Naruto apologises for failing but she avoids the subject. He persists, saying that he will one day fulfil his promise of bringing Sasuke home. Seeing how much Naruto has gone through, Sakura leaves after telling him that he won't need to fulfil that promise by himself next time. Sakura goes to see Tsunade and asks to learn how to become a medical-nin. Seeing that Sakura has that "special something", the desire to avoid losing those one is close to, Tsunade accepts.
