The
Prajñā Group
 (
般若衆
,
Hannyashū
,
English TV:
 Hannya Black Ops) is a regiment of the
Anbu
 of the
Land of Woods
.

History

In the anime, about six years after the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
, the village moved for a potential alliance with the Land of Woods, agreeing to trade special scrolls as a sign of trust. The Prajñā Group was assigned to go to the meeting point. Ultimately, the Prajñā Group betrayed the Konoha-nin, attempting to kill them after receiving the enemy's scroll. Their attempt was thwarted by a
Konoha
 Anbu team appointed by
Danzō Shimura
 of
Root
 and all but annihilating the Prajñā Group.
 Nine years later, on his way to the
Kage Summit
, the remnants of this group emerged in the hope of exacting revenge against Danzō. In spite of his old age, Danzō responded by killing every single member of the group, resulting in the Prajñā Group being wiped out forever.

In the manga, they fought with extremely long
kunai
 that lacked rings at the end. In the anime, they were shown using
Earth Release
 to
drop massive chunks of rock
 at their opponents.

Trivia

Prajñā
 is a Buddhist concept, often translated as
wisdom
. There are many interpretations of Prajñā, but it usually refers to the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about enlightenment.

In the anime, the sword-length
kunai
 used by these Anbu were replaced with regular kunai and
swords
.

"Prajñā" is also a translation of the word "
hannya
", which is a mask used in
noh
 theatre to represent a jealous female demon. This is in reference to the design of the mask being worn by all the members.

This is further emphasised in the anime when the group's leader is shown to be a woman who calls the rest of the team with a demonic laugh.

A Prajñā member appears as one of the bosses in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Blazing
 in the mission "
Kakashi
: Shadow of the ANBU Black Ops".
