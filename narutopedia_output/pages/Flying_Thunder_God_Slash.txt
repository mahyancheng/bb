This article is about the bukijutsu technique used by Tobirama Senju. For the ninjutsu from which it is derived, see
Flying Thunder God Technique
. For other uses, see
Hiraishin
.

A technique combining the use of a bladed weapon and
space–time ninjutsu
. The user teleports to a marked target, with weapon in hand, to instantaneously deliver a swift, devastating slash to his opponent. Because of the speed of the technique's execution, not even an individual wielding the
Sharingan
 — a dōjutsu capable of predicting movement — has enough reaction time to defend themselves against this technique, especially if the user is already physically fast.

In the anime, Tobirama used a marked kunai hidden with other thrown kunai, allowing him to attack a target that dodged his projectile attack.

Trivia

Despite using Space–Time Ninjutsu and weapons, the databook classifies this technique as
taijutsu
.
