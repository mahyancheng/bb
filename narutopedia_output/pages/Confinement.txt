Summary

To share the thrill of getting to fight one's former masters,
Orochimaru
 summons the
First Hokage
 and the
Second Hokage
 for
Sarutobi
's benefit. Meanwhile,
Sakura
 informs
Naruto
 and
Shikamaru
 of the mission given to them by
Kakashi
.
Pakkun
 alerts them to the fact that they are being followed by nine
Otogakure
 ninja. Naruto suggests ambushing them, but Shikamaru states that this would waste too much time and that it would make no difference since they are all under-qualified to neutralise the ninja. Shikamaru volunteers to stay behind and buy time for Naruto and Sakura to catch up to
Sasuke
. The Oto ninja pick up on his trail, but it does not stop them from getting trapped by his shadow technique.
