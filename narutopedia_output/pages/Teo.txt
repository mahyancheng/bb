Teo
 (
テオー
,
Teō
) is a thief.

Personality

He is a rather violent yet cowardly person who immediately gave up when they were surrounded by stronger opponents. Like his leader, Teo is greedy and eager to find the Gekkōran flower due to its high black market value.

Appearance

Teo is a man of average height with short brown hair and black eyes. He wears a brown sweater with a lighter brown patch on his belly, pants and sandals, and glasses.

Abilities

Teo and his comrades use traps that have knives in them, with which they even managed to injure
Shikadai Nara
. However, they are very weak and were easily defeated the first time by the forces of
Iwabee Yuino
 and
Wasabi Izuno
, and simply surrendered the second time.

New Era

Teo and his group went to search for the
Gekkōran flower
, but they failed, causing them to hunt
Tonsuke
 as only he was able to find the flower. The thieves attacked Shikadai Nara's group and tricked them, stealing the piglet and injuring Shikadai despite being beaten up themselves. At a cliff,
Konohagakure
 shinobi caught up with them, but the thieves ran away. A new attempt to find the flower was unsuccessful as Tonsuke was hungry, and afterwards, Shikadai and his team surrounded Teo and his comrades, causing them to give up and also take the pig.

Trivia

Teo and his fellow thief,
Jin
, were created as a collaboration between the
Boruto
 anime and the Japanese YouTuber duo
SKY PEACE
.
 Correspondingly, Teo is named after the member who voices him, Teokun.
