Chainya
 (
チャイニャ
) is a
ninneko
 from
Cat Fortress
.

Background






Chainya spies on Sakura Haruno.



Chainya spied on Sakura when Team 7 sneaked into the Cat Fortress. Suspicious of her, Chainya fought her on the roof, and was besting her until a water tower was damaged, dousing Chainya in cold water, which dropped his body temperature, causing him to give up.

Personality

He is a very perceptive cat who suspected something was wrong with Sakura's disguise, while the other cats did not notice anything. He is also confident in his abilities, believing that he will defeat Sakura in a fight. Like any cat, Chainya does not like water.

Appearance

Chainya is a rather tall cat, given the fact that he walks on his hind legs, with black fur and brown ears. The fur has a lightning bolt pattern in the centre of its head and is yellow in colour in this area. He wears a sleeveless white kimono, but with a bow tie around the neck, and grey pants.

Abilities

Chainya is very flexible and dexterous, and has a decent level of
taijutsu
, surprising Sakura, who recognised the superiority of her opponent. He is able to
strengthen his claws with chakra
, countering with their help against a
kunai
, easily knocking it out of Sakura's hands. However, he has a weakness to water, which is why he lost the battle after being soaked by its strong flow.

Trivia

The second part of his name, "
nya
", means "
meow
" in Japanese.
