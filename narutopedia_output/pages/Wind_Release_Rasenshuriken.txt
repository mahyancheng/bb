Synopsis

Naruto
 forms his
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
 and has his
shadow clones
 corner
Kakuzu
. While Kakuzu deals with the clones, the real Naruto manages to sneak up on Kakuzu and tries to hit him with the Rasenshuriken; however, the technique dissipates mere seconds before impact, sparing Kakuzu any injuries. Kakuzu then uses his thick black threads to bind Naruto's body in an attempt to steal his heart.
Yamato
 uses his
Wood Release
 to launch an attack at Kakuzu while
Kakashi
 uses his speed and his
Chidori
 to slice the black threads and rescue Naruto.

In the woods, the dismembered
Hidan
 lies in the rubble as he curses
Shikamaru
, swearing on his god
Jashin
 that he will get his revenge. Shikamaru tells him their beliefs are different, as he chooses to believe in the
Will of Fire
. Throwing a
kunai
 with an
explosive tag
 attached, Shikamaru tells him that the only god he needs to worry about is him, since he is the one who will be passing judgment. The explosive tag then ignites and causes the dismembered Hidan to be buried. Shikamaru's deer,
Rikumaru
, unearths
Asuma
's lighter, which Shikamaru appreciates. He then exits the woods, only to be found by
Pakkun
,
Sakura
 and
Sai
, the former having been
summoned
 by Kakashi to aid the two find Shikamaru. Sakura and Sai are surprised to find out that Shikamaru had managed to defeat an immortal
Akatsuki
 member on his own, and the latter credits it due to him having a personal motive. With that, the four set off towards the clearing in order to provide
Teams 10

and 7
 with backup.

At the clearing,
Ino
 remarks how she viewed Naruto differently for a few seconds until his jutsu dissipated, while
Chōji
 remarks that based on the name "Rasenshuriken", he thought Naruto would have thrown it. Yamato clears up his confusion, stating that the techniques require a frontal attack. When Naruto decides to have another go, Chōji offers to back him up, with Kakashi stating that it would be for the better as they outnumber him by four; Naruto, however, brings up Kakashi's words about Naruto being the only
shinobi
 who could surpass the
Fourth Hokage
 and asks for another chance to go solo and prove his worth. Kakashi and Yamato grant Naruto the opportunity, and creating more shadow clones, Naruto prepares his Wind Release: Rasenshuriken once more.

Seeing Naruto getting ready to attack. Kakuzu unleashes the full power of his
Earth Grudge Fear
 ability and rushes towards the Naruto holding the Rasenshuriken, believing the others to be mere shadow clones that will be dispelled once the original dies. He impales Naruto and snuffs out the Rasenshuriken with his black threads, but is surprised when "Naruto" is dispelled, proving itself to be none other than a shadow clone. The real Naruto, along with two shadow clones, attack him from above with the Rasenshuriken; Kakuzu is surprised that Naruto hid amongst the shadow clones, and having no way to escape, is forced to take the brunt of the attack. The impact of the Rasenshuriken dispels both shadow clones and sends Naruto flying while propelling Kakuzu a few feet away in mid-air, the attack undoing his threads and bursting all of his hearts. With no more hearts or threads to maintain his body, Kakuzu falls to the ground, defeated. Meanwhile, Chōji, Ino, Yamato and Kakashi marvel at Naruto's success, with the latter being genuinely surprised that he was unable to track the Rasenshuriken's movements with his
Sharingan
 and that Naruto was able to successfully master what he and the Fourth Hokage could not - combining their
chakra nature
 with the
Rasengan
.
