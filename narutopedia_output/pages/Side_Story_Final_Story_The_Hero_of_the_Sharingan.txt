Naruto
 manga.

Summary

With his new
Sharingan
,
Kakashi
 is able to overcome the
Chidori
's weakness; though the attack is still fast, the Sharingan gives him enough reaction time to avoid counterattacks. He kills
Kakkō
 and returns to
Obito
's side. With
Iwagakure
 reinforcements incoming, Obito asks Kakashi to take
Rin
 away and protect her from harm. When the cave-in resumes, Kakashi reluctantly complies. Obito dies, regretting that he couldn't spend more time with his team while also regretting the fact that he couldn't tell Rin that he loved her. Kakashi attacks the newly arrived Iwagakure ninja to fulfil his promise, but soon loses consciousness. He awakes some time later to find the enemies dead, having been killed by
his master
. With Rin safe, they complete their mission by destroying the
Kannabi Bridge
.
