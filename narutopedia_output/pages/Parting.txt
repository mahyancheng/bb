"
Parting
" (
離別
,
Ribetsu
) is episode 260 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Sasuke

accepts
 the
Sound Four
's offer and becomes their leader. Meanwhile,
Shikamaru

informs

Naruto
 of Sasuke's defection from
Konoha
 and invites him to be a part of the
Sasuke Recovery Mission
, with
Neji
,
Chōji
, and
Kiba
 joining as well. En route to
Otogakure
,
Sakon and Ukon
 notify Sasuke that he is to consume a
Mind Awakening Pill
 in order to progress his
Cursed Seal of Heaven
 to its second state, although he must undergo suspended animation in the process. Using the
Dark Sealing Method
 in conjuction with the
Four Black Fogs Formation
, the four Oto-nin
place
 Sasuke in a sealed barrel as they transport him to
Orochimaru
.

Eventually, Naruto
catches up
 to Sasuke at the
Valley of the End
, asking Sasuke to return with him to Konoha. Sasuke merely rebuffs Naruto, who angrily tells him that the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 risked their lives just to bring him back to Konoha, although Sasuke is indifferent to their actions. Infuriated at Sasuke's callous demeanour, Naruto recalls how Chōji
took
 on
Jirōbō
 in order to give the others a chance to retrieve Sasuke and how Neji did the same when he decided to
battle

Kidōmaru
 single-handedly, reminding Naruto that Sasuke was lost in the darkness. Although they managed to
retrieve
 the barrel containing Sasuke, an incensed Sakon activated his
cursed seal
 and pursued them. Kiba and
Akamaru
, along with Sakon and Ukon, ended up
plummeting
 off a cliff, leaving Naruto and Shikamaru to deal with
Tayuya
. However,
Kimimaro
, one of Orochimaru's loyal servants, stole the barrel containing Sasuke and fled; Shikamaru decided to deal with Tayuya himself and instructed Naruto to follow Kimimaro. As Naruto caught up to his foe in a meadow, Sasuke
emerged
 from his barrier and laughed at his new power, before running away. Kimimaro decided to take advantage of Naruto's distraction in order to kill him, only for him to be
attacked
 by
Rock Lee
, who had arrived in the nick of time to allow Naruto to chase after Sasuke.

Gritting his teeth as he recalls all the potential sacrifices their fellow comrades made, Naruto
lunges
 towards Sasuke and punches him across the face, although Sasuke kicks him away. Landing in the water below, Naruto realises that Sasuke
intends to kill
 him. He attempts to reach out to his teammate, asking if the memories of
Team 7
 meant nothing to him, but Sasuke
replies
 that one thing made it worthwhile — his friendship with Naruto. Wishing to kill Naruto in order to obtain the
Mangekyō Sharingan
, Sasuke
rushes
 towards him with his
Chidori
 as Naruto creates a
shadow clone
 and counters the attack with his
Rasengan
. The clash sends the two of them flying in opposite directions, with Sasuke being amazed that Naruto was able to negate the effects of his Chidori. Sasuke activates his
cursed seal
 as he once more charges towards Naruto with his Chidori, this time succeeding in his attack, puncturing Naruto's right lung.

However, Naruto is enveloped in the
chakra
 of the
Nine-Tails
 and is able to fight back. Shocked at this new display of power, Sasuke
asks
 Naruto what he is, only for the latter to claim that he is his friend. Naruto viciously attacks Sasuke before pinning him to a rock while Sasuke shouts that Naruto would never understand the suffering he is enduring as he never had parents or siblings and asks why Naruto would go so far for him. Naruto replies that while all of that is true, he views Sasuke as the closest thing he has to a brother and thus is fighting to preserve that bond. Accepting Naruto as his equal, Sasuke puts on his
forehead protector
. As Naruto enters into his
one-tailed
 form, Sasuke accesses the second stage of his cursed seal and undergoes a transformation, gaining two giant wings as his skin becomes darker and his hair grows out. As the members of the Sasuke Recovery Team are saved, Sasuke prepares an enhanced Chidori while Naruto forms an augmented Rasengan, and the two collide.

Sasuke emerges victorious from the battle as Naruto is rendered unconscious. Deciding not to kill Naruto and to obtain power in his own way, Sasuke walks away from the Valley and finds his way to Otogakure, demanding Orochimaru to give him power. Meanwhile,
Kakashi
 and
Pakkun
 locate Naruto and bring him back home, as Naruto realises that he has failed in his mission and mentally mutters an apology to
Sakura
.
