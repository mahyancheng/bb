Nurari
 (
濡羅吏
) was a
shinobi
 from
Otogakure
 and a member of
Team Guren
.

Personality

Nurari, like some of his teammates, wanted nothing to do with Orochimaru and wished to flee. He enjoyed toying with his foes and constantly mocked them. He was also shown to be rather feminine through his voice and appearance, particularly his lipstick and eyelashes.

Appearance

Despite his slender and somewhat feminine appearance, he was male. He wore a full-body slime suit, leaving only his face uncovered. He wore dark green lipstick, his eyes were wide open all the time and had some pink hair sticking out of his slime suit.

Abilities






Nurari using Viscous Water Mass.



Like
Orochimaru
, Nurari seemed to have gone through physical modifications that allowed his body to
bend and stretch
 in exceedingly unusual manners. With this ability, he could fight at any range or shift his body's structure to avoid having internal organs or chakra points damaged. His stretching power also allowed him to flatten his entire body, protecting him from being crushed. After Hinata tried to use her Gentle Fist technique against Nurari, her hands were covered with a wet, slimy substance which was a
mucus-like membrane
, and was described as being like "
birdlime
". Utilising
Water Release
, this substance could also be
expanded
 to act as a makeshift shield for cushioning incoming projectiles, or launched as a stretchy and sticky projectile to pin his opponents down. Nurari's abilities seemed to stem from his blue, liquid-like suit, as, according to Hinata, "
his body is his technique… his suit is full of chakra
". It also allowed him to camouflage his presence.






Nurari's cursed seal activated.



Later, Nurari was given the power of the
cursed seal
, which granted him an increase in chakra and raw power, but if he does not take a pill after a certain amount of time, the seal would kill him by tearing him inside out. He also had the power to bend light with chakra to become
invisible
 and
absorb another person's body
 and use their limbs and techniques as his own.

Part II

Three-Tails' Appearance






Nurari fighting Hinata.



He was one of
Orochimaru
's prisoners who had been selected to join forces with
Guren
. When Guren left with
Kabuto
 and
Yūkimaru
, he was instructed to stay behind to deal with
Team Kurenai
 and
Team Yamato
. Nurari ended up fighting
Hinata
, but thanks to his unique ability to transform his body, he was able to render her
Gentle Fist
 useless. He ultimately retreated with his team and regrouped with Guren, where they learned that they were to help retrieve the
Three-Tails
. Nurari voiced his disapproval of trying to capture such a dangerous beast, but was sent to once again deal with the Konoha ninja. Without the help of
Rinji
, they were easily defeated.






Nurari fusing with his team-mates as a last resort.



Later, taking advantage of Nurari's fear of dying, Kabuto tricked him into forcibly activating a cursed seal. Using his new power, Nurari joined his team in defeating the primary defence team and recapturing Yūkimaru. Seeing this as a chance for freedom, Nurari and his team decided to run away, only to soon learn that their Cursed Marks were slowly and painfully killing them, and would continue to do so without proper care. Not wanting to die, Nurari and his team attacked the Leaf ninja who were attempting to seal the Three-Tails again. Nurari found himself against
Shino
, and quickly took the advantage against the bug-jutsu user. Shino's second attack on Nurari was successful because the bugs he had sent the first time had been meant to get rid of the slimy fluid covering Nurari's body. After his defeat, Nurari used the Casualty Puppet technique to absorb the dead
Kihō
 and
Kigiri
 to overpower
Kakashi
 before being killed by the rampaging of the Three-Tails.
