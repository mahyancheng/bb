Summary

While running errands for
Tsunade
,
Izumo
 and
Kotetsu
 find
Sakura
 unconscious. They wake her up and she tells them about
Sasuke
's defection. They immediately inform Tsunade. Surprised that
Orochimaru
 is making his move so soon, Tsunade has
Shikamaru
 brought before her and tells him what has happened. Because the village is understaffed after Orochimaru's
Konoha Crush
, Shikamaru and a
genin
 team of his choosing are all that can be spared to retrieve Sasuke. Tsunade recommends
Naruto

Shino
 would be preferable to Chōji, but
Kiba
 informs them that Shino is away on a mission. He, however, volunteers.
Lee

Neji
. Lee himself awaiting his surgery.
