The
Three Brothers
 (
三兄弟
,
Sankyōdai
) is a team from
Iwagakure
 that chased down
Kosuke Maruboshi
 in an attempt to retrieve valuable information that he had stolen from them. Their efforts were, however, thwarted by
Team Asuma
 using their
Formation Ino–Shika–Chō
.

The Three Brothers showed excellent teamwork, their individual abilities complementing each other, with Kosuke lamenting that they did not have any apparent weaknesses and that he was most certain to be killed by them. The team themselves noted that no one had ever escaped their clutches.

All three brothers seemed to have some level of speed, as it often seemed that they were skating on the ground instead of running on it — whether or not this entailed use of
Earth Release
 is unknown, however.
