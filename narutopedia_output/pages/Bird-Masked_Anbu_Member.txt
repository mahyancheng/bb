He is an
Anbu
 Captain from
Konohagakure
.

Background






Hiruzen and the Anbu confronting Orochimaru.



He and
another Anbu
 accompanied the
Third Hokage
 in infiltrating a secret bunker with the intention to find out who was behind the disappearances of shinobi from their village. After they disarmed the traps, they confronted the person behind the acts and discovered it was
Orochimaru
. Having been caught, the Sannin
attacked
 the Anbu and Hiruzen, giving him an opportunity to escape and flee the
Land of Fire
.

Appearance

He is dressed in a white cloak and black trousers with bandages tied around his right leg and black sandals. He has brown hair that sticks out his right side in a long bang. His mask varies between the manga and the anime. In the manga his mask has a triangular shape pointing down from the top and a short line running up from the right eye hole. In the anime these marking are replaced by four yellow lines on either side running in towards the centre of the face. Both masks however retain the bird-like motif.

Abilities

He is presumably a powerful shinobi, being an
Anbu
. He showed proficiency in
Wind Release
 techniques, being able to use the
Wind Release: Wind Cutter Technique
 effectively to attack one of Pain's summons.

Part II

Pain's Assault






The Anbu captains confronting the Animal Paths summons.



During Pain's invasion this Anbu captain worked in a three man team with

episode 50
, a similar looking Anbu appears alongside his
