Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Sakura
 manages to destroy the
Third Kazekage puppet
 using her
Chakra Enhanced Strength
. She then uses the strength to lift a boulder off of
Chiyo
's remaining arm and uses her
medical ninja
 expertise to heal the damage.
Sasori
 wonders how Sakura is able to move, and remembers when he left
Kankurō
 alive to die from the poison. He wonders whether anybody from
Sunagakure
 could have analysed the poison and made an
antidote
 but claims that not even Chiyo would have been able to do it. However, upon watching Sakura heal Chiyo, he remembers that she is from
Konohagakure
, a nation led by the world's most renown medic-nin,
Tsunade
. Realising she cooked the antidote and not wanting to risk losing any more
human puppets
, Sasori disrobes and reveals the secret to his eternal youth - that he
himself is a puppet
. Having equipped himself with various weapons along with his special brand of poison, he launches his attack against Sakura and Chiyo.

Outside,
Naruto
 is still angrily chasing
Deidara
. Deidara believes that Sasori will berate him from dragging the situation out, and needing to get rid of
Kakashi
, he forms crickets out of his
explosive clay
 to kill Kakashi. He manages to separate Kakashi and Naruto, but Kakashi
creates a shadow clone
 that bears the brunt of the detonation caused by the crickets. Deidara believes Kakashi to be dead and halts his flight, ready to engage Naruto, only for Kakashi to show up. Deidara flees once more, but before Naruto can continue his pursuit, Kakashi stops him. He tells Naruto that he is a close-combat fighter while Deidara is a long-range fighter. To top it off, Deidara infiltrated Suna and took out
Gaara
 all on his own. Kakashi tells Naruto that the only way he could beat Deidara is if he had a long-range fighting specialist on his team, long-range ninjutsu or the intelligence of someone like
Shikamaru
. As Kakashi fits under all three categories, Kakashi devises a strategy for the duo to defeat Deidara together. As they resume tailing Deidara, the latter spots Kakashi in tow preparing and closing his
Sharingan
.
