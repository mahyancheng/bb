Summary

The
Four-Tails
 tosses the
Eight-Tails
 on the ground, and keeps forcing its mouth shut with
Naruto
 in it while the
Nine-Tails
 watches on.
Guy
 wants to save Naruto, but
Kakashi
 points out their own unfortunate situation between two attack fronts: the
Six-Tails
'
Wisdom Wolf Decay
 and the other jinchūriki's
chakra arms
. Kakashi creates a
shadow clone
 and
slices
 through the arms, while Guy
punches and burns
 the gas away. The Eight-Tails wraps its tentacles around the Four-Tails, telling it to let go of Naruto. The Eight-Tails tells the Nine-Tails it heard that it helped Naruto against
Madara
, the Nine-Tails saying it won't wag its tails to help its
jinchūriki
 as easily as the Eight-Tails. The Eight-Tails questions if it doesn't care at all about what happens to Naruto. The Nine-Tails recalls how many shinobi in the past have restrained it and denied it an identity. The Four-Tails closes its mouth. Naruto meets the Four-Tails, bound by
chains
. It asks if Naruto is there to take its power, and demands to be called by its proper name, making a boisterous introduction. Naruto apologises for not listening to Son Gokū, which impresses it. Naruto and Son Gokū discuss issues of recognition, identity, and existence. The Four-Tails laughs when Naruto says he's jealous of how
B
 and the Eight-Tails are with each other, before seeing Naruto is serious about it. Considering Naruto to be a better sight than
Tobi
, Son Gokū offers to help Naruto if he can undo the chains that bind it.
