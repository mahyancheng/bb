Following an
Aburame clan
 member placing a number of
kidaichū
 onto the skin of an enemy, these insects immediately burrow into the victim's body and begin to devour its flesh and
chakra
. This process causes the insects to grow rapidly in size, until the host body is completely eaten away from the inside out.
