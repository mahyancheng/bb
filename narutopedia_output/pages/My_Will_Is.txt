"
My Will Is
" (
オレノ意志ハ
,
Ore no Ishi wa
) is chapter 678 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

The entire world is revealed to be trapped in the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
, with the exception of the members of
Team 7
.
Sakura
 tries to find out just what is going on outside
Susanoo
's protection, but
Sasuke
 dismisses her, stating that she would be of no help either way.
Kakashi
 admonishes him for speaking that way, only to be told that without his
Sharingan
, he was no better than Sakura. Though
Naruto
 also scolds Sasuke for speaking to his teammates that way, Kakashi concludes that it was in fact for the best that Sasuke take the lead on this one.
 Sasuke eventually informs everyone that the
genjutsu
 had been cast, and that it would probably take a
Rinnegan
 to break it. The dreamscape of several shinobi are shown after which the glow from the
moon
 fades allowing Team 7 to emerge from Susanoo's protection and confirming
Black Zetsu
's suspicions that they were unaffected by the genjutsu. Before he can move to confront them, however, the triumphant
Madara
 appears before them stating that as the "Saviour of this World", he would stop them from destroying the peace he created. As they decried his false peace, Madara is attacked by Black Zetsu much to everyone's shock with Black Zetsu stabbing Madara in the chest with his left hand. Revealing that he harboured the will of
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
, not Madara's much to the
Uchiha
's own horror, the hand that Zetsu had used to impale Madara through the chest causes the Uchiha to start
changing
.

Trivia

When Sasuke is talking to Kakashi inside the Susanoo, the
tomoe
 in his Rinnegan are missing. This was not corrected in the tankōbon version.
