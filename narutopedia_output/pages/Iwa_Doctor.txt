The
Doctor
 (
ドクター
,
Dokutā
) was an
Outer
 of Kara who worked for
Victor
's company in the
Land of Valleys
. Wanting to elevate his position, he secretly worked with the retired Third
Tsuchikage

Ōnoki
 to create the
Fabrications
 and
Akuta
.

Background

As an Outer of the secret organisation, Kara, the doctor worked under
Victor
 in an unauthorised project to recreate the
God Tree
 from a splinter recovered during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. Wanting to elevate his own social status, the doctor proceeded with his own personal agenda by acquiring genetic material from the
White Zetsu
 sometime after the war, in order to attain additional data for Kara's cause. One day, he approached Ōnoki, whose hopes to create artificial soldiers to replace the shinobi of Iwagakure backfired, to offer his services with the material he obtained. With it, they created the Fabrications, artificial humans to help lead the Akuta, mindless soldiers created from clay. To lead the Fabrications themselves, the doctor and Ōnoki created a Fabrication clone of the Tsuchikage himself,
Kū
.

Personality

The doctor gave the initial impression of being loyal to Iwagakure's well-being to the point that he was willing to assist the Third Tsuchikage in creating a private army that undermines the peace treaty of the
Shinobi Union
. However, unlike Ōnoki, the doctor was willing to commit sacrifices to ensure these soldiers will have a stable body to serve their duties. His loyalty to Ōnoki was, in fact, a façade to gain experimental data for Kara's cause.

While working as an Outer of Kara, the doctor was rather unhappy being left out of the more important information when he requested for an update on the development, being reprimanded for asking questions and told to simply attend his work.

Appearance

The doctor had an oval face with thick grey hair on the sides, but bald on the top, and a toothbrush moustache. He had narrow eyes with wrinkles under them, and creases around his mouth area.

He wore a white lab coat over a dark navy turtleneck and pants, and a monocle over his right eye.

Abilities

The doctor was very intelligent, being able to use the genetic materials acquired from White Zetsu to create artificial lifeforms, the
Fabrications
, and even integrate them with certain genetic anomalies to grant them advanced
nature transformations
. He could also use a fragment of the
God Tree
, combined with
Hashirama's Cells
, to cause an artificial God Tree to blossom.

The doctor's scientific ingenuity did have its limitations, as his creations were flawed with unstably short lifespans and durability. He managed to overcome this flaw by examining
Mitsuki
, a different type of artificial human (limited by a
cursed seal
 that he cannot get through), though it requires a human to be sacrificed in the process, which defeats the very purpose of having Fabrications to protect humanity to begin with. Also, his artificial God Tree could not beget a Chakra Fruit, instead having created a tree that simply absorbed chakra from every living beings within reach.

Despite having his heart torn out by Kū, he somehow managed to come back to life.

Mitsuki's Disappearance Arc

Mitsuki's Disappearance Arc

The doctor assisted Ōnoki in maintaining the Fabrications' fragile health, and seeking a method to stabilise them permanently. Upon bringing in Mitsuki, the doctor did an examination on the artificial boy's body. Though Mitsuki's heart had a cursed seal blocking the sensors from learning the body's secrets in-depth, the doctor was able conclude that he can craft an artificial heart by using a live human's heart as raw material, which can be used to extend a Fabrication's lifespan.

Though Kū was at first reluctant in trampling over Ōnoki's creed, he eventually had Iwagakure under lock-down and ordered the doctor to proceed in creating artificial hearts for all the Fabrications. However, before the doctor could extract the raw material out of five Iwa-nin, the
Fourth Tsuchikage
 was freed from imprisonment and led a counterattack against Kū's faction, freeing the "donors" who in turn bound the doctor as they left to deal with the
Akuta
.

When Kū returned to the lab, fatally wounded by Mitsuki, he released the doctor to have him prepare the artificial heart. The doctor notified him due to the donors' escape, the heart remains incomplete. Kū, noticing that all that is required to complete his new artificial organ is a human heart, turned around to kill the doctor for it, who was overwhelmed with horror as the Fabrication attacked.

After Kū was killed by Ōnoki and Iwagakure was back in the custody of Kurotsuchi, the Iwa-nin found the doctor's corpse was gone.
Orochimaru
 and
Log
 later noted that
someone
 was probably interested in the doctor's ability to create such powerful artificial lifeforms.

Kara Actuation Arc

Kara Actuation Arc

The doctor was later revealed to have been resusicated and working directly for
Victor
's company, using his research with Ōnoki to further Victor's own research. In a secret lab accessed by an elevator to deep underground, he began working on various subjects. As he asked Victor's
secretary
 about any new development, she reminded him that Outers such as them are only mean to follow orders, not ask questions, which he grumpily accepted.

Later, the doctor welcomed the
daimyō
 when he visited the company for an inspection. When Victor explained they were using the cell of
Hashirama Senju
 for their research,
Konohamaru Sarutobi
 and
Mugino
, who were disguised as the daimyō's bodyguards, revealed themselves and undid the genjutsu placed on him, exposing Victor's inhuman experiments. After being attacked by Mugino, Victor activated the experiment, which grew into an artificial
God Tree
. As Victor and his secretary took the elevator to inspect it, the doctor was left behind to have his chakra absorbed by the tree.
