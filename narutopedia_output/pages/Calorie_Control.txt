Calorie Control
 (
カロリーコントロール
,
Karorī Kontorōru
) is a
hiden
 utilised by the
Akimichi clan
 and forms the basis of all their clan techniques.

Overview

This technique grants the user the ability to freely convert the calories they store in their bodies into chakra to be used in their unique
fighting style
 which ranges from expanding parts of, or, their entire body. Akimichi who are less experienced with this technique make use of the
Three Coloured Pills
 to initiate this process, however, these pills have the adverse effect of converting all the calories in the user's body to chakra. Once perfected, however, the Akimichi no longer has need for the pills and can regulate how much of their body weight is converted at any given time.

Trivia

Because of the high amounts of chakra that their clan techniques usually consume, Akimichi tend to eat in direct proportion to that. Members of the clan are usually described as being gluttonous as a result.
