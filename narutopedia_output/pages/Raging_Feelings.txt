Viz:
 Naruto Charges On…!!) is chapter 262 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Team Guy
 tries to break into the
Akatsuki
 lair, alerting Akatsuki to their presence. Elsewhere, knowing they are running out of time to save
Gaara
,
Naruto
 picks up the speed.
Chiyo
 asks
Kakashi
 why Naruto is so committed to saving Gaara. Just as Gaara is the
jinchūriki
 of
Shukaku
, Naruto is the jinchūriki of the
Nine-Tails
, a similarity that transcends the fact they are from rival villages. Touched, Chiyo reveals that she was the one who sealed Shukaku into Gaara's body, and wonders if perhaps ruining Gaara's life to give
Sunagakure
 a weapon was a mistake.
Team 7
 joins up with Team Guy.
