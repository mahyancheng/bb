This article is about the Konoha Anbu. For the member of the Ibura clan, see
Tenzō
.

Yamato
 (
ヤマト
), also known as "
Tenzō
" (
テンゾウ
,
Tenzō
),
 are both code names for this
Anbu
-turned-
jōnin
 of
Konohagakure
. As his
Wood Release
 would allow him to be able to keep the
Nine-Tails
 sealed within
Naruto Uzumaki
 in check, he was re-assigned from Anbu to the
regular forces
, joining
Team Kakashi
 as a temporary replacement for their jōnin-sensei,
Kakashi Hatake
. While Kakashi eventually returns to the team, Yamato stays on to provide assistance as needed.

Background






Yamato as one of Orochimaru's test subjects.



Yamato graduated from the
Academy
 at the age of six, and at that same age, was promoted to the rank of
chūnin
.
 As an infant (child in the anime), he was abducted by
Orochimaru
 and became one of sixty children that were his test subjects. They were injected with the
First Hokage
's DNA in the hopes that they could replicate the First's ability to use Wood Release. Before Orochimaru could finalise the results of the experiments, he was caught by Hiruzen for his other experiments and had to flee the village. Because every child who had been subjected to the experiment had died after a certain amount of time, Orochimaru believed all remaining test subjects would perish as well. In actuality, this boy was the lone survivor and found himself endowed with an unquantified Wood Release and likewise the First's abilities to
control

tailed beasts
.
 In the anime, while contained in a test tube, he was fully conscious of his surroundings, watching in horror as other children died from failed experiments. Not wanting to die all by himself, he used his Wood Release to escape. He was soon afterwards found by
Danzō Shimura
. Having lost all memory of who he was, the boy was taken in by Danzō, where he was recruited into the
Anbu
's
Root
 division under the codename
Kinoe
 (
甲
,
Kinoe
).






"Kinoe" training to use Wood Release under Danzō's watch.



Having high hopes for Kinoe, Danzō began to personally train him as a Root operative. He also gave Kinoe a scroll containing the secrets and various techniques of the Wood Release.
 As
Hiruzen Sarutobi
 began to resume his post as
Hokage
 after
Minato Namikaze
's untimely passing, Danzō sent Root members, including Kinoe, to assassinate the Third. However, Kakashi, a recent recruit to Root, warned the Hokage and went in his place. Kakashi quickly defeated Kinoe, but chose to spare him in the belief that he would become a valuable ally in the future. After the battle, Kinoe began following Kakashi from afar.
 Kinoe later informed Danzō of Orochimaru's defection from Konoha and was instructed to meet up with Orochimaru at an underground cave that secretly housed the
Iburi clan
. After delivering his message to the clan, who promised to help Orochimaru escape the country, he met a young girl named
Yukimi
 who insisted that Kinoe was her brother,
Tenzō
. While Yukimi began to show Kinoe around, word soon reached them that an unknown individual had entered the cave.

When the intruder, Kakashi, was subdued by the Iburi clan, Kinoe convinced them to let him interrogate Kakashi. While seemingly alone, Kinoe revealed that his actual mission was the same as Kakashi's, ensuring that Orochimaru did not escape the country.
Gotta
, the clan's leader, overheard this while spying and quickly ordered for both Konoha-nin to be killed, though Yukimi refused to let Kinoe die, saving them both. Leaving Kakashi behind, Yukimi possessed Kinoe's body and the two travelled to a carnival, where they took part in the festivities. Kakashi later caught up, planning to use Yukimi to capture Orochimaru, since she was of great importance to him. Refusing to let Yukimi be used as bait, Kinoe ran off with her, announcing that his name was "Tenzō".

Quickly catching up to them, Kakashi explained that Yukimi's blood could temporarily bestow Orochimaru with the Iburi clan's smoke transformation, allowing him to slip across the border. Overhearing that, Yukimi slipped away and returned to the cave. Recognising that Kinoe cared for Yukimi not unlike he had cared for
Rin Nohara
, Kakashi agreed to work together with Kinoe to save her. Upon returning to the cave, the two discovered that Orochimaru had killed the Iburi clan and captured Yukimi. The spirits of the Iburi guided Kinoe and Kakashi to Yukimi, causing Orochimaru to flee. Yukimi's body then began to destabilise, but the spirits of the Iburi used their power along with Kinoe's Wood Release to re-stabilise her ability. Kakashi decided to leave and not report anything about the Iburi or Root's involvement. Yukimi, no longer needing to fear the wind, parted ways with Kinoe to see the world, while the latter was happy to know that he did have the power to save people.






Kinoe starts questioning Root's methods.



Three years later, Danzō, fearing that his transplanted
Sharingan
 would eventually go blind from its over-usage, assigned Kinoe and
Kinoto
 to steal the Sharingan from Kakashi as a substitute. Kinoe found Kakashi while on a mission to investigate one of Orochimaru's abandoned labs. While initially working alongside Kakashi, he quickly attacked the older shinobi. As Kakashi tried to reason with him that friends should not kill each other, Kinoe retorted that comment, knowing that Kakashi killed his friend Rin. Enraged that Kinoe believed Kakashi killed her on purpose, Kakashi quickly overpowered him, telling Kinoe that she died because he couldn't protect her, making Kinoe remember the other test subjects he wanted to save. Refusing to kill Kinoe as he still viewed him a friend and ally, Kakashi instead chose to take him to the Third Hokage.
 Before he could, one of Orochimaru's
snake experiments
 escaped its test tube and attacked the duo. As Kinoe was taken captive, Kakashi managed to slay the creature. While saving Kinoe, the creature's corpse began emitting a poisonous vapour which quickly infected Kakashi. Kinoe got Kakashi out safely and, having accepting Kakashi's words, Kinoe gave Kakashi an antidote and chose to abandon his mission, leaving Kakashi a message of it.






"Tenzō" joins Team Ro.



Upon returning to Danzō, the elder was furious at Kinoe's blatant choice to defy his orders. While Kinoe insisted that Root should not target fellow Konoha members as they are allies, Danzō countered by stating that Root exists as a separate section of Konoha. Remembering the feelings of friendship from Yukimi, Kinoe ultimately decided that Root's philosophies were not for him. Disgusted at Kinoe's new view, Danzō knocked him out with his Sharingan, ordering his men to have Kinoe's
cursed seal
 activated. As Kinoe was prepped for the operation, Kakashi arrived and freed him. The two were quickly surrounded by Danzō and several Root members. Before Danzō could act, the Third Hokage appeared, vouching for Kakashi's unsanctioned arrival and convincing Danzō to give Kinoe over to him, though Danzō refused to remove the cursed seal on Kinoe's tongue. Later, Kinoe was re-assigned to
Team Ro
 under Kakashi's command. Joining his new squad, Kinoe was given a warm welcome to his new allies and insisted by Kakashi that he go by his chosen name of "Tenzō", which he happily agreed to.






Tenzō and Kakashi as Anbu members.



During this time in the Anbu, he
served under the guidance
 of Kakashi
 and learned much from him, developing great respect for his captain. Two years after joining Team Ro, a new Anbu was added to their team,
Itachi Uchiha
, who was the youngest Anbu of all time. While many on the team members questioned the wisdom of allowing someone so young to join Anbu, Tenzō and Kakashi took a great interest in the prodigy's talents.
 Two years later, Tenzō was shocked to learn that Itachi was made an Anbu captain while being even younger than Kakashi was. He and Kakashi were then approached by
Yūgao Uzuki
, who would act as Itachi's replacement for Team Ro. Later, Team Ro was mobilised to intercept the planned coup d'état, which was however already stopped by the
slaughter of the clan
. As they began gathering the corpses, Danzō told them that the culprit was their former comrade Itachi. Some time after the genocide, Tenzō tried to comfort Kakashi, who was saddened by his inability to help or even understand his former friend.
 Later, after Kakashi was honourably discharged from Anbu and reassigned as a jōnin sensei, Tenzō went to meet with his former captain, noting a positive change in Kakashi's demeanour from his new position.
 As Tenzō continued his career in Anbu, he would come to have the best performance record of any Anbu serving under the Third Hokage.

In the anime, when
Team 10
 and Naruto Uzumaki were given a
B-rank
, potentially
A-rank
, mission of rescuing the son of a
daimyō
,
Shū
, who was an ally to the
Land of Fire
, Tsunade called for Yamato. Because of rumours about there being suspicious activity going on in the
Land of This
 where Team 10 was heading, she had Yamato secretly tail the younger Konoha-nin in the event things became
S-rank
 danger and also gather any information possible.
 Later, after Team 10 completed the initial phase of their plan, capturing Shū, the nation was suddenly attacked by
Akatsuki
. Yamato took action and destroyed several of
Sasori
's puppets. Despite his help, the nation ultimately fell to the Akatsuki's attack. With Team 10's mission still going to return Shū home, Yamato tailed them until they crossed the country borders. Afterwards, Yamato returned to Konohagakure to report to Tsunade, who became troubled by the news.

Personality






Yamato using his ghastly face fault to intimidate Naruto.



Yamato is a very discreet, cautious and generally well-prepared person. He projects a calm, stoic demeanour even in very stressful situations. He takes his missions very seriously, even insisting on being referred to by whatever his current codename is. In the anime, having no family nor memories of them, Yamato's greatest desire has become to work hard for the village to make others happy and to be acknowledged by all for his efforts, particularly as leader of Team 7, as revealed by Infinite Tsukuyomi.
 Yamato also takes great interest in
architecture
 which can be seen when he goes out on missions and creates
a house
 to "camp out" in. This skill to incorporate his hobby with his
kekkei genkai
 was also seen after
Pain's assault
 on Konoha where he was key in
recreating
 the village. While he has been good-natured so far, Yamato claims to be a different sort of leader than Kakashi, one who is not above "ruling by the use of terror" when his team misbehaves.
 Aside from his obviously intimidating skills as a ninja, however, this "terror" has so far primarily consisted of casting a creepy "ghoul-eyes" expression at his charges.
Naruto
, especially, is easily terrified by it, and stated that it felt like Yamato was controlling him with fear — something Yamato himself has noted that he has no qualms with.
 He also has less tolerance of Naruto's antics and lack of respect for rules than Kakashi. He is, however, also prone to being a victim of a cruel joke when given misleading information, as witness his visible fear and subsequent annoyance when
Killer B
 maliciously joked about the dangers of a
jinchūriki
 trying to control their
tailed beast
.
 In the anime, he's shown to use his fear face in a more comical manner when he created a bridge for Naruto and the others and asked if Naruto was happy he came along.

Despite his serious and sometimes overworked demeanour, Yamato is known for being somewhat playful, such as his tendency play pranks on Naruto during their downtime on missions. He usually does this by using his ghoul-eyes' frightening appearance or a wood clone to scare Naruto during ghost stories, showing that he does have a sense of humour underneath all of that responsibility and seriousness. He is also aware of his tendency to be overworked by his peers and gets frustrated by their lack of appreciation of how exhausting his Wood Release techniques are despite their obvious usefulness and versatility.

Yamato is known to respect ranking, as he told Naruto, who was now the Seventh Hokage, to not call him "Captain Yamato" anymore as he doesn't feel comfortable for the Hokage calling him captain.

Appearance

Yamato's appearance prior to Part I.
Yamato's appearance during Part I.
Yamato's appearance during Part II.
1/3

Yamato has short brown hair and black, almond-shaped eyes. While still a child and test subject of Orochimaru, he had long, unkempt hair going past his shoulders.
 When he débuted, Yamato wore the standard attire of the Anbu: a black, sleeveless jumper under a grey flack jacket with strapped-up shinobi sandals, arm-length gloves with guards over them. He carried a
sword
 strapped to his back, and wore a mask that resembles a cat's face covered in green, and red intricate markings, and the Anbu tattoo on his left shoulder.
 When he meets up with Naruto, Sakura, and Sai for the first time, however, he has changed into a variation of the standard attire of a Konoha-nin, with a
flak jacket
.

The differences between his attire and that of the standard one is that his does not have the
Uzushiogakure
 crest on the shoulders of the sleeves, and the neck of his navy-blue shirt is form fitting and goes up to his chin. He also still retains two hip pouches strapped to his lower back instead of just one. In addition to that, he has a
happuri
-style
forehead protector
 that frames his face, similar to that of
Tobirama Senju
.

Years later during the reign of the Seventh Hokage, Yamato's appearance remained largely the same except with minor noticeable changes: he developed small wrinkles under his eyes and at the corners of his mouth, his hair was shorter, spiky and his happuri-style forehead protector is devoid of any emblem and slightly cracked.

Abilities






Yamato's kekkei genkai: Wood Release.



In the anime, his talents were shown to be enough to join the Anbu while still a child.
 Due to his abilities and potential, Danzō took him on as his personal apprentice and trained Yamato himself.
 As a member of the Anbu, Yamato was a highly capable ninja, having one of — if not the finest service record of anyone working under the Third Hokage — leading the
Fifth Hokage
 to have the utmost confidence in him.
 Upon leaving the organisation, he was promoted to
jōnin
, with his skills being both utilised to monitor Orochimaru, as well as being recognised to the point a
X Card
 was made of him.

Ninjutsu

Nature Transformation






Yamato using the Wood Release: Wood Locking Wall.



Sharing the same DNA as
Hashirama Senju
, Yamato possesses the First's signature
Wood Release

kekkei genkai
. This kekkei genkai allows him to combine
earth-natured
 chakra in one hand, and
water
 in the other,
 to create vegetation such as trees and even grass which can be grown from any surface.
 These trees can be grown not only from the earth and pre-existing flora, but from his own body as well by using his own cells as a source of life. As this ability is not inherently his, however, Yamato has realised that he cannot use the Wood Release techniques to their full potential, which by his own admission results in the scale of his techniques paling in comparison to that of the First Hokage.
 Nonetheless, he has enough skill and experience with Wood Release to make it the main element of his
fighting style
, showing considerable control and gaining fame as a capable user of it. In the anime, he was shown able to effectively use this ability while still a young child.
 Much of his techniques come from studying a scroll containing the Wood Release techniques of the First Hokage.






Yamato using Wood Release: Great Forest Technique.



Yamato can use Wood Release for both offensive and defensive purposes: he can surround himself with
extremely durable wooden domes
, which he can also use to trap foes within,
 and in the anime, create a
wooden shield
 that can rebuild itself, and a
wall of tangled branches
.
 He can also cause
trees
 to grow from his arm, which can be used to trap or impale an enemy, and create a
binding tree
 around an enemy and subsequently crush them.

Yamato can also use Wood Release for other purposes, such as to
transform
 into someone, with the wood acting as an outer layer, allowing him to leave out the suit when needed. He is able to create a
wood-based clone
 that can be generated from his body or from the ground. As they share the same cells, he is able to track its location, communicate with it over long distances,
 and absorb any information it has gathered by laying his hand on it.
 Yamato can even turn a wood clone into a
seed
 in order to track anyone he plants it on.
 He can generate wooden structures almost instantly, which he can use to create a
large cage
 used to hold prisoners and intimidate unruly subordinates,
 and a
large house
 that can be erected at a moment's notice instead of setting up a camp.

Yamato is skilled in the use of Water and Earth Release as well, as seen when he
raised the ground
 and created a
waterfall
.
 He is also capable of utilising
Yang Release
.

Tailed Beast Suppression






Yamato suppressing Naruto's version 2 form.



Using the
First Hokage's Necklace
 to amplify his powers, Yamato can
suppress the power of a tailed beast
. This legendary ability was one of the reasons that Hashirama Senju was made
Hokage
 in the first place, and it was greatly coveted by Orochimaru.
 Although the First Hokage could suppress entire tailed beasts, Yamato has admitted to his skill not being as strong as the original's so it is unknown what the limits of his suppression ability are. He was able to suppress Naruto's four-tailed form in mere seconds.
 It was for this reason why Yamato was assigned to Team Kakashi in their leader's absence.






Yamato being notified that Naruto manifested six tails.



Yamato added a
seal
 to the Hokage's necklace that would activate and attempt to suppress him when he called upon too much of the Nine-Tails' chakra. He used a technique alongside this that would reveal a number on his palm corresponding to the tails Naruto had gained, warning him in the process. With the destruction of the necklace, however, Yamato implied that he could no longer help suppress tailed beasts.
 Despite this, during Naruto's
tailed-beast control
 training, when Naruto started losing control, Yamato tried to suppress the beast once again.

Yamato can also use his Wood Release to suppress the chakra of regular people, as seen when he
suppressed
 Kisame's chakra in order to subdue him after his capture.

Other Skills

Yamato is highly proficient in multiple areas of combat, including tracking,
 trapping, stealth, and diversionary tactics. He has keen instincts in battle, allowing him to quickly react to threats. He can also
merge with the environment
 to spy undetected or evade most attacks. During his test of his
new team's
 skills, he demonstrated considerable ability in
taijutsu
, as shown when he simultaneously fended off Naruto and Sai.
 Thanks to his training as an Anbu, Yamato is proficient in
kenjutsu
, able to clash against his senior Kakashi.
 He also has some skill in
fūinjutsu
, as he was able to place a
seal
 and rig it to activate under certain conditions. Having been genetically altered to match Hashirama's DNA, Yamato was also granted the legendary shinobi's ability to
heal nearly any wound
, without the need for hand seals.

Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission

Main article:
Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission






Tsunade assigning Yamato to Team 7.



Yamato was assigned to lead Team 7 in meeting with one of
Sasori
's spies within Orochimaru's ranks. Naruto and Sakura found it difficult to work with their newest team member,
Sai
, and much of Yamato's time was spent trying to get them to cooperate. Upon arriving at the arranged meeting place, Yamato went ahead dressed as Sasori, to make meeting with the spy easier. After the spy arrived, who turned out to be
Kabuto Yakushi
, Yamato was able to learn a great deal of information until Orochimaru showed up. Just as Yamato started to contemplate how he would fight Orochimaru whilst keeping up his act as Sasori, Kabuto cut off the head of the Sasori costume, having hoped to kill the real Sasori.






Yamato and his team confront Orochimaru and Kabuto.



Faced with a combined attack from Kabuto and Orochimaru, Yamato created a
wood clone
 to escape, causing Orochimaru to realise that one of his test subjects had survived. Seeing the situation he was in, Yamato signalled the rest of team 7 to join him. A battle between Orochimaru and Naruto ensued, and Yamato spent much of his time protecting Sakura. When the battle was over, Sai was found to be missing, although a wood clone that Yamato had following Sai revealed that the latter had joined with Orochimaru. As the clone followed Sai to Orochimaru's hideout, the rest of Team 7 followed the clone. On their way, they had to break to not strain Sakura's injury, which she also lied about to Naruto, along with what happened at the bridge. Yamato secretly took Naruto aside and took him the truth. Along with telling him how dangerous it is to rely on the Nine-Tails' power, he also tell him that he is strong enough without it and should use his own to protect those he loves. Once they arrived at the hideout, Yamato used his Wood Release abilities to infiltrate the base.






Team 7 restrains Sai.



When they eventually found Sai, they restrained him, and were able to learn about Sai's real mission: to join forces with Orochimaru on behalf of his organisation,
Root
, in an attempt to destroy Konoha. Sai was eventually freed by Kabuto, who in turn was restrained by Sai. Sai, touched by Naruto's words about
Sasuke Uchiha
, rejoined Team 7 in their other mission of retrieving Sasuke. When the group split up again, Yamato discovered a
Bingo Book
 whilst going through some of Sai's belongings. In doing so, Yamato learned that Sai once again had an ulterior motive: to kill Sasuke Uchiha. In desperation, Team 7 went looking for Sai, hoping to stop him from fulfilling his mission. Sai, however, had actually had a change of heart, and attempted to convince Sasuke to come back to Konoha on Naruto's behalf. Sasuke however ended up overpowering Sai.






Yamato being stabbed by Sasuke.



Due to an explosive attack from Sasuke, Team 7 was able to find Sai and learn that he had really allied with them. Upon failing to persuade Sasuke to return to Konoha, the team decided to use force instead. Sasuke's growth, however, was too much for the four's joint effort, and he was able to repel them all. After a brief confrontation between Naruto and Sasuke, Yamato attempted to capture Sasuke with his
Wood Release: Wood Locking Wall
, although Sasuke was able to escape. As an answer to this, Yamato declared that he had no intention of getting too rough on him in front of Naruto and Sakura, but had no choice. Despite this, Sasuke prepared what appeared to be a finishing move. Orochimaru and a freed Kabuto arrived to stop him, however, and they disappeared, leaving Team 7 defeated which made them unsuccessful in their mission.

Twelve Guardian Ninja

Main article:
Twelve Guardian Ninja

In the anime, Yamato led Team 7 on a mission to the
Fire Temple
. Upon arrival,
Chiriku
 informed them that the tombs belonging to a former member of the
Twelve Guardian Ninja
 had been robbed of its corpse. While Yamato pondered the motive fached them which had reached the Fire Temple that the graves of three other former Ninja Guardian members had also had their corpses stolen. Yamato, his team, and Chiriku went to investigate and find the four coffins. While Yamato knew it was clearly some sort of trap, he knew they had no choice but to play along if they wished to retrieve the bodies.






Yamato emerges from Fudō's attack unscathed.



As they neared the coffins, the trap was sprung, and the team became trapped in a rocky cavern. While searching for the way out whilst dodging more traps, Yamato was approached by one of the thieves,
Fudō
. Caught off guard and completely unprepared for an opponent such as this, Yamato was overpowered by Fudō's unique earth-technique prowess and indestructible body, forcing him on the defensive. Eventually, Fudō caught him in a
rock-crushing technique
, but deceived Fudō by
merging
 with the rocks. Yamato regrouped with his team and, having failed to recover the stolen corpses or capture the tomb robbers, returned to Konoha with
Sora
.

Later, when the tomb robbers emerged again to attack Konoha, Yamato was one of the few jōnin still available to defend the village. He was then sent out to stop one of the resurrected Ninja Guardians from completing the
Limelight
 technique, but was intercepted by Fudō. After figuring out Fudō's attack patterns, Yamato used Fudō's blunt attack methods to set up the area for a
water technique
 to trap Fudō in mud. He then proceeded to finished off Fudō by crushing him with a
wood ninjutsu
. He went to join Asuma and the others in stopping the bandits' leader,
Furido
, who released Sora's
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 chakra. Because Yamato's wood release was not as refined as the First Hokage's, he couldn't suppress Sora's spliced demon chakra. Yamato instead used his wood technique to protect his allies from Sora's attacks.

Akatsuki Suppression Mission

Main article:
Akatsuki Suppression Mission






Yamato aiding with Naruto's training.



Kakashi recruited Yamato to help with Naruto's training in creating a new technique. In addition to being able to create training devices for Naruto with his Wood Release abilities, Yamato was also able to subdue Naruto if he lost control of the Nine-Tails' chakra. Once Naruto completed the initial stages of his training, he moved onto perfecting his pre-existing
Rasengan
. Kakashi, however, was not able to oversee Naruto in these final stages, due to his volunteering to help Team Asuma in the fight against
Akatsuki
. As such, he left Yamato in charge of the technique's perfection. Yamato was able to give advice in the technique's creation, and eventually bore witness to the fruits of Naruto's training.

Once Naruto had perfected his technique enough to be used in battle, Yamato, Naruto, and the rest of Team 7 joined Kakashi and Team 10. After
teaming up
 with Naruto to stop an attack by
Kakuzu
, Yamato convinced Kakashi to allow Naruto to fight Kakuzu alone. Once Naruto was successful in defeating Kakuzu, Yamato joined everyone else in returning to Konoha.

Three-Tails' Appearance

Main article:
Three-Tails' Appearance






Team Two formed to capture the Three Tails.



In the anime, Team Kakashi was sent to provide back-up for
Team 8
 and Kakashi. When they located the team, Yamato assisted in rescuing
Hinata
. They pursued the opposing
Team Guren
 to a lake, where they located the
Three-Tails
. The two teams shifted objectives and, once back-up from Konoha arrived they switched objectives, to seal the beast. Yamato was put in charge of a
team
 meant to stop any attempted interference. His team was able to stop some of the enemies however, the sealing was still distributed and the beast was freed, creating tidal waves upon its release.

He made a
hideout
 for the teams to regroup in, and later facilitated in Naruto's rescue from the Three-Tails. He also battled
Kihō
, to stop him from interfering with the second sealing attempt and ultimately killed him. After another failed sealing attempt, Yamato returned to Konoha with the others.

Itachi Pursuit Mission

The Eight Man Squad formed to pursue Itachi and Sasuke.



When Kakashi received permission from
Tsunade
 to lead a
special team
 to capture
Itachi Uchiha
 in order to bait

, Yamato joined him as acting head of
Team 8
, with the pregnant
Kurenai
 remaining behind in the village.

Fated Battle Between Brothers

Fated Battle Between Brothers

While trying to locate Itachi they are stopped by
Tobi
. Using the formations created in such for the mission, they battled the Akatsuki member. Yamato is able to seemingly immobilise Tobi with his wood technique, only for the foe to escape. Ultimately, Tobi managed to avoid every move of the group. Afterwards,
Zetsu
 appeared and informed Tobi of the outcome of Itachi and Sasuke's battle, stating Itachi fell to him. Having distracted the Konoha-nin long enough, Tobi leaves alongside Zetsu. After failing to find Itachi or Sasuke, the group was forced to abandon the mission and return to Konoha.

Six-Tails Unleashed

Main article:
Six-Tails Unleashed

In the anime, on their way back to the village,
Katsuyu
 appears and gives the team orders for a new mission, to help the
Tsuchigumo clan
 protect their infamous and forbidden technique from being taken by ninja bandits. While Kakashi returns to the village for more information, Yamato is put in charge of the team. Yamato and his team unfortunately arrive at the clan's base too late, as the bandits had already broken through its defences and forced the former clan leader's granddaughter,
Hotaru
 to retreat into the woods. Upon finding her, they discover that she was travelling with a stranger named
Utakata
 who seemed indifferent to Hotaru's well-being as he decided to leave her in Konoha's care. After successfully bringing Hotaru to her village, despite the mission being completed, Naruto refused to leave yet as he felt something was wrong from how the village was so hesitant to let Hotaru return. Upon investigating, it was discovered that the bandits tracked Hotaru down and drove her back into the woods.

While searching for her, they discovered Utakata had returned and was being attacked by
Kirigakure
 Anbu
hunter-nin
 who were holding Hotaru hostage. After managing to calm Naruto down, Yamato tried to talk with the Anbu, explaining the situation and asking them to release Hotaru. The Anbu initially agreed under the condition they hand over Utakata, Yamato refused as he knew Hotaru would refuse to go with the Konoha-nin if Utakata didn't come along. Suddenly, the Anbu's squad captain appeared to make a deal with Yamato, not wanting things to become a war between the two villages. It was then agreed that the Anbu would release Hotaru and not pursue Utakata until the Konoha-nin's mission was complete, as long as the Konoha-nin agreed not to interfere with their pursuing of Utakata afterwards.

Later, the shocking truth is revealed that Hotaru has the clan's forbidden technique embedded in her back. After learning that Hotaru asked for this to help restore the clan, it is acknowledged that the technique will only cause more harm and preparations are made to safely remove the technique from Hotaru's back and destroy it. Not wanting to give up just yet, Hotaru insists they find a man named
Shiranami
 who should be able to help protect the technique, who Naruto goes off to find. Unfortunately, Hotaru runs off when Utakata suddenly leaves. Yamato has Sai track her down back to her clan's village, which has been taken control of by Shiranami himself, who is also the bandit's leader. Yamato and the others arrive in time to hold off the possessed villagers while Naruto and Utakata goes on to save Hotaru.

Pain's Assault

Pain's Assault






Yamato helping to rebuild Konoha using his Wood Release.



When the invasion began, Yamato was away on a mission with Sai and
Anko Mitarashi
, trying to locate and capture Kabuto. Just when they located Kabuto, Yamato was alerted to the fact that Naruto had broken the seal he had placed on the
First Hokage's Necklace
, and was about to completely release the Nine-Tails with a seal appearing in his palm with the number of tails that Naruto had manifested. He rushed back to Konoha to try and stop Naruto, but was informed by
Shikaku
 that Naruto was able to suppress the Nine-Tails' power on his own. He was later seen using his
Wood Release: Serial Pillar Houses Technique
 to help rebuild Konoha, complaining that it put a lot of strain on him.

Five Kage Summit

Main article:
Five Kage Summit






Kakashi and Yamato restrain Tobi.



When Naruto states that he wants to meet with the
Fourth Raikage
, Yamato advises against it; leaving the village is forbidden because of the
Kage Summit
, Yamato can no longer suppress the Nine-Tails because of the
First Hokage's Necklace
's destruction, and Yamato needs to help with the village's reconstruction. However, Naruto manages to convince Kakashi, who forces Yamato to go too. Yamato plants a wood clone seed on
Team Samui
, allowing him, Naruto, and Kakashi to follow them to the
Fourth Raikage
 in the
Land of Iron
. When Naruto is unable to sway the Raikage, even with his and Kakashi's support, the three of them rest at a local inn. Tobi confronts Naruto while there and Yamato and Kakashi, having expected him, try to restrain him. Their attempts do not work and, after telling them the truth about the
Uchiha clan
 and Sasuke's current motives, he leaves. Afterwards, Kakashi encourages that three of them keep what Tobi said between them until they knew more and if what Tobi said was true.






Yamato prevents Naruto from leaving.



Yamato repairs the damage he and Kakashi did to the inn. Soon afterwards Sakura arrives with Sai and tells Naruto that she loves him, shocking Yamato. However, as the event unfolds an angered Yamato tries to ask why she would say that, but was stopped by Kakashi before he could. As he watched and listened to Sakura's talk to Naruto, he could tell she wasn't telling the truth, and like Kiba, looked upon it both questioningly and disapprovingly. She leaves when Naruto says he doesn't believe her, after which one of Sai's
ink clone
's approaches them and tells them Sakura's plans to kill Sasuke. Before Kakashi can go to stop her, Gaara appears and tells them about the outbreak of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 and Danzō Shimura's actions during the Kage Summit. Because the other
Kage
 would prefer Kakashi were Hokage, Yamato encourages him to comply. Naruto passes out shortly afterwards and Yamato is left in charge of looking after him while Kakashi finds Sakura.

When Naruto finally awakens, he tries to go after Sakura, but Yamato stops him and insists that they return to the village. Naruto asks to rest some more and Yamato lets him, unaware that Naruto is sneaking out, leaving a shadow clone behind so that he wouldn't notice. In the anime, it is shown that after realising that Naruto had escaped he hunts him down to the
Samurai Bridge
 and
captures
 him, but later releases him and returns to the village on his own.

Yamato restraining the squid.



In the anime, Yamato is seen in a bar with Shikamaru, telling him that since the First Hokage's Necklace was destroyed, he could no longer suppress the Nine-Tails. Yamato is one of the Konoha ninja sent to an isolated
island
 in the
Land of Lightning
 as Naruto's bodyguard. When Naruto expresses an interest in finally taming the Nine-Tails, Yamato and
Motoi
 accompany him to the
Falls of Truth
 in order to defeat his
dark side
. After a brief encounter with the
Giant Squid
 again, B instructs Naruto on how to enter into his subconscious and face the Nine-Tails. When the Nine-Tails starts gaining the advantage and a chakra cloak develops around Naruto, Yamato tries to suppress it. It eventually stops on its own, surprising him. Naruto soon informs them of his victory, explaining the particulars to B through a fist-bump. Being left out of the loop irritates Yamato, but he is left amazed when Naruto begins demonstrating his new control over the Nine-Tails and the advantages it allows him. Among the advantages is the ability to sense
Kisame
 hidden within B's
Samehada
. Naruto pursues Kisame when he tries to flee, but his inexperience with his new strength and speed causes him to lodge himself in the wall. Yamato helps Naruto while B goes after Kisame.






Yamato restrains Kisame.



Yamato splints Naruto's sprained ankle and warns him to exercise restraint until he can gain better control over his powers. They rendezvous with B and find that Kisame has been captured. Yamato fortifies Kisame's wooden restraints while
Aoba Yamashiro

reads his mind
. Before Aoba can learn anything of real value about Akatsuki, Kisame breaks free and commits suicide. They try to examine the intel Kisame wanted to escape with, but it is booby-trapped and they are trapped in
water prisons
 while the intel makes its way to Akatsuki.






Yamato being used to strengthen the White Zetsu Army.



Fearing that Naruto may grow suspicious about their reasons for being on the island given his dominance over the Nine-Tails and the incident with Kisame, Yamato and the others convince him to take a survey of the island's native animal population to keep him busy. Akatsuki, meanwhile, launches an assault on the island, and Yamato looks after Naruto and formulates explanations for any signs of the battle that Naruto notices. When things calm down, Yamato, Aoba, and
Motoi
 go outside to investigate. They come across Kabuto as he is captured by
Kurotsuchi
. Yamato creates a wooden beam that Aoba can walk on to approach Kabuto and read his mind like he did with Kisame, but Kabuto sheds his body to free himself. He goes after Yamato and, before being captured, Yamato pushes Motoi out of the way.

Kabuto escapes to the
Mountains' Graveyard
 where he and
Obito
 gather information from Yamato about the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. Kabuto also studies Hashirama's DNA within Yamato to strengthen the
White Zetsu Army
. Rather than kill Yamato when he has fulfilled his usefulness, they suspend him opposite
Hashirama's clone
 for future use.

Yamato

Yamato is an ancient name of Japan, and is also the name of a
World War II
 era
Japanese battleship
. Tenzō (
天造
) means "heavenly creation" and refers to anything created by nature, rather than by humans.

He could also be named after
Yamato Takeru
, who was a Japanese legendary prince of the Yamato dynasty and was believed to have been the first ninja.

"Kinoe" (
甲
) is the first sign of the Chinese calendar.

Studio Pierrots Settei sheets of Yamato show that he was 140 cm as a 10 year old Anbu and 166 cm as a 14 year old Anbu.

According to the databook(s):

Yamato's favourite foods are walnuts, while his least favourites are any food that is oily.

His hobby is reading books about architecture.

Yamato wishes to fight
Kakashi Hatake
.

Yamato has completed 996 official missions in total: 80 D-rank, 176 C-rank, 400 B-rank, 305 A-rank, 35 S-rank.

Yamato's favourite phrase is "Knocking on a stone bridge before crossing it" (
石橋を叩いて渡る
,
Ishibashi o tataite wataru
).

In the anime, it is revealed that Yamato suffers from motion sickness while in enclosed spaces.

Yamato is often affected by running gags in the series:

The prime running gag is that people overwork him because of his wood abilities. Best seen when he rebuilt some of Konoha and everyone wanted him to do more despite being out of energy after making a street of houses.

A running gag in
two

omakes
 is that whenever his teammates stop for the night, they constantly attack Yamato while still asleep. He was almost hit by Naruto's weapons and a
Rasengan
,
Kiba
's
Fang Passing Fang
 and even
Shino
's
kikaichū
 swarm. Such assaults always force him to use
Wood Release: Wood Locking Wall
 to protect himself and getting little to no sleep, making him look terrible in the morning.

He and
Orochimaru
 had a running gag during
Naruto
 &
Hinata
's wedding with him following Orochimaru, one example is him hiding in a barrel while Orochimaru was on a boat.

In the
Naruto
 character popularity polls, Yamato was ranked as the 14th most popular character in the 7th.

In the same poll, his
forehead protector
 ended in 76th place with 6 votes.

In

, Yamato has a non speaking role in the entire spin-off and only makes cameo appearances.

Quotes

(To his
team
) "
I like being nice and friendly, but I don't have any problems with ruling by fear either.
"

(To
Sakura
) "
It's not important whether the things you do are large or small, what's important… is the magnitude of the feelings you have for Naruto.
"

(To
Naruto
) "
If you want to save Sasuke, then do it with your own power. If you want to see Sasuke again, then look at him through your own eyes, not the Nine-Tails. If you want to protect Sakura, do it with your own strength, not the Nine-Tails'.
"

(To
A
) "
When you went after the
Hyūga
's
Byakugan
,
Konoha
 never did anything to retaliate. Your
actions
 could have provoked a war, but we swallowed our bloody tears in order to prevent that. Don't forget that you exist because of our precious sacrifices.
