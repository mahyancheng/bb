Plot Overview

After
Shabadaba
 revealed that he had betrayed the king, had him killed and took the throne, he sent a high number of men to kill Michiru, Hikaru, and all the others. Shortly after, Korega appeared to help
Naruto
 and the others from Shabadaba's henchmen and tells the ones he faces that they were all with the previous king and not the present king. After meeting
Kakashi
, Kakashi tells him to get Michiru and Hikaru out of the place with the coach. Meanwhile, Kakashi used
Earth Release
 to block the way to Korega.

Taking them to a place for a reason as to why he fought, he took them to Kakeru, the dying king. After Michiru, Kakashi and his team took the king's final words, Korega shed tears to his death.

Later on an attempt to get Michiru and Hikaru to board boats to safety, the
Wandering Ninja Clan
 intercepted them. Korega served for backup first, but after
Ishidate
 was about to turn into stone and kill Kakashi with his
Petrification Gauntlet
 Korega interfered with Ishidate, and explained how he wanted revenge for Kakeru's demise. Korega tried to slash Ishidate with his sword, but Ishidate dodged everything and toyed with Korega for a while. After hearing Michiru's cry for help, he shouted out loud, which left him off-guard. Ishidate placed his hand on Korega's back and turned him completely into stone. To mock Kakashi and Korega's team, Ishidate told them that what he just did was indeed a work of art. But it was not "perfect", so then he used Korega's own sword to shatter the stone body, killing him.

In the aftermath, Korega's team mourned for his death and stated that they will always remember Korega as their great and strongest captain.
