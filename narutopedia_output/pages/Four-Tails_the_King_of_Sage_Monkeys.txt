"
Four-Tails, the King of Sage Monkeys
" (
四尾・仙猿の王
,
Yonbi: Sen'en no Ō
) is episode 326 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

At the
Mountains' Graveyard
,
Sasuke
 quickly kills
White Zetsu
 with his
new technique
, while removing the bandages around his eyes to reveal his
Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan
. Elsewhere,
Suigetsu
 and
Jūgo
 discuss Sasuke and
Karin
 while en route to a hideout of
Orochimaru
. Meanwhile, on the battlefield,
Kakashi
 and
Guy
 battle against the reincarnated
jinchūriki
. Just as the
Five-Tails
 is about to attack,
Tobi
 releases a
chakra chain
 and subdues the
tailed beast
. Kakashi speculates that he has to output a lot of
chakra
 to keep them under his control and that when fully transformed, he almost has no control over them.
Naruto
 suddenly hears a voice speaking out for help and the
Eight-Tails
 recognises it as the voice of the Five-Tails. The Eight-Tails also telepathically speaks to the
Nine-Tails
, who shows irritation for humans because they only see the Tailed Beasts as pets they can bend to their will. The fox thinks back to all its previous encounters with
Madara
,
Hashirama
,
Mito
 and
Kushina
.
 Suddenly Tobi forces
Rōshi
 and
Utakata
 to fully transform, cutting Naruto and B from Kakashi and Guy, ending with the
Four-Tails
 swallowing up Naruto. In an alternate dimension located inside the tailed beast, Naruto meets the beast, who quickly becomes irritated by the former for calling him the Four-Tails and not giving him the respect of using its real name;
Son Gokū
. After brief discussion about the humans treatment of the tailed beast, upon which Naruto learned the Nine-Tails' name was
Kurama
, Son comes to realise that Naruto was different than most humans and truly wanted to help it and its kind. Son tells Naruto he could start by removing the chakra chains that bind it, to which Naruto eagerly accepts.

Trivia

In this episode, there are a few errors/changes:

In the manga, when Sasuke kills White Zetsu, his Susanoo Sword is made of Amaterasu. In the anime, it is made of the same ethereal substance Susanoo is made of.

In the manga, when Sasuke emerges from the Mountains' Graveyard, his
Sharingan
 is activated. In the anime, his Sharingan is not activated.
