"
The Scroll's Secret: No Peeking Allowed
" (
のぞき見厳禁!巻き物の秘密
,
Nozoki mi Genkin! Makimono no Himitsu
) is episode 35 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

In need of a second scroll, a recently awakened
Naruto
 contemplated forging a new
scroll
, although he would first need to read the original one that they already had. Before he could do so,
Kabuto
 arrived to stop him, citing that those who read the scroll were rendered unconscious until the exam's end; and that a
rival team
 had tried to open their scroll and had suffered this fate. Kabuto, separated from his teammates, accompanied
Team 7
 to the tower at the centre of the forest. Along the way, the group encountered a disorienting
genjutsu
 set by the
teammates
 of the
Ame

genin
 that
Sasuke
 had earlier defeated. By the time they realised that they were not getting any closer to the centre of the forest, it was too late, as they were attacked by a number of clones.

Trivia

Sakura mistakenly refers to their team never having a Heaven scroll, despite that being the scroll
Orochimaru
 took from them and burned.
