She returned to the residence when her father, Tōbei Kagetsu, supposedly died. His will specified she could inherit a portion of his fortune if her older brother,
Fūta Kagetsu
, was to laugh during there father's funeral. She and her fellow clan members did their best to make him laugh. She was shocked when Tōbei revealed he was alive and faked the whole thing. When he stated he wanted them to not focus on money and enjoy life again, she once again could find some humour in life.
