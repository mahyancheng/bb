The user creates
water
 in their body using
chakra
. The user then spits the water from their mouth as orb-shaped projectiles, whose destructive potential are determined by how much chakra is placed in them. The orbs travel quickly towards the target, dealing extensive damage upon impact. When
Gamabunta
 uses this technique, the water orbs are not only especially large, but are made more lethal because they're shot while he's airborne, thereby adding the force of gravity to their power.
