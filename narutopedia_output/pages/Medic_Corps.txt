The
Medic Corps
 (
医療部隊
,
Iryō Butai
) is a subdivision of
Konohagakure
's
medical-nin
 organisation and
hospital
. These shinobi generally work at the hospital full-time, and their roles are similar to those of field medical-nin in that they are deployed to aid the comrades who are out on missions. However, unlike field medical-nin that normally get assigned to a four-man-team to serve in that capacity, they move as an independent team comprised solely of medical-nin.

These shinobi are under the directions of 'Captains'. One of these captains,
Nonō Yakushi
 was stated to have found
Kabuto Yakushi
 after the
Battle of Kikyō Pass
.
 This story, however, may not be true although it was fabricated by
Orochimaru
.
 Medic Corps shinobi can be seen throughout the duration of the
Chūnin Exams
, and a team was also sent after the
Sasuke Recovery Team
.
