"
The Hidden Heart
" (
裏の心
,
Ura no Kokoro
) is episode 392 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

As the
tailed beasts
 go into battle against
Madara
,
Gaara
 and
Shukaku
 lead the way using a
cooperation ninjutsu
 on the Uchiha, which momentarily manages to immobilise him. The other tailed beasts follow suit with
fierce

techniques
. Using its body as a medium, Shukaku
seals
 Madara away, but before it could finish, the latter breaks free via
Susanoo
 before being intercepted by
Naruto
 and jointly tail-whipped by the tailed beasts.
 A
White Zetsu Army
 clone
emerges
 from the ground, giving Madara his original right eye. Now with his
Rinnegan
 restored, Madara brings forth the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 as it emerges from
Obito
's body.
Kakashi

attempts
 to stop the statue but only manages to amputate one of its arms. Standing atop the statue, Madara executes a
technique
 which repels the tailed beasts all at once. He then has the statue unleash its
chains
 to restrain them, and plans to extract the
Eight
 and
Nine-Tails
. As the targeted
jinchūriki
 continue to battle against their restraints,
Naruto
 attempts to exit
Tailed Beast Mode
, but finds that he is unable to suppress Kurama's chakra. Deeming Naruto's efforts futile, Madara redirects his attention to Shukaku. Gaara forms two enormous
sand hands
 to stop the chain from dragging the One-Tail. The tanuki, shocked that its former host would defend it, recalls its time with the young
Kazekage
. Shukaku also remembers its conversation with its previous jinchūriki
Bunpuku
, and finally realises that Gaara is the one whom the priest had foretold. Activating his Susanoo, Madara launches a
sword
 at Gaara, but Shukaku deflects it in time, declaring that it prided itself on its absolute defence after all.
