Part II

Paradise Life on a Boat

While on a mission, Kiji , his brother Sada, and
Bandō
 encountered
Sakura Haruno
,
Ino Yamanaka
,
Chōji Akimichi
 along with
Naruto Uzumaki
 who were trying to complete their mission to gather herbs from the
Nanakusa Island
. Because they were on a similar mission, and had already gathered most of the provisions on the island, they offered to allow the shinobi from
Konohagakure
 to pay for some of what they had gathered, but their offer was refused. Claiming that they could gather everything before them, they set out, reaching all the locations before the Konoha shinobi could.

When the teams met up having reached their final stop on the island, Kiji and his team having retrieved the final things on their list are attacked by a giant lizard and are subsequently rescued by Naruto. Grateful to him, Bandō offered some of their harvest from the island to them free of charge, something that shocked Kiji and his brother. As the grateful Konoha shinobi left, they asked him why he would do such a thing to which he told them that he was willing to take a loss now for future pay-offs later.
