Momoshiki grabs his opponent, throws them up in the air, and consumes a chakra edible, changing his appearance. Transformed, he sends five dog avatars which converge at his opponent, biting at them, before a fire pheasant crashes through them. Finally, Momoshiki punches his opponent back at the ground with a giant rock monkey.
