Summary

Hagoromo
 explains
Team 7
's current situation to the four
Hokage
, and how it was possible for his spirit to manifest from
Madara
's severed half. He mentions a jutsu he can no longer perform, having given much of his chakra to
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
.
Obito
 suffers from the intense chakra he used to find Sasuke, and thinks back to
Rin
, his old dreams of being Hokage, and his rivalry with
Kakashi
. Obito focuses on getting the three of them back to the others.

Kaguya
 and
Black Zetsu
 focus their efforts in attacking the Naruto with
Truth-Seeking Balls
 on his back, several shadow clones protecting it. Kakashi worries about being of little use in the fight. Obito returns with Sakura and Sasuke. Kaguya ensnares Naruto with her hair and strikes him down, only for it to be a clone as well, the real Naruto having passed it the Truth-Seeking Balls. Kaguya shifts to a high-gravity dimension, bringing everyone, including Kaguya herself, to the ground. Kaguya attacks them with her bones, but the high gravity interferes with her aim. She strikes again, compensating for it, but Obito and Kakashi throw themselves in front of it, thinking of Rin. Obito sends the bone that would have hit Kakashi away with Kamui, while he himself is struck. Obito tells Kakashi to stay a little longer.
