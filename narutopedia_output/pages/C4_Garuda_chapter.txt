Summary

Tobi
 runs while
Deidara
 creates his
C4
 explosive: a giant replica of himself. When it explodes it releases a cloud of microscopic bombs that cause whatever inhales them to disintegrate. After
Sasuke
 appears to succumb to this fate, Deidara starts to celebrate. He is attacked from behind by Sasuke, who saw the miniature explosives with his
Sharingan
 and evaded them, using a
genjutsu
 to make it look as though he had died. Sasuke finds that the Deidara he attacked was a
clay clone
, Deidara having known it was a genjutsu thanks to years of training to specifically defeat Sharingan illusions.
