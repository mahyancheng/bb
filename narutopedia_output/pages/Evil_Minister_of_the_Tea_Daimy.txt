Part I

Land of Tea Escort Mission

This minister and the
Wagarashi family
 challenged
Idate Morino
 of the
Wasabi family
 led by
Jirōchō Wasabi
 to a race for control of the town.

Later, it is revealed that he had done many bad things while in office. He had accepted bribes on their behalf and tried to use his authority to cheat in the outcome of the race almost dooming the Wasabi to disband forever. When the Tea Daimyō found out what his minister did, he dismissed him, stripping him of all his authority and ordered him to become a Monk.
