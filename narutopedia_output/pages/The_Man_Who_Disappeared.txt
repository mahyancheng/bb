The Man Who Disappeared
" (
消えた男
,
Kieta Otoko
) is episode 158 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

A
cloaked figure
 eats a fruit while watching a pass before dropping from a stone pillar.
Boruto
 practices
shurikenjutsu
 by himself, impressing
Sasuke
. He's heard that
Shojoji
's intel led to confirmation of the
organisation
's existence, and wants to go find out more about them, concerned about the
seal in his hand
. Sasuke warns him that seeking an enemy without enough understanding about them leads to death, and directs him to keep training to carry out his assigned missions. He concedes he can't really talk, since he left the village very young, and hands Boruto a glove to hide his seal, which draws attention.
Team 7
 is assigned a missing person's mission in the
Land of Valleys
. They're joined by a recently returned
Mugino
, who is familiar with the region. Mugino is terse with the genin, but eventually explains he spent the last few years mediating conflicts between smaller nations. They reach the Land of Valleys and report to
Mia
, who requested the mission. The missing person is her husband
Anato
, a researcher for a medical supplies' company. He was supposed to have return after a one month work related trip, but it's been three weeks since his intended return date, and the company won't divulge anything due to trade secrets. They go to the company where Anato worked.
 The receptionist assures Mia she'll be updated, as they have also sent a search party to look for Anato. While a distressed Mia makes a scene,
Mitsuki
 has a
snake
 look for information. He manages to learn where the company's search party was sent to look for Anato, a place he told Mia about. Someone watches them from afar. Approaching Anato's destination, the group is surrounded by other shinobi.
Victor
 tells his underlings to stand down. They're surprised the head of the company is involved in the search. Victor explains his motivations. The two groups exchange information, and narrow down Anato's possible location by ruling out places they've already investigated. They search a cave, finding tree roots and branches inside, before finding Anato on the other side. Anato unexpectedly attacks them.
