 appears and prevents the two from engaging further. He asks for a chance to speak with Sasuke, which will also give the Raikage an opportunity to deal with his arm. Gaara discourages Sasuke from a life of hate, citing his own experiences as proof that doing so won't solve anything. Sasuke rejects Gaara's suggestion that he can turn back. Gaara sheds tears for him. When

 and
Kankurō
 point out that if Sasuke could be convinced
Naruto
 wouldn't have failed and that Sasuke isn't Gaara. Gaara, the

,
Kiba

Lee
, off to find and speak with
Naruto
. In the
Land of Iron
,
Tobi
 sends
Sasuke
 and
Karin
 away. He then tells the
Kage
 that
Akatsuki
 seeks the
tailed beasts
 for the good of the world. The beasts were created centuries ago when the
Sage of the Six Paths
 split up the immense power of the
Ten-Tails
. If Tobi recombines the tailed beasts into the original Ten-Tails and seals the Ten-Tails within his body, he will be able to place an illusion over the entire world and end all wars. He asks the Kage to help him achieve this goal by giving him Naruto and
Killer B
 (in doing so revealing that B was never captured). They refuse, so he declares the start of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

 return to the idea of joining forces to fight
Akatsuki
. Because of
Danzō
's actions,
Konoha
 will not be permitted to join them until a new
Hokage
 is found, preferably
Kakashi
. Although
Killer B
 and
Naruto
 would be valuable assets in the war effort as Ōnoki states, the other three Kage believe putting them on the battlefield would make it too easy for Akatsuki to capture them. The Kage agree to dedicate all necessary resources to protecting them both. Naruto's training with
senjutsu
 is interrupted by the arrival of Sakura's group, so that she may speak with him.  Meanwhile, B begins to learn how to become a better singer from
Sabu

" (
キラービーVS鬼鮫!!

Sakura
 refutes
Naruto
's claim that she is lying. Although Naruto points out that she would not come to the
Land of Iron
 just to tell him she loved him, Sakura insists it is true. She encourages Naruto to give up on trying to bring
Sasuke
 back to
Konoha
 for her, but he states that that is no longer his main reason for looking for Sasuke. Sakura leaves without another word. She then starts her own search for Sasuke, unaware that
Sai
 is leaving behind an
ink clone
. Elsewhere, the battle between

 continues to attack
Kisame
, and
Samehada
 continues to absorb and grow stronger from his
chakra

Eight-Tails

Killer B

Samehada, having grown fond of B's chakra, stops him and protects B, even giving him back some of his chakra. Kisame kicks it away and tries once again to cut off B's legs.

 are captured while
Ao
 is elsewhere saved from death by the
Fifth Mizukage

Fū Yamanaka
, still in control of Ao's body, asks the Mizukage to help him remove the
Byakugan
's defences. This alerts her to Ao's predicament, forcing Fū to relinquish control. Meanwhile,
Sai
's
ink clone
 approaches
Naruto
 to tell him what
Sakura
 could not.

Author's Note

“

Recently, the batteries in my TV and DVD player remote control have started running out of juice, responding sluggishly when I press the buttons and not powering on easily. However, they do still eventually turn on, so I keep telling myself "Eh, it's still okay..." and procrastinating. And then I noticed something. Once the remote stops working at all, if I open up its battery case and rub the batteries, it starts working again! You all should try it too!
It's true... though it would be faster just to change the batteries.
