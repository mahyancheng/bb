Summary

Madara
 questions
Mū
 about the user of the technique which brought them back to life.
Kabuto
 takes full control of Mū to talk directly with Madara, explaining he brought him back in a special manner that makes him stronger than his prime.
Gaara
 attacks Madara but he dodges his sand and moves to counter-attack using a
widespread Fire Release
, which is countered by many Alliance shinobi using a water wall. Moving in to general melee he wreaks havoc on the Alliance forces until
Ōnoki
 raises the ground below him to capture him against
Naruto
's Rasengan. Madara defends himself with
Susanoo
. As Naruto prepares to go into Sage Mode, Ōnoki lightens Gaara's sand allowing him to pull Madara out of his Susanoo just in time to be hit by Naruto's
Rasenshuriken
. Madara activates the
Rinnegan
 and absorbs the Rasenshuriken, and Kabuto rejoices that his suspicions about the evolutionary chain of the Sharingan were correct. Madara replies that this power is not of Kabuto's creation, and using his Susanoo to weave hand-seals, draws a
meteorite
 towards the battlefield.
