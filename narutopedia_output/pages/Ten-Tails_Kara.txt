This article is about the Ten-Tails kept prisoner by Jigen.  For other uses, see

This
Ten-Tails
 (
十尾
,
Jūbi
) is a juvenile
tailed beast
 in
Kara
's possession,
 that is kept immobilised in a
dimension
 only accessible via
space–time ninjutsu
.

Appearance

The beast largely resembles Earth's Ten-Tails in its first form. While considerably smaller, it is still massive, comparable in size to the nine tailed beasts. It has a large, egg-shaped head with small spikes protruding from the top alongside a single spike on its chin, as well as a large mouth containing human-like teeth and a single eye with black, vein-like markings around it. It appears to have two small arms, as well as ten tails.

Abilities

The beast possesses a single red
dōjutsu
 containing several concentric rings and six
tomoe
, which
Sasuke Uchiha
 identified as a
Rinnegan
.
 It presumably has a massive reserve of
chakra
, as
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
 would take some when necessary. Being a tailed beast means the Ten-Tails is a living form of chakra, in which
Code
 compares it to moulding clay, allowing him to break off pieces which then can
form
 into
smaller humanoid beings
 that are much more nimble. Code also applied his
Claw Marks
 onto these beings, allowing them to have access to these portals.

Kawaki Arc

Kawaki Arc






Isshiki absorbs the Ten-Tails' chakra.



Upon being discovered by Sasuke, the beast was approached by Isshiki. Failing to bite
Jigen
, Isshiki stated it was too soon for it to eat him, leading to him
absorbing
 the Ten-Tails' chakra to strengthen himself.

Code
 was assigned to guard the Ten-Tails, in which nothing notable happened, leading to both him and the beast to fall asleep. It was not until Isshiki's death did his lingering spirit instruct Code to feed either Kawaki or Boruto to the beast to bloom into the God Tree. At the same time,
Momoshiki
 intended to find this beast in order to feed Kawaki to it so he could claim the chakra fruit for himself.






Code creating fission beings out of the Ten-Tails.



When Code was betrayed by
Ada
 and
Daemon
, he retreated to the Ten-Tails' holding pen, and decided to use the beast to destroy his enemies. He used his Claw Marks to tear off pieces of the Ten-Tails, reforming them into smaller humanoid beings to serve as his soldiers.

New Era: Part II

Boruto's Return Arc

Main article:
Boruto's Return Arc

During Code's attack on Konoha to draw Boruto out of hiding, his Claw Grime begin to devour Konoha shinobi, transforming into trees that encase their bodies, but keep them alive. Among those who have been devoured are
Bug
, Sasuke,
Soegi
,
Moegi
 and Shinki. After tracking Code to
Kara's dimension
, Boruto and Code discover that the main body of his Ten-Tails has disappeared and that several humanoid God Trees have emerged, having become self-aware and bearing visages resembling individuals devoured by the Claw Grime. They declare that they are no longer driven by their instinct to consume chakra and are more interested in satiating their newfound curiosity by acquiring knowledge, though they remain fated to one day devour Boruto.
