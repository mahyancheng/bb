Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

In the woods, the
Eight Man Squad
 find themselves unable to defeat
Akatsuki
 member
Tobi
. Despite
Naruto
 managing to hit him with a
Rasengan
,
Yamato
 binding him with his
Wood Release
 and
Shino
 using his
Secret Technique: Insect Sphere
, all of those attacks manage to
go through
 Tobi. Kakashi is forced to uncover his
Sharingan
, but does not go head to head with Tobi as
Zetsu
 arrives, announcing to everyone that
Sasuke
 has managed to kill
Itachi Uchiha
, shocking the group. Tobi immediately drops his high-pitched voice and goofy demeanour and reverts to a cold, harsh tone, telling the group that he will see them later. He and Zetsu then head to the
Uchiha Hideout
 in order to retrieve Sasuke and Itachi's bodies; however, before he leaves, he stares at Kakashi, and Kakashi notices in shock that Tobi possesses the Sharingan as well.

At the hideout ruins, Tobi asks Zetsu if he had
recorded the event
, as he wishes to analyse it later. Taking the bodies of the
Uchihas
, they flee to their hideout. Zetsu also stops the fight between
Kisame
 and
Suigetsu
, notifying them of Sasuke's victory and inviting
Hebi
 to the Akatsuki's hideout in the East. Kisame, however, chooses to resign from the Akatsuki following Itachi's demise. Meanwhile, using
Hinata
's
Byakugan
, the Eight Man Squad reach the hideout, only to find themselves blocked by Itachi's
Amaterasu
; Yamato uses his
Earth Release: Earth Flow Divide
 to provide them a safe passage. As they stand on the ruins of the hideout, they realise that Sasuke is gone, while Naruto cries about how he is never able to catch up to Sasuke.

At their hideout, Tobi reveals to Sasuke that he is a survivor of the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
 and partially removes his mask in order to show Sasuke his Sharingan. However, Sasuke's left Sharingan immediately activates and transforms into Itachi's
Mangekyō Sharingan
, igniting Tobi with Amaterasu. Fleeing and returning moments later, Tobi explains that Itachi must have
passed down
 the Amaterasu to Sasuke and have it rigged to go off if he made eye contact with his Sharingan. Sasuke wonders why Itachi would have done such a thing, and Tobi replies that he knows many things about Itachi that Sasuke does not, including the fact that Itachi was trying to protect Sasuke.
