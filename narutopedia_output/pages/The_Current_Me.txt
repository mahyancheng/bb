"
The Current Me
" (
今のオレは
,
Ima no Ore wa
) is chapter 665 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Apologising to his
master
 for being delayed so long,
Black Zetsu
 informs Madara that not only was he able to retrieve the
eye
, but also
Yin
-
Kurama
 from
Minato
 as well. Seemingly content with that, he commands Zetsu to bring both to him, but as the clone tries to leave
Obito
's body — no longer concerned about the threat around him — but finds himself unable to as his host regains consciousness.
The two
Uchiha
 have a conversation about Obito's role in Madara's
plan
, with the new
jinchūriki
 stating that the other was not Obito, but Madara, the one who rejected the world created by the
Sage of the Six Paths
 which had failed. Calling to him to stand by his side as he had once before, Obito starts walking towards Madara while Minato,
Kakashi
 and
Gaara
 try to stop them. However, their efforts prove futile as
Sakura
 watches on horrified and confused as she tries her best to keep
Naruto
 alive. Stretching out his hand to his ancestor once again, Obito bypasses Madara's own and instead sticks his hand into Madara's chest recreating the same
shakujō
 he wielded when he was the
Ten-Tails
' jinchūriki. Renouncing Madara's action and his plan as he remembers Naruto's words, Obito states that his current self is the one that wanted to become
Hokage
 — a person who stands at the forefront of hardship themselves and doesn't manipulate others to achieve their own goals. Declaring that he would no longer be Madara's pawn and hurt his comrades: because he's Obito Uchiha.

Trivia

In the last panel of page 12, Kakashi's
Sharingan
 is seemingly depicted as a normal eye. However, it was corrected in the tankōbon version.
