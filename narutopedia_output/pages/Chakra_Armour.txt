The
Chakra Armour
 (
チャクラの鎧
,
Chakura no Yoroi
) is a unique type of armour that blocks out opposing
ninjutsu
 and
genjutsu
 while strengthening the user's own chakra and techniques. A black-coloured prototype armour was worn by
Dotō Kazahana
.

Powered by a crystal-like object, the armor produces an invisible
barrier
 around the user to nullify or deflect most chakra-based techniques, as well as physical projectiles like kunai and
fūma shuriken
. The armour has been shown to be strong enough to deflect high-level
Water Release
 and protect its wearer from multiple
explosive tags
, though it became heavily damaged in the process.

Despite the advantage it gives the wearer, multiple wearers must be careful not to be too close to one another, as the armour is highly unstable and will, if sufficiently damaged, explode on contact with another suit's power source. Kakashi's
Lightning Cutter
 was able to crack
Nadare
's armour and  Sasuke's
Chidori
 did the same to Dotō's in tandem with another armor's crystal, suggesting the barrier produced by the armor is not an absolute protection. Overconfidence in it can cause a user to neglect their training in taijutsu, which the armor does not protect again, leading to their defeat.

Aside from these features, the Chakra Armour was also endowed with a wrist-mounted wire-launcher, enabling the user to either quickly move about using the wire, or to bind and restrain an opponent. Some suits of armour were also shown having built-in wings for gliding, such as the ones worn by
Fubuki Kakuyoku
 and Dotō.

Trivia

Bando
, the primary antagonist of
Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 2
, wears
a variation
 of the Chakra Armour, which functions similarly as the Yukigakure version by reducing incoming damage and increasing attack powers.
