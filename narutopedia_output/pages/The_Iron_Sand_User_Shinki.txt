The Iron Sand User: Shinki
" (
砂鉄使い・シンキ
,
Satetsu Tsukai: Shinki
) is episode 61 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

The final match, between
Boruto
,
Sarada
, and
Shinki
 begins. Shinki immediately attacks both Boruto and Sarada.
Kurotsuchi
,
Darui
, and
Chōjūrō
 discuss whether that is recklessness or a sign of confidence. Sarada proposes joining forces with Boruto to defeat Shinki, both as payback for
Mitsuki
 and because she doesn't want the Five Kage to see two Konoha shinobi losing in their home. Boruto has his clones attack with explosive tags and Sarada uses
Fire Release
 against Shinki, but he protects himself with his
Iron Sand
.
Naruto
 comments a similarity to
Gaara
's jutsu. Shinki uses the same iron fists he used to protect himself to attack, destroying Boruto's clones.
 Sarada observes Shinki's jutsu with her
Sharingan
, determining how he controls it. They consider using
Lightning Release
 to disrupt his control, but need a stronger jutsu than what Mitsuki used. They combine their Lightning Release jutsu, and while Shinki approves of their idea, he blocks the attack with a single fist, then grabs Boruto and Sarada. Shinki boasts about his power, angering Boruto. In response, he uses a clone to loosen the grip on Sarada, allowing her to launch an attack while both of Shinki's fists are occupied. He releases them to protect himself. Shinki creates wings with the Iron Sand, surprising Gaara. He targets Sarada, and while she dodges his initial onslaught, his constructs track her because of the mark he placed on her. Sarada charges Shinki, but his attack incapacitates, eliminating her from the match. Shinki angers Boruto by trash talking about his defeated friends. Boruto propels himself towards Shinki with a Lightning Release in hand, but is unable to break through the Iron Sand until he uses
Lightning Release: Purple Electricity
 from the
Kote
, defeating Shinki. Naruto deduces Boruto's use of a Scientific Ninja Tool, and exposes its use, disqualifying him. Naruto says they'll talk later, but Boruto calls him out on never having time to talk to him.
Katasuke
 steps in and begins advertising the Kote. Naruto detects
Momoshiki
 and
Kinshiki
's ill intent, and spots them flying above the arena.
