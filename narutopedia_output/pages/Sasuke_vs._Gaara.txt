) is chapter 111 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

As the fight between
Sasuke
 and
Gaara
 commences,
Kakashi
 apologises to
Sakura
 for worrying her by being late. He then remarks to
Guy
 about the
Anbu
 presence in the stadium,
Konoha
 not knowing how or when they will be attacked.
Naruto
, knowing how dangerous Gaara is, realises that the only person who can currently satisfy his blood-lust is Sasuke. At the same moment, Sasuke begins attacking Gaara fast enough to bypass his
Shield of Sand
, oddly reminiscent of
Lee
's fighting style.
