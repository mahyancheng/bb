Team Asuma

Sakura
 and
Kakashi
 and
Team Kurenai
 helps
Naruto
.
Tenten
 and
Neji
 arrive, but are cornered by the
reincarnated
 puppets.
Kakashi
 chases after Kabuto. The beast grabs Naruto to absorb
chakra
, which the
Nine-Tails
 gladly shares.
Hinata
 tries to defend Naruto, but is sent flying as Neji catches her in his arms. After the beast absorbs Naruto's chakra, it grows in size and starts to devastate the
Hachō Village
, even firing a
Tailed Beast Ball
 in far away, missing
Yamato
,
Sai
,
Deidara
 and
Hidan
 who are fighting outside the village. Dokku tries to save Naruto, who is still unconscious.

Moments before the beast tramples them, Kabuto
summons
 a snake to swallow both of them alive and retreats. While inside the underground
hole
 in the
Tonika Village
, Naruto, unconscious and strangled by snakes, meets the Nine-Tails again in his subconscious. The
Konoha
-nin investigates Kabuto's intention in the meanwhile.
Shiseru
 remembers an earlier conversation between her and Dokku about the pros and cons of them adopting the kids. While the Nine-Tails tries to control Naruto, Dokku calls him, but gets shouted instead. Dokku asks Naruto what burden a powerful person carries and made Naruto choose the reason why he desires to be powerful, seeing flashbacks of his comrades of Konoha and also
Sasuke
, leading to the seal inside Naruto to gain strength again. Dokku gives Naruto his
forehead protector
, stating that he believes in him. Meanwhile,
Leo
 decides to save their teacher by giving the mysterious iron bars which were mentioned earlier by the
Tonika Village Head
. While inside the hall, Kabuto, along with two reincarnated puppets, approaches with
Disonasu
, revealing the village leader's betrayal. Disonasu pulls out a scroll, revealing
Saezuri
, a mysterious light much to Naruto and Dokku's shock.

Trivia

Though he stated he could only restore the
seal
 once,
Minato
 manages to restore it with a
fūinjutsu
.
