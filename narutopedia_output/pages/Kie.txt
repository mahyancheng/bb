Kie
 (
帰依
) was a member of the original
Akatsuki
.

Background

In search of peace, Kie joined the independent group called Akatsuki. During one of the ordeals he and his comrades had to go through, Kie was injured and had to wear a sling on his arm. Later, during a gathering of Akatsuki members, he reaffirmed to
Konan
 his own and the others' endorsement of
Nagato
 and
Yahiko
.

He was presumably killed afterwards when
Obito Uchiha
 attacked the members of Akatsuki, who were on their way to save Yahiko, Nagato and Konan from
Hanzō
 and the
Konohagakure

Anbu
.

Personality

Kie was a very faithful person and he had great faith in Nagato and Yahiko. He cared deeply about the Akatsuki. He strongly supported Yahiko and the other's wishes, and continued to strive to change Amegakure.

Appearance

Kie had black eyes and long brown-coloured hair that he had tied in a bun in the back. He wore an Amegakure forehead protector with which he let two strands of his hair hang over on the sides of his face. He wore a black-coloured zip up robe with the zipper part being red. He also had a white sash wrapped around him from the right side of his waist up around his left shoulder.
