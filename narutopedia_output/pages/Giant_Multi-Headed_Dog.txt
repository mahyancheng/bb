A large, multi-headed dog with wings, this summon had a number of body piercings and
Rinnegan
, implying it was being controlled by
Nagato
.

Appearance

Its fur was all brown-coloured and it had a giant
black receiver
 stuck through its head. It also had black colouring around its mouth along with razor sharp teeth and fangs.

Abilities

It was modified by Pain using the
Amplification Summoning Technique
, so that it can split apart, when struck, into individual dogs that can then merge back together. It gained additional heads every time it splits in this way, and each duplicated head carried the
black receiver
 and the Rinnegan like the original. According to Nagato, the only way it can be defeated was by defeating its original summoner. In the anime, this summon was seen at different sizes, ranging from several stories tall to just tall enough to fit underneath trees.

This dog was also physically strong and resilient, since it broke through an
ANBU Captain's

Earth Release: Sticky Earth Drop
 technique, and
another's

Lightning Release: Sixteen Pillar Bind
, and received no more than minor burns from
Fire Release: Fired Pottery Technique
 despite having its legs cut off by the
Wind Release: Wind Cutter Technique
. Even a usually devastating attack, such as the
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
 couldn't kill it easily, as the dog merely continued to multiply. Even when hit by a technique like
Amaterasu
, while it was incapacitated it didn't vanish until after Nagato himself was struck.

Part II

Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant

It was first summoned during Pain's fight with
Jiraiya
, but
Gamaken
 was able to fend it off.

Six-Tails Unleashed

In the anime, it appeared before
Tsurugi
 and his
hunter-nin
 unit and attacked them.

Pain's Assault

It was summoned again during his attack on Konoha, where it fought against Gamaken,
Gamabunta
, and
Gamahiro
. They were unable to prevent it from splitting and it only disappeared once
Naruto
 defeated the
Animal Path
.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

It was summoned again during
Nagato
's and
Itachi Uchiha
's fight with
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Killer B
. Naruto attacked it only for Nagato to remind him that it can't be beaten directly. Later, after Itachi was freed from
Kabuto
's
control
 with the use of a
powerful genjutsu
 and his
crow
, he used
Amaterasu
 on the dog, incapacitating it.

Trivia

This animal summoning had the qualities of two Greek Mythological creatures, the
Lernaean Hydra
 (its abilities to produce more heads) and
Cerberus
 (its appearance of a dog with several heads).
