This is a high-level form of
medical ninjutsu
 that only
Tsunade
 has been shown to have mastered. Tsunade creates an electric field by giving her chakra the properties of electricity. When she strikes a target with her hand, the electricity pours into their nervous system and rearranges their body's signals. Ordinarily, the brain sends electric signals to the body to control how it moves. But when under the influence of this technique, these signals will produce any movement
other
 than what the brain intends. When used against most opponents, they will be unable to do something as simple as walking, much less continue fighting.

The target can partially overcome this technique if they manage to relearn the connection between their brain and their limbs, as
Kabuto Yakushi
 demonstrates. However, this is not an easy feat and takes a high amount of concentration and intelligence.

Trivia

Because of how its entry in
Tō no Sho
 is worded, it isn't clear if this qualifies as
Lightning Release
.

In
Jump Ultimate Stars
,
Sakura
 uses this technique by charging
chakra
 in her hand and thrusting the opponent with her palm, causing damage and leaving the target confused.
