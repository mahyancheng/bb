Guy
 and
Lee
 both activate the
Eight Gates
, Guy entering the Seventh Gate and Lee the Sixth. After a streak of hits throwing the opponent up in the air, Lee uses the
Reverse Lotus
 sending them down. Before they can reach the ground, Guy performs the
Morning Peacock
 and the
Daytime Tiger
, causing the tiger to consume the peacock's flames. Lee and Guy both rush through the combined jutsu, punching through their opponent, before the tiger explodes, spreading the peacock's flames.
