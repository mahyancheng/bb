"
Madara Uchiha Arises
" (
うちはマダラ、立つ
,
Uchiha Madara, Tatsu
) is episode 391 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

As
Obito
 lies powerless, he notes
Rin
 was his only light and hope in life and that the world began to change after her demise.
Minato
 notes that Obito will die after having a tailed beast extracted but
Yin

Kurama
 assures him that he will survive due to having the
Demonic Statue
 inside him. Elsewhere,
Madara
 is
subjugated
 by
Hashirama
 after
Naruto
's earlier
attack
 failed to deal damage on him. Unbeknownst to those around him, Madara secretly puts his plan into motion.

Obito
 attempts to amend his mistakes by using the
Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 to revive those he killed, noting he had finally understood why
Nagato
 betrayed him. However,
Black Zetsu

emerges
 from the ground, and takes control of Obito's body to force him to revive Madara.
Sai
 then makes his effort to
seal
 the immobilised Madara, albeit a failed attempt.  Madara is then fully resurrected, but this comes with a price as his eyes begin to crumble; the former having forfeited his eyes during his life. Giving Madara no time to relent,
Sasuke
 engulfs him in the flames of
Amaterasu
, but to no avail. Removing his armour, a fully revived Madara directs his attention to
Hashirama
 and begins to absorb the latter's
senjutsu
. Though Sasuke resorts to
kenjutsu
 instead, he is easily overwhelmed by the elder
Uchiha
 despite having no eyesight. Elsewhere,
Kakashi
 and
Minato
 question just what had happened and Black Zetsu notes that Madara has been brought back to the living world. As the two Uchiha continue battling, Madara calls for Sasuke to join forces with him but the latter refuses. Overpowering his opponents, Madara eyes his target to the
tailed beasts
, determined to hunt them down.
