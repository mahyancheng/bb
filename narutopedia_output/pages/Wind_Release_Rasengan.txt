The
Wind Release: Rasengan
 is an original technique created by
Naruto Uzumaki
.

Overview

After learning
Minato Namikaze
 created the
Rasengan
 with the intention of combining it with his own
nature
, a task that proved too difficult for him to complete prior to his death,
 Naruto struggled to combine the Rasengan with his
wind
-nature, which he described as needing to look left and right at the same time.
 He is eventually able to overcome this obstacle by using
shadow clones
: he provides the
chakra
, one shadow clone
shapes
 the chakra into a sphere, and a second infuses the sphere with wind.
 The end product becomes the Wind Release: Rasengan.
 Users who have mastered the Rasengan's shape transformation will only need one shadow clone, to provide the wind-nature,
 and with additional experience users can perform it without any shadow clones at all.

Naruto's version appears largely identical to a standard Rasengan, but is stronger,
 and capable of being thrown.
 When used in combination with
Water

Release
, its wind nature can
expand
 the other jutsu's coverage area.
 Konohamaru's usage is surrounded by an aura and generates a large current of air, with its strength being capable of destroying a hill from a distance.
 Boruto's is uniquely green in chakra and sports rings around the central sphere. Though his is incomplete, Boruto is able to throw it.

Tailed Beast Influence

In the
Sasuke Shinden
 novel, Naruto uses the power of the
Nine-Tails
 to form a Wind Release: Rasengan that he's able to throw; he also doesn't need any shadow clones to create it. When it hits its target, it creates a shockwave of wind away from Naruto. In the anime, Naruto instead uses "
Rasengan: Flash
".

Trivia

In the anime,
Asura Ōtsutsuki
 developed
Amenomihashira
, a precursor to this technique.
