 anime.

Synopsis

Kawaki
 decides to fix the vase he broke.
Himawari
 places flowers on the vase Kawaki bought. She finds Kawaki trying to glue her vase back together. He thinks that doing so is impractical, and Himawari thanks him for buying a new vase, finding it enough.
Boruto
 listens to them.
Koji
 watches Kawaki through his
toad
, and thinks about his next steps.
Code
 asks
Amado
 about
Jigen
's whereabouts. Amado explains Jigen is recovering and asked not to be disturbed. He tells Code he's going through Kawaki's file looking for clues that a traitor might have accessed them, and shares his concerns about Jigen's relaxed disposition and apparent detachment to the Vessel. Code assures him that Jigen is still very much invested in Kawaki, having mentioned it's impossible for him to escape Jigen, though he doesn't understand exactly what that means. He suggests Jigen already knows who the traitor is, which angers Amado for doing so much work for nothing. Amado asks Code to check on
Boro
, assuring him that Jigen will be pleased.
 When Code asks about Koji, Amado says
Delta
 is already on it, and wonders to himself what Koji is doing. Enraged by Koji's attitude, Delta deploys her
spy drone
, its lack of
chakra
 meaning it won't be sensed. Despite the animosity between them, Boruto agrees to help Kawaki learn more about the
Kāma
, finding his argument to be sound.
Naruto
 listens to them. He and Himawari watch Boruto and Kawaki activate their Kāma and begin fighting. Naruto explains Kawaki's abilities to Himawari. Satisfied with Boruto's performance, Kawaki fires a blast at him, wanting him to absorb it with his Kāma. Boruto fails to do so, but isn't hurt much. With the sparring over, Naruto has them perform the
Seal of Reconciliation
. They both experience pain in their hands, and Boruto has a vision of
Momoshiki
. Through his toad, Koji notices Boruto's hand healing and speculates on it. Delta finds Kawaki through her drone, and decides to get him herself. Using
jets on her legs
, she flies through the
village
. The
Konoha Barrier Team
 detects her, and
Ino
 alerts Naruto. He gives her instructions. Koji sees Delta in flight. Naruto warns the kids about the incoming danger and wants them to leave. Delta arrives before they can leave.
