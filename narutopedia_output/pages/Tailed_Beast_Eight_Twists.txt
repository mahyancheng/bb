After assuming his
full Eight-Tails transformation
, Killer B tightly coils the beast's tails around himself, before extending them with an enormous amount of physical strength. This causes him to spin rapidly, resulting in the generation of tremendous gusts of wind that buffets everything in the surrounding area. This technique was powerful enough to level the terrain within a large range of the Eight-Tails.

Trivia
