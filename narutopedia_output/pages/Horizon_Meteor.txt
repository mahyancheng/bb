The user launches a series of
Truth-Seeking Balls
 at the opponent, forcing them straight into the ground. Then, several platforms, alongside the opponent, are lifted into the air, with the user creating an
invisible clone
 to strike the opponent hard enough to blow them onto another floating platform. After that, four more invisible clones are created, which punch the opponent with force enough to send them straight into the ground. Finally, the user uses
Chibaku Tensei
 to create multiple satellites and drop them on the opponent.
