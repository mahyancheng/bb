Summary

Naruto
's attempt at forming a
Tailed Beast Ball
 fails, and is forced out of
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
. Naruto tells
Dodai
 that he needs to contact
B
 and the
Eight-Tails
. As the Raikage suddenly attacks them, Dodai forms a
rubber ball
 as a decoy to buy Naruto some time. Dodai contacts
Inoichi Yamanaka
, who allows Naruto to talk to B. Naruto tells B that he wants to talk to the Eight-Tails. The Eight-Tails tells Naruto that when it and the Raikage fought they collapsed with both of their techniques in hand. The Raikage cuts the rubber ball in half and sees that Naruto isn't in it. He heads towards Naruto's location. Naruto goes in to
Sage Mode
 and plans to use
Frog Kata
 to sense the Raikage's attack faster. The Raikage attacks with a one-finger nukite, but Naruto dodges and hits the Raikage's arm with a Rasengan, knocking his attack into his own chest. The sealing team immediately seals the Raikage. Elsewhere, the
Second Mizukage
 stands before an exhausted Gaara and asks him if that was all he is capable of.
