 as the new
Hokage
. The villagers are eager to have her begin her official duties, but
Naruto
 insists that she help
Sasuke
 and
Kakashi
 first. They run into
Shikamaru
 along the way, who, given his history with women, is unhappy that the Hokage is a woman too. He later reluctantly has lunch with

, the only advance in rank from the
Chūnin Exams
.

 too.

Chapter 173

"
Those Suffering
" (
苦悩する者たち
,
Kunōsuru Mono-Tachi
)

Tsunade
 examines the damage to
Lee
's back and finds there are bone fragments lodged in his spine. Although she, and only she, could try removing them, Lee will die if she fails. Since her odds of success are only 50%, she advises he give up his dreams of being a ninja. To
Guy
's disappointment, Lee accepts his prognosis and leaves. While
Team 10
 is having lunch,
Chōji
 insists that he get to have the last morsel of food, claiming it is the best.
Asuma
 points out that he should train more and become a
chūnin
 like
Shikamaru
, upsetting him.
Sasuke
, still recovering from his encounter with
Itachi
, thinks about how useless he was and how much
Naruto
 has surpassed him.
Orochimaru
 elsewhere sends his
Sound Four
 to
Konoha
.

Chapter 174

"
Feelings, Each One…!
" (
想い、それぞれ…!
,
Omoi, Sorezore…!
)

Naruto
 thinks about his lunch with
Iruka
. Iruka is happy with Naruto's development, but informs him that he will now need to start doing actual work. After the failed
Konoha Crush
, the
village
 is operating with a diminished manpower and ninja are being sent on more difficult missions and more often. Naruto is eager to start doing his part. After
Team 10
 has lunch,
Ino
 tells
Shikamaru
 that
Chōji
 should go on a diet. Shikamaru defends him. Chōji tells Shikamaru that, now that he is a
chūnin
, his superiority to
Sasuke
 and
Neji
 is only more apparent. Shikamaru is unconcerned since he only wants to be himself, which he tells Chōji to strive for too. Naruto visits Sasuke in the hospital. Because so many others have shown a special interest in Naruto, Sasuke demands that they fight each other. Naruto accepts.

Chapter 175

"
Naruto vs. Sasuke!!
" (
ナルトvsサスケ!!
,
Naruto Bāsasu Sasuke!!
)

Over
Sakura
's objections,
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 head to the hospital roof to fight. Regarding the battle casually, Naruto asks Sasuke to put on his
Konoha

forehead protector
. Sasuke refuses since that would mean that they are equals, upsetting Naruto for not acknowledging himself as Konoha ninja. Naruto surrounds Sasuke with
shadow clones
, which Sasuke destroys with his
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
. As the smoke clears Sasuke sees that one clone has survived and is helping Naruto form the
Rasengan
. He uses his own
Chidori
 and they charge at each other. Sakura screams for them to stop.

Chapter 176

"
They Who are Called Rivals
" (
ライバルというもの
,
Raibaru to Iu Mono
)

Sakura
 puts herself between
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 to get them to stop, but they are not able to.
Kakashi
 catches them and sends them into two opposing water towers. He points out that they went overboard for a casual fight, and Kakashi lectures Sasuke for using the
Chidori
 against a friend. Sasuke is unconcerned, instead happy to see that his Chidori did more damage to the water tower than Naruto's
Rasengan
. On closer examination, however, he finds that the Rasengan did more damage. He jealously leaves. Kakashi also lectures
Jiraiya
 for teaching Naruto the Rasengan saying he is too young to handle it, and Jiraiya shoots back that Kakashi shouldn't have taught the Chidori to someone hellbent on vengeance. Kakashi continues saying he should know better since Sasuke and Naruto are like
Orochimaru
 and Jiraiya once were; Naruto longs to be acknowledged by Sasuke as an equal, and Sasuke is feeling inferior to Naruto's growth . Kakashi assures Sakura that he will speak with Sasuke. Elsewhere, the
Sound Four
 observe Sasuke.

Chapter 177

"
The Oto Four
" (
音の四人衆
,
Oto no Yoninshū
)

Kakashi

ties

Sasuke
 to a tree so that he can speak to him without running off. Kakashi advises Sasuke against his pursuit for revenge against
Itachi
. Sasuke retorts that Kakashi doesn't know what he's been through and offers to kill everyone Kakashi loves. Kakashi points out that everyone he loves is already dead. However, both he and Sasuke have found friends in
Team 7
, and they would do well to value what they still have more than what have lost. Kakashi leaves him to consider it and he struggles to forget about Itachi. Before he can reach a conclusion he is attacked by the
Sound Four
. He quickly repels them and challenges them to try again.

Chapter 178

"
Oto's Invitation…!!
" (
音の誘い…!!
,
Oto no Izanai…!!
)

The
Sound Four
 attack
Sasuke
 again, this time having more success. Sasuke still retains the advantage. Meanwhile,
Sakura
 thinks about Sasuke and wonders if it was a good idea to tell
Naruto
 about the
cursed seal
 Sasuke received from
Orochimaru
, which he had previously instructed her not to. Naruto assured her that Sasuke would never give in to Orochimaru's temptations, putting a smile on her face. Sasuke, however, has been defeated by the Sound Four. They tell him he will never be able to defeat them if he remains in
Konoha
, as only Orochimaru can give one true power.

Chapter 179

"
Don't Forget…!!
" (
忘れるな…!!
,
Wasureruna…!!
)

The
Sound Four
 remark that
Orochimaru
 is wasting his time with
Sasuke
. Sasuke activates his
cursed seal
 in an effort to prove them wrong, but they are unimpressed since they have greater control over their own cursed seals. They remind him of his desire to kill
Itachi
 and promise that Orochimaru could give him the strength he needs, improving his cursed seal being only one of many possibilities. They leave Sasuke to pick between Orochimaru and
Konoha
, and Sasuke reaches a decision. Elsewhere,
Lee
 reflects on his dreams of becoming a splendid ninja that excels in
taijutsu
. As he remembers the confidence
Guy
 has always had in him, Guy comes to see him.

Chapter 180

"
It's a Promise!!
" (
約束だ!!
,
Yakusoku da!!
)

Lee
 is indebted to
Guy
 for giving him hopes of achieving his dreams of becoming a ninja and guidance in fulfilling those dreams. However, Guy's advice of hard work will do him no good with the operation that will restore him to fighting capability, as his survival is a matter of luck rather than skill or persistence. Because his death would leave him unable to be a ninja in any capacity, he is torn over what to do. Guy tells him to go through with the operation since Lee would only be even sadder if he gave up on his dream. If he at least tries to resume his life as a ninja, that will make all the difference and he will definitely survive. Lee is still reluctant, so Guy tells him that if Lee died in pursuit of his dreams, Guy would die too for being unable to fulfil his own dreams of helping Lee achieve his dreams. Lee decides to go through with the operation.

Author's Note

“

I've recently been feeling the limits of expression in manga. With manga's particular style of reading from top right to bottom left, the order of dialogue severely limits the angle of the camera... Isn't there another way...?
