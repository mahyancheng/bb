This technique is a specialty of
Kirigakure
 ninja. Users fill the air with mist and control its thickness with their
chakra
. Once the mists are thick enough that opponents cannot see, that in turn means they cannot manage much defence against the user.
Zabuza Momochi
 famously used this technique to perform
assassinations
;
 although he also could not see within the mists, he was able to locate his targets based only on the sounds they made.
 The mists can be created using water from the surroundings,
 or users can create the mists themselves, which they exhale from their mouths.
 If the mists are made thick enough, they can cancel out the enhanced vision of the
Sharingan
 and
Rinnegan
.
 In the anime,
Byakugan
 users are able to see through the mists.

Sensors
 also can still find targets despite the lost visibility.

Trivia

In
Naruto: Shippūden
 episode 15
,
Itachi Uchiha
 claims that the mist does not prevent him from using his Sharingan, contradicting both the manga and earlier anime scenes.

In one of the cutscenes for
Naruto Mobile
, the mist Zabuza forms spreads out from his body in a vortex that can deflect
shuriken
 and
kunai
.
