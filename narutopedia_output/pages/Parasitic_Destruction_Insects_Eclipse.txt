Shino manipulates his
kikaichū
 to form a giant pillar that collapses into a wave that engulfs the opponent. The bugs then turn into a whirlpool that drag the opponent below ground before spouting out as a pillar that implodes.

Trivia

"Shoku" (
蝕
) can mean both "meal" and "eclipse". However, "meal" is usually written as "食".
