The bikōchūmodoki.



The
bikōchūmodoki
 (
微香虫もどき
,
literally meaning:
 pseudo-bikōchū) is a giant insect which is similar to
bikōchū
.

It lives in a special bug habitat, uninhabited by humans. It has a long nose (to which the shape is similar to the trunk of an elephant), white antennae (like elephant tusks) placed in front of its eyes (further down its head) and blue eyes. Vicious in temperament, it's provoked when its nose is poked, and when it gets angry, there is a possibility that it may eat people. When it gets angry its eyes become red and, before attacking, it makes cries like that of a warthog. When ramming to attack it makes the trumpeting cry of an elephant and some snorts of a warthog. But despite its large size, it still has the capability to fly (as shown when it attacks).
