Through the power of the
Animal Path
, the user is able to
summon
 people and animals which will come to possess copies of the
Rinnegan
. As with the
Six Paths of Pain
 and the
King of Hell
, animals summoned through this technique are visually linked to the user's own Rinnegan, offering them a greater field of view. The summons' bodies are also adorned with a number of
black piercings
, allowing the user to control them remotely through the use of their
chakra
. People summoned with the technique can also be granted a portion of the
Six Paths Technique
.

Trivia

When
Nagato
 uses this technique, he refers to it simply as "
Summoning Technique
",
 whereas
Kabuto Yakushi
 uses the technique's full title.

Unlike the usual Summoning Technique, this technique does not appear to require a blood offering.
