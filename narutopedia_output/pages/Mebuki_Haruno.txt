,
Haruno Mebuki
) is a
kunoichi
 from
Konohagakure
. She is also a member of the

Background

In the anime, after learning that her daughter was to be taught by
Kakashi Hatake
, Mebuki and
her husband
 were visited by Kakashi and the
Third Hokage
, inviting them for tea.

Personality

Mebuki seems to be a kind and caring woman, seen from her concern over her daughter's then-confused state. In contrast to her light-hearted husband, she is much more serious which causes constant banter between the couple as sometimes Mebuki believes her husband Kizashi tends to take things too lightly all the time.

Appearance






A younger Kizashi and Mebuki in an alternate universe.



Mebuki is a fair-skinned woman with shoulder-length, blonde hair with a single bang which falls down into her face. She also has green eyes and wears a white
qipao
 dress with three red circular designs at the bottom of the front of her dress as well as the back. Underneath the dress, she wears pink ¾-length pants along with brown sandals. In the anime, when Sakura was a child, Mebuki wore a red qipao dress similar to what her daughter would wear as a genin.

Mebuki's alternate-world self was seen wearing the standard Konoha-nin attire complete with a
flak jacket
. She did not, however, wear the village's
forehead protector
.

Abilities

In the anime, it is shown that Mebuki is adept at using
taijutsu
, as seen when she was able to defeat a sumo wrestler with a single kick. She can also fight using unorthodox weapons such as a frying pan.

After coming home from a sale across town with her husband, Mebuki found
Ino Yamanaka
 and a seemingly confused Sakura at their doorstep. Seeing the familiar faces, Sakura was initially shocked and confused but later ran off in tears much to everyone else's confusion. When Kizashi gave her back the necklace she had lost and produced one similar to it from around his neck, Sakura tearfully hugged the two, confusing them even more. Despite this, her parents depart, leaving her with Ino, and telling their daughter to come home whenever she was ready.
