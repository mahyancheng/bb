"
Asura's Decision
" (
アシュラの決意
,
Ashura no Ketsui
) is episode 467 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Asura
 feels his chakra reacting to the location. He comes to the conclusion that the sap of the
God Tree
 is what is making people sick. It acts as a fertiliser to the land, and when people eat food grown in that land, the sap builds up on them. Asura and
Taizō
 suspect that because the village elder had the place under guard, he is aware of this. Asura, Taizō, and
Kanna
 talk with the village elder about the God Tree, Asura explaining he was sent to do something about it.
 The elder explains how dire their situation was before the God Tree started nourishing the land, with yearly droughts, and countless deaths due to starvation. Kanna is resigned to continue living there and endure what comes. Asura tells the villagers about the dangers of the God Tree, but the villagers turn against him when they learn he's from the village of
Ninshū
. Hagoromo and
Gamamaru
 discuss Indra and Asura's missions, both having been sent to villages with the same problem. In the village he was sent to,
Indra
 is certain all the villagers together won't be able to reach a decision. Thinking back to Hagoromo's words, Asura decides to help the village without destroying the God Tree, even if it takes him years. Indra returns from his journey. Kanna finds Asura and Taizō digging a well. Hagoromo wants to wait for Asura's return before making his decision. Indra meets with
Black Zetsu
, who continues to influence him. After a year has passed, Asura returns to the
Land of Ancestors
 with some of the villagers. Gamamaru informs Hagoromo what he learned watching the two from afar. In the village Asura visited, after learning his plan to dig a well, the villagers helped him, and Asura taught them Ninshū. Working together, they managed to find water, allowing them to safely destroy the God Tree. Hagoromo reaches a decision.
