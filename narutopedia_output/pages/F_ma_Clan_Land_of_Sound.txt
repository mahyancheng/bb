This article is about the anime-only Fūma clan from the Land of Sound. For the Fūma clan from the manga, see
Fūma Clan
.

The
Fūma Clan
 (
ふうま一族
,
Fūma Ichizoku
) is a
shinobi
 clan from the Land of the Rice Fields, where
Orochimaru
 established the
Land of Sound
. The clan specialises in using chakra threads and also have a large number of shinobi trained in archery. It also has a number of hidden techniques, including the
Curse Mandala
. The clan split into two factions where some of their most powerful members were tricked into joining Orochimaru, who promised to restore their clan's name and status, and were used in his
kinjutsu
 development experiments. The other faction became involved in criminal activity and were considered traitors by the rest of the clan.

Trivia

The name "Fūma" (
ふうま
) is usually written in hiragana. However, in
Naruto

episode 137
, a banner saying "Fūma Lane" (
風馬小路
,
Fūma Kōji
) is shown. Here, the name Fūma is written with the kanji for "wind" and "horse". Regardless of how it is written, the name likely stems from the real-life ninja clan founded by the legendary
Fūma Kotarō
. This clan's name is written the same as the manga's Fūma Clan's name, 風魔 (
"Wind Demon"
).

The manga features another
Fūma Clan
. The manga's Fūma Clan are the creators of the
Fūma Shuriken
 and one of their members became a body of
Pain
. It is unknown whether the Fūma Clan from the anime and the manga are the same, but it is unlikely, since the names are written differently and the clans' descriptions differ.
