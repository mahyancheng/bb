Tsukigakure
 (
月隠れの里
,
Tsukigakure no Sato
,
English:
 Hidden Moon Village,
literally meaning:
 Village Hidden under the Moon) is a hidden village led by
Tsukino
, who succeeded her
father
 after he died. They have a hereditary system and so positions are passed down to the next generation.

It is a custom for the people of Tsukigakure to always give strangers and newcomers warm welcomes, because of an ancient legend of the village.

Legend

"In a time of war, a wanderer from afar did happen upon the Tsukigakure. Great were the trials he endured to drive off the destruction that placed the moon in such peril. He had a noble heart and a spirit bound by none. So was revealed our heroic saviour. His name rang with the pureness of his soul. Like unto a gentle breeze."

Trivia
