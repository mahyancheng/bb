Within each division of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 there was a team of
shinobi
 with the express purpose of capturing the
reincarnated individuals
 used by the
opposition
. The shinobi that composed these teams were predominantly from
Sunagakure
 and are capable of using the
Cloth Binding Technique
. After the target has been bound,
seals
 are then applied to the bindings in order to prevent
Kabuto Yakushi
 from
retrieving
 them and then simply re-deploying them to the battlefield.
