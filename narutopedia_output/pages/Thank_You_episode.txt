Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Tobi
 is defeated, he notifies
Minato
 that while he may have been foiled this time, he would continue with his plans of world domination, and proceeds to
teleport
 away. In
Konoha
, the
Nine-Tails
 continues its rampage, no longer controlled by the
Sharingan
.
Iruka
 wishes to stay on the battlefield along with his
mother
 and
father
, but they have him escorted away from the area, with his father telling him that it was a parent's duty to protect their child. Soon after, Iruka's parents are both killed. Elsewhere,
Shinku Yūhi
 prevents the younger
ninja
 from interfering in the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
, and reminds his daughter
Kurenai
 that she is not just a
shinobi
, but also a woman, and tells her that all he would like is for her to have a child to whom she'd pass down the
Will of Fire
.

The
Third Hokage

summons

Monkey King: Enma
 and has him
transform
 into an adamantine staff, which he extends and uses to forcefully push the
tailed beast
 out of the village. The Nine-Tails retaliates by preparing a
Tailed Beast Ball
, but Minato summons
Gamabunta
 in mid-air, causing the giant toad to land on the fox, while using his
Flying Thunder God: Guiding Thunder
 technique to teleport himself and the fox further outside the village. As the Tailed Beast Ball detonates, Minato uses his
Flying Thunder God Technique
 to teleport away from danger and reappears moments later with
Kushina
 and
Naruto
.

Kushina uses her
Adamantine Sealing Chains
 to restrain the Nine-Tails and asks Minato to seal the beast back within her so that she may die with it inside of her; doing so would create an interval until the Nine-Tails is able to revive itself back to life. She expresses sorrow at not being able to see Naruto all grown up. However, Minato decides to use the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
 to seal half of the fox's
chakra
 into Naruto; as he is unable to seal the entire thing, he decides to seal the other half into himself before he dies. Knowing that the Dead Demon Consuming Seal comes at the cost of the user's life, Kushina demands to know why Minato would kill himself and leave Naruto to be an orphan, as well as condemn him to life as a
jinchūriki
. Minato tells her that it is his duty to die for his son and reminds Kushina that Konoha needs a jinchūriki in order to maintain the balance of power and that he believes that Naruto is the
Child of Prophecy
 that
Jiraiya
 spoke of, who would defeat Tobi. He adds that by using the Dead Demon Consuming Seal, he would be able to seal a portion of Kushina's chakra into the
Eight Trigrams Sealing Style
 so that she may meet Naruto when he is older, as he believes meeting her once is far favourable than for Naruto to never meet her at all, adding that he would never be able to replace Kushina.

Erecting a
barrier
 around them, Minato summons the
shinigami
, who pulls out the Yin half of the Nine-Tails' chakra and seals it into himself. Realising that Minato plans to seal the other half into the newborn Naruto, the fox tries to kill Naruto with his claw, only for Minato and Kushina to impale themselves on it. Summoning
Gerotora
, Minato gives him the key for the seal, instructing him to pass it on to Jiraiya, as Kushina bids her last words to Naruto; the entire scene is observed by the Third Hokage and two
Anbu
 guards, who are unable to penetrate the barrier. Kushina apologises for taking too much time, leaving Minato very little time to seal his own chakra, but Minato deems it alright. Minato then uses the
Four Symbols Seal
 to seal the rest of the Nine-Tails inside Naruto along with both his and Kushina's chakra, and they die.

Kushina finishes sharing her tale with Naruto, apologising for having made him into a jinchūriki as well as for not being present in his life. Naruto admits that in the past, his life was hard due to being both an orphan and a jinchūriki, but that he does not hate his parents for what they did since they gave up their lives for him. Crying, Kushina hugs him, thanking Naruto for making her and Minato into parents and fades away, as Naruto sheds tears.
