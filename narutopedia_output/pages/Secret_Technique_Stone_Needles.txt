This technique makes use of the user's chakra as a paralysing agent. The user throws kunai with strings attached at the opponent. Once the enemy is hit, chakra is ran through the string to paralyse them, which will serve to either incapacitate or allow the user to attack.
 However, against those who can
absorb chakra
, this technique could backfire as the target may simply steal chakra from the user, while exhibiting immunity to the paralysis, as
Kisame
 demonstrated.

Trivia

Stone needle
 (
石鍼, 石針
,
ishibari
) is an old word for
acupuncture
 needles, indicating the stone needles used as far back as Stone Age China to open abscesses. The pressure points used in acupuncture are said to be able to inflict great pain, paralysis, and even death, hence this technique's name. This offensive use has long been featured in fiction as an unorthodox, but elegant fighting method.
Haku
, for example, uses this to great effect.

In
Naruto Mobile
, Aoba uses this technique in conjunction with
Scattering Thousand Crows Technique
. He directs the crows towards the enemy and they obscure their vision so that they do not notice Aoba attacking them.
