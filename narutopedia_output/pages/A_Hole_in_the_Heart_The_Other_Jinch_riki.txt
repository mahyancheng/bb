Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Gyūki
 notifies
B
 who had stopped for yet another bathroom break that
Naruto
 was far ahead of them, to the beast's exasperation
Motoi
 catches up to B and informed them that he had been sent to assist them. As they proceed towards the battlefield, a small faction of the
White Zetsu Army
 nearby plotted an ambush on the duo.
Kabuto Yakushi
 who had also located B decided to enable another one of his special war potentials  in order to capture Killer B. As the coffin emerges from underground — comically uncovering the White Zetsu in the process — the contents of the coffin is revealed to be Blue B, the previous
jinchūriki
 of the Eight-Tails.
 As the two parties converse, Blue B advises them that he was not in control of his body and that they needed to escape but B notes that without Gyūki, he did not pose as much a threat as he would have. Blue B, however, enters Version 2, shocking B and Motoi. It is then revealed that it was
Orochimaru
's experiments and actions which brought about Blue B's death and Gyūki's rampage some thirty years prior. As the two men fight in their respective Version 2 states, it is revealed that Orochimaru had infiltrated
Kumogakure
, drugged Blue B, and extracted Gyūki who launched into a
mindless
 rampage in order to collect some of the beast's cells. Ultimately, with some
help
 from Motoi, Killer B is able to convey his feelings to Blue B who is glad to know that B had found something to fill the void left by being a jinchūriki. As his body deconstructed, Blue B ordered B to end the war. With this, B rushed towards the battlefield noting that his war had just begun.
