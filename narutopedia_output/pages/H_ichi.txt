Appearance

Hōichi is a bald young man with brown eyes and a long, horizontal scar from his left ear across to his face. He wears what appears to be a dark blue monk attire, albeit without sleeves, with a white collar and garb at the end. He also dons a dark blue sash and carries a
biwa
 around with him, tied to a white cloth. Hōichi wears a pair of red rosary beads on his wrists. He also has a Suna
forehead protector
 attached to the centre of his attire.

Abilities






Hōichi using his dharma techniques.



When he was a child, Hōichi noted that he had studied Bunpuku's power to mould currents. He also learned Bunpuku's
fūinjutsu
 including the
Dharma Power Sealing Technique: Sen no Rikyū
, allowing him to forcibly extract multiple tailed beasts at once.
 He is also capable of using
sand
, hardening it to either provide an additional form of defence or to conceal his presence in a similar terrain. Hōichi is shown to be proficient in playing a biwa, using its tones in the same way as shinobi regularly use
hand seals
 to perform his techniques. Using the tones of the instrument, he can also
erect barriers
 and
take control over shadows
.

Hōichi absorbing the tailed beasts chakra into himself.



During the
chūnin exams
 in the
Demon Desert
, Hōichi notices
Team Matsuri
 as they head towards the central tower. He later becomes caught in the sandstorm that Fugi caused, and hides underneath the sand. After Gaara arrives to assist Team Matsuri, Hōichi emerges from the sand and prepares to attack the Kazekage.
 After Gaara's departure, Hōichi targets Team Matsuri by using
their own shadows against them
, in order to lure out Gaara, knowing that he will come to rescue the
genin
. As the Kazekage approaches, the priest uses his
seal
, which creates
chains
 and pierces Gaara, and begins to extract Shukaku's
chakra
. As the two shinobi stand against each other, Fū arrives and attempts to save Gaara, which she was unsuccessful. Noticing that the kunoichi was also a
jinchūriki
, Hōichi decides to test the power of
his seal
 and begins to extract her
tailed beast
 at the same time as Gaara's.






Hōichi's technique turns onto himself.



As the extraction continued, Fū used her
Cocoon
 to slow down the extraction process. While Hōichi continued his efforts,
Team Guy
 along with Fū's team-mates arrived to save the jinchūriki. As
Neji Hyūga
 got close enough, he blocked the chakra points in Gaara and Fū from which the extraction was taking place, ultimately cancelling it and rejecting the chakra chains. This came at Hōichi's expense as because the process was interrupted, the chains went wild in pursuit. As the chains quickly bound Hōichi, Gaara took pity on the man and asked for Neji to save him. To which, Neji blocked Hōichi's chakra points and cancelled the technique. Hōichi was then taken away for treatment.

Trivia

Hōichi's name and abilities may have been inspired by
Mimi-nashi Hōichi
, the tale of blind Buddhist monk Hōichi, who was so skilled at playing the biwa that it even brought ghosts and demons to tears. One night, after he was asked to perform for the ghosts of nobles who had perished during the
Battle of Dan no ura
, a high priest painted Hōichi's body with the Heart Sutra to render him invisible. The high priest, however, had forgotten to paint Hōichi's ears, leaving them visible to the ghosts. The ghosts pulled off Hōichi's ears, thus his nickname
miminashi Hōichi
 ("earless Hōichi").
