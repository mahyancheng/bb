An application of
Kagutsuchi
 through
Susanoo
, whereby Sasuke produces weapons made from the orb of
black flames
 held in his Susanoo's secondary right hand.

Variants

The black flames can form a sword to be wielded by Susanoo, which is able to stab and slice through individuals or defences, incinerating whatever remains.

Magatama-shaped projectiles
 can be unleashed from the orb in volleys, knocking back and subsequently incinerating their targets.

This technique can produce arrows to be utilised with Susanoo's bow.

Trivia

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
, the sword version is named "
Sword of Kagutsuchi
".

When portrayed in the anime, the orb held by Susanoo and the blade it produces appear to be made of the same ethereal substance as the rest of Susanoo, rather than black flames as it appears in the manga and games.
 Instead, the orb briefly changes into black flames when using certain techniques.
