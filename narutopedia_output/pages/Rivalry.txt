Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Sakura
 and
Ino
 continue exchanging blows. Being at par with each other, neither is able to gain the upper hand, so both soon grow tired. Sakura berates Ino for being too focused on her appearance and beauty rather than her
kunoichi
 skills, and Ino apparently snaps at her insults, cutting her hair and throwing it to the ground. Desperate, Ino tries to use her
Mind Body Switch Technique
 to force Sakura to forfeit, despite knowing how inaccurate it is and that she will be left defenceless if she misses. Sakura dodges the attack and appears to have won, but finds that she is immobilised by the strands of Ino's cut hair which have been infused with
chakra
 to form a binding rope. Ino is revealed to only have pretended to snap and to use the Mind Body Switch Technique in order to lead Sakura into the trap. She uses the Mind Body Switch Technique again knowing it cannot miss and succeeds on gaining control of Sakura's body.
