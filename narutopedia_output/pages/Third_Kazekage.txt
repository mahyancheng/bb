The
Third
Kazekage
 (
三代目風影
,
Sandaime Kazekage
,
literally meaning:
 Third Wind Shadow) was the leader of
Sunagakure
, and is hailed as the village's strongest Kazekage of his time.

Background

After studying the
jinchūriki
 of
Shukaku
 of the time, he recreated its sand-manipulating powers by combining his own magnetic chakra and iron powder, which produced the
Iron Sand
 technique. At some point,
Sasori
 kidnapped and killed the Third Kazekage in order to
turn
 him into a
human puppet
. According to Sasori, the effort involved in the Third's capture made it his favourite puppet. Sunagakure was not aware of what Sasori had done and searched earnestly for his whereabouts. However, with the
ongoing war
, the village was forced to choose a
Fourth Kazekage
, though they still attempted to search for him in later years. It was not until the start of the
Fifth Kazekage
's reign, did his fate become known.






The Third Kazekage revived by Orochimaru.



In the anime,
Orochimaru
, in his quest to obtain absolute mastery of all ninjutsu, managed to acquire some of the Kazekage's DNA, which he used as a source for the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
. To test this new pawn, once aware of Sasori coming after him in the
Land of Wind
, along with his new partner
Deidara
, Orochimaru unleashed the reincarnated Kazekage to face off against his human puppet counterpart. While Kazekage's Magnet Release ultimately proved stronger than the puppet's imitation, being called a pawn by Orochimaru sparked the Kazekage's consciousness. Refusing to be a tool for anyone, he regained control of himself and forced the release of the technique, returning to the
Pure Land
, leaving Orochimaru to speculate that the reincarnation technique was still imperfect.

Personality

In the anime, after being revived by
Orochimaru
, the Third showed himself to be a very calm and stoic person, displaying no visible emotion. He held a grudge against Sasori for killing him, proclaiming to him that things would not go the same way in their upcoming fight. Also, he is a very proud individual, firmly stating that he is not a pawn. To which, he showed a remarkable willpower, able to regain control of himself despite Orochimaru's brainwashing and cancelled the Impure World Reincarnation Technique on him.

Appearance

The Third Kazekage was a tall man with a fair complexion. He had short messy dark-blue hair and narrow yellow eyes. He wore the normal Kazekage attire minus the Kage hat, plus a flowing ankle-length white cape.

Abilities

The Third was undoubtedly a powerful shinobi. He is hailed as the strongest Kazekage for decades after his death,
 and even
Sasori
, an Akatsuki member, claimed that he had trouble killing him.
 He also appeared to have possessed a high level of intelligence as he was able to comprehend the One-Tail's unique powers and produce his own version of the same, thus creating
Iron Sand
.

The Third possessed the
kekkei genkai

Magnet Release
 which allowed him to convert his chakra into strong magnetic forces, enabling him to manipulate magnetic objects. Combined with his research of Shukaku's powers, he crafted his own version of "sand-manipulation" by combining the magnetic forces with iron powder to create
Iron Sand
. His magnetic control also granted him immunity from all metallic weapons, as well as the ability to nullify opposing puppets by clogging their joints with sand. With Iron Sand, he could make weapons to fit various occasions, thereby making this a very versatile technique, which
Chiyo
 considered to be the "most feared weapon in the history of Sunagakure".
 In the anime, it was shown that his Magnet Release was especially powerful. Despite Sasori gaining control of the Kazekage's corpse and powers by turning him into a Human Puppet, the puppet's Magnet Release was noticeably weaker even compared to the Third's diminished strength from the reincarnation technique.
 His ability to use Iron Sand is what led many to believe that he was the strongest Kazekage.
