Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation, a kinjutsu.



Kinjutsu
 (
禁術
,
literally meaning:
 Forbidden Techniques) are
techniques
 that have been banned from being taught or used.
 The term first came into use following the end of the
Warring States Period
, when the newly-formed
hidden villages
 agreed to forbid certain kinds of techniques in the interests of reducing unnecessary bloodshed and maintaining the peace.
 Although the hidden villages no longer teach kinjutsu to their ninja, they have preserved the knowledge of how to perform them: in
Konohagakure
, instructions for the
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 are detailed in the
Scroll of Seals
;

Takigakure
 "prized" the
Earth Grudge Fear
, but it was stolen by
Kakuzu
;

Deidara
 similarly stole the kinjutsu
used with
 his
Explosive Clay
 from
Iwagakure
;

Sunagakure
 actively promoted creation of what became
One's Own Life Reincarnation
, but halted all research once it became apparent the technique would qualify as kinjutsu.

Despite being forbidden, it's unclear what the actual penalties for using kinjutsu are, if any.
Naruto Uzumaki
 regularly performs the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique without reprimand, though this may be because he is one of the few who can perform it safely.
 When the
Fifth Hokage
 determines that Naruto's
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
 meets the definition of kinjutsu, Naruto is only encouraged not to use it because of the risks the technique carries.
 Kakuzu and Deidara are deemed
S-rank

missing-nin
,
 but this presumably has less to do with their use of kinjutsu than it does betraying their villages in order to steal the kinjutsu in the first place.

Orochimaru
 is also deemed an S-rank missing-nin, though his crimes stem from his actions while developing the
Living Corpse Reincarnation
 rather than from its actual use.
 Conversely, the
Fourth Hokage
's use of the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
 earned him the label of a hero because he used it to protect Konoha, a purpose that the
Third Hokage
 also believes justifies his own use of it.

There are several different reasons that can lead to a technique's classification as kinjutsu:

Techniques that endanger the user's life, such as
Twin Snakes Mutual Death Technique
 and the
Reverse Lotus
.

Techniques with severe
chakra
 requirements to perform, such as the Multiple Shadow Clone Technique.

Techniques that violate the laws of nature, such as
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
.

Techniques that cost the life of the user and/or another sacrifice,
 such as
One's Own Life Reincarnation
.

In the case of
Izanagi
, the
Uchiha clan
 declared it a kinjutsu because its use led to the blinding of the user's
Sharingan
, a
kekkei genkai
 that the Uchiha prized.

Techniques which cause destruction on a large scale, such as the anime-exclusive
Fury
.

Trivia

Despite not being an actual technique, the
Eight Gates
 has been called a forbidden technique.

In the anime, in exchange for Fury being classified as kinjutsu, the Third Hokage agreed that
Konohagakure
 would aid the
Tsuchigumo Clan
 in time of danger.
