Sasuke slashes the opponent into the air with his
sword
 and jumps after them. He then proceeds to kick, backfist and slash them while still in midair as he tumbles around, ending in a heel drop akin to the original Lion Combo. However, Sasuke quickly lands on the floor, holds up a formed-Chidori on his left hand to have the falling victim land on it.

Trivia

Akin to the
Storm
 series' version of Part 1 Sasuke's Lion Combo done solely as a midair string, this version of the Lion Combo also does not make use of the
Shadow of the Dancing Leaf
 technique.
