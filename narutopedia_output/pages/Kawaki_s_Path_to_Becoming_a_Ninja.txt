"
Kawaki's Path to Becoming a Ninja
" (
カワキ、忍への道
,
Kawaki, Shinobi e no Michi
) is episode 228 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

During breakfast,
Boruto
 notices that
Kawaki
 still isn't up, and
Hinata
 asks him to go wake Kawaki up for a meeting in the
Hokage
's office. Boruto and
Himawari
 both don't want to do it, but Boruto loses at rock-paper-scissors, so he wakes Kawaki up. At the office,
Naruto
 and
Shikamaru
 explain that instead of having to graduate from the
Academy
, since he's already skilled, they want to see how Kawaki handles himself during
missions
 with teams other than
Team 7
. Kawaki isn't enthusiastic, and is assigned a D-rank mission with
Team 5
. He sleeps in the middle of it, creating tension with the team. With the mission over, Kawaki practises
ninjutsu
. On his way back home, Kawaki refuses playing
cards
 with
Inojin
 and
Shikadai
. At the
Lightning Burger
, Boruto's friends recount their attrition with Kawaki, and comment how he might not be suited for being a
shinobi
. At home, Boruto and Kawaki argue over completing missions and cooperating with team-mates.
 The next day, Kawaki also causes trouble during a mission with
Team 15
. Naruto and Shikamaru discuss Kawaki's inability to get along with other teams. They try to assign him to a C-rank escort mission to try getting him more motivated to complete missions. He will fill in for Inojin in
Team 10
, who is backing up the Sensing Team. This is the final exam for whether Kawaki can become a
genin
. Kawaki bluntly admits to being unfit for being a shinobi, still having not decided whether he wants to be one or not. After they leave, Shikamaru expresses concern with allowing Kawaki to leave the village for a mission, believing he will be targeted for the
Kara
 technology in his
body
. Naruto thinks they can't keep him in the village forever, and wants him to make friends who will protect him.
Suika Kannonji
 pays Kawaki his earnings from his completed missions, which he spends in taiyaki. Shikadai, Inojin, and Boruto discuss Kawaki as they play cards. At home, Boruto is concerned about Kawaki's mission. Hinata tells him Kawaki probably struggles with positive interactions after spending so much time as a prisoner, and shows him the taiyaki he bought them. Kawaki finds
Sarada
 training at night, and she explains her motivations. The next day, Kawaki arrives late for his mission, and is berated by their client,
Mozuku
 from the
Land of Calm Seas
. They depart the village.

Trivia

In the opening scene, Boruto's
Kāma
 isn't visible in his right palm.

Despite having a speaking role, Sara Matsumoto isn't credited for Mozuku in this episode.
