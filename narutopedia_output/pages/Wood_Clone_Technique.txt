A clone that is created by using
chakra
 to alter the user's own cells into vegetation. The clones can be as simple in function as a wooden dummy for use in the
Body Replacement Technique
 or completely mobile and able to perform
jutsu
.
 They have the ability to travel far from the user and are able to communicate with the original.
 Moreover, since the wood clone has the ability to merge with plants and trees, it is also great for reconnaissance missions.
 By directly touching the wood clone with his hand, the user can change the shape of the clone.

Unlike other
clone techniques
, the wood clone doesn't disappear when hit and takes the damage to a certain degree. This, according to
Madara Uchiha
, makes it the perfect clone technique that only he with his
dōjutsu
 was able to see through.
 Wood clones are also somewhat inhibited by the actions of the user, so if they are preoccupied with other tasks the wood clones will not be able to act to their full potential.
 Wood clones can, however, be dispelled like normal clones.
