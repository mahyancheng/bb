Tekuno Kanden
 (
感電テクノ
,
Kanden Tekuno
) is a
jōnin
 of
Konohagakure
.

Background






Tekuno summons weapons and prepares to fight.



He was assigned to a squad along with Hayama Shirakumo,
Kosuke Maruboshi
 and
Naruto Uzumaki
 to protect the northern boundaries of the village after
Suna
 and
Otogakure
's invasion of the village. During their mission he was assigned to set traps around the area. Not long after they were ambushed by a battalion of ninja from
Iwagakure
. Tekuno's traps proved  useful in hindering the progress of the ninja but when they had breached these securities, he stayed behind to allow the other members of the squad time to escape and report to the village. He summoned a crossbow with explosive tags attached to the projectiles and along with Hayama wiped out the majority of the ninja. Together the team was able to wipe out dozens of Iwa ninja.

Personality

Tekuno is a very jovial, food-loving, laid-back and charismatic person as seen during a mission and even after when he jokingly boasted of his actions. He can also become very serious as seen when fellow jōnin
Hayama Shirakumo
 told him the situation surrounding their mission. He has a great sense of duty to both protect those lower in rank than him as well as the village.

Appearance

Tekuno has a robust build and shaggy brown hair. He wears the standard attire of a Konoha shinobi along with fingerless gloves. He also wears his
flak jacket
 unzipped under which he wears a utility sash which holds several
scrolls
. Like Hayama, his shirt only has the traditional red, swirl pattern on his left-sleeve's shoulder.

Abilities

His abilities primarily revolve around the use of heavy explosive artillery and is also highly skilled at setting traps. He uses
wires
 with great proficiency, often incorporating them into his traps, laying them all over the battlefield, then, manipulate them in such a way that he could trap multiple enemies at once. During a
mission
 he was shown summoning a crossbow and cannon that he used to fire projectiles with
explosive tags
 attached to them. Along with this weapon he also summoned a few katana, so it can be assumed that he is skilled at
kenjutsu
 as well.

Part II

Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha

He was later seen aiding to restore the village after
Pain's assault
 bragging about his heroism during the mission.
