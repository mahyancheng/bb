The
Eight Trigrams Sixteen Palms
 is a manoeuvre of the
Gentle Fist
 fighting style. It is essentially a halved version of the already halved
Eight Trigrams Thirty-Two Palms
. This technique is used to close off the flow of chakra through sixteen
chakra points
 of an opponent's
chakra pathway system
. This eliminates their ability to use
chakra
 for quite some time and renders them unconscious. It also appears to cause internal damage, as Mukai's target was spitting up blood.

Once someone is within range of his field of divination, Mukai assumes his Gentle Fist stance and begins to deliver his attack:

First, two consecutive strikes to make two.

Second, another two consecutive strikes to make four.

Third, four consecutive strikes to make eight.

Fourth, eight consecutive strikes making a total of sixteen.
