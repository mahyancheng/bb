"
The Soul Living Inside the Puppet
" (
傀儡に宿る魂
,
Kugutsu ni Yadoru Tamashī
) is episode 319 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Somewhere in the forest near the battlefield, the
Fifth Division
 led by
Mifune
 is confronted by
reincarnated

Kimimaro
 and
Chiyo
. Kimimaro quickly charges them getting rid of several units of the battalion, which Mifune gives orders to shy away from such a dangerous adversary. Chiyo enters the battle using a
samurai
 as a
puppet
 attacking Mifune who defends himself nearly about to kill an ally. Fortunately,
Kankurō
 arrives in time cutting the
chakra threads
 controlling the samurai, avoiding his death. Chiyo seems surprised with Kankurō's presence, realising the
puppet
 that Kankurō brought with him begins feeling guilty and thinking of her sins towards Sasori, recalling the past and the influence she had on his life choices.
 While looking back at Sasori's childhood memories, after his parents' death, Chiyo kept a link with him through
Komushi
, Sasori's best and only friend that would die due to a defective intervention carried out by Sasori, later becoming a
human puppet
 fulfilling a request by Komushi's mother. Returning to battle, Chiyo starts
fighting
 with Kankurō, promptly gathering
more samurai
 to assault Sasori and Kankurō, which he blocks by
summoning

Mother and Father
, shocking Chiyo by positioning both puppets in a familiar way to her. Kankurō realises that she did not overcome the guilt through her chakra threads, going to the past memories again he states that Sasori entrusted the Mother and Father puppets to him for future generations much to the surprise of Chiyo who starts having more memories of Sasori's early life and time with his parents. She admits that the puppets are in good hands and falls inert much to Kankurō's despair, but it was just window dressing, and she continues with
investing
 over him.
