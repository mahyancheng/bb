The Hoshikage's hat.



The
Hoshikage
 (
星影
,
literally meaning:
 Star Shadow) is the leader of
Hoshigakure
. The title of Hoshikage is merely a formality within Hoshigakure as it is not recognised as a
Kage
 by the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
, but Hoshigakure hopes to one day change that.

Background

The First Hoshikage came to be when Hoshigakure was first found by him 200 years ago. It was from his appointment as "Hoshikage" that the village began using that title for their village heads, in the hopes that their village will one day be strong enough to be recognised as worthy as the villages of the Five Great Shinobi Countries.

The Third Hoshikage was killed by
Akahoshi
, and he became the Fourth Hoshikage for a short time. After the people of Hoshigakure discovered he killed the Third Hoshikage, he was defeated by
Naruto Uzumaki
 and given to the proper authorities. His fate and the next Hoshikage are unknown.
