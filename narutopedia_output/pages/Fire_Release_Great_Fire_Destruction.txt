A technique where
chakra
 kneaded inside the user's body is converted into fire, and then expelled from the mouth in a massive stream of intense flames that can set a vast area ablaze, engulfing the target in a veritable sea of flames. If used upon a dense, combustible terrain, such as a forest, the confined area can greatly increase the possibility of the target's incineration.

Trivia

When Madara first used this technique in the anime, he used the full sequence of seven hand seals required to perform it. When he used it a second time against Tsunade, he only used the Tiger hand seal.
