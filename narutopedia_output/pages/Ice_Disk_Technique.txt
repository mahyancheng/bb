This technique turns the moisture particles in the air into ice disks of multiple uses. They can be hurled with tremendous force at a target, and are hard to dodge because of their transparency. They can create highly durable shields against enemy attacks. They can be stand on as platforms for hovering in the air. They can also be used to spy with, stringing together multiple disks to reflect images from great distances. By forming the ice into a large lens, the user can hover it high into the sky to focus the rays of the sun into a powerful beam capable of melting and exploding the pinpointed area, allegedly able to burn down an entire mountainous terrain, but when used in this manner, the beam can be reflected onto the user or anyone else, using a reflective surface.
