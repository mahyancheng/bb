Trivia

In
Naruto: Shippūden
 episode 189
,
Sakura Haruno
 observed that a ninneko may be defeated by throwing water over it because cats body temperatures drop rapidly when wet causing them to become lethargic. Most of them were also deceived by cat-ears provided by Nekobaa, which made them perceive humans as cats, and also made their speech intelligible to them.
