 manga.

Chapter 576

"
The Guidepost of Reunion
" (
再会の道標
,
Saikai no Michishirube
)

After
Sasuke
 spots
Itachi
, he chases his brother down. Itachi refuses to be swayed from his mission, so Sasuke attempts to use
Susanoo
 to stop him, but Itachi counters with his own. While Sasuke chases his brother the two have a conversation. Elsewhere, a regenerating
Madara
 decides to target
Tsunade
 after realising she was a
Senju
. Deeming her a weak woman who had seemingly inherited nothing from
Hashirama
 who he claimed was even more skilled in
medical ninjutsu
 than she was, he goes on to say that even more so that a weak person, he detested a weak Senju. Tsunade however rebuffs him, telling him that though she had not inherited the
Wood Release
 kekkei genkai her grandfather possessed and that he may have even been more skilled than her with medical ninjutsu — since he did not require the use of
hand seals
 to use it, Madara made two mistakes. One was assuming she was a weak woman and the other was that she had inherited nothing from her ancestor. She states that she inherited something more than simple power, the
Will of Fire
 — something Madara should not take so lightly.

Chapter 577

"
Blade of Hatred
" (
憎しみの刃
,
Nikushimi no Yaiba
)

Madara
 doubts
Tsunade
 can defeat him with the
Will of Fire
, stating power has nothing to do with will. Tsunade disagrees, saying that the will she inherited made her strong, crediting it for her revolution of
medical ninjutsu
, building an entire system, and making its three rules, which she lists to him as she
releases her seal
. She then reveals another rule: that only those who have mastered the
Ninja Art Creation Rebirth — Strength of a Hundred Technique
 are allowed to break the other three rules. The other
Kage
 are stunned to learn about this, while Madara is unfazed, having never heard of the technique. Tsunade explains it's a
kinjutsu
 only she knows how to use. Madara says that getting rid of the pollen and adding a medical-nin won't help their odds. Tsunade says all of them will go at it at once if it comes down to it, and that she's not just a medical-nin. Madara covers himself with
Susanoo
's ribcage, which Tsunade cracks with her attack. Madara notes her to be slower than the Raikage, but stronger than him. Madara tries
immolating
 Tsunade, but is
stopped
 by
Mei
, who also
attacks
.
A
 and
Ōnoki
 deal a
heavy

blow
 just as Tsunade lands a powerful kick, sending Madara crashing down. Madara concedes that Tsunade isn't as weak as he thought. Madara reminds her that she'll get herself killed if she simply rushes into battle, the Kage's source of treatment and recovery. Madara wonders what
Hashirama
 left them, saying they're nothing compared to Hashirama, and that if he had known how weak they'd be, he'd have taught Hashirama how to rise from the dead. He says the only power Hashirama left is clinging to him, and that
his own brother
 only left him his eyes and their power. Tsunade asks if he heard nothing of what she said. Madara says the only thing that could be passed to them is hatred. At the same time,
Dan Katō
 and
Chōza Akimichi
 have a conversation where Chōza informs him that Madara had been
reincarnated
 and that Tsunade — as
Hokage
 — and the other Kage were battling him, which shocks Dan. Despite Chōza's confidence in Tsunade, Dan tells him that he should use his time finding the
caster
 of the
technique
 instead of guarding the barrier that held him as Madara was not to be taken lightly, expressing his belief that only Hashirama could possibly defeat Madara. Back at the battle with Madara, Tsunade manages to land a devastating blow on Madara and as he regenerates,
Gaara

binds
 and
seals
 him. This is however, revealed to be nothing more that a
wood clone
, as Tsunade is impaled by a
Susanoo Sword
 and Madara emerges from a root telling them that when he fought Hashirama in the past, only his dōjutsu could see through the clone. To keep
Sasuke
 from following him,
Itachi
 summons a flock of crows, which stall Sasuke. Itachi finds
Kabuto
, saying that he felt where his chakra came from while he was being controlled earlier, citing it as a weakness of the technique. Kabuto isn't concerned, as he's the only one who can stop the technique. After seeing Sasuke close behind Itachi, Kabuto gets excited, exclaiming his luck had turned for the better which leaded and exasperated Itachi to remark that things had turned out worse than he expected.

Chapter 578

"
The Weakness of Despair!!
" (
絶望の弱点!!
,
Zetsubō no Jakuten!!
)

Having arrived at
Kabuto
's hideout,
Sasuke
 identifies Kabuto. Kabuto attempts to manipulate him into attacking
Itachi
, but Sasuke explains his goal was to talk with his brother and that Kabuto, who has now taken
Orochimaru
's mantle, is his enemy. Meanwhile
Tsunade
 reveals her new technique's power, which allows instant regeneration without the usage of hand seals, and throws the sword that impales her back at
Madara
. While he absorbs it into his
Susanoo
,
Ōnoki
 tries to blast Madara with
Dust Release
 from behind, but Madara simply absorbs it, claiming he could have done it earlier but instead took it as a chance to demoralise them with
Hashirama
's visage. Tsunade questions his confidence, stating the
Kage
 forced him into using a
wood clone
. Instead of rebuffing her, Madara admits five versus one is a good match-up number and creates
twenty-five wood clones
, five for each Kage. Sasuke attempts to kill Kabuto, but Itachi stops him, explaining the need to discover the counter to the
Impure World Reincarnation
 beforehand. Sasuke agrees to cooperate on the terms that Itachi will answer his questions once they're done, and Itachi accepts, as both brothers and Kabuto ready themselves for battle.

Chapter 579

"
Brothers, Fight Together!!
" (
兄弟、共闘!!
,
Kyōdai, Kyōtō!!
)

Closing his hood and stating that he was an introverted person and as such it was unsettling to be stared at by so many people,
Kabuto
 sends his snakes charging towards
Sasuke
 and
Itachi
. The brothers are able to fend this attack off, however Kabuto uses this opportunity to hide in one of his snakes. Here, Kabuto reveals the abilities that he had gained from experimenting with Sasuke's former teammates:
Karin
's healing abilities (which derive from her being an
Uzumaki
), a similar ability to
Suigetsu
's
Hydrification Technique
 as well as
Jūgo
's ability to absorb the forces of nature. After revealing that he had found and trained at the
Ryūchi Cave
 — much to Itachi's shock — he narrowly dodges Sasuke's attack. Emerging from the snake's mouth he reveals that he had finally surpassed
Orochimaru
 and was able to become a
sage
 and declares that he was now a dragon after Sasuke calls him an imperfect snake like Orochimaru.

Chapter 580

"
The Brothers' Time
" (
兄弟の時間
,
Kyōdai no Jikan
)

Kabuto
 launches his
technique
 at the
Uchiha
 brothers. As
Itachi
 rushes over to
Sasuke
, a blinding light and violent air vibrations suddenly erupt. Sasuke and Itachi are paralysed by the air vibrations, but Kabuto is still able to move because of his liquified body and can still see because of the
brille
 over his eyes. Kabuto goes after Sasuke first. Itachi protects him with
Susanoo
. Itachi explains that he already knows where Kabuto's going to attack, so he can act according and explains that he's not a
sensor
,
Nagato
 was. Kabuto jumps onto the ceiling. Itachi tells Sasuke to remember the plan they used when they went on a mission together. Sasuke remembering hunting a huge boar as he puts the plan into action with his brother. Sasuke thinks he has Kabuto, but then is shocked to see Kabuto off to the side stabbing Itachi. Itachi's body is revealed to be a
crow clone
, and the real Itachi counterattacks, cutting off a piece of Kabuto's horn. Itachi and Sasuke remember their time together and prepare to catch the "snake" as Kabuto states it would take some time to get used to having horns.

Chapter 581

"
Everyone's Konoha
" (
それぞれの木ノ葉
,
Sorezore no Konoha
)

Amused at the fact that though
Sasuke
 should hate
Itachi
, the two seemed to be getting along well,
Kabuto Yakushi
 states that he understands that something might have happened during the brothers' battle, could not understand what Sasuke could want from a dead person. After hearing Sasuke declare that he wanted to know the truth, Kabuto surmises that Sasuke was suspicious of his brother, having already heard the truth and as such never returned to
Konohagakure
 because of his intent to destroy it for making his brother suffer. Calling Itachi a liar and stating that he had gone as far as to eradicate his entire
clan
 in order to protect the village, he asks Sasuke whether or not what he was doing was more akin to his own goals of wanting to continue what
Orochimaru
 started and destroy Konoha. Attempting to inveigle him to his side once again, Sasuke has a flashback of a conversation he overheard with a group of Konoha-nin bad-mouthing Itachi after which he declares that he was nothing like Kabuto and that crushing Konoha was his own ambition. Recalling his life in Konoha, Kabuto begins to renounce the village and tells Sasuke that he would be his new brother. Telling his brother not to listen to Kabuto, Itachi commences his plan of action, telling his brother that he would use one of the clan's ultimate
dōjutsu
. Believing it to be
Izanagi
, Sasuke questions his brother on this. Itachi however corrects his brother as he clashes with Kabuto while wielding Sasuke's
sword
 telling him that this was a
technique
 that can decide destiny.

Chapter 582

"
Nothing
" (
何も無い
,
Nani mo nai
)

Kabuto
 attacked the
Uchiha
 brothers with his
Sage Art: Inorganic Reincarnation
 technique, causing the
cave formations
 to attack them. Having used his
Susanoo
 to protect
Sasuke
,
Itachi
 was incapacitated between the rocks. As Kabuto retrieved a talisman from his snake, he attempted to rewrite Itachi's mind. Sasuke created a ring of
Amaterasu
 flames to prevent Kabuto from taking any further action. Commending Sasuke's
strategy
, Kabuto told him nonetheless that they were not capable of defeating him. Continuing to brag about his accomplishments, he states that of anyone currently alive, he had come the closest to the
Sage of the Six Paths
 and that compared to him, the Uchiha were nothing. This prompts Sasuke to lash out at him, but he was stopped by a fully-regenerated Itachi. Itachi told Kabuto that he reminded him of his former self though the two of them were very different. He then told him that because he did not understand his own limitations, the value of comrades and who he really was, he was doomed to fail as he did when he was alive. With this, Kabuto retorted that they were the ones that knew nothing about him and that for his whole life, he had tried to find who he really was. Kabuto also had a flashback to his earliest memory of being found by
Nonō
 and
Urushi
. He then stated that for his whole life, he had nothing.

Chapter 583

"
Who is This?
" (
これは誰だ
,
Kore wa Dare da
)

Kabuto
 reminisced on the time when the orphanage aided several
Konohagakure
 shinobi by healing them. Asked by
Orochimaru
, who thought his skills were impressive whether or not he had thought of being a
shinobi
, to which Kabuto declined.
Nonō
 was later approached by
Danzō Shimura
, Orochimaru and another unknown shinobi, who blackmailed her into undertaking an intelligence gathering mission based on the intel they received on
Iwagakure
's attack plans. Taking Kabuto along with them to replace a dead
Root
 member, the young man was sent on several spy missions in different hidden villages inclusive of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
. On a mission in Iwagakure, his cover was blown and as he attempted to escape he was confronted by an Iwa-nin. Kabuto attacked the ninja with his
chakra scalpel
 severely wounding the enemy. This person turned out to be Nonō much to Kabuto's shock as he tried to heal her. She however did not remember him, which devastated Kabuto who ran off and left her as
Kitsuchi
 and another Iwa-nin approached them. Devastated that she did not remember him and wondering who he was, Kabuto was once again approached by Orochimaru who stated that he had become quite the shinobi.

Chapter 584

"
Kabuto Yakushi
" (
薬師カブト
,
Yakushi Kabuto
)

Kabuto
 was startled by
Orochimaru
's approach. Orochimaru said he's been watching Kabuto and
Nonō
 for a long time, and invited him to come with him, promising to reveal to him the reason Nonō attacked him and didn't recognise him. Orochimaru then took Kabuto to his medically-equipped hideout, telling Kabuto he's the first person he had brought there. Kabuto questioned Orochimaru on why he brought him there, and Orochimaru was pleased with his enquiring nature. Orochimaru reveals that
Root
 designed for Kabuto and Nonō to kill each other, as they became too skilled as spies, and that their knowledge made them too dangerous. Orochimaru explained that
Danzō
 told Nonō the reason Kabuto joined Root, and she begged him to free Kabuto. Danzō agreed, provided she killed
one man
, which turned out to be Kabuto, though she wasn't told of this. Orochimaru showed Kabuto photos Nonō was shown through the years, as proof Kabuto was growing up. At some point, the photos were changed, showing someone other than Kabuto, making Nonō believe Kabuto was someone else, living a civilian life, and being sent on missions on different countries, they would never meet. Kabuto figured Orochimaru was sent to kill the one who survived. Orochimaru told him he's correct, and Kabuto attacked him viciously, all the while asking who he is now that the only person who knew him was gone. Orochimaru regurgitates himself, and told Kabuto he's not who he thinks, and that he was like him. He explained to Kabuto that he was the research he made, always changing himself, adding knowledge and skills, and that he valued Kabuto's skill, that being the reason why he assembled that hideout. He added that he planned to create
Otogakure
, a village without country, and fashioned Kabuto a new background. Kabuto became Orochimaru's spy, pretending to be a spy for
Sasori
 in order to learn about
Akatsuki
, and aided Orochimaru in his experiments through the years. After Orochimaru's defeat at
Sasuke
's hand, Kabuto injected himself with blood from Orochimaru's true form's remains, looking for his true self.

Chapter 585

"
To Be Myself
" (
ボクがボクであるために
,
Boku ga Boku de Aru Tame ni
)

Having finished reminiscing about his childhood,
Kabuto
 tells the brothers that after assimilating
Orochimaru
's DNA, he continued to add things to himself and that as his pawns were a show of his own power and that he would not allow
Itachi
 to oppose him. Even though Itachi rejects what Kabuto says, Kabuto presses on with his attack. As
Sakon
 emerges from the base of his navel snake, he has him use his
Attack of the Twin Demons
 technique to transform into
Jirōbō
, who then uses the
Earth Release: Earth Shore Return
 technique to part the circle of flames that the Uchiha siblings had created around themselves. Giving them no time to react, he brings forth
Kidōmaru
 next and has him use the
Spider Web Unrolling
 technique to trap the brothers — who use
Amaterasu
 to incinerate the uncuttable web. Moving behind the brothers and producing
Kimimaro
 next, he has him use the
Dance of the Seedling Fern
 technique to block the area behind them while also creating another web in front of them, effectively caging the brothers in. After they manage to escape, Kabuto uses
Tayuya
 and her
Demonic Flute: Phantom Sound Chains
 technique to attack the siblings with an auditory genjutsu effectively incapacitating them. Bringing forth Orochimaru himself finally, Kabuto has him transform into his white snake form and attack the brothers. They however find
a way

to escape
 the
genjutsu
 and fend the snake off by casting genjutsu on each other. Kabuto, however, appears from the mouth of the snake with a surprise attack and
bisects
 Itachi, stating that a genius that has had everything would not understand him wanting to find his true self and then declared that no one would stand in his way with this.

Chapter 586

"
Izanami's Activation
" (
イザナミ発動
,
Izanami Hatsudō
)

Regenerating,
Itachi
 called out to
Sasuke
 as
Kabuto
 moved to implant his talisman to rewrite Itachi's mind. Responding, Sasuke threw his
sword
 at Kabuto. Kabuto caught the sword with his navel-snake, and dodged the grasp of Sasuke's
Susanoo
. Sasuke launched a
fireball
 at Kabuto who countered it with a large
torrent
 of water which swept Sasuke off his feet. Through the mist created from the two clashing techniques, Kabuto noticed that Itachi, whom he stabbed with the sword for him disappeared into a flurry of crows and attack Kabuto with the sword he took from him. Chastising him for using the same attack pattern he had used before to cut his horn off, to which Itachi rebuffs that he cannot be harmed also refuting Kabuto's claims that
genjutsu
 cannot affect him, stating that it already had. This sequence of events repeats itself once again until Kabuto begins to notice the
déjà vu
, regardless of what he did differently. It was ultimately revealed that the entire battle was taking place within Kabuto's head, as he was trapped within
Izanami
.

Chapter 587

"
When It Turns 9 o'clock
" (
9時になったら
,
9-Ji ni Nattara
)

Using this time,
Sasuke
 questioned his brother about
Izanami
.
Itachi
 explained the mechanism behind the technique, the history of
their clan
, their use of
Izanagi
 and why Izanami was created. He then told his brother that
Kabuto
 would be freed from Izanami once he accepted his fate. Somewhat angered that Itachi would use a technique that the victim could escape, Sasuke questioned his brother who told him that he wanted to give Kabuto the opportunity to accept his fate — something he himself could not do during his lifetime. This explanation only served to irate Sasuke more who believed his brother to be perfect, but Itachi refuses this claim. All throughout this, Kabuto continued to battle on in his mind, refusing to give up. Elsewhere on the battlefield, a grown up
Urushi
, told one of his comrades about his
home
 and hoped that by the time he got back, his brother, Kabuto, would be there. Meanwhile at the cave, Itachi prepared to end the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
.
