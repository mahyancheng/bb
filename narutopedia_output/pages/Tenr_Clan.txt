The
Tenrō Clan
 (
天狼一族
,
Tenrō Ichizoku
) is a clan of
shinobi
 that hail from
Yumegakure
.

Background

The Tenrō Clan was responsible for sealing and controlling the
Three-Headed Guardian Beast
 which resulted in them gaining control of Yumegakure. The village's current chief,
Enzo
, hails from this clan.

Abilities

The Tenrō Clan ninja fighting style revolves mainly around the use of
taijutsu
 and some use of ninja tools. Some members have been shown to use a combat based transformation technique, allowing them to take on a wolf-like creature that enhances their strength and speed, which emphasises their main focus of taijutsu and close combat. Some members of the clan also used unconventional weaponry in the form of
large dual-wielded drills
, capable of swiftly boring through the earth, thus surprising the opponent, alongside using them as thrusting weapons when battling above ground. Like the
Inuzuka clan
 of
Konohagakure
, the Tenrō Clan makes use of canines in combat by using wolves with a pair of large bladed weapons strapped to their back. The canines use their blades by rearing up onto their hind legs and jump at their targets and spinning around.

Aside from combat skills, the clan also boasted knowledge of a high level sealing technique, which in the past enabled them to imprison the Three-Headed Guardian Beast. While the seal was not shown, its abilities were similar to the
Eight Trigrams Sealing Style
 in that it allows for an opening of the seal with a special key. The key itself, is held by the leader of the village, Enzo.
