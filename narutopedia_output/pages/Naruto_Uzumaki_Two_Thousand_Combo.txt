Naruto
 uses the
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
, creating a total of one thousand Narutos. Some of the Narutos then kick the target high into the air while yelling "U-ZU-MA-KI", just as is done with the original
Naruto Uzumaki Combo
. Once the target is airborne, the one thousand Narutos punch them from every direction with their, combined, two thousand fists, hence the name; the punches are so numerous that targets have no chance to escape. Two Narutos then join to deliver a final blow: a simultaneous punch from the left and right.
