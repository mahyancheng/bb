A demonstration of a hiden technique.



Hiden
 (
秘伝
,
literally meaning:
 secret tradition) or simply "secret" techniques are passed down from generation to generation in certain regions or
clans
.

The groups who possess these techniques are usually extremely secretive about them in order to ensure that no one other than the members of the group or clan learns them. As such, they are passed down through oral means instead of being written down or recorded. A few hiden techniques require a special ability or lineage and as such are usually the pride and fame of the clan that possesses them.

Many Hiden techniques are rooted in
Yin
 or
Yang Release
 such as the
Nara clan
's
Shadow Imitation Technique
, or the
Akimichi clan
's
Multi-Size Technique
 respectively. These techniques cannot be copied through simple observation, however, they are not to be confused with
kekkei genkai
, as technically, hiden techniques can be taught to anyone.
