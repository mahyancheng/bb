He is the mason who carves the faces of
Hokage
 on the
Hokage Rock
.

Personality

He seems to be dedicated to his occupation, as he goes to great lengths to carve a perfect replica of his subjects' by studying their face and even dreaming about them. Further dedication to his work is shown, as he became furious when
Danzō Shimura
 had died in battle before he could even begin carving his face into the monument.

Appearance

He has a short crop of black hair forming side burns that connect into a very short beard. He also has a bushy moustache. He wears a small twisted up rope-like headband around his forehead.

Part II

Five Kage Summit

Before he could carve the Sixth Hokage Candidate's face into the monument, he is informed by
his assistant
 that Danzō has been killed. He is later infuriated, due to the hard work he has put in to just have a perfect visualisation of his face. Before
Kakashi Hatake
 could attend an emergency meeting with the
Fire Daimyō
, he takes him with him to make preparations for his stone carving by measuring his face and preparing a mould by painting thin layers of plaster. Before he could make the mould, he asked Kakashi to remove his mask, saying that the stone face won't look good if he's hiding his face. Later, as he prepared to carve Kakashi Hatake's face on the
Hokage Rock
, he is informed once again by his assistant that Kakashi is no longer the Hokage since the
Fifth Hokage
 has awoken from her coma, much to his frustration.

Trivia

He bears the kanji 'stone' (
石
) on the back of his attire.
