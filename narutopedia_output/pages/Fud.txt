Fudō
 (
フドウ
) was a member of
Furido
's
Team
.

Personality

Fudō was rather arrogant and had great confidence in his abilities. During his first battle against
Team Yamato
, he ridiculed Fuen for not giving him the credit he deserved for the trap. Fudō, as a result of his arrogance, developed a habit of underestimating his opponents, thereby making way for smarter opponents to easily turn the tides of battle.

Appearance








Fudō was a tall muscular man with short messy black hair. He had a very distinguished face including a broad jawline, pronounced forehead, and noticeable creases under his eyes. He also had black triangular markings on each of his cheeks. Like his team-mates, he wore qípáo-like outfit with straw sandals. His particular outfit was green and sleeveless with yellow, blue, and purple stripe going down the edges and brown pants. He also had a brown undershirt and black elbow-bands covering from his biceps to forearms.

Abilities






Fudō creates fissures to kill Konohagakure shinobi.



Having been selected by
Kazuma
 to join him in his campaign against Konohagakure, Fudō was a very powerful ninja. He proved such in being able to compete against some of Konoha's strongest ninja, even leading the charge on the village which decimated many of its defences (albeit they tricked the main forces of the village to relocated elsewhere).

Physical Prowess






Fudō using Earth Release to enhance his strength.



Fudō's battle style was usually at close-range, using powerful
taijutsu
 strikes. His proficiency was evident from how many Konoha ninja he took down on his own. He also showed tremendous strength, as he effortlessly broke free from Yamato's wood bindings and ploughing through solid stone. He had immense reserves of chakra, able to perform a myriad of large-scale techniques quickly and without tiring. His chakra control was very advanced, able to perform techniques with a one-handed
hand seal
.
 He could also focus his chakra into his palm to
enhance his strikes
 or precisely
engrave
 writing on a stone surface.

Ninjutsu

Nature Transformation






Fudō traps Team 7 by erecting numerous rock pillars.



Fudō's signature skill was
Earth Release
. He was very crafty and skilled with them, being able to use wide-scale techniques, able to create large
earth canyon
. Using the earth around him, he could cause
cave-ins
 and
warping grounds
 to crush his opponents, or skewer them with
stone spikes
. Alternatively, he could create
protective walls
,
shifting ground
 that sucks his target in, trap a person in
prisons
 of
rock
, and also blend into the rocks and
move in and out
 of them undetected. His most common technique with Earth Release was to absorb the properties of stone around him to form a skin-deep
armour
 capable of defending him from nearly all forms of physical attacks, whilst at the same time making his strikes more destructive.

Fudō was also able to utilise the Earth-natured
Corpse Soil
 technique to
reanimate
 the dead in a massive quantity as mindless zombies for combat. These numerous individuals lacked the techniques they had in life, rationality, their physical capabilities and are destroyed fairly easily, but were able to respawn from the ground immediately after their destruction.

Part II

Twelve Guardian Ninja

Main article:
Twelve Guardian Ninja






Fūka, Fuen, Fudō and Furido carrying out the grave robbery.



As part of
Furido
's plan to destroy Konoha, Fudō, along with
Fuen
 and
Fūka
, proceeded in stealing the corpses of
Seito
,
Nauma
,
Kitane
 and
Tōu
. The four were part of the Twelve Guardian Ninja and were masters of the
Limelight
 technique. Their revival was crucial in Furido's plan to destroy Konoha, for their technique had enough potential to decimate ninja villages within seconds.
Team 7
, however, on their mission to the
Fire Temple
, were quickly informed by
Chiriku
 that his graves had been robbed. In turn, they ventured out into the landscape and began to chase down the robbers.

The grave robbers quickly caught onto their persecutors, which prompted them to
imprison
 and separate them to later dive in and head for the kill. With haste, the four scattered out into the labyrinth of pillars and found themselves against a set opponent. In due time, Fudō faced
Yamato
, and displayed his mastery with
Earth Release
. His taijutsu and earth-natured attacks forced Yamato into the defensive. As the battle came to a close, Fudō managed to encapsulate the latter within an
earth prison
, however, little did he know that Yamato allowed this to happen, for he had only been analysing his attack patterns throughout the fight.






Fudō's death.



Later, during the attack on
Konohagakure
, Fudō ploughed through Konoha's defences and summoned
hundreds of undead ninja
 to preoccupy the remaining Konohagakure shinobi. Fudō, after heading out into the village, once again found himself in battle against Yamato. As the skirmish progressed, Yamato, with the help of prior knowledge, realised that Fudō's armour was rather heavy. In turn, he
drenched
 the area in water, which resulted in Fudō slowly sinking into the ground. Yamato then finished him by trapping and crushing him with the
Wood Release: Tree Bind Flourishing Burial
 technique. Upon his death, Fudō's reanimation technique was cancelled, causing all zombies around the village to turn to dust.
