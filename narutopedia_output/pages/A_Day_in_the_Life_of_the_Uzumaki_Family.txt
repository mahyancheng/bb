"
A Day in the Life of the Uzumaki Family
" (
うずまき家の一日
,
Uzumaki-ke no Ichinichi
) is episode 18 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Boruto
 looks after a bedridden
Himawari
 while
Hinata
 goes to pick up her medicine. Boruto recalls a previous occasion Himawari had a rough time and recalls when
Naruto
 became
Hokage
. Naruto had arrived drunk late from celebrating with his friends the night before his inauguration. The next morning, Boruto jumps on him to wake him up when Himawari is unable to do it. Hinata leaves to pick up Naruto's formal wear, as the seamstress, who made the formal attire of every previous Hokage, still isn't done with it. At the inauguration venue,
Kakashi
 expresses relief at passing on the mantle of Hokage. Hinata arrives, but Naruto hasn't, so she goes back home to check on him. At home, Boruto and Himawari fight over a teddy bear and end up tearing it apart. Himawari, angered beyond reason, awakens her
Byakugan
, and moves in to attack Boruto. Seeing a terrified Boruto, Naruto puts himself between them, getting himself knocked out.
 At the inauguration, Kakashi and
Shikamaru
 have
Konohamaru
 transform into Naruto to get the event underway; down in the crowd, only
Iruka
 sees through the ruse. Hinata finds Naruto unconscious at home with his
tenketsu
 closed, and wonders who might have done it. Upstairs, Himawari finds Boruto hidden in a closet. In the present, Boruto thinks about his resentment of Naruto for spending little time at home ever since becoming Hokage. He also fumes that he has not come to check on Himawari, but Naruto ironically arrives at that moment to see her. Boruto notices his Hokage cloak is inside out and is secretly glad Naruto came home. Boruto and Naruto fight over what Himawari should eat, and Hinata puts them both outside. Naruto invites Boruto to eat with him and takes him to
Ramen Ichiraku
, where they are greeted by
Ayame
. As they wait for their ramen, the two look at a newscast about an upcoming Five Kage meeting. Boruto asks if Naruto is going to be busy again, and he tells him not to worry.
Chōji
 and
Chōchō
 arrive for an eating competition, hoping to beat the record for the most bowls of ramen eaten, and Boruto envies their rapport. Before leaving, the two Uzumaki notice the
Akimichi
 ending the contest at a draw, with neither beating the record holder's score. On the way out, Naruto is forced to reveal that the holder of the ramen eating record is Hinata. At home, Hinata sees a picture of Naruto's inauguration and recalls the end of that day, when she discussed Himawari's Byakugan and Naruto's new dreams with him.

Trivia

After Naruto and Boruto look towards Hinata in fear, when their argument is interrupted, Naruto's bandaged arm is partially seen with skin.

Adult Swim
's English dub broadcast of this episode strangely cuts out the beginning scene before the opening plays, despite that not happening to other episodes. This could have simply been a master control room error, since
Toonami
's programming block runner Jason DeMarco has taken to Twitter to address other broadcasting mistakes that have occurred on the block before.

Hinata's record of eating 46 bowls of Ramen is a reference to the
Ninja Champion Eating Contest Omake short
 where she ate the exact amount, beating Naruto and Yamato.
