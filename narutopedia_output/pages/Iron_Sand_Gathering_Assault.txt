The
Iron Sand Gathering Assault
 is a technique which gathers a great volume of
Iron Sand
 and compresses it into a high-density shape.

Usage

This technique greatly increases the hardness of the Iron Sand, creating a gigantic steel-like weapon in an instant. The weight and size of these shapes are so great, they can easily shatter bedrock and break through most defences with a single hit.

Because the weapon is made out of Iron Sand, the shape can be whatever the user wants, and can even be changed during the fight. This allows the user to create the best weapon for the fight, by taking into account the opponent's abilities and the surrounding environment. Since the Iron Sand generates a strong
magnetic field
, the opponent cannot use any metal weapons or tools.
