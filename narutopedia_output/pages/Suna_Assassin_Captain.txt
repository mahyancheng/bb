He is the captain of the assassination squad from
Sunagakure
 who were ordered to assassinate
Gaara
.

Personality

He is a rather violent person who hates Gaara, believing that such a force should not exist. Therefore, he did not hesitate to accept a mission to assassinate him from the elders of Sunagakure, who adhere to the same direction. He also showed aggression towards the
Konohagakure
 shinobi, although he and his comrades declared that they would not interfere in the mission of friendly countries.

Appearance

The captain wears what appears to be the standard attire for the Suna-nin albeit a sleeveless shirt and a mask that is reminiscent of an
oni
. Like the rest of his team, he wore black gloves and had his head wrapped in bandages.

Abilities

Being appointed leader of a group of assassins sent to kill Gaara, it stands to reason that he is a very skilled shinobi.

Ninjutsu

Like many
Suna

shinobi
, he employs the
use
 of
puppets
. He is able to combine
Water Release
 with
certain
 puppets to
spew water
 at opponents trapped in
chakra threads
. This is effective against
sand
 users as it decreases the opponents ability to use sand. Since he carries a
sword
, it stands to reason that he is skilled in
kenjutsu
.

Part II

Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha

During a joint mission with Konoha, his squad was ordered to kill Gaara. Using his
Puppet Water Release: Dance of Mystic Rain
 technique, he prevented Gaara from manipulating his sand. Gaara was saved by the arrival of
Naruto Uzumaki
 and his team-mates,
Yaoki
 and
Korobi
. The captain and his squad were defeated when Gaara used a non-lethal ball of sand to incapacitate almost every member of the assassination squad.
