This article is about the Scientific Ninja Tool jutsu. For advanced chakra control, see
Shape Transformation
.

With
microscopic Scientific Ninja Tools
 in their blood stream, the user is able to modify their flesh for multiple purposes, such as blades, claws, shields, and throwable projectiles.
Kawaki
's affected limb are his arms,
Delta
's are her legs, and
Code
's are his hands. Unlike Code and Kawaki, Delta can modify her legs to enable her jet propulsion, granting her flight.

Should an affected limb be lost, the user is not incapable of shaping their flesh and can simply extend it around where the limb used to be, such as in Kawaki's case from when he briefly used a
prosthetic
 before gaining a new arm.

Modified Appendages

Kawaki's right arm.
Delta's legs.
