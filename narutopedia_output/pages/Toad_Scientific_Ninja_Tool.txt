This article is about the Scientific Ninja Tool. For the animals, see
Toad
.

These toads are
Scientific Ninja Tools
 created to be used by former
Kara
 Inner,
Koji Kashin
. They resemble and act like real
toads
, but are non-sentient recreations that are remotely controlled by Koji's chakra. They are used as surveillance, communication and even as flammable weapons. Koji can also
sync
 with these toads in a remote location to be able to see through them and control their actions.

Three years after the events leading to Koji defecting from Kara and
Boruto
 being
forced
 to flee
Konohagakure
, the two form a partnership and the latter keeps one of Koji's toads on him in order to communicate with him. Acting
Hokage

Shikamaru
 and
Ada
 were also given toads to keep in contact with Koji.
