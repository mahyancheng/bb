This is a ninjutsu using materialised shadows, but compared to the
Shadow Sewing Technique
 from the same line, this technique places emphasis on the minute control of the shadow's movements. It is accurate enough to even make the tentacles go through tiny holes. Basically, this technique takes the user's own shadow and transforms and stretches it into countless thin tentacles, which are then used to grab objects and pull them in. Also, one can skilfully make use of the tentacle-shaped shadow tendrils by using them to lift up and throw weapons like kunai and such. This technique has many possible applications and uses.

There are no hand seals used for this technique, but the hand movements resemble that of
Gaara
's
Sand Binding Coffin
.

Trivia

Yose (
寄せ
,
gathering
) is also the Japanese term for endgame. That is, the final moves in strategy games like
chess
,
shōgi
, or
Go
. This translation is almost as perfect as gathering in this case, since this technique was the final move in Shikamaru's shōgi-themed mission.

In
Naruto: The Broken Bond
, Shikamaru used this technique in Part I.

Shikamaru was shown training Shikadai in the basics of this technique.
