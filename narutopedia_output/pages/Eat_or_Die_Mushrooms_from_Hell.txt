"
Eat or Die! Mushrooms from Hell
" (
食うか食われるか!踊るキノコ地獄
,
Kuu ka Kuwareru ka! Odoru Kinoko Jigoku
) is episode 229 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

During their journey to the
Land of Lightning
,
Naruto
 and the others stops at a nearby port to stock up on supplies and prepare to enter the
Sea Route of Silence
, an area devoid of fish of the sea and wind that takes two weeks to be crossed. In the hold, a
mushroom
 purchased by Naruto from a
vegetable merchant
 begins to multiply and to absorb the
chakra
 of
Yamato
, as well as devouring all of the food and water on the ship. After resisting for a long time without food, Naruto and
Guy
 eat the mushrooms, but are poisoned and loose self-consciousness resulting in a skirmish between the two. As they regurgitate the mushrooms, Naruto
summons

Gamatatsu
 and has him ask
Shima
 for some of her insect cooking.

The merchant and his
gang
 infiltrate the ship, believing everyone to be dead. However, the
Konoha

shinobi
 defeat them and place them on a small boat, sending them back along the Sea Route of Silence with the moulding mushroom as their only source of food. As they exit the route themselves, Guy becomes seasick once more and Yamato recovers from his temporary illness.
