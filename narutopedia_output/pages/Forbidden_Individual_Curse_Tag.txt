The
Forbidden Individual Curse Tag
 is a
juinjutsu
 utilised by
Madara Uchiha
.

Usage

The cursed seal is placed directly on the target's heart and by design, prevents the branded individual from taking their own lives or removing the cursed seal themselves. A direct strike to the heart appears to be able to remove the seal — albeit risking one's life in the process. According to
Obito Uchiha
, the cursed seal also interfered with him becoming the
Ten-Tails
'
jinchūriki
.

Trivia

Both
Rin Nohara
 and Obito Uchiha, who were branded with this cursed seal, had it removed by
Kakashi Hatake
's
Chidori
 and
Lightning Cutter
 respectively, although Rin died while Obito survived by
sealing
 the Ten-Tails into himself shortly after.

In the manga, the tag is black, with a
Rinnegan
-like symbol on it, while in the anime, it is white, with a red, white, and teal symbol.

While this seal prevented Obito from becoming a jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails, no such hindrance existed for Rin becoming one for
Isobu
.
