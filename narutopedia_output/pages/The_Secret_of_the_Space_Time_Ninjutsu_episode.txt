Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Naruto
's
attack
 is
countered
 by
Tobi
 who declares that no one shall hinder the
statue
. The group then prepares to go all-out. Easily gaining the upper hand against Naruto, Tobi has a harder time as
Guy
, who took out a pair of
nunchaku
, joins the fray. Amidst the clash, Guy is able to create an opening for Naruto to land his
attack
. As Tobi is distracted,
Kakashi
 uses
Kamui
 and aims for the Demonic Statue; however it nullified the attack, much to his confusion. As Naruto fails to land his attack, he is separated from the others and now has a harder time holding his own against Tobi. Rushing to Naruto's aid, Kakashi launches his
lightning
-imbued
kunai
 at Tobi, however the latter changes its trajectory at Naruto instead.
 Kakashi uses Kamui in time to warp it. Just as the group exclaim Tobi is too strong, a slight fissure appears on his mask. Frustrated, Tobi erects a
barrier
 around the Demonic Statue, preventing
B
 from landing a fatal blow. Analysing the masked man's abilities, Kakashi asks the group to aid him in testing his theory. After putting the plan in motion, Kakashi realises that Tobi is only using a single technique. Having explained Tobi's abilities to the group, Kakashi reveals that their techniques lead to the same
dimension
. Kakashi asks Tobi where he got the
Sharingan
 from, to which the latter tells him that he got it from the
battle
 at the
Kannabi Bridge
, much to Kakashi's disbelief. As Tobi states there is no more hope for the world, Naruto rejects his
views
 and
Kurama
 — who switched with its
jinchūriki
 — declares that the
Fourth Hokage

sealed
 it inside Naruto to take him down. With that, the Nine-Tails commands Naruto to charge. Now wearing a new version of the form, Naruto then charges forward, ready to take Tobi down once and for all.
