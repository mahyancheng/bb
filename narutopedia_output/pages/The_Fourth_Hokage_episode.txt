Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 is surprised to see the
Fourth Hokage
 and wonders why the
Hokage
 knows his name. The Fourth Hokage replies that he had implanted his psyche into the
seal
 in the event that Naruto sprouted eight of the nine tails, and hoped that it would never happen, although he is glad to have the opportunity to meet his son. Naruto is shocked to discover that the Fourth Hokage is his father, and sheds tears; however, he proceeds to punch his father in the gut, asking him why he would seal a
tailed beast
 in his own infant son, citing all the trouble he had growing up and being hated due to his
jinchuriki
 status, and that the
Akatsuki
 have destroyed
Konoha
 in order to come after him just because of that.

The Fourth Hokage tells Naruto that he sealed half of the fox inside Naruto because Naruto is his son and he believes Naruto would be able to control the power. He also reveals that sixteen years ago, it was a
masked man
 in Akatsuki robes whom he had fought who had manipulated the fox into
attacking the village
; additionally, he witnessed Naruto's battle with
Pain
 through Naruto and believes that Pain's hatred towards Konoha is being manipulated by the masked man. The Fourth states that he is aware of
Jiraiya
's death, and tells Naruto that he nor anybody else can answer Pain's question on how to achieve peace, but entrusts his faith that Naruto would find the answer. Tightening and restoring Naruto's seal, he warns his son that he would not be there to seal it again in the future and fades away as his
chakra
 diminishes.

Meanwhile,
Team Guy
 return to the village, having been notified of
Pain's assault
 by a wounded
Gamabunta
, and rescue
Hinata
. Pain is stunned to see Naruto, in his eight-tailed form, breaking out of the
Chibaku Tensei
, shocked that it was unable to contain the beast. However, the eight-tailed form instantly reverts back into Naruto, who is in
Sage Mode
. Pain is surprised by the sudden turn of events and ponders whether Naruto has attained full control over his beast in order to quell it and activate Sage Mode at the same time. As Naruto prepares to defeat Pain, he notices the destruction around him, although he is reassured by
Katsuyu
 that he did not harm anybody during his rampage. Naruto tells the
Deva Path
 that he wishes to speak to the real Pain while Pain merely states that once Naruto depletes his
senjutsu
 after firing two
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
, he would beat Naruto to inches of his life and haul him away. Using his
Frog Kata
, Naruto is able to repel Pain and grab one of his
black receivers
, which he stabs himself with. Sending his
natural energy
 through the receiver, Naruto is able to pinpoint the real Pain's location.

Since his Version 2 transformation dispelled the other shadow clone he had at
Mount Myōboku
, Naruto realises he only has five minutes left in Sage Mode; he creates two
shadow clones
 and launches two Rasenshuriken at Pain, who uses
Shinra Tensei
 to nullify the first one while leaping into the air to
avoid the second
. Naruto then uses
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 to have a handful of shadow clones burst from the rubble circling Pain, and attempts to take advantage of the five-second interval to attack him. Pain's interval ends just as the shadow clones reach him, and he uses Shinra Tensei to repel the clones. However, the real Naruto is launched through mid-air towards Pain, and uses the interval to his advantage as he strikes the defenceless Deva Path with his
Rasengan
.
