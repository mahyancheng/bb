Minamo Funato
 (
舟戸ミナモ
,
Funato Minamo
) was a pirate of the
Funato clan
, the wife of
Araumi Funato
, and mother of
Isari
,
Seiren
, and
Ikada
.

Background

During a battle against
Kirigakure
, Minamo brought her newborn son Ikada with her and Araumi, who commented that bringing a child to a battlefield threw him off. During the attack, Minamo was hit by a
freezing attack
 from Kirigakure while protecting Ikada. Before being completely frozen, she handed Ikada to Araumi, making him promise to raise their son well, who she believed would grow into a great leader for the Funato. Her frozen body sank into the ocean.

Personality

Minamo was very loyal to her clan, and also very kind and nurturing. Treasuring her family, she wanted nothing more than to see them prosper.

Appearance

Minamo was considered very beautiful. She was fair-skinned woman of average height and curvaceous frame. She had icy-blue eyes and wavy brown hair reaching her lower back. She wore a red bandanna atop her hair, a halter-top that is white at her bodice and brown at the midsection, a gold ring pendant, and long red skirt with a blue sash across her waist.

Legacy






Minamo's frozen body underwater.



Araumi would visit Minamo's ice-encased form often, leaving her a pearl as tribute each time. With her final wish being for Ikada to be raised as a future leader for the Funato, Araumi became completely driven to realise that wish. After Araumi's argument with Isari over their approach on the war against Kiri, he went underwater to see Minamo while remembering his promise to her.

Trivia

Written as "水面", "minamo" means "surface of the water".
