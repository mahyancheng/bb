This was a team establised by
Shibuki
 from
Takigakure
, consisting of Taki's jinchūriki
Fū
 and two
jōnin
,
Kegon
 and
Yōrō
, who disguised themselves as
genin
 to protect Fū during the joint Konoha and Suna
Chūnin Exams
, with the intention of also trying to hide her status as a
jinchūriki
.

After passing the first exam held in
Konohagakure
, they were the first genin team to make it to the
Demon Desert
. During the second exam, Fū went to rescue the
Fifth Kazekage
 who was being attacked by
Hōichi
 trying to steal his
Tailed Beast
, and ended up being targeted for her
own
 as well. The two were rescued and freed by
Neji Hyūga
 and the Exams third round were soon cancelled thereafter. After leaving Sunagakure, the team was ambushed by the
Akatsuki
 members
Kakuzu
 and
Hidan
, who eventually managed to defeat and capture Fū and extract her tailed beast, leading to her death.  What happened to Kegon and Yōrō after this encounter is unknown.
