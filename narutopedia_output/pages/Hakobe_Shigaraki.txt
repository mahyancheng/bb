Hakobe Shigaraki
 (
Shigaraki Hakobe
) was the wife of
Tanuki Shigaraki
 and mother of
Sumire Kakei
.

Background






Hakobe and her daughter Sumire.



When
Danzō Shimura
 was killed, it caused
Root
 to be completely disbanded and an investigation on the unit was started. With its activities becoming known to the public, its former members became outcasts. Hakobe told her daughter Sumire to not give up hope, but she herself later died from deteriorating health, despaired and disdained for her family.

Personality

Despite all the hardships of her life, Hakobe wholeheartedly believed that such a life would end with her generation and that her daughter's life would become happier in the future, and she promised to pray for this to happen.

Appearance

Hakobe had purple eyes and hair, which her daughter inherited. She wore a red shirt, a white cape over it, and red pants.

Legacy

Hakobe's death was one of the factors that caused her husband to become stronger in his desire to take revenge on Konohagakure for the Root and his family, a mission he eventually passed on to Sumire by inflicting
Gozu Tennō
 on her back before his own death. Over the years that followed, Sumire's memories of her mother were the brightest corner of her life, although over time, Sumire almost forgot her voice. Ultimately, Sumire was able to remember her mother's words that she herself would have a new life without their suffering, and this, along with the words of
Boruto Uzumaki
, convinced Sumire to give up revenge and choose her own path.

Trivia

Her name can be spelled two ways - はこべ and ハコベ - but they both mean
stellaria
.

In the English version, Hakobe and her daughter Sumire are voiced by the same actress, Erica Lindbeck.
