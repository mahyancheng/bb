Much like the
Shadow Imitation Technique
 and
Shadow–Neck Binding Technique
, shadows dart towards the opponent, though they're much larger and have more shadow strips, all going at a fast pace. Once the opponent is caught, small shadow hands wrap their entire body, making them unable to move. Then the user sets his index finger and thumb looking like a window while concentrating chakra to the desired area to shadow crush.
