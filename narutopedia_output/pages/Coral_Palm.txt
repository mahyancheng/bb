While in his
transformed
 state,
Yagura
 strikes the opponent with a powerful blow, causing a large formation of
coral
 to quickly grow from the initial point of contact. This then rapidly solidifies and restricts the enemy's mobility, as the substance continues to grow, eventually covering their entire body.

Trivia

When written as 珊瑚礁, sangoshō means "
coral reef
".

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
 and later games, Yagura, without going into his transformed state, is capable of slamming his hand on the ground to create coral, perhaps due to his status as a
perfect
 jinchūriki.
