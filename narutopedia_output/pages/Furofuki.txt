 (
フロフキ
) is a
medical-nin
 from
Konohagakure
.

Appearance

She is an elderly bespectacled woman with dull light-brown-coloured hair and a sharp nose. She seems to be rather aged, indicated by the wrinkles on her face. She applies a red lipstick and wears a kimono along with an overcoat.

Abilities

As a medical-nin, she has possibly great chakra control and basic knowledge about medical treatments. She is well versed in studying and using plants and herbs to prevent and cure diseases, since she is an herbologist.

Part II

Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha

Naruto
,
Sakura
, and
Ino
 meet her in the
Jofuku Forest
 when she comes to see what was happening as Naruto destroys the 'fake
Gaara
' created by the
Jofuku flowers
. When queried by Naruto about her decision to live and work all alone on the mountain, she told him that's what she decided and it wasn't his business. She has a great understanding of the flowers and seems to have gathered quite a lot of them, indicating that she may have either fought off the flowers' defences or discovered a way to safely harvest them, either one being testament to her ability.
