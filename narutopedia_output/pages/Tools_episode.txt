Synopsis

Hiding in an abandoned structure,
Sarada
 applies the healing foam to
Konohamaru
's injuries. He thanks
Katasuke
 for developing the technology.
Mitsuki
 believes
Ao
 isn't pursuing them at the moment, Sarada wants to retreat as soon as Konohamaru is healed.
Boruto
 is frustrated by
Mugino
's death, so Konohamaru assures him of Mugino's intentions. They discuss how someone like Ao would align with
Kara
, and how dangerous he is. Knowing that Ao wants to eliminate them for investigating the empty container, Konohamaru priorities getting the information to
Konoha
, and offers himself as a decoy to stall Ao. The genin argue against it, pointing out he's exhausted. Katasuke offers himself as bait instead, revealing that while under
genjutsu
, he leaked information on the
scientific ninja tools
. He feels responsible for what the enemy has done with his technology, including Ao's murder of Mugino.
 Boruto confesses he used to agree that scientific ninja tools shouldn't exist, but seeing their positive influence in his lab changed his mind. He wants to stop Ao from misusing the tools, so others won't hate them without knowing them like he did. Konohamaru is convinced to deal with Ao instead of the decoy strategy. In Kara's headquarters, while trading insults,
Code
 tells
Delta
 that
Jigen
 believes there's a traitor among the Inners. Each accuses the other of being the traitor.
Amado
 interrupts them, and explains the steps he has taken so far to uncover who is the traitor. Code and Delta point out
Boro
 skipped maintenance, as did
Koji
, and wonder where he is. Koji meets with Ao, and questions his commitment. Ao assures him of his loyalty to Kara. The Konoha shinobi strategise, wanting to make use of the
jutsu absorption tool
 Ao stole. They intend to make him absorb their attacks to create an opening for a surprise attack from a blindspot, now that Ao no longer has a
Byakugan
. Boruto activates the
chakra blade
 he intends to use, but passes out from its chakra use. When he wakes up, Katasuke has finished adjusting their remaining jutsu absorption arm for Boruto's use. They prepare to defeat Ao with the proper use of scientific ninja tools.
