A
sword
 (
刀剣
,
Tōken
) is a long, bladed weapon used for combat. While most swords in
Naruto
 are traditional Japanese
katana
,
tantō
, or
ninjatō
, swords used by main characters tend to bear little resemblance to real-life weapons, as is the case with the
Seven Swordsmen of the Mist
's swords. Other swords that have been introduced in the series have mystical or special powers, including
Orochimaru
's
Sword of Kusanagi
 and the
Sword of Totsuka
 as wielded by
Itachi Uchiha
's
Susanoo
.

Most shinobi appear to have a preference towards long and wide blades while some ninja like
Tenten
 use shorter swords, mainly for throwing them long-range. Of note are the
samurai
 of the
Land of Iron
, who are nearly all seen with swords, and the shinobi of the
Land of Lightning
, which boasts a visible majority carrying them. A sword noted for belonging to a particular wielder is known as a Meitō (
名刀
,
literally meaning:
 Famous/Excellent Sword).

Certain foreign countries use more westernised types of swords. For instance, the kingdom of the
Land of the Moon
's military uses either
sabers
 or
spatha
, while
Shion
's guards in the
Land of Demons
 wield
jian
.
