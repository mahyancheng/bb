"
The Secrets of the Mangekyō Sharingan
" (
開眼　万華鏡写輪眼の秘密
,
Kaigan Mangekyō Sharingan no Himitsu
) is episode 131 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Sasuke
's remembrance of his childhood draws to a close, Sasuke returned home from the
Ninja Academy
 one day to find all the members of the
Uchiha clan
 murdered. Upon finding his parents' bodies, Sasuke discovered
Itachi
 to be responsible for the massacre. Using his
Mangekyō Sharingan
, Itachi showed Sasuke their parents' deaths, causing Sasuke to run with fright. Itachi stopped him, telling him that he wasn't worth killing. As Itachi left, he informed Sasuke that if he wanted to take revenge for the clan, he would need to get stronger. To help Sasuke gain the strongest ability of the Uchiha, Itachi tells Sasuke the requirements to obtain his own Mangekyō Sharingan: He must kill his closest friend. With that, Itachi left, leaving Sasuke to build a hate for his brother. Resolving to get stronger, Sasuke decided he would do whatever was necessary to kill Itachi. Returning to the present day, Sasuke and
Naruto
 resume their battle, with Sasuke stating that Naruto is his closest friend and that he must kill Naruto to achieve the power needed to kill Itachi.

Trivia

In the manga, before Sasuke discovered
Fugaku
's and
Mikoto
's corpses, someone told Sasuke to not come in. Since this did not occur in the anime, it is unknown who said it.

Most of the flashbacks from this episode are taken from
episode 84
; however, there is one noticeable difference. In the original episode, during Sasuke's flashback, Itachi's Sharingan does not change into his Mangekyō Sharingan when he uses
Tsukuyomi
 on Sasuke. In this episode, however, Sasuke's flashback does show Itachi's eyes changing. This is because at the time the original episode aired,
Masashi Kishimoto
 had not yet designed the Mangekyō Sharingan.
