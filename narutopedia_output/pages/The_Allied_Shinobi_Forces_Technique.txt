"
The Allied Shinobi Forces Technique
" (
忍連合軍の術!
,
Shinobi Rengōgun no Jutsu!
) is episode 363 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Naruto
 is confused at first over not being able to sense the
Ten-Tails
, so Kurama tells him that the Ten-Tails is akin to
natural energy
, prompting Naruto to stagger when he senses it in
Sage Mode
.
Madara
 and Obito take command of the
Ten-Tails
, and discuss whether they should move their plans along or test its power.
Kurama
 develops a strategy against the Ten-Tails, resulting in a gamble with a
Kakashi
 releasing B from
Kamui's dimension
 right in front of the beast to target its eye, but it simply flicks the Tailed Beast Ball right back at
B
. Running low on chakra, B and Naruto revert from their Tailed Beast Modes.
 Naruto moves in to create more shadow clones, but ends up discussing ideals with Obito.
Obito
 has the Ten-Tails fire a
Tailed Beast Ball
 at them, which misses due to the timely arrival and intervention of
Ino
,
Hinata
, and a few others. Several
Aburame
 and
Kirigakure
 shinobi disrupt sensing and conceal the battlefield. The rest of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 arrives at the battlefield, revealed as the Ten-Tails swipes its tail to blow away their cover. Naruto boldly claims that the
Allied Shinobi Forces Technique
 is more powerful than the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
. Remaining unimpressed by their swollen numbers, Obito argues with Naruto some more, during which time
Shikaku
 relays the Alliance a strategy through
Inoichi
's telepathy. The Alliance sequentially blinds the Ten-Tails, sinks it into the ground, and binds it with a quick-drying mixture of water and quicklime. Madara notes the good coordination from shinobi from different countries. Shikaku instructs the Alliance to cooperate with Naruto in exploiting the limits of Obito's intangibility, and
taijutsu
-capable shinobi to attack Madara. As their assault begins, Obito and Madara note that they cling to hope that doesn't exist as the Ten-Tails begins changing.

Trivia

Before the Allied Shinobi Forces began their assault on Obito and Madara, behind Might Guy and
Rock Lee
 are two Kiri shinobi who bear striking resemblances to
Zōri
 and
Waraji
. There also happens to be a
Kumo
 shinobi who resembles
Jako
, and a shinobi resembling Pac Lee (from
Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth
) can be seen standing behind Lee and Guy.

When the Ten-Tails first roared, its eye was depicted as a regular
Rinnegan
 instead of its
Rinne Sharingan
.
