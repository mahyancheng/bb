Jiraiya
 uses his
Wild Lion's Mane Technique
 to extend his hair, then swings it 360 degrees to slam the opponent and send them flying into the air. He then uses the
Fire Release: Fire Dragon Flame Bullet
 on the opponent and slams his
Rasengan
 onto them, absorbing the fire
chakra
 and forms into the
Fire Release: Great Flame Rasengan
 with a white orb inside instead of black. The Rasengan is released from Jiraiya's hand, and instead of an explosion of fire, when the opponent hits the ground like the Great Flame Rasengan, a small cyclone composed of flame appears and after disappearing for a few seconds, rain made of fire falls to the ground at a dramatic speed.
