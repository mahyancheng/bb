By forming a sphere of water, the user can use it to monitor chakra signatures in a given area. Individuals or groups are represented as varying-sized bubbles within the sphere, with larger chakra signatures having larger bubbles. The sphere itself is not a great form of detection and needs on-the-field reports to locate targets that should be kept track of. When linked with a

, this imprecision is mitigated somewhat.
