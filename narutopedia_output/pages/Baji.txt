Baji
 (
バジ
) was the leader of a group of bandits.

Personality

Baji seems to care only for himself, as he said that as long as he has the hostage, he can get away safely. Even if his men die, he stated that he could form a new gang, suggesting that he does not care for others at all, even for combat value. However, Baji is willing to commit suicide if the alternative is to be arrested.

He has great confidence in himself, and because of that, he often believes everything is going according to plan, even when it's actually not. He is often seen smirking and generally have a very arrogant demeanour. This is also what led to him underestimating the abilities
Team 7
 and
Team 10
.

Abilities

Baji is noted to be very intelligent and an excellent tactician. His skill was apparently high enough to have all of his men following his orders without asking questions.
