Clan symbols seen in the series.



A
clan
 (
一族
,
Ichizoku
,
literally meaning:
 household, clan), in the loosest sense of the term, refers to a family or group of shinobi who form a basic unit of a shinobi village. A majority of these clans were
mercenary military forces
 even before the
First Shinobi World War
.
 The
Senju clan
 and
Uchiha clan
 were the first known clans to have agreed to settle and form
a shinobi village
, facilitated by creating agreements with the
daimyō
 of
the land they inhabit
. Many clans would follow the example of the Senju and the Uchiha, later establishing the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 as they are known today.

Membership in a clan is usually determined by blood relations and genetics, which is vital in the usage of
kekkei genkai
 and
secret
 techniques. These attributes and abilities made many clans feared and renowned throughout many villages. While clans may be composed of many individuals and extended families, many clans mentioned and seen in the series were somewhat limited to a nuclear family.
