Using his chakra-made fishing rod, Urashiki launches a barrage of multiple hooks at his opponent to steal their chakra.

Trivia

The name of this technique is derived from an earlier version of the
Urashima Taro
 folktale, in which a fisherman named Tsutsukawa no Shimako, or Ura no Shimako, is introduced to seven children named the Subaru-boshi, a reference to the
Pleiades
 star cluster, at the entrance to the Palace of the Dragon King. "Subaru", normally written as 昴, meaning "cluster", is instead written as 須波流, meaning "essential wave current".
