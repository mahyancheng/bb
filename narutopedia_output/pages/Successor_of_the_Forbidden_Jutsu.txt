"
Successor of the Forbidden Jutsu
" (
禁術の継承者
,
Kinjutsu no Keishōsha
) is episode 145 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

The
four bandits
 have a meeting with their
leader
, who tells them that
En no Gyōja
's
secret technique
 unleashed its true potential during the
Third Shinobi World War
 and that if they acquired it, they could use it to become rulers of various lands. However, he advises them not to engage in combat with the
Konoha

shinobi
 team dispatched to provide assistance, claiming that once they reached the
Tsuchigumo Clan
's village, they would depart, allowing the bandits to swoop in and retrieve the
kinjutsu
.

Elsewhere,
Utakata
 sits against a tree,
blowing bubbles
. He remembers when he first met
Hotaru
, and how she begged him to be her master. Having been irritated at the word "master" (due to his own
master
 abusing him), he refused; Hotaru, however, reminded him that he was getting free food and a room and that he should pay them back by teaching her. He told her that he would consider it if she is able to
walk on water
. When Hotaru failed, Utakata claimed that he cannot teach anyone
ninjutsu
 if they cannot manage to walk on the surface of water. Nevertheless, Hotaru practised all night and come morning, she mastered the technique. Wanting to get her off his back, Utakata showed her the
Water Release: Wild Water Wave
 technique, and told her to master that before being his student. As she failed to perform the technique, Utakata smiled as he mused that only one who possesses
Water Release
 could use the jutsu. Yet, by the next morning, Hotaru managed to master the Wild Water Wave technique as well.

Utakata is snapped out of his reverie when he notices four shadows flitting through the trees. He attacks them with his bubbles, claiming that he was from
Mount Katsuragi
, the fort they had attacked, and that he is interested in getting his hands on the forbidden technique as well. He uses his
bubble clones
 to deceive them while also
blinding
 one of them, although he is caught in the middle of an
exploding barrier
.

Meanwhile, Hotaru attempts to brush off
Naruto
, who is following her through the woods. She tells him to leave, as she can handle herself.
Yamato
 gives
Sai
 an idea, and Sai creates an
ink leech
 that falls on Hotaru. Panicking, she cries out for Naruto to help her, and asks him to come with her until the forest clears out, being afraid of leeches. As they walk, with Naruto constantly swatting away the leeches, Hotaru talks about how she had viewed Utakata as her master. Naruto tells her about his own
master
, who is a pervert, but states that Jiraiya is strong and kind-hearted and that he would not mind becoming like him some day. The team eventually reaches the village, where they leave Hotaru at the hands of the
Tsuchigumo Chief
, who is Hotaru's uncle. Naruto notices all the villagers glaring at her, but leaves along with Yamato and Sai. However, he finds himself riddled with uncertainty and rushes back to the village alone to ensure her safety.
