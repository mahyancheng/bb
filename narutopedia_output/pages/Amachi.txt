Amachi
 (
アマチ
) is a
medical-nin
 and scientist who was an accomplice of
Orochimaru
.

Background

He and Orochimaru terrorised the people of the
Land of the Sea
, and kidnapped the citizens for their deadly experiments (including
Isaribi
) which included making the ultimate underwater ninja for Orochimaru. He ordered Isaribi to attack ships, promising to return her to her normal form, but truly intending to dissect her once she was no longer of use. He also seemed to know
Anko Mitarashi
 as well, since she was with Orochimaru at that time.

Abilities






Amachi's Kaima form.



Being a medical-nin, Amachi uses a scalpel as a tool and has good
chakra control
 in general. Due to experiments on himself, he can transform into a
fish-man hybrid
. While in this hybrid form, he can use
water
 nature techniques such as spitting a
strong stream
 of water from his mouth. His movements are improved greatly due to his transformation and he is also able to breathe underwater. He can
summon
 a
sentient
 mass of water that takes a powerful
Fire Release technique
 to defeat.

Part I

Kaima Capture Mission

Much later,
Yoroi Akadō
 and
Misumi Tsurugi
 joined him as bodyguards and assistants. He planned to steal gold from an arriving ship, and manipulated Isaribi into attacking it. It was also revealed that he planned on using his experiments to take revenge on Orochimaru, who cancelled the underwater ninja project due to loss of interest.

In the final confrontation with Anko,
Naruto Uzumaki
,
Ino Yamanaka
, and
Shino Aburame
, he also transformed into a
complete Kaima Form
 and  summoned the indestructible
Umibōzu
. He was defeated by Naruto when he used the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
's chakra and was captured by Anko. Upon his capture, he mentioned that he didn't know a way to cure Isaribi, and had planned to dissect her when she was no longer useful. Naruto grew infuriated and tried to strike him, but Anko held him back, only to slug Amachi herself after asking him about Orochimaru's whereabouts.
