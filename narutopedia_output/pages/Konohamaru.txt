Summary

While preparing for his life as a ninja,
Naruto Uzumaki
 meets the young
Konohamaru
 in the middle of an attempt on the
Third Hokage
's life. When he fails, Konohamaru asks to train under Naruto, hoping that his
Sexy Technique
 will be enough to defeat the Third and become
Hokage
. Planning to become Hokage himself, Naruto asks why he would want the title. Konohamaru explains that, as the Third's grandson, people only identify him as such and not by his name. He hopes that, by becoming Hokage, people will acknowledge him, not because he's the grandson of the latter.

Knowing what Konohamaru is going through, Naruto agrees to train him.
Ebisu
, Konohamaru's tutor, believes the "
Nine-Tails
 boy" is a bad influence and attempts to stop their training. Konohamaru uses his perfected Sexy Technique to try and get rid of Ebisu, but it has no effect. Naruto follows up with his
Harem Technique
, which affected Ebisu and a proof he's also a pervert. Seeing that he still has much to learn, Konohamaru breaks off his student-teacher relationship with Naruto, as depending on Naruto's help to become Hokage would mean he is unfit for the position.
