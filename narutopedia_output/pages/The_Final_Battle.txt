" (
最後の戦い
,
Saigo no Tatakai
) is episode 476 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

At the
Valley of the End
,
Naruto
 recalls
Neji
's words about
Sasuke
 being in darkness. Sasuke explains that based on
Itachi
's life, he's come to the conclusion that a true
Hokage
 is one who shoulders the hatred of others. Sasuke intends to concentrate all power and all hatred on himself. Naruto points out others would not agree with his plan, but Sasuke doesn't care. Sasuke is certain he has all the power he needs to carry out his plan. Naruto argues there are things that can't be done alone, like the fight against
Kaguya
. By killing the
tailed beasts
 and the
Kage
, Sasuke wants to erase the darkness of the past. Naruto denounces erasing the past, having been shaped by his past as well.
Hagoromo
 begins fading away, and tells
Kakashi
 to keep having faith. Thinking of their answers, Hagoromo fades.
 Naruto and Sasuke begin fighting, first with
taijutsu
. Sasuke attacks with
fireballs
, which Naruto dodges. Naruto creates clones, which attack with
Rasengan
. Using the
Rinnegan
, Sasuke
pulls
 Naruto and his clones toward himself, and
skewers
 them with black flames. The real Naruto blocks it with
chakra arms
, and attacks Sasuke from above with more arms. Entering
Six Paths Sage Mode
, Naruto continues attacking with chakra arms. Sasuke sends another fireball his way, which Naruto blocks. Sasuke
teleports
 behind Naruto, and sends him back with
Chidori
. Sasuke begins firing
Susanoo
 arrows, which Naruto blocks with his
Truth-Seeking Balls
. Sasuke switches to a Complete Body Susanoo, and Naruto enters Tailed Beast Mode just in time to parry Sasuke's attack, fist-bumping him in the process. The two see each other's loneliness as children. Sasuke has Susanoo blow
fireballs
 at Naruto, who dodges them, blocks Susanoo's swords with
Kurama
's tails, and tosses Susanoo down with them. Naruto hesitates using a
Tailed Beast Ball
 when Susanoo is down, giving Sasuke an opportunity of using
Kirin
. Sasuke chastises Naruto for stalling. Naruto refuses to let Sasuke go alone again. The two clash with a
Susanoo: Chidori
 and a Tailed Beast Ball. In each other's minds again, Sasuke expresses the need to kill Naruto, and tells him that they are both different from the last time they fought there. Naruto points out there's no guarantee the world Sasuke creates won't have the same darkness as before, and that the five villages are finally united at peace. Sasuke argues the only reason that happened is because were forced to band together to defeat common enemies in
Akatsuki
,
Madara
, and Kaguya. Naruto asks what happens after Sasuke dies, no longer fulfilling the role of common enemy. Sasuke answers that with the power of the Rinnegan, he has many ways of leading from the shadows. Still annoyed at Naruto's insistence in not killing him, Sasuke calls forth the
Chibaku Tensei
 the tailed beasts are sealed in, in his first step into the shadows.

Trivia

When Sasuke shifted behind Naruto after Naruto blocked his fireball attack, one of Naruto's three Truth-Seeking Balls disappeared as if Sasuke traded places with it. This did not occur in the
manga
.
