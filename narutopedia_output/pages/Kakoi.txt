Background

In the anime, the
Third Hokage
 reported to
Kakashi
 that someone had been slipping through Konoha's
Sensing Barrier
. Kakoi reported that the possibilities were that there was a traitor who had knowledge of how not to trigger it, of that someone had a jutsu that could break through it. He showed Kakashi reports where the barrier was on high alert, around the self-governing
Uchiha
 district. Hiruzen tasked Kakashi with installing a sensing barrier there without linking back to the Anbu.

Kakoi has shoulder-length brown hair and unique markings under his eye. He wears a high-collared white tunic and white hat.

By using
Water Release
, Kakoi was able to erect an immense Sensing Barrier with the help of others, which allowed him to monitor the situation in
Konohagakure
.

Part II

Sensing Water Sphere
 when
Pain's assault

Trivia

Kakoi
), it means "enclosure".

 over a decade later.
