Sasori uses his
Third Kazekage

human puppet
 to manipulate a large quantity of
Iron Sand
 into a pyramid-shaped figure that lengthens towards his opponent while spinning from left to right.

Trivia

In the anime, Sasori performs a similar method, where he creates a similar shaped figure but has it spin in a single direction and merely uses it to try and drill it into the target.
