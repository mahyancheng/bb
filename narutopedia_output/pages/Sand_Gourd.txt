Gaara carries around a variety of different
calabash
-shaped
gourds
 covered in designs and filled with his
chakra
-infused
sand
 which he can freely manipulate.

Overview





The gourd being converted into sand for use.



Infused with his own chakra, Gaara controls this "specially-made sand" (
特別製の砂
,
tokubetsu-sei no suna
) far easier than regular sand, though he can use this supply to break down the ground to increase the quantity of sand. The gourd and cork are also made from sand and can be broken down and used to perform techniques as well.
 In Part I,
Kiba Inuzuka
 noted that the sand from the gourd had a strong stench of blood, due to the number of people Gaara had killed with it.
 If Gaara is sent plummeting towards the ground at high velocities, he can turn the gourd into sand to cushion the fall. He can easily reform the gourd afterwards.
