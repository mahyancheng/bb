Kakuzu, after using the
Wind Release: Pressure Damage
 to create a whirlwind in the centre of the battlefield, releases through his
fire-mask
 a large fireball into the whirlwind, causing the fireball to split into several smaller ones that are sent in all directions in a fixed pattern.

Trivia

When there are four fireballs, the pattern takes a cross formation. When there are six fireballs, the pattern takes a star formation.
