A more powerful variation of
Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm
. The user hits the target at close range with a powerful wave of chakra emitted from their palm, which sends them flying back, causing severe damage.

Trivia

Whenever this technique is used, the target is generally sent crashing into some kind of rock formation, which may be an allusion to the technique's name.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 4
 and
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 5
 when the technique is used, Neji spins toward his opponent and places both his hands on the opponent's body with his left hand sideways above his right hand which is pointing down. After calling out the attack a massive beam of chakra shoots through them and carves through the rocky terrain behind them, making it visually different from the version used in the anime.
