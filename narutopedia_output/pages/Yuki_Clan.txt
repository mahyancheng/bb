This article is about the clan.  For other uses, see
Yuki (disambiguation)
.

The
Yuki Clan
 (
雪一族
,
Yuki Ichizoku
) lived in the
Land of Water
. Some time ago, the country was in the midst of a civil war. In this war, different sides battled each other using ninja in combat, some of whom possessed
kekkei genkai
. After the war ended, memories of the gruesome battles still lingered in the minds of the people, causing wide-spread persecutions against those with the kekkei genkai. Because of this, the Yuki clan, whose members carried the
Ice Release
 kekkei genkai went into hiding for their own safety.

Haku
 and
his mother
, now both deceased, were the only known members of this clan. What happened to the rest of the clan is unknown, but it is assumed that they were either killed or, like Haku's mother, went to live peaceful lives living as normal people, without revealing their true bloodline. Memories of the clan still linger, its members and kekkei genkai being called "cursed" even during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

Trivia

The name "Yuki" means "snow" (
雪
), a reference to their kekkei genkai.

The clan's ultimate technique is the
Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals
, which is said to have been passed down through the generations.
