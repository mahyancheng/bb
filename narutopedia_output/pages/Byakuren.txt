Byakuren
 (
白蓮
) was the
First
Mizukage
 (
初代水影
,
Shodai Mizukage
,
literally meaning:
 First or Founding Water Shadow) who founded
Kirigakure
 in the
Land of Water
.

Background

During the
Warring States Period
, after the formation of Kirigakure, Byakuren worked tirelessly to establish the village as one of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
. However, its governance was marked by limited interaction with the other villages.






The first ever five Kage summit is convened.



At the first
meeting of the five Kage
, Byakuren was accompanied by a shinobi from his village, who would later become the
Third Mizukage
. He sat alongside the others, and told
Hashirama Senju
 that if he acted so humbly as to bow to them — his equals — he would suspect an ulterior motive for having them gather in such a manner. He later expressed outrage when the
First Kazekage
 made a demand that instead of receiving a
tailed beast
 — as the sand priests of
Sunagakure
 had already sealed away
one
 — they requested 30% of whatever the other nations would pay for a tailed beast from
Konoha
, claiming the amount to be too high a demand. As infighting broke out and Hashirama made his plea to them to preserve the future of their children and unite, he looked on thoughtfully at the proceedings.

Personality

While much was not seen of his personality, he seemed to be cautious in nature while being a frank person, mincing no words with the First Kazekage when he showed no signs of lowering or abandoning his conditions for signing the treaty, and noting that if Sunagakure were to plan to attack them, the other nations could band together and destroy them.
 His cautious nature was also displayed with Hashirama when the latter was acting too humble over the five Kage meeting for his liking, going as far as suggesting that Hashirama had a hidden agenda for the meeting.
 He was also a stern individual which along with his cautious nature heavily influenced his village's governance and was the reason interaction with the other villages was limited.

Appearance






Byakuren wearing the Mizukage headpiece.



In his old age, Byakuren had copious amounts of long, grey hair along with a long moustache and beard that merged into one all of which almost covered the entirety of his face. He had a scar that ran across his left eye, similar to
Yagura
, which was apparently blind. His teeth were sharp and triangular; a trait carried by generations of shinobi from Kirigakure. Attire-wise, he wore a simple, light-coloured, loose-fitting kimono over a pair of dark pants. His right eye is black  and his left eye is pure white.

Abilities

As the First Mizukage and the founder of Kirigakure, Byakuren was undoubtedly a powerful shinobi. He was hailed as a legendary shinobi who excelled in worldly wisdom.

Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes






The deceased Kage summoning Team 7 and the tailed beasts.



Subsequent to
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 being
sealed
 by
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Sasuke Uchiha
, he and the other deceased
Kage
 were summoned from the
Pure Land
 by
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 to aid him and the
Hokage
 in
summoning

Team 7
, the
tailed beasts
 and
Madara Uchiha
 from
Kaguya's dimension
. He marvelled at the fact that all of the tailed beasts were gathered in one place before his and the other Kage's souls were released to the Pure Land once more.

Trivia

"Byakuren" (
白蓮
) literally means "
white lotus
".

In his anime debút, his eyes are depicted as being the same colour.
 However, in the manga, during the First Summit, his left eye was noticeably greyer than the right one.
