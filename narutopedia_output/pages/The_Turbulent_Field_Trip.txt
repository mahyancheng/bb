Synopsis

Land of Fire

daimyō

Ikkyū Madoka
 issues a statement regarding state of affairs with the
Land of Waves
.
Iruka
 and
Anko
 watch it on the news, disconcerted with his position, and muse how good
Konoha
 has it.
Naruto
 is with them, having come to the
Academy
, and announced he has reached an agreement with the
Land of Water
, allowing for field trips there.
Boruto
 interrupts their discussions with a poor rendition of
Wind Release
 jutsu. Boruto tries talking around the issue. Boruto and Naruto get into an argument.
Shino
 announces the development to his class. The students discuss the possibilities.
 Shino asks for a class leader to represent them, and
Sarada
 volunteers Boruto, who is hanging upside down tied up and gagged over his earlier prank. Other students support her, and due to being gagged, Boruto is unable to voice his dissent. While talking about it after class,
Iwabee
 reminds them of
Kirigakure
's past as the "Bloody Mist".
Hinata
 helps Boruto pack for the trip. Shino and Anko take the class by train and boat. Boruto and Sarada fight. Iwabee remains gloomy during the trip. At night, Boruto asks
Mitsuki
 about his Wind Release. Kirigakure comes into sight. They arrive in the morning, and are surprised at how urban it looks. The group is welcomed by their guide,
Kagura Karatachi
, an aide to the
Mizukage
. Many of the girls swoon over him. Kagura greets Boruto, and shows them around. Kagura and Boruto bond over their shared interest in
Kagemasa
. Iwabee remains gloomy as well as sceptical about Kirigakure's current state when talking to Boruto and
Denki
. Boruto bumps into someone. Iwabee and the guy's attitude about it cause him and Boruto to begin fighting, but
Shizuma
 intervenes. He's impressed with the Konoha kids for standing up to
Hassaku
. The two leave, and as they do, a thick mist covers the village.
