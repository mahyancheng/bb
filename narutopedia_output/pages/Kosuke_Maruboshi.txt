Kosuke Maruboshi
 (
まるぼしコスケ
,
Maruboshi Kosuke
) is a
genin
 of
Konohagakure
 and is reputed as the
Eternal Genin
 (
万年下忍
,
Mannen Genin
) as well as
Konoha's Strongest Genin
 (
木ノ葉最強の下忍
,
Konoha Saikyō no Genin
).

Background






Kosuke mourning the loss of his comrades as the Second Hokage speaks to him.



When he was still a child, he made a reckless decision that cost him the lives of his teammates. Ashamed of this, he felt he was not worthy of being promoted beyond the rank of genin. Despite this, he continued to train arduously to improve his skills, something that was insisted upon him by
Tobirama Senju
. Kosuke would remain a genin for over fifty years, thus the reason others called him the
Eternal Genin
. During this time, Kosuke would serve under the Second,
Third
, and
Fourth Hokage
. At other points, he fought alongside the Legendary
Sannin
,
Konoha's White Fang
, and the previous generation of
Ino-Shika-Chō
 trio. He also seems to be one of the few people who knew about the true identity of
Naruto Uzumaki
 as the Fourth's son. At some point he lost one of his legs, presumably in battle, and had it replaced with a sword he conceals with a prosthetic foot.

Six years after the Fourth Hokage died
saving Konoha from the Nine-Tails
, Kosuke was sent on a mission with
Might Guy
 to complete a trading of secret scrolls with the
Land of Wood
's
Prajñā Group
 to establish an alliance between the two countries. Along the way, Guy noted his suspicions that this
mission
 was actually to test the trustworthiness of the other country. Ultimately, Guy's guess was right as the Prajñā Group betrayed the Konoha-nin after getting the scroll. As Kosuke and his team were nearly
crushed
 by the enemy,
Kakashi Hatake
 and
Itachi Uchiha
 of the
Anbu
 appeared to save their allies and swiftly defeated the Prajñā Group.






Kosuke cuts down the enemy.



Seven years later, he was placed on a team alongside
Hayama Shirakumo
,
Tekuno Kanden
 and Naruto Uzumaki to guard the borders of the village after
Orochimaru
 and
Sunagakure
's invasion of the village. While on the mission, they realised that their borders were invaded by several
Iwagakure
 shinobi. After being left by both Hayama and Tekuno, to report to the village what had happened while they held them off, they were confronted by two Iwagakure teams that had broken through the defensive lines. After defeating the teams with various techniques, Kosuke directly clashed with the attack force's
leader
 who mistook him to be the leader of Konoha's defence forces as well. After Naruto returned claiming that he could never abandon a comrade on the battlefield, Kosuke declared that he would neither die, nor allow Konoha to be besieged by someone who would so willingly sacrifice their subordinates. With this, he defeated the Iwagakure
kunoichi
.

He was later given a mission on retrieving valuabe infomation from Iwagakure. After retrieving information from the
Three Brothers
 from Iwagakure, Kosuke rushed back to Konohagakure to relay the information. He was, however, overpowered by them and when seemingly trapped, Team Asuma arrived as back up and saved him with their
Formation Ino–Shika–Chō
.

Personality

Kosuke has a very calm, collected and kind personality which seemingly comes from his years of knowledge and expertise, and is often seen smiling and hardly letting anything bother him even while on missions. This demeanour however, should not be taken as him being lazy or uncaring as he was quick to action when the team was being attacked and with his expert survival skills. He is usually seen with a smile on his face which gives him an air of carefree. This however can change in an instant to one of pure seriousness.

He is also quite loyal, holding closely to the
Will of Fire
 belief shared by the villagers with which comes his great sense of duty. This is seen in his willingness to sacrifice himself to allow Naruto to escape to warn the village and when he got angry at the Iwa kunoichi that had sacrificed her genin-level ninja during the battle. Because of what happened during his youth, Kosuke seemed to put little value on his life, resulting in him putting the village's well-being ahead of his own, which led to him being repeatedly reprimanded by the Second, Third, and Fourth Hokage. This mentality has seemingly changed however, after he met
Naruto Uzumaki
, whom he has noted to be very similar to his father.

Appearance






Kosuke as an adult.



Kosuke is an elderly man with his once black hair, now greyed which he wears in a short ponytail. He wears a mesh armour shirt under a short, brown, sleeveless kimono with a pair of grey pants. He carries a
wok
 that he uses for multiple reasons ranging from cooking in while out on missions, to supplementary weaponry during battle. He also carries a ladle, and a sword sheathed horizontally across his lower back.

In his youth, Kosuke had dark hair, tied in a ponytail. He wore a blue jacket along with a mesh shirt underneath.

Abilities






Kosuke using Leaf-Style Willow.



While officially a genin, he is easily skilled enough to become a
jōnin
 — a promotion he repeatedly declined. A long career as a shinobi and teachings from some of Konoha's most prominent shinobi has given Kosuke a large amount of knowledge and experience, both within and out of combat. In addition to combat skills, Kosuke is a highly capable survival expert and cook and as such is often requested personally when missions that require these skills arise.

Physical Prowess

Kosuke has considerable taijutsu skill, able to use only his cooking-ware to defend and manoeuvre against enemy attacks. He is also a skilled
kenjutsu
 fighter and wields a
tantō
 and a hidden blade concealed in his prosthetic, left leg, both of which he can use to strike with deadly precision. Additionally, despite his advanced age, Kosuke has repeatedly showed to be deceptively agile and fast.

Ninjutsu

He also demonstrated the use of a unique
technique
 which incorporates
genjutsu
 along with kenjutsu to confuse and petrify his opponent, making it easier to strike them down. He also learned the
Shuriken Shadow Clone Technique
 from the Third Hokage which he uses with similar proficiency.

Nature Transformation






Kosuke using Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique.



His training under the Second Hokage gave him highly proficient skill in high calibre
Water Release
 techniques, including the
Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique
 and
Water Release: Water Formation Wall
. He was even able to overpower an
Earth Release

technique
 with a Water Release technique, despite Earth being Water's weakness. He can also use
Earth Release
 techniques such as the
Earth Release: Hiding Like a Mole Technique
.

Part II

Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha

Two years later, when the village was being rebuilt after
Pain's assault
, he remarked that Minato had left behind a
fine son
.

Paradise Life on a Boat






Kosuke thanks Team Asuma for saving him many years ago.



Kosuke later came across
Team Asuma
 whom he greets fondly, telling them that he owed a debt to them for saving him many years ago. After thanking them, he tells them about the first time the formation had saved him during the
Konoha Crush
, causing the three friends to realise that their fathers were amazing. As he leaves, he tells them not to worry as good shinobi aren't made in a day, and that he'd be more careful so they wouldn't have to save him again.

Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes

On the day of the
Sixth Hokage
's inauguration, Kosuke and the other shinobi guard the village gate, not allowing anyone not authorised to enter.
