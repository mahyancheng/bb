Naruto
 manga.

Summary

After successfully entering
Kaguya's dimension
,
Sakura
 makes her intentions clear, before
Naruto
's disintegrating
shadow clone
 disperses, causing the events to be relayed to him. With this, he charges forward intent on distracting
Kaguya
 until his allies could retrieve
Sasuke
. Activating her
Strength of a Hundred Seal
, Sakura
transfers
 her chakra to
Obito
 wrapping the seals of her technique around his body as well, as the
Uchiha
 uses his
Kamui
 to breach Kaguya's other dimensions.
 The feat itself takes a heavy toll on the duo and they are almost swallowed by a sea of acid from one dimension. Sakura however uses her body to shield them from the worst of it, discarding her damaged
flak jacket
 in the process. Meanwhile Kaguya battles Naruto in her frozen dimension and decides not to use her
Amenominaka
 ability in case more of what she thought to just be Naruto's clones breached her main dimension. Elsewhere, in the sand-dune dimension, Sasuke is able to make his way to the location where he felt Naruto's chakra strongly only moments before. Continuing with their toll-taking search for Sasuke, Sakura and Obito are finally able to open the dimension that Sasuke is trapped in. Calling out to him, the young Uchiha dashed towards them. With their strength wavering, however, the portal began closing; ultimately Sakura is able to pour more chakra into Obito to enlarge the closing portal once more. Their abilities at their limit, they thought their efforts had failed only to find Sasuke standing next to them. When questioned, he notes that he was able to get close enough to use his
dōjutsu
 to
swap places
 with Sakura's flak jacket.

Trivia

When Naruto received the memories of his shadow clone, his eyes were shown to have normal pupils.
