Utakata blows acidic bubbles from his
pipe
 that burn anything it comes into contact with. The sheer multitude and wide-range it can cover makes avoiding it very difficult.

Trivia

Santōka is the given name of
Santōka Taneda
 (
種田山頭火
,
Taneda Santōka
). He was a
haiku
 poet, well-known for his free style haiku lacking the traditional 5-7-5 syllabic rule and seasonal word. He is called a wandering poet for the many trips he took in his later life as a Buddhist monk, wandering through Japan without being part of a monastery.

The
san
 in Santōka's name is actually written with the kanji for
mountain
 (
山
), but for this technique, it is interpreted as
acid
 (
酸
), also pronounced
san
.
Tōka
 is interpreted as meaning
permeation
 (
透過
) instead of
head
 (
頭
) and
fire
 (
火
), which it means in Santōka's name.

Although he wasn't shown using this technique in the manga, it was stated he could mix acid in with his bubble ninjutsu.
 This is also demonstrated in
Naruto Mobile
.
