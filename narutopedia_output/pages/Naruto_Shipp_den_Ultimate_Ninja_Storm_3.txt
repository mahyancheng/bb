Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
 is a game developed by CyberConnect2 and published by Namco-Bandai games for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It was released on March 5, 2013 in North America, March 8 in Europe, and April 18 in Japan. An enhanced edition called "
Full Burst
" was released on October 24th 2013 for PC and Steam. The game starts with a flashback from the beginning of the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
 and then starts with the
Five Kage Summit
 arc, ending with an alternate turn of events in the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. In Europe, the game is available in a "
Will of Fire Edition
" and "
True Despair Edition
".

An enhanced re-release was bundled in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Trilogy/Legacy
 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. The game was once again re-released for the Nintendo Switch on April 26, 2018.

Gameplay





A limited time download was available for Naruto, which allowed players to use Goku's classic turtle gi from Dragon Ball Z.



Namco Bandai stated that the game would feature a 'more profound' story and a combat system that is 'aimed to further evolution'. Other than the usual form of Awakening, renamed Adversity Awakening, the game introduces a new element called Instant Awakening where players can go into awakening mode at any point during the battle, even in the middle of a combo. The downside of being in an Instant Awakened state is that it depletes a player's max chakra amount. If a player depletes their chakra capacity completely while in an Instant Awakening, they will have to wait for a period before being able to charge their chakra (though in Guy and Lee's case, they have self-inflicted HP drain instead for their Instant Awakenings).

Characters who are awakened can now be grabbed or hit by a U2/Ultimate Jutsu, whereas trying to do so in the prior games forces a clashing recoil for both characters akin to an actual clash.

Similar to the
Naruto: Gekitō Ninja Taisen/Clash of Ninja
 Wii games akin to the stage transition mechanic, characters can now be knocked out of the ring, but in this game, unless a support character is sacrificed, this always results in an automatic loss of the match. Also, there is stage destruction in addition to ring outs. There is a new addition in the Team Attack System as the player can now use their support characters to get ready to charge and attack. Also, support characters now have health bars and once their health is depleted, the support player can no longer be used and their body remain on the stage lifeless for a few seconds. If the player has one support character, it has ten health bars. If the player has two support characters, each has five health bars.

Boss battles also make their return to the game. The game also has the return of missions in Konoha during story mode. The story mode also features mob battles, similar to
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Impact
. There is a new system known as "The Ultimate Decision", where players are able to follow two different paths in the game which are the Legend and Hero paths. Legend path is mostly difficult in battles while Hero path is the opposite. Choosing a path gives a player good amount of points on the chosen path if the battle is completed.

However, a majority of intricate mechanics that used to be in the games before this one have been somewhat nerfed and/or awkwardly balanced:

Hitstun on all attacks are adjusted, including the air chakra dash which is made to be more angle-dependent.

Thus, while it is still possible to loop a perfectly-performed downwards air chakra dash on an opponent endlessly provided if they cannot escape with a Body Replacement Technique (allowing for a large range of followups in all other cases), there are times the hitstun will fail to register and can cause the opposition to be able to block it far sooner than before if performed at an awkward angle.

The original ninja dash also by this proxy no longer generates as much hitstun.

A double jump is now added, which somewhat conflicts with the original ninja move input.

A majority of chakra ninja tool throws that used to have knockdown, stunning and/or staggering hit effects have been severely nerfed, only inflicting the amount of hitstun akin to a standard ninja tool throw.

Ninja item tags accessed with the D-Pad that inflict status effects no longer do so when blocked, unlike in
Generations
.

Tilt/mid-ranged attacks can no longer cancel into a ninja move or a neutral jump, effectively nerfing some characters who relied on such moves.

Both neutral jump and ninja move cancels (and likewise the Hollow Step) now occur immediately without buffering towards an animation's end.

The Body Replacement metre now recharges slightly faster more.

Characters can no longer customise their ninja item sets, and some ninja items have been removed.

Some characters now have more notably-re-balanced frame data across their attacks, as well as questionable physics changes on attacks such as Pain's
Shinra Tensei
 or moves with newly-added invincibility frames in their startup or in unexpected animation frames.

All in-game hitboxes are replaced with generic mesh colliders, causing many more back hits to be present.

A new mechanic called a "Relay" is added. Upon holding the close-range/basic attack button akin to the first
Storm
 game's Ultimate Impact attack, the user jumps backward and flashes yellow (different from the Spark Cancel), spending chakra meter. Releasing the button from there causes them to break into a fast dash.

Upon connecting with this dash, you are prompted to call one of your supports to trigger their close-range up string finisher (which skips over their intro-close-range/neutral string inputs entirely). Upon the said up string finisher being completed, you can then call the other support to trigger their air string to finish off the Relay.

The said yellow spark during a Relay can be cancelled into a block/guard, as well as being able to cancel a close-range attack of any sort into a Relay itself.

Development

Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
 was first announced by Namco Bandai Games in June 2012 in the manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump. With the official announcement, Yusuke Sasaki from Namco Bandai promised improvements regarding the fighting system and the story mode. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama also promised the return of "epic boss battles" that were absent in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations
.

In August 2012, CyberConnect2 started a new suggestion form in their official website, requesting players from all over the world their opinions regarding what they would like to see in Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 and upcoming Naruto games they would release. In July 2012, Comic-Con International, Namco Bandai Games America representatives confirmed plans for a Spring 2013 release in North America.

In October 28, London MCM Expo, CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama announced a card edition, a poster, a Naruto DLC
Goku
 costume, the original Naruto Storm 3 soundtrack, the Naruto Storm 3 game, a figurine by Banpresto, and a Naruto edition and a Sasuke edition. They also stated that those who pre-order will get five free downloadable costumes, including Armoured Naruto. This game is rated T for Teen. There is a "violent imagery" filter that can be turned on or off, for people under 13.

In January 4, 2013, Hiroshi Matsuyama announced that there will be over 80 playable characters.

In July 4, 2013,
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst
 was announced by Namco Bandai Games Europe, containing material of the original with enhanced cinematics, all released DLC including the new "Final Episode of the Uchiha Brothers" DLC, which expands the game's story and adds
Kabuto Yakushi
's
Sage Mode
 form to the character roster and 100 additional missions in the story. Owners of the console game will be able to download the new content as a DLC pack.

On October 22, 2013,
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst
 was released.

Non-Canon Game Ending

As the war was still on-going at the time, a non-canon ending to the story was made.

Defeated,
Tobi
,
Madara
 and
Kabuto
 fall back, thus giving victory to the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. The
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 shinobi return to their villages while
Kage
 discuss on preparing for a counter-attack against Madara's group along with bettering the peace between them and their countries. Naruto is congratulated for his victory upon awakening from his battle with Tobi in
Konoha
 and is spurred by the spirits of his parents to join his friends.

Sasuke, however, leaves the Mountain's Graveyard to find Naruto.

Reception

The game shipped over 2 million copies worldwide by August 2014, with over 1 million copies shipped in the Americas, 750,000 copies shipped in Europe and 250,000 copies shipped in Japan.

Famitsu gave the game a score of 10/10/10/9 (39/40) while IGN gave it a 8.6 rating.

Glitches

There was a glitch during the Five Kage vs. Madara battle. Once A and Ōnoki use their
combi
nation
 against Madara, the sound of electricity continues in the background for the rest of the battle. This has been fixed in the latest patch.

There appears to be a glitch that occurs when the player has a
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations
 save file before playing. Any character unlocked via the save file will not be able to unlock different support types such as attack, guard and balance. However, if the player downloads a DLC that contains a costume for a character without all 3 support types, they will get the 3 support types for that character. This has been fixed in the latest patch.

Similar to
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations
, non-playable characters can be made playable through manipulation of game data. In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
, the reincarnated Kage can be made playable through this method, but their movesets are incomplete and only available in the campaign.

In Ultimate Adventure via Collections, if the player play A's
ultimate technique
 only his technique will be shown, but not himself executing the technique. This has been fixed in the latest patch.

Sometimes, if Kurotsuchi and/or a puppet master is used, the player's opponent will be unable to move.

There is another glitch that involves Kakuzu and Hidan. If the player select either Kakuzu or Hidan's "Attack" support type and in the match and cause a "Strike Back" with either character, their voices will be switched (Kakuzu having Hidan's voice and Hidan having Kakuzu's voice).

When fighting as Kakuzu there is a slight glitch with his shadow where it doesn't update properly when the player reaches the end of an unconnected combo (his arm stays elongated).

In story mode, when the player goes back and replays the fight "Tears in the Final Valley" or "Crimson Rampage", the item hotpad will still appear on screen even though the characters can't use them. An additional glitch is when the player tries to use any item that is thrown (ex. paper bomb) it will not display the animation however if the player jumps and tries to use the item the player will begin to fly (the character bobs up and down as long as the player is spamming the button).

If a character receives damage at the same time as initiating their Ultimate Jutsu, the user's character will have its eyes closed and/or will be gritting his/her teeth (that is, if the animation shows the character's face).

If Eternal Mangekyō Sasuke is hit with Itachi's Amaterasu attack while Sasuke is performing his Ultimate attack, Sasuke's character is coloured all black with only his Eternal Mangekyō visible, glowing in the dark.

Some characters lose their downloadable content costumes during certain situations. Examples include Jiraiya in Sage Mode and Naruto in Chakra Mode, losing their costumes upon transformation and returning once the awakening ends. Danzō and A also lose their Kage hats when they activate their awakenings in addition to losing them during their ultimate techniques.

During the Battle of the Five Kage, there is a glitch during the button mashing stage when
Tsunade
 is about to help the Raikage that does not allow you to complete the rest of the game on the PC only.

Trivia

Hiroshi Matsuyama, president of CyberConnect2, mentioned in an interview that, other than Hiruzen Sarutobi, there would be no characters from Part I. This is not true, due to the fact that Hashirama Senju, Tobirama Senju, and Kimimaro are playable, as well as the Part I iterations of Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, Neji, Lee, Hinata and Gaara. However, it was revealed that what Matsuyama said was mistranslated, and that he meant that not all of the Part I characters would return in
Storm 3
.

In the story mode when
Naruto Uzumaki
 meets the other
jinchūriki
 and
tailed beasts
,
Utakata
 asks if Naruto remembers him when introducing himself, referencing a
filler arc
 in the anime, where the two jinchūriki had previously met. This only happens in the English version however, as the Japanese audio makes no mention of a prior meeting.

This is one of the first Naruto games to be in Stereoscopic Digital 3D next to
Naruto SD Powerful Shippūden
 and
Naruto Shippūden 3D: The New Era
.

While wearing the Goku costume, Naruto's
Rasengan
 and
Sage Art: Many Ultra-Big Ball Spiralling Serial Spheres
 techniques are used in a similar matter to the
Kamehameha
 and
Father-Son Kamehameha
 respectively, though the latter's Secret Action extends to "Armoured" Naruto as well.

While wearing the School Uniform and Road to Ninja costumes, Sasuke's sword is not shown. Instead, whenever he uses his sword in his attacks, it appears through a summoning and will disappear after his attack ends.

While wearing the Anbu and School Uniform costumes, Kakashi doesn't have his Konoha forehead protector to cover his Sharingan. Whenever he activates his awakening, it's shown that he pulls nothing.

At the start and end of Naruto's fight with the Tailed Beasts in Tailed Beast Mode,
Tobi
 is not seen with his
gunbai
.

Certain characters had their movesets changed from previous games, with changes such as having faster combos (e.g Part I Naruto), decreasing the number of hits in a combo (e.g Part I Sasuke and Part I Neji), and combining combos from previous games, due to the
side
 combo being removed (e.g Minato).

Despite fighting against Sasuke, A doesn't get his left forearm burned by the latter's
Amaterasu: Flame Wrapping Fire
 let alone chop it off to save himself from getting burned. As a result, A still has both arms when he appears later on.

When Ōnoki flew high in the sky to stop Madara's Tengai Shinsei meteorites, and took damage from stopping them, his outfit wasn't damaged.

In the game, Sakura was on the front lines as a member of the
Third Division
 with Might Guy, Rock Lee, and Kakashi, while in both the manga and anime, she is with the medical team.

In the game, Sai, Omoi, and Zaji are absent in fighting alongside the
Third Division
. Whereas in both the manga and anime, he is present.

The Portuguese translation of the game is infamous for having a considerable number of grammatical errors and sentences that do not make sense.
