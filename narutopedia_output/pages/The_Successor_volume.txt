The Successor
 (
受け継ぐ者
,
Uketsugumono
,
Viz:
 Successor) is volume 19 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 163

"
The Undecayed…!!
" (
朽ちぬもの…!!
,
Kuchinumono…!!
)

Tsunade
 approaches
Orochimaru
 and prepares to heal him. At the last moment, they are stopped by
Kabuto
. Having full confidence in Kabuto's loyalty, Orochimaru realises that Tsunade was about to betray him. Kabuto explains that her jutsu was filled with
killing intent
 that he, a
medical-nin
, could pick up on. Tsunade does not deny it, saying that she had longed to see
Dan
 and
Nawaki
 again. However,
Naruto
 had caused her to remember how much they loved
Konoha
. Knowing that Orochimaru was lying when he said he would spare the village, she couldn't bring herself to bring back her loved ones at the cost of destroying what they held precious. Intending to prevent Orochimaru from ever harming the village again, Tsunade attacks.

Chapter 164

"
Medical Specialist!!
" (
医療忍者!!
,
Supesharisuto!!
)

Because
Orochimaru
 is unable to fight in his current state,
Kabuto
 battles
Tsunade
 in his place. He informs Orochimaru that
Jiraiya
 is nearby and likely en route, so they relocate. Jiraiya,
Shizune
, and
Naruto
 just miss them, but pick up the trail. Unskilled with
taijutsu
 and otherwise outmatched, Kabuto tries to end the battle quickly. He damages Tsunade's chest to disable her while keeping her alive, but she shirks it off and attacks him. He recovers and attempts to take advantage of her fear of blood, but Jiraiya and the others appear between them.

Chapter 165

"
Naruto, Attack!!
" (
ナルト、突撃っ!!
,
Naruto, Totsugeki!!
)

Wishing to finish the fight by herself,
Tsunade
 charges passed
Jiraiya
.
Kabuto
 slits his own wrist to cover her in his blood, immobilising her due to her fear of blood.
Naruto
 is confused, having considered Kabuto a friend the last time they saw each other. Kabuto informs him that he is an
Otogakure
 spy. He adds that he is disappointed with Naruto, as he makes unimpressive use of the
Nine-Tails
 and doesn't even compare to
Sasuke
. Angry, Naruto attacks him, intending to take advantage of Kabuto's injured arm, but he is easily repelled. Kabuto then heals himself. They all split up;
Shizune
 will fight Kabuto, while Jiraiya will fight
Orochimaru
, and Naruto will protect Tsunade since Orochimaru and Kabuto are out of his league. Orochimaru, with Kabuto's help, summons two
snakes
 and Jiraiya tries to summon a
toad
. Still under the effects of Tsunade's drug, he only manages to summon
Gamakichi
.

Chapter 166

"
The Abilities of the Shinobi…!!
" (
忍の才能…!!
,
Shinobi no Sainō…!!
)

With
Jiraiya
 unable to fully control his
chakra
,
Naruto
 tries to summon a
toad
 larger than
Gamakichi
 for him to use. He can only summon
Gamatatsu
, Gamakichi's younger brother.
Orochimaru
 and
Kabuto
, each riding a
snake
, attack. Jiraiya is able to trap Orochimaru's in a swamp, but Kabuto's manages to catch Naruto in its mouth. As Naruto struggles to escape, Kabuto fights
Shizune
 and quickly subdues her. He then turns his attention to the still-paralysed
Tsunade
. Jiraiya and Orochimaru exchange blows but, being unable to do much to each other, discuss their respective interests. Orochimaru says that nobody can compare to
Sasuke
, an
Uchiha
, but Jiraiya says that natural skills do not compare to someone with Naruto's determination. At that moment, Naruto blocks Kabuto's attack.

Chapter 167

"
As Promised…!!
" (
約束通り…!!
,
Yakusokudōri…!!
)

Naruto
 tries to hit
Kabuto
 with his incomplete
Rasengan
. Because Naruto needs a linear, lunging motion to use it, Kabuto easily avoids it and injures his leg. He tells Naruto that his hopes of winning and his dreams for the future are impossible, which
Tsunade
 realises sounds just like what she said to Naruto a week earlier. Because he does not care about predictions or leg injuries, Naruto stands up and reminds Tsunade of their bet: if he can master the Rasengan in a week, he gets the
First Hokage's Necklace
. He creates a
shadow clone
, which Kabuto attacks. Naruto catches Kabuto and holds his hand to stop him from escaping. The shadow clone assists him with the Rasengan's formation, ensuring that the swirling chakra is contained in a sphere, and then Naruto strikes Kabuto with it.

Chapter 168

"
Just Once More
" (
もう一度だけ
,
Mō Ichido Dake
)

Kabuto
 is flung back by the perfected
Rasengan
. Kabuto is able to stand up after the attack while
Naruto
 collapses, Kabuto having damaged his heart at the last second. Though initially confident his medical expertise has saved him from the worst of the damage, Kabuto finds that his injuries are too great and collapses.
Tsunade
 rushes to Naruto's side and tries to heal him, vowing to not let him die in his pursuit of the title of
Hokage
 like
Dan
 and
Nawaki
 did. Kabuto insists he is doomed but Naruto, healed, grasps the
First Hokage's Necklace
 he has now won before losing consciousness. Putting faith in another's dreams once more, Tsunade puts the necklace around him.
Orochimaru
, seeing Naruto's success against Kabuto as a potential concern for the future, tries to kill him, but Tsunade blocks the attack with her own body.

Chapter 169

"
Risking One's Life…!!
" (
命を懸ける…!!
,
Inochi o Kakeru…!!
)

Having inflicted a fatal injury upon
Tsunade
,
Orochimaru
 asks why she would give her life to protect
Naruto
. Tsunade, shaking at the sight of her own blood, responds that it was to protect
Konoha
, as Naruto will someday be its
Hokage
. Orochimaru scoffs at the title, saying that Hokage is for fools who want to die. Reminded of what she said to Naruto a week earlier, Tsunade tells him that she will now be one of those fools, accepting the position of Fifth Hokage for herself. Orochimaru delivers a finishing blow and then tries to do the same to Naruto, but Tsunade again blocks the attack. She overcomes her fear of blood and counterattacks, throwing him back and healing her injuries with
Creation Rebirth
. With the battle escalating, the
Sannin
 each perform their largest summon.

Chapter 170

"
A Three-Way Deadlock of Offence and Defence!!
" (

 say hello to their father; Tsunade has Katsuyu take
Naruto
 to
Shizune
; Manda threatens Orochimaru. Declaring this to be the last meeting of the
Sannin
, Jiraiya and Tsunade attack Orochimaru. Despite their efforts, Manda's speed allows Orochimaru to avoid their attacks. As Manda is about to bite Gamabunta, Tsunade appears and uses Gamabunta's giant sword to seal his mouth closed and pin him to the ground. Orochimaru wraps his tongue around her neck in an effort to strangle her, but Tsunade grabs the tongue to bring Orochimaru to her, punching him in the face.

Chapter 171

" (

Uketsugumono
)

Orochimaru
 falls to the ground.
Manda
, humiliated, promises to kill Orochimaru the next time they meet before disappearing. Orochimaru regroups with
Kabuto
 and tells Tsunade that, even if she won't heal his arms, he has one other way of regaining the ability to perform
techniques
. Tsunade and
Jiraiya
 see that his face has been torn away, revealing someone else underneath. He and Kabuto flee. Jiraiya is too injured to follow and Tsunade, having expended all of her
chakra
, loses her youthful appearance. They take Naruto back to
Tanzaku Quarters
 to rest. When he wakes up he tells Tsunade that she will be a terrible
Hokage
. Tsunade challenges him to a fight and Naruto is once again out-classed. Rather than defeat him, Tsunade kisses him on the forehead. They head back to
Konoha
, Tsunade is confident Naruto will someday be a wonderful Hokage.

Author's Note

“

Naruto
 has been going for four years already. And, if I say so myself, I think I've worked pretty hard... So I thought to myself, feeling pretty good about it out on the porch. I'll keep giving it my best in year five!
