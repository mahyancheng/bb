While focusing their chakra into their sword while still sheathed, the user performs a
Battōjutsu
 strike. From this, the user unleashes a powerful shockwave which becomes a massive tornado surrounding them, repelling everything in the area near the user. Powerful as the technique is, it is not without drawbacks. It takes time and focus to unleash the technique. It is also very chakra-taxing, making it only usable once in a given day. Finally, the technique is also potentially dangerous to the user, as loss of control can potentially cause as much harm to the user as all other targets around them.
