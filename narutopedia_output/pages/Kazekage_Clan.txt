This
shinobi
 clan from
Sunagakure
 holds high influential authority in its village.
 Its true family name is unknown.

Overview

Not much is known about the clan, with the exception that it has produced several notable members who have held positions of high authority, including the
Fourth
 and
Fifth Kazekage
, and the village's
ambassador
, as well as the fact that it was led by Rasa during his lifetime.
 With
Temari
's marriage, the clan, to some extent, has obtained connections with the
Konohagakure
's
Nara Clan
.

Because of Temari's marriage into a Konohagakure family, if Gaara and Kankurō die without leaving children of their own, the position of Kazekage would be open to Temari's children, whom would be categorised as a Konoha-nin. The
Suna Council
 considered this as an undesirable result, thus attempted to coerce Gaara, the Fifth Kazekage, into an arranged marriage to leave an heir. However, some other
extremist members
 would prefer to banish the clan with a frame-up in order to prevent any of them from claiming the bloodline altogether.
