This technique is simply a larger, more powerful version of the
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
 seen only in the video games. Its colour is also different, being orange instead of blue or, in Hinata's case, pink.

Also unlike the version which is Neji's back strong attack (as well as Awakened Hinata's), no counter-trigger is required as it can be performed standalone.
