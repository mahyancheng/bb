Summary

Knowing that not even
Itachi
 could kill the entire
Uchiha clan
 by himself,
Sasuke
 asks who helped him kill their family, planning to kill them too after he is done with Itachi. Itachi doubts that he could do this, but he gives Sasuke the name of
Madara Uchiha
. A founder of
Konoha
, Sasuke asks how Madara could still be alive after so many decades. Itachi reminds him not to be deceived by such facts, having once believed Itachi to be a loving older brother. Angered that he is being patronised with
genjutsu
, Sasuke demands that the real Itachi face him. Itachi responds that, since Sasuke doesn't have a
Mangekyō Sharingan
, there is no reason why he should do so, but agrees to tell him about Madara anyway.
