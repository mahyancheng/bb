This summon is a large bird which has a number of body piercings and the
Rinnegan
, implying that it is being controlled by
Nagato
.

Appearance

The bird itself is unusual, as not only does it demonstrate a prominent and jagged  yellow-coloured beak, but it also features three distinct legs as well as wings. It also has one giant chakra receiver sticking through the right side of its back and another one sticking through the left side of its neck.

Abilities

This summon can move at an incredibly fast speed, and can use that velocity combined with its beak to form powerful dive attacks slamming its beak into its opponent. In the anime, the bird had additional abilities where it could lay a large quantity of eggs that subsequently explode like bombs, and while flying low over
Konoha
 produced dust clouds strewn with lightning in its wake. It is very agile, being able to fly very gracefully.

Part II

Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant

It is summoned briefly during Pain's fight with
Jiraiya
. It is summoned to fight
Gamaken
. It flew over to a in-air Gamaken and attacked him with its beak, Gamaken blocked the attack with his shield. After this, it was hit by one of Jiraiya's
Fire Release
 techniques and was desummoned.

Pain's Assault

He is summoned again to attack
Naruto
 after he uses his perfected
Rasenshuriken
.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

The bird was next summoned by the reincarnated Nagato alongside the
Giant Multi-Headed Dog
 to provide a way for Nagato to move.
Itachi
 soon retreats atop of the bird's head alongside Nagato. Later, after Itachi is freed from
Kabuto
's
control
, he used
Amaterasu
 on both Nagato and the giant bird, incapacitating it and its summoner.

Trivia

This summon's three legs make it reminiscent of
Yatagarasu
, the three-legged crow of Amaterasu, the Shintō goddess of the sun. Ironically, it was defeated by Itachi's Amaterasu technique.

Adding to this, in
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Online
, this bird was called the "
Eight Span Crow
" (
八咫烏
,
Yatagarasu
).

In its first appearance, it was depicted with three legs and two wings. Later, after being summoned by the
reincarnated
 Nagato, it was depicted with four legs and four wings.
