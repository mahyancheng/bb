Hinoe
 (
丙
) is a former member of
Konohagakure
's
Anbu
 faction
Root
.

Background

In the events to follow the
Third Great Shinobi War
, Hinoe accompanied
Danzō Shimura
 to a meeting with
Orochimaru
 after the latter had been passed over for the position as
Hokage
. With nine other Root members, Hinoe received a mission to assassinate Hiruzen Sarutobi before he could be reinstated as Hokage. Disguised as a foreign shinobi, he fought the Anbu accompanying his target, who turned out to be a disguised Kakashi.

Years later, Hinoe and
Hinoto
 were guarding the entrance to the Root chambers when the Anbu members
Yūgao Uzuki
 and
Kakashi Hatake
 showed up with the order to bring Danzō in front of the Hokage. Hinoe told them that he was unsure about Danzō's whereabouts. After Yūgao left, Kakashi revealed his face and
subdued
 Hinoe with his
Sharingan
 when the latter was trying to stop him from entering.

Personality

Hinoe was extremely loyal to Danzō and would do whatever was asked of him.

Appearance

Hinoe is a tall shinobi with messy, short, brown-coloured hair. He wore the standard attire of the Anbu inclusive of a black hooded mantle and a mask that has seven light tannish-coloured markings on it. One mark is a long point coming from the forehead area of the mask with three pointed lines going through it horizontally, next he has two curved but pointed at the end markings on each cheek, then he has a line marking made to resemble a closed mouth and finally he has a large spike-like marking starting from the bottom of the mask near the chin area and ending directly under the mouth marking.

Abilities

As a part of the Anbu, Hinoe is most likely a powerful shinobi. He was seen wielding both a
sword
 and a
bō
, indicating that he is skilled with both.
