"
Danger! Sage Mode Limit Reached
" (
危機! 消えた仙人モード
,
Pinchi! Kieta Sennin Mōdo
) is episode 164 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto hurls his
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
 at the
five Paths
 of
Pain
, who attempt to get out of its range. However, Naruto expands the Rasenshuriken at the last moment, and the attack destroys Pain's
Human Path
. Shortly after, Pain notices that Naruto's
senjutsu
 is beginning to wane. Knowing that Naruto cannot fight the remaining four due to all four sharing the same
Rinnegan
 vision,
Shima
 creates a
dust cloud
 to obscure Pain's vision;
Fukasaku
 uses his senjutsu to hurl
Gamabunta
 in Naruto's direction, and the giant toad swallows both Naruto and Pain's
Animal Path
. With the other Paths unable to see through the dust cloud and the Animal Path unable to see inside Gamabunta's mouth, Naruto uses his remaining senjutsu to form his
Spiralling Serial Spheres
 and rams it at the Animal Path, destroying it. Gamabunta then regurgitates the destroyed Path as well as Naruto, whose
Sage Mode
 is deactivated as he has run out of
natural energy
.

The
Deva Path
 begins to attack Naruto, believing it to be an easy fight now that Naruto is not in Sage Mode. Naruto tosses his
scroll
 to Fukasaku, who
summons
 a Naruto
shadow clone
 that was gathering natural energy back at
Mount Myōboku
. Naruto then dispels the clone and absorbs the clone's gathered senjutsu, reverting back to his Sage Mode and resuming his fight against Pain. Fukasaku explains to Shima that since they could not fuse with him due to the
Nine-Tails
 rejecting them, Naruto had come up with that creative, ingenious solution to circumvent Sage Mode's five minute duration. Naruto forms another Rasenshuriken and hurls it towards the Deva Path, since
Katsuyu
 reveals to Naruto that he is unable to use any techniques at the moment. However, the technique is absorbed by
Preta Path
. Naruto wonders how the Preta Path is able to move, since he knocked it out with his
Frog Kata
, and realises that Pain's
Outer Path
 is able to reanimate the bodies using its
King of Hell
 technique. Knowing that his victory rests on destroying the Outer Path, Naruto forms a strategy.

Naruto creates two shadow clones and has them form a
Rasengan
 in each of his hands, and then has the clones drop a pellet of red smoke. One of his shadow clones then transforms into the Rasenshuriken as the other clone throws it in the Deva Path's direction, knowing that the Preta Path would catch it and attempt to absorb it. The fake Rasenshuriken promptly reverts back to its shadow clone form just before the Preta Path can catch it, and since that Path's weakness is physical attacks, the Path is easily subdued. Naruto then throws the real Rasenshuriken through the red smoke towards the Deva Path, who does not have anyone guarding his front anymore. However, Pain has regained his abilities and proceeds to use his
Shinra Tensei
 to repel and dissipate the attack. In spite of that, the real Naruto, who had jumped into the air through the guise of the smoke, lands on the Outer Path, using his Spiralling Serial Spheres to destroy it, surprising Gamabunta, Fukasaku and Shima. The Naruto that attacked the Preta Path prepares to kill it, only for Pain, whose five second interval has passed, to use Shinra Tensei again to repel both Naruto and his shadow clone, as well as Gamabunta,
Gamahiro
 and
Gamaken
. With the three giant toads defeated, Naruto is left to fight the two remaining Paths alone.
