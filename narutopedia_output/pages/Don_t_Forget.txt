Naruto
 manga.

Summary

The
Sound Four
 remark that
Orochimaru
 is wasting his time with
Sasuke
. Sasuke activates his
cursed seal
 in an effort to prove them wrong, but they are unimpressed since they have greater control over their own cursed seals. They remind him of his desire to kill
Itachi
 and promise that Orochimaru could give him the strength he needs, improving his cursed seal being only one of many possibilities. They leave Sasuke to pick between Orochimaru and
Konoha
, and Sasuke reaches a decision. Elsewhere,
Lee
 reflects on his dreams of becoming a splendid ninja that excels in
taijutsu
. As he remembers the confidence
Guy
 has always had in him, Guy comes to see him.
