Chūnin Re-Examination Arc

As the Land of Calm Seas was ravaged by an epidemic, a medical-nin found cheap and quick-acting treatment to help the population. The greedy daimyō sent out Kurobane and his brother to destroy the treatment so he could continue using his slower method of treating people to make more money. One after another, the brothers were able to track down the medical-nin's students, securing their medical samples and killing them. The final target was
Mozuku
, who hired
Konoha-nin
 as bodyguards. Kurobane was able to secure the medical samples and left while leaving Jujumaru to deal with the targets. Kawaki and Mozuku caught up with him, so he used his illusory mist to deal confuse and drain them while he attacked from a safe distance. Kawaki was able to read through his tactic and hit him dispelling the mist. However, Kurobane was still able to manipulate his sword, and used it to attack Kawaki, though Mozuku protected him, getting fatally injured. Boruto and Shikadai arrived, destroying his sword and preventing him from escaping, allowing Kawaki to thoroughly pummel him.
