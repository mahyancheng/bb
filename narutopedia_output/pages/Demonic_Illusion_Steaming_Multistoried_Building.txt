A wide-range genjutsu (
広範囲幻術
,
kōhan'i genjutsu
,
literally meaning:
 wide-range illusion technique), whereby
Gengetsu
, in tandem with his
Giant Clam
, is able to manifest realistic mirages by manipulating the light reflecting off the steam that it produces.

Overview

As it is impossible for observers to distinguish from the real thing through normal methods, this technique is ideal for concealing the actual location of either individual, resulting in confusion amongst the opposition as their attacks are rendered ineffective as they attempt to ascertain the pair's true positions. Because the clam can continually produce steam from its
siphons
,
 Gengetsu's illusions can last indefinitely.

According to Gengetsu, the only method to end the technique is to defeat the real clam, stopping it from producing steam. But as the creature itself remains camouflaged within the mirage, this is no easy task, even if the summoner is providing beneficial advice. While the technique is in effect, both Gengetsu and the clam cannot be
sensed
 through
traditional
 means, with the exception of
contact type methods
.
