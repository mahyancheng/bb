Background

The Spirit Beast was once a normal giant catfish that had the ability to mould chakra. At some point, it was sealed away within the Valley of Evil.

Appearance

The Spirit Beast took the form of a gigantic purple catfish with arms and many crab-like legs. It had yellow eyes and long barbels. It wore a large green beaded necklace around its neck and had markings on its body. One of its most distinguishing features was its extra mouth, located above its main mouth and below its eyes.

Abilities

The Spirit Beast uses its evil chakra to take control of people's actions.

Plot Overview

The Spirit Beast had been sealed away deep in a cave located in the Valley of Evil. Genshō and his followers unsealed it, causing it to unleash a dark fog that poisoned the minds of those who entered it. Within seven days, the fog would have spread far enough to reach
Konohagakure
. Genshō planned to use the beast to destroy the world and start civilisation anew with him as the ruler.
Naruto
 and his group of
Suna
 and Konoha ninja attempted to seal it using the five spirit mirrors, but failed when Genshō, in a last ditch effort, fused himself with the beast. The group battled the large beast, defeating and presumably killing it once and for all.
