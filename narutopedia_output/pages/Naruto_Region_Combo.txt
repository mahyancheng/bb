The
Naruto Region Combo
 is a taijutsu attack used by Naruto Uzumaki while having Six Paths Sage Mode and Nine-Tails Chakra Mode active at the same time. The attack, enhanced by Six Paths Senjutsu, is the strongest taijutsu in his arsenal. After using his Multiple Shadow Clone Technique, Naruto creates an army of clones to assault his opponent, overwhelming them by attacking on all sides while yelling "U-ZU-MA-KI". The rest of the clones then follow up with a direct attack to finish the combo.
