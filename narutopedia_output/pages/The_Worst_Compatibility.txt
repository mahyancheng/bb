Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Naruto
, angry that
Lee
 only wants to fight
Sasuke
, tries to prove himself by attacking Lee. He is quickly defeated. Impressed by Lee's abilities, Sasuke agrees to fight him. When he is left unable to keep up with Lee's movements, Sasuke suspects it is some sort of
ninjutsu
 or
genjutsu
 and so activates his
Sharingan
. Because Lee is using
taijutsu
, the Sharingan does not help since Sasuke lacks the physical training to replicate Lee's attacks. Lee prepares to use his
Front Lotus
 on Sasuke but is stopped by
Ningame
.
