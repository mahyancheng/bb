This is an unnamed
kinjutsu
 which was passed down through generations in
Iwagakure
.

Overview

This technique allows the user to knead chakra into materials. By doing so the object can be shaped, animated, and controlled remotely. On command, the object's size can also be manipulated — from nano-sized to gigantic heights.

Once the user infuses their chakra into an object, it can become a source of origin for a technique. Deidara stole this technique in his quest to find the ultimate art and used it in conjunction with his
Explosion Release

kekkei genkai
 to infuse explosive chakra into clay, creating his signature
Explosive Clay
. Sekiei, a
fabrication
, was given both the
nature transformation
 and this technique to utilise it in the same way.

Trivia

It is likely that the mouths on Deidara's palms and chest are the result of using this technique, though Sekiei didn't seem to possess them.
