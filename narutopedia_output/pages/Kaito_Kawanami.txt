Chūnin Re-Examination Arc

Chūnin Re-Examination Arc

Following
Isshiki
's attack, Naruto decided to host another Chūnin Exam to both boost morale and promote capable shinobi. Kaito and his team passed the written exam. During the second exam, Kaito sabotaged Boruto, having placed a tracker on him at the start of the exam so he could leverage Boruto's effort in rescuing an ally for himself. However, he fell of a ledge after being surprised by a bear and injured himself. Unwilling to abandon him, Boruto carried Kaito in addition of his ally, causing him to miss the time limit placed on the exam. Despite this, Boruto passed the exam, as they were being judged by overall performance, and his unwillingness to abandon an injured ally secured his passing.
