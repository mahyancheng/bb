 manga.

Summary

Not wanting
Gaara
 to fight by himself,
Lee
 tries to help and attacks
Kimimaro
 to try and provide an opening for him. Gaara restrains him and instructs him to not interfere, saying he doesn't need the help, especially from someone in Lee's condition. Kimimaro, seeing that Gaara does not rely on
taijutsu
 like his two opponents, contemplates how to respond. He is quickly captured with Gaara's sand and crushed, but by activating the first stage of his
cursed seal
 and strengthening his bones, he avoids death. Gaara tries once more, using even more sand to crush Kimimaro and the surrounding area, but Kimimaro again survives.
