Synopsis

Shikamaru
 and
Yurito
 handle documents for
Kakashi
. Kakashi tells them they should take a break sometimes. During a break, Shikamaru looks at the clouds, and Yurito asks if he gets bored with a desk job. Yurito tells him he sounds like an old man sometimes. At the end of the day, Shikamaru and Kakashi discuss how things have changed during peace times, and how Shikamaru is doing a desk job so he can help
Naruto
 become
Hokage
 in the future. Kakashi invites Shikamaru to eat, but Shikamaru has a game scheduled with
Ōnoki
. At the game, Shikamaru beats him. Later that night, Shikamaru trains.
 During the day, Shikamaru performs his duties as Kakashi's aide. Shikamaru arrives late for barbecue with
Ino
 and
Chōji
, where they discuss what they've been up to. Shikamaru says he has to leave for
Shinobi Union
 business. On a Shinobi Union meeting, Shikamaru is asked about the drop in mission requests, but says it's still being investigated. Later,
Temari
 tries getting more information out of him, but when he evades her questions, she slaps him. Shikamaru informs Kakashi Temari is growing suspicious of him, and that their independent investigation on the
Land of Silence
 could lead to Shinobi Union intervention due to rogue and missing shinobi potentially undertaking illegal missions there. They finally receive word from
Sai
, who left to infiltrate the Land of Silence. Sai's report gets them worried, and Shikamaru requests two
Anbu
 to accompany him to the Land of Silence. Shikamaru is introduced to
Rō
 and
Hinoko
, who were selected based on Shikamaru's mention of preferred abilities. Shikamaru visits his father's and
Asuma
's graves. At Asuma's grave, he is met by
Kurenai
,
Mirai
