Kigiri
 (
鬼霧
) was a
shinobi
 from
Otogakure
 and a member of
Team Guren
.

Personality

Kigiri, like some of his teammates, wanted nothing to do with Orochimaru and wished to flee. He appeared quite laid-back compared to other members of the group. Also, he addressed
Rinji
 as
Aniki
 (
兄貴
,
literally meaning:
 Brother) on occasion. He was doubtful of Guren's promise to him and the others. He feared death and wouldn't run into a fight recklessly. In addition, he seemed to enjoy playing cards with others and disliked getting wet.

Appearance

Kigiri had medium-length dull-purple hair and grey eyes. He wore a black cloak with a black under-shirt under with lavender pants and sandals. His most recognisable feature was the gas mask he wore which covered the lower-half of his face.

Abilities






Kigiri using the Multiple Smoke Clone technique.



Kigiri's primary battle tactics revolved around the manipulation of smoke. He was able to unleash a powerful and
blinding smokescreen
 for diversionary tactics, though he can also use it to
bind
 his opponent. He was also able to create
solid

clones
 out of smoke to aid him in battle. During his fight with Kakashi, he showed proficiency with
Fire Release
, able to launch
blasts of fire
.






Kigiri's cursed seal activated.



After being given a
cursed seal
 from Kabuto (which was depicted as rectangular designs), it granted him with more chakra and enhanced power. However, the cost of this had a side effect that will tear him from the inside out. This could, however, be prevented with a certain pill.

Part II

Three-Tails' Appearance






Guren's team.



He was one of
Orochimaru
's prisoners that is selected to join forces with
Guren
. Kigiri was later seen in the hideout playing cards with Rinji, albeit having bad luck and complained about the base's ragged condition.

Some time afterwards, Kigiri and the others were sent to deal with
Team Kurenai
. Kigiri used his smokescreens to disable
Kiba Inuzuka
's sense of smell. He later retreats with the others after Guren calls them back so she can deal with them herself. When Guren leaves with
Kabuto Yakushi
 and
Yūkimaru
, he is instructed to stay behind to deal with Team Kurenai and
Team Yamato
. After the tidal wave he complained to Rinji about not being told about the
Three-Tails
' involvement in the mission. Kigiri also said he wasn't going to risk his life over capturing the beast.






Kigiri evades Lee.



Later, Kigiri and the others, with the exception of Gozu, ended up fighting Yamato,
Rock Lee
, Kiba, and
Tenten
. Yamato restrained Kigiri with his Wood technique, but when Lee attacked him, it turned out to be an smoke clone and Kigiri traped Lee in his smokescreen. Lee, remembering what Guy told him about sensing the enemy with his heart, was able to detect his enemies and attacked
Kihō
. When Kigiri and
Nurari
 tried to counter, Tenten used her weapons to keep them in the smoke and then used
explosive tags
 attached to
kunai
 to stun them, after which Kiba and
Akamaru
 finished Kigiri and the others off with the
Fang Passing Fang
, knocking all three of them into the sky. While managing to survive, he along with the rest of his team found themselves heavily injured.






Kigiri attacks Kakashi.



Kabuto took advantage of Kigiri's condition to convince him he needed surgery immediately to survive, which forcibly activated a cursed seal. Following Kabuto's orders, Kigiri and his team once again attacked the
Konoha
 ninja with more confidence than ever. He and his team managed to take down the primary defence team and capture Yūkimaru. Afterwards, Kigiri and his team saw this as an opportunity to escape Orochimaru's grasp, only to learn that their Cursed Marks would kill them if not properly handled. Fearing death, Kigiri and his team attacked the sealing team with Kigiri facing off against
Kakashi
. Kakashi kills Kigiri with his Lightning Cutter after tricking Kigiri into thinking he captured him. After his death, Nurari
merges
 with him and Kihō into a monster who fought against Kakashi and the others. As they were about to be killed by Kakashi, the merged trio soon met their demise at the rampaging
Three-Tails
.

Trivia

Kigiri was shown fighting Kiba in the
fourth opening
, but this never occured, as he fell to Kakashi before anything happened.

Kigiri's clothing and mouth piece are similar to what is worn by some
Amegakure
 ninja. His mouthpiece is also similar to that of the
Demon Brothers
 of
Kirigakure
.

Another indicator of a connection with Kirigakure would be his name, 鬼霧. 鬼 means
"ghost"
 or
"devil"
, and 霧 means
"fog"
 and is the same kanji used in writing Kirigakure (
霧隠
). Thus, his name would mean something like
"devil fog"
.
