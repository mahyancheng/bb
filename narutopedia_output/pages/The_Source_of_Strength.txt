Summary

Yamato
's
wood clone
 examines what appears to be
Sai
's corpse. While meant to look as though Sai has been killed to prevent
Orochimaru
 from being followed, the wood clone determines that it is a fake and continues on its way. The rest of
Team 7
 follows as well, but must take a break because of
Sakura
's injury. Although Sakura does not want
Naruto
 to know that he gave her the injury, Yamato secretly tells him. He encourages Naruto not to rely on the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 if he really wants to protect his friends. While resting, Sakura looks at Sai's picture book.
