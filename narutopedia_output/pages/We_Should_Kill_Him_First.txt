Viz:
 We Ought to Kill Him) is chapter 684 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Sakura
 realises that
Obito
 was willing to die so easily because he was beyond saving but soon casts aside these thoughts when the
Uchiha
 calls her, and
Naruto
's clone forth. Though
Kaguya
 notes their presence, she pays little to no attention to them on the battlefield and instead opts to attack the real Naruto.
 As Naruto contemplates his next course of action, he settles on a combination of diversionary tactics and taijutsu.
Kokuō
 lends Naruto support with its steam-based ninjutsu bolstering Naruto's physical attacks to monstrous levels. Shocked that she was being pressured in
her own dimension
, Kaguya emerges from the rubble to find herself surrounded by a barrage of
shadow clones
. Assaulted from all sides, Kaguya is forced to retreat to another dimension — an opportunity which Naruto and Obito take to invade her dimension. Sensing the invaders,
Black Zetsu
 advises his mother to kill Naruto rather than give him the opportunity to reunite with
Sasuke
 and seal her. Though hesitant at first, she ultimately agrees with this advise and uses her All-Killing Ash Bones technique which strikes Naruto and begins to disintegrate his body. Believing that now the clones would be gone as well, she returns to her ice-clad dimension to find the clones still there much to her shock. Meanwhile, Obito and Sakura invade her main dimension, intent on finding Sasuke.
