Sasori uses his
Third Kazekage

human puppet
 to create a wall of
Iron Sand
 in front of him, which he then causes several variable sized spikes to protrude and strikes the opponent.

Trivia

The name of this technique comes from the appearance of the variable sized spikes resembling a mountain range.
