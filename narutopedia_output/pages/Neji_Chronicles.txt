"
Neji Chronicles
" (
ネジ外伝
,
Neji Gaiden
) is episode 192 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Konohamaru
,
Udon
 and
Moegi
 interview
Neji
 about a story related to
Naruto
 for the
Academy
 newspaper, and Neji acquiesces. During the final rounds of the
Chūnin Exams
,
Sunagakure
 and
Otogakure
 teamed up in an effort to destroy
Konohagakure
. Neji was told by
his grandfather
 that two
Kumo Spectators
 decided to take advantage of the chaos by using the opportunity to kidnap
Hinata
, all in a bid to acquire the
Byakugan
.
Tenten
 and
Kiba
 joined Neji as well, Kiba not trusting Neji to actually save Hinata since Neji was known for looking down on her.

After triggering a trap that produced
mud wolves
, Tenten stayed back to deal with them while Neji and Kiba went ahead. After locating Hinata and the Kumo
shinobi
, Kiba and Akamaru used their
Passing Fang
 to interfere; Kiba picked up Hinata and dropped a
Smoke Bomb
 before disappearing. As the Kumo shinobi chased Kiba and Hinata, Kiba turned around and used
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
 on
one
 of them, knocking him out. Kiba was actually Neji, who had used the
Transformation Technique
.
Sekiei
, the remaining Kumo-nin, used his
Earth Release: Earth Flow Wave
 to avoid being struck by Neji's
Gentle Fist
 and attempted to finish him off with his
Violent Heavenly Earth Needle
 technique; however, his attack was blocked by
Hiashi
's
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
.

Hiashi told Neji that he had left the village despite what was going on because both Hinata and Neji were precious to him.
Team Ebisu
 is surprised to hear the story, unaware that such a crisis had happened during the
Konoha Crush
. Neji divulges that sometime after, the two Kumo-nin were apprehended and the situation was dealt internally with
Kumogakure
 to avoid a conflict. The three
genin
 pester Neji to explain what Naruto had to do with the story, and Neji tells them that if Naruto hadn't changed his perspective on life and destiny during their fight, then he may not have agreed to go save Hinata. However, they are unsatisfied with the story and Neji tells them to go ask somebody else for a story about Naruto.

Trivia

The episode is likely the reference to the
omake
 when Neji demanded to have his own special due to his lack of screentime.
