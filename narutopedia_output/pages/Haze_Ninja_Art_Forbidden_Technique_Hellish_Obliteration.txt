The user summons tar-like sludge in the area around them and those caught in the sludge will sink to their deaths. If the targets try to get close to the user, they will sink faster. The user can also form tendrils of the sludge to hold down the victims' limbs or defend themselves.

The downside to the technique is that the user will sink first and once the user dies, the technique will end. The deeper the user sinks, the more injury and pain they will incur. This makes it less likely to kill other targets, making this technique more suitable for stalling than actual combat. However, the user can cancel the technique as long as they're alive.
