Yūgao Uzuki
 (
卯月夕顔
,
Uzuki Yūgao
) is an
Anbu
 of
Konohagakure
.

Background






Yūgao and Kakashi report to Hiruzen.



In the anime, during her childhood, Yūgao was selected to join the Anbu due to her skill in
kenjutsu
 and
sensory abilities
.
 During her early years as an Anbu, Yūgao served under
Kakashi Hatake
, looking up to him as a role model.
 Four years after the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
, Kakashi was ordered to investigate one of the secret labs belonging to
Orochimaru
. Upon returning, Kakashi informed the Third Hokage of a
Root
 member who saved him but would be punished by
Danzō Shimura
 for failing his mission. Hiruzen then gave a letter requesting Danzō to meet with him to Yūgao, who quickly rushed to the Root headquarters. Upon arriving, the guards insisted that Danzō was not there at the moment. Yūgao left to report to Hiruzen, soon after returning with the Hokage in time to save Kakashi and a
Wood Release
 user named "
Kinoe
" from Danzō's punishment.






Yūgao finds the only survivor of the Uchiha clan massacre.



Six years later, when
Itachi Uchiha
 was promoted to Anbu captain and removed from
Team Ro
, Yūgao, much to her delight, was assigned as his replacement under Kakashi's command. Later, Yūgao and her new team were mobilised to investigate the recent
Uchiha Clan Downfall
, where Yūgao found the sole survivor,
Sasuke Uchiha
.
 At some point, Hayate was chosen to be Yūgao's instructor in
kenjutsu
; the time the two of them spent training together eventually led to them falling in love with one another.

Personality

Of the little that has been seen of Yūgao, she seems to be a caring and loyal person. She has also been described as someone that puts herself all into whatever she does and enjoys watching the moon, which might be a pun on the meaning of her name.
 In the anime, it is shown that Hayate's death left an emotional scar on her, leading her to avoid any form of combat until Sakura made her change her mind.

Appearance

Yūgao as a child.
Yūgao as an adult.
1/2

Yūgao is a young woman with straight, purple hair reaching down to her waist, warm brown eyes, and a dark shade of red lipstick. As an Anbu member, Yūgao wears a porcelain mask resembling a cat with three red stripes — one vertical stripe on the forehead and two horizontal stripes, one on each cheek. She also wears the standard Anbu uniform, consisting of black and grey armour, metal arm guards and a katana strapped to her back. She has the signature Anbu tattoo on her right shoulder.

While aiding the Logistical Support and Medical Division during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Yūgao keeps her hair tied in a ponytail, and also wears the standard
Konoha
 infantry
flak jacket
 and assorted clothing, which are hidden underneath a long light blue cloak common amongst the
medical-nin
. However, when engaged in battle, Yūgao reverts to wearing her Anbu uniform.

Abilities

Though her skills are yet to be displayed in the manga, as an Anbu member, Yūgao is a highly skilled
kunoichi
. In the anime, her skills are greatly expanded on. As a young child, Yūgao was allowed to join the Anbu for her talents.

Ninjutsu






Yūgao using the Enclosing Technique to store corpses.



In the anime, Yūgao's skill in
sealing objects into scrolls
 got her assigned to the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
, where she would seal away shinobi corpses. In addition, she would assist in basic medical care, implying some skill in the art. Yūgao is also a proficient tracker and
sensor
, as she was explicitly requested to help retrieve the KIA stolen from her division, and could easily
track down the thieves
.

Kenjutsu






Yūgao using Hazy Moon Night.



While in the manga, her skill in kenjutsu is unknown, the anime expands on this. She carries one of the standard
katana
 of the Anbu. In the anime, it was revealed that she spent years training with Hayate — a skilled kenjutsu expert himself — nearly equaling his proficiency and skill level. She is well-versed in a variety of kenjutsu techniques, including the
Dance of the Crescent Moon
 and the
Hazy Moon Night
, which all allow her to strike with great speed and complex movements that make it difficult for her opponents to react.

 Anbu rendezvoused at the hospital and met with the Third Hokage and Kakashi.
 While discussing the matter,
Hayate
 abruptly barged in after hearing about the attack, but was relieved when he saw Yūgao alive. Afterwards, Hiruzen assigned Hayate the task of tracking down Kabuto, much to Yūgao's concern. Before Hayate left for his mission, Yūgao promised that she would come to Hayate's aid if he needed help and the two promised to always love each other.
 The following morning, she and her Anbu squad discovered Hayate's corpse after he was killed.

 to
tend
 to the villagers. Soon after,

 was spotted and when Tsunade moved to confront him, they followed her as well. After Pain unleashed a large-scale

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Main article:
Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

In the anime, Yūgao was one of the ninja who were working for the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
. She was responsible for the
safekeeping
 of shinobi corpses which carry valuable intel such as their
kekkei genkai
. During the corpse infiltration, Yūgao would meet once again a
reincarnated
 Hayate, who was forced to steal the KIA
scroll
. Much to Yūgao's dismay, she would later on be forced to procure the stolen scroll from
Kabuto Yakushi
's minions.
 They caught up with them and sealed Hayate's comrades but Yūgao was unable to fight with her former lover, so other team members got wounded while protecting her. She then tried to leave, but was stopped by
Sakura Haruno
, who asked her about her inability to fight. She claimed that the only reason she had left the Anbu was because of the loss of Hayate.






Yūgao forced to fight Hayate.



While she originally continued to fight to avenge him, she was eventually pushed to the point of emotionally snapping, forcing her to see a sword as a symbol of his death. Sakura then stated they must fight with this "unforgivable" technique and went to retrieve the scroll on her own, but Yūgao eventually caught up with her. She and Hayate clashed with their Dance of the Crescent Moon techniques and later she used her Hazy Moon Night against his
Secret Sword: Moonlight
. He praised her improvement in kenjutsu, but then Kabuto attempted to take over his consciousness against his will. Hayate seemingly pinned Yūgao to a tree, but thanks to him fighting with control she was unharmed and managed to pierce him. Hayate was later sealed and the mission ended with a success when they retrieved the scroll.

Trivia

"Uzuki" is the old name for the fourth month of the Japanese lunar calendar, while "Yūgao" means "evening face", the term used for a bottle gourd or the ipomoea alba moonflower.

According to the databook(s):

Her hobby is moon viewing.

In the manga, it was
Gazeru
 instead of Yūgao who was guarding Tsunade in the Pain's Assault arc.

There were no indications of Yūgao's inability to fight after Hayate's death in earlier appearances of her in the anime, like the
Pain's Assault
 arc.

In the
anime
, within Tsunade's
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 dream, Yūgao was part of
Root
 and was one of its best members, alongside
Hayate Gekkō
,
Anko Mitarashi
, and
Sai
.
