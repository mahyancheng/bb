Jūgo Arc

Momo and
Sasami
 confronted and prevented
Team 15
 from requesting backup from
Konoha
. Using the opportunity to test their device based cursed seals, they both managed to immobilise
Namida Suzumeno
 and
Wasabi Izuno
 while
Sumire Kakei
 reluctantly escaped with
Nue
. They later disguised themselves as researchers from the
Land of Rivers
 and brought Namida and Wasabi, both infected with the cursed seal, back to the village, informing
Team 7
 that they only found the two members of Team 15 unconscious but did not find Sumire. After the Land of Rivers researchers took custody of the incapacitated
Jūgo
 and the entire village turned against the Konoha-nin, he and his sister stood before Jūgo with the head researcher preparing to experiment on him.






Momo fights Sumire and Nue.



Later, after delighting in watching Wasabi and Namida's suffering from their cursed seals, Momo and Sasami were sent to search for the Konoha shinobi wandering in the forest. As they searched, they noticed "
Sumire
" running by. The siblings quickly pursued her. During the chase, Sasami realised it was a diversion from how their target was deliberately staying just ahead of them. Momo then fell back to the base, intercepting the real Sumire as she escaped with Wasabi and Namida.






Momo defeated by Nue.



Once Momo transformed with his collar, his power proved too much for the genin. Concluding that only Nue's full power would be enough to defeat Momo, Namida and Wasabi offered their chakra to let Nue transform again into its larger form. The gamble proved successful as Sumire and Nue were able to defeat him and destroyed his collar device.
