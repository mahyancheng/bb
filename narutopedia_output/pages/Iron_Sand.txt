Iron Sand
 (
砂鉄
,
Satetsu
,
literally meaning:
 Sand Iron) is the most feared weapon in the history of
Sunagakure
,
 which was developed by the
Third Kazekage
.

Overview

After studying the sand manipulation abilities of
Shukaku
's
jinchūriki
, the Third Kazekage was able to imitate this ability using iron powder instead of sand, and his special
magnetic powers
. He often moulded the iron powder into weapons and used them as part of his main
fighting style
.

When used in sufficient quantities, this iron sand can be equipped in various ways in order to create useful techniques ranging from
large structures
 to
bullet-like particles
 and
multiple striking branches
.
Sasori
 took full advantage of this through the use of his
puppet
 of the Third Kazekage.

The iron sand can also clot up the joints of
puppets
, making them unusable in battle
 as long as the user's magnetic field is in effect, even bypassing a
Chakra Shield
.

Shinki is able to control and change the shape of the iron sand through an
electromagnetic field
.

Being a clone of Shinki,
Ryū
 is able to control iron sand, but instead creates his own through his
Claw Mark
 created clothing,
 which is a combination of iron from his blood mixed with his
chakra
.

Trivia

When Sasori made the Kazekage into a puppet, he drenched the sand in
poison
, making it more lethal in battle.

Magnetite, the main component of
Iron Sand
, is about 2 times denser than
silica
, which is the main component of sand, while
gold
 is about 3.7 times denser than magnetite.
