"
To the Land of Silence
" (
黙の国へ
,
Shijima no Kuni e
) is episode 160 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

The group arrives at the
Land of Silence
, narrowly avoiding a trap by thieves. Because many of the criminals there are hostile to the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
,
Konohamaru
 has them remove their forehead protectors. Konohamaru and
Mugino
 give
Boruto
 and
Sarada
 a brief history lesson on the Land of Silence, and Mugino voices his opposition to having them in the mission, considering it too much for genin. Boruto is adamant of not letting others become victims like
Mitsuki
. Noticing the ruined gates, the jōnin explain that as they don't have a proper village to protect, the shinobi of the Land of Silence only follow money and power. Walking through the black market, they notice many shinobi who are wanted in the
Bingo Book
, and figure the rumours about the
Hashirama
 Cell have spread far. They take note of the many things sold and stolen in the market. They ask for information at a shop, but the proprietor has no interest in them if they're not buying anything. Boruto gets separated, defeats the shopkeeper's subordinates, and threatens him into giving them information. He shows them a company ID from
Victor
's company, claiming a man in a white coat sold him the Hashirama Cell. He directs them to The Ladies for more information. At the bar, Mugino recognises
Kirisaki
, a former
medical-nin
 from
Kirigakure
. Boruto approaches Kirisaki disguised with his
Sexy Technique
, and convinces him to dismiss the other women around him. Sarada and Mugino comment on Boruto's performance.
 While trying to get him alone, Kirisaki's briefcase gets stolen. Boruto stops Kirisaki from beating up the thief and defeats him. Their fight attracts attention, so the group takes him away. They threaten to hand him over to Kirigakure, so he reveals he's only in the Land of Silence because he has intel on the Hashirama Cell, and he's supposed to meet someone the day after about it. They plan for the meeting. Konohamaru goes
disguised
 as Kirisaki. They meet with a butler of the interested party, who wishes to test if Kirisaki really is who he says he is. The butler is infected with the cell, and if Kirisaki is the real deal, he should be able to treat it.

Trivia

In the preview of this episode, it showed Sarada with a two tomoe Sharingan in each eye. It was fixed when it was aired, showing a single tomoe in each eye.
