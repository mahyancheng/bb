"
The Weapons Known as Shinobi
" (
忍という名の道具
,
Shinobi toiu na no Dōgu
) is episode 18 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Inari
 runs door to door throughout the
Land of Waves
 trying to rally the villagers to defend
Tazuna
 and the
bridge
. To his disappointment, the adults are too afraid to get involved, but Inari is willing to go to the bridge alone if necessary. At the bridge,
Kakashi
 has immobilised
Zabuza
 with his
Ninken
 and readies his
Lightning Cutter
 for a finishing blow. Meanwhile,
Haku
, having been defeated by
Naruto
, has seemingly lost his purpose in life (serving Zabuza) and requests that Naruto kill him. Naruto is confused and argues that being a
shinobi
 is more than just mindless killing, but Haku won't be dissuaded. Naruto relents, saying softly that they might have been friends under different circumstances, and charges at Haku with his
kunai
 drawn. However, Haku senses that Zabuza's life is in danger and blocks Naruto's attack. Declaring he's not ready to die yet, he rushes to Zabuza's side just in time to take all the damage of Kakashi's Lightning Cutter. Back at the village,
Tsunami
 tells Inari that he is too young to fight, but he is determined to defend his village. His demeanour reminds Tsunami of
Kaiza
, which surprises her. Inari leaves to go protect the bridge but finds a crowd waiting for him outside. As Zabuza's
mist
 clears, Naruto is stunned to find Haku killed by Kakashi's attack. Zabuza is unfazed by his partner's sacrifice and swings his sword to slice through Kakashi and Haku at the same time. Kakashi evades this blow and prepares to resume the fight, telling an enraged Naruto to stay out of it. Tazuna accompanies
Sakura
 to
Sasuke
's body. The girl tries to maintain her composure as per shinobi requirements but breaks down in tears when she sees that Sasuke is cold and lifeless. Kakashi once again immobilises Zabuza, this time disabling both of his arms. With Zabuza unable to swing his sword or perform techniques, the battle seems over.
Gatō
 then appears with dozens of hired thugs and dismisses Zabuza.

Trivia

In the anime, Kakashi's blow strikes Haku on the chest but does not go through. In the manga, his arm pierces Haku's body, emerging out of Haku's back.
