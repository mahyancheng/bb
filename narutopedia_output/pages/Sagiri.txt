Sagiri
 (
サギリ
) was a tradesman who was granted entry into the
Nadeshiko Village
.

Background

Because of the village's laws and customs, he and
Shizuka
 were prohibited from being together, despite their intense love for each other. He nevertheless loved her very much and vowed to do whatever he could to change the laws of the village that he found ridiculous. However, he was later ambushed and killed as proof to show his lack of strength and unworthiness of being with Shizuka. Though, according to
Tokiwa
, it was believed that it was a plot perpetrated by the village elders who were concerned about the fate of the village before deciding to have Sagiri killed.

Personality

Sagiri cared very much for Shizuka and wanted to be with her no matter what. He seemed to be considerably determined in his devotion to Shizuka, willing to defy and change the preventive laws of her village that he disagreed with just so he could be with Shizuka in peace.

Appearance

Sagiri had long brown hair with his bangs hanging down just above his eyes. He also had brown-coloured eyes. He wore a simple long-sleeved brown shirt with a black v-neck and pants.
