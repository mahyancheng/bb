Naruto punches his opponent with a tailed beast chakra arm, sending them up in the air and putting some distance between them. He fully manifests Kurama, and creates nine shadow clones, each creating a different Rasenshuriken. The shadow clones throw the Rasenshuriken, while the real Naruto sends a Tailed Beast Ball, all attacks converging on the opponent.
