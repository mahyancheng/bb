A ray-shaped bow that can fire chakra arrows. Even a grazing wound can be dangerous, as the arrows can disrupt a target's
chakra flow
, paralysing the wounded body part. By plucking its different strings, the wielder can change the arrows' trajectory after they're fired, circumventing attempts to block them, as well as track their targets by
echolocation
.
