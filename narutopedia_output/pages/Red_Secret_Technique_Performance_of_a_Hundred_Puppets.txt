To begin this technique,
Sasori
 removes one summoning scroll from his back. He then opens his right chest compartment to emit more than a hundred chakra strings, which reach into the scroll. From the scroll, more than a hundred
puppets
 wearing red cloaks emerge.

As even the most elite of puppeteers cannot control more than ten puppets a time (one per finger), this technique is proof of Sasori's superiority with regard to the
Puppet Technique
. Also, normally a puppet's movement is dependent on the will of the user, and as such there will be a time lag between the user's commands and the puppet's response. However, since these hundred puppets are directly connected to Sasori's core, there is no time lag between Sasori's will and the puppets' movements.

Sasori stated that he brought down an entire country (the
Land of This
 in the anime) with this technique. Many of the puppets, however, were destroyed during Sasori's battle with
Chiyo
 and
Sakura Haruno
, although they did manage to destroy some of Chiyo's
White Secret Technique: The Chikamatsu Collection of Ten Puppets
. While these one hundred puppets lacked teamwork, they apparently used sheer attrition and numbers to overwhelm their opponents. Even when they decrease in numbers they do not become less dangerous as it merely allows Sasori to focus more on the remaining puppets.

As with all of Sasori's puppets, all the weapons wielded are coated in his special
poison
, which would kill the victims after three days of painful paralysis.

In the anime, Sasori was shown using this technique while inside
Hiruko
.

Trivia

In the anime, two of the puppets are briefly shown with the
Sharingan
.
