Tenten summons multiple weapons connected with
wire strings
 to her fingertips from one of her
scrolls
, directing them towards her opponent in a stream formation. After the final weapon hits the opponent, Tenten uses the strings to make the weapons fly above her opponent. Moving her fingers to make the weapons spin, she then directs the weapons downwards to hit the opponent down into the ground again.
