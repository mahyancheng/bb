This technique covers the enemy's entire body with the
kikaichū
 living inside the
Aburame clan
 member's body. The chakra-sensing kikaichū spread over a wide range, and the moment they locate the enemy, the insects, following the user's orders, gather at once completely surrounding the target creating a fast-moving tornado that will seemingly disintegrate the target.
