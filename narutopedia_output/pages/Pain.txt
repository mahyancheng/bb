 To Hurt…!!) is chapter 129 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Naruto
 has difficulty recognising
Gaara
 in his transformed state. When
Pakkun
 tells him who it is, Naruto remembers Gaara's claim that he is a monster and realises he wasn't exaggerating. Naruto suggests running, but Gaara takes his preoccupation to try and kill
Sasuke
.
Sakura
 shields him, but Gaara immobilises her. Tormented about her selfless act, Gaara reflects on his childhood. When Gaara was a child in
Sunagakure
 he only wanted friends. His peers feared him for being the host of
Shukaku
 and ran when he was nearby, and he would accidentally attack them while trying to stop them. Sympathising with them, Gaara wondered what it was to feel pain.
