Akebi Sanzu
 (
三途アケビ
,
Sanzu Akebi
) was
Amado Sanzu
's daughter.

Background

Akebi contracted an incurable disease of unknown origin. When no cure was found and no treatment effective, her doctors gave up on her. Amado, who had already some experience with cloning, decided it would be more effective to give Akebi a new body rather than try creating a cure from scratch. Akebi died during the nine month period of her clone's development.

Personality

According to
Ada
, Akebi was a normal woman with her personality nothing like Delta's.

Appearance

As a genetic source to her clone
Delta
, Akebi greatly resembled her.

Legacy

Despite her death, Amado wasn't discouraged. Having preserved her brain, he was able to extract her memories and preserve them in digital from, creating a backup. However, upon putting them in her new cloned body, despite having all of Akebi's memories, her clone had a different personality, and was an entirely different person. Amado remade her several times, but failed to recreate Akebi's personality, only then breaking down from the loss of his daughter. At that point, Amado was approached by
Jigen
 to join
Kara
, promising to reunite him with his daughter if Amado helped him achieve his goal. Her cloned bodies became known as Delta.

Amado eventually discovered
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
's goal, which would result in the extermination of life on the planet, rendering Akebi's resurrection moot, and focused his efforts on destroying him. Having learned much about the Ōtsutsuki, he discovered about the Kāma and its resurrection, finding its personality restoring capabilities exactly what he failed to achieve. When he restored
Kawaki
's Kāma after Isshiki's soul was eradicated, he altered it to contain Akebi's data, hoping for Kawaki to apply a Kāma to a cloned body to finally resurrect Akebi properly.
