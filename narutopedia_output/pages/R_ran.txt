Rōran
 (
桜蘭
,
Viz:
 Loran,
literally meaning:
 Cherry Blossom Orchid) was a kingdom surrounded by a desert in the
Land of Wind
 and the second setting of
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower
 after the ruins of Rōran when
Mukade
 sends himself,
Naruto Uzumaki
, and
Yamato
 back in time, 20 years into the past.
 In the city, there are other places such as the
Garden of Ryūmyaku
, the
Rōran Palace
, and the
Source of the Ryūmyaku
.

While Mukade had became the Minister, he had persuaded
Sēramu
, the previous Queen, to build towers throughout the entire kingdom for the sake of its people, but in truth to extend his
Chakra Threads
 for his
Puppet Ninja Force
. Six years after Mukade's arrival, Naruto meets the fated last Queen of Rōran,
Sāra
, obtains a special
kunai
, meets and teams up with his father,
Minato Namikaze
.

After Mukade was defeated by Naruto, Minato has sealed off the Ryūmyaku vein so future people would not use it for evil as Mukade did. The kingdom eventually fell into ruination from a war, but Sāra — influenced by Naruto’s heroic actions — would lead its people to safety, allowing them to survive into the present. Sāra would pass away at some point after the fall of Rōran, leaving
a daughter
 who would continue to protect their people.
