This article is about the technique. For the summon, see
Earth Prison Golem

This technique allows the user to create a large, humanoid creature composed of rock that can either be expelled from the user's mouth, or formed from a pre-existing source of earth. Depending on the user, the golem can be formed instantly.

The size of the
golem
 differs depending on use, but it always possesses an ample amount of brute strength, being able to bite and tear through a
White Zetsu clone

 It is very durable, being able to withstand a point-blank
explosion
.
 This makes the golem ideal for serving as additional support or simply as a mobile shield.
