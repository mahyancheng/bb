With his team
lending him chakra
, Akaboshi can slam his hand onto the ground and cause lightning to spread from his hand to underneath the opponent.

Trivia

The name of this technique appears to come from "Denkō Sekka" (
電光石火
,
Lightning Flash
), an idiom used for "lightning speed". In this technique, the first part is changed to "Denpō" (
電報
,
literally meaning:
 telegram), likely a reference on how the target is hit from a distance.

Though all four members use chakra for this technique, it only seems to take properties of Lightning Release, when the chakra reaches Akaboshi.
