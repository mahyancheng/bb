Etoro Konjiki
 (
金色エトロ
,
Konjiki Etoro
) was a terrorist of
Ishigakure
 and
Metoro Konjiki
's older twin brother. Etoro, alongside his brother, specialised in destroying buildings or merchant ships.

Personality

Compared to his younger brother, Metoro, Etoro was very talkative and the more outgoing of the two.

Appearance

Etoro had crimson-coloured eyes and wore gaudy earrings. Not much else is known about his appearance, except that with Etoro and his brother being twins, they were similar in appearance, as
Gaara
 noted them using their appearance as a factor in tricks.

Abilities

Etoro was capable of combining
Earth
 and
Fire Release

nature transformations
 to use the
Lava Release

kekkei genkai
, which took the form of high temperature melting flames. With it, Etoro was capable of launching flaming bullets and
expanding flame rings
, which were capable of melting other substances and creating fire storms from the high pressure. He also showed some capability in
genjutsu
, combining it with a basic
Clone Technique
 to trick his targets into making the first move, leaving themselves open to cooperative attacks. Gaara noted that Etoro and his younger brother,
Metoro Konjiki
 had large war potential.

Blank Period

Gaara Hiden: A Sandstorm Mirage

Etoro and his younger twin brother Metoro were in an organisation of terrorists, who were targeting Gaara, with the
Kazekage
 recognising the two terrorists from the
Bingo Book
. As the two boasted about their achievements, Gaara attacked them with his
Sand Binding Coffin
, but it was revealed to be just a
Clone Technique
 in unison with
genjutsu
. When Gaara noticed them on the ceiling, Etoro created a ring of fire for his brother's steel ball to go through, aiming the attack at
Hakuto
. Their combined attack, however, was withstood by the Kazekage's
Shield of Sand
 with support from his
Wind Release
.
Surrounded in sand
, the brothers readied their second attack, but
Shijima
 came to back-up Gaara, throwing a bunch of hōshuriken to distract the two, with Etoro melting them. However, the
compressed air
 in the hōshuriken greatly injured Etoro. After Gaara sliced through Metoro with his
Sand Sword
, Etoro, in devastation, launched a series of countless flame bullets, using up his remaining
chakra
, but was caught in Gaara's
sand
 and
crushed
.

Trivia

Etoro's last name, Konjiki (
金色
), literally means "golden colour".
