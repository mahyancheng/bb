"
The Legend of the Monster Cat
" (
化け猫伝説
,
Bakeneko Densetsu
) is episode 224 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Iwabee
 fires himself up, feeling that becoming a
chūnin
 will take him closer to becoming
Hokage
. His
team-mates
 support him.
Wasabi
 isn't as boisterous, which her
team-mates
 notice and comment on. Wasabi's parents arrive, already celebrating her promotion, flustering her.
Wasabi's grandmother
 joins them, expressing pride in Wasabi representing
their clan
. She believes that Wasabi becoming chūnin at her age, a first for their clan, will be a great accomplishment, Wasabi's parents echoing her and confident that Wasabi can become Hokage. Wasabi's grandmother hands her a scroll she left at home, a jutsu passed down their clan that
channels a monster cat
. Wasabi points out her match is about to begin, and asks them to return to their seats. Wasabi is exasperated after they leave, thinking that the jutsu is something her grandmother dreamed up. She explains that only a few of her clansmen became chūnin, only after becoming adults themselves, and adds she's never met a
jōnin
 from her clan.
Tsubaki
 is surprised to hear it, but
Namida
 relates to her. Wasabi wants to make her clan proud, but their expectations weight on her.
 The match begins, Iwabee noticing her low energy, and her finding he can't understand how she feels. Iwabee strikes first, attempting to
crush
 her, but she dodges him, activates
her jutsu
, and counterattacks.
Sarada
 and
Chōchō
 are joined in the stands by
Shinki
,
Araya
, and
Yodo
, who were told by
Gaara
 to come watch. They confirm they've been chūnin for a while, and comment the
Konoha

genin
 are taking their time in doing the same. Shinki notices
Kawaki
 yawning at the stands. Iwabee notices Wasabi's parents cheering on her, which embarrasses her, and she confesses that while she wants to be a great shinobi, becoming Hokage isn't her goal, just something her family assumed and expects of her. That angers Iwabee, who holds the Hokage in the highest regard. Wasabi tells him that for ordinary shinobi like them, becoming Hokage is an unrealistic fantasy. She realises she's yelling and that her family heard her, her mother covering her grandmother's ears. Iwabee notices she dropped a scroll, and she explains the supposed jutsu, though she doubts it's legitimate. She recalls her grandmother telling her about the jutsu, each time aggrandising it. She believes that if such a jutsu existed, she could never use it because of the limits of what she can do. Iwabee agrees with her, find her so afraid of other's expectations she doesn't dare to dream big. He asks if she'll dream big if she sees a cat as big as a mountain, like her grandmother told her, and uses his
Earth Release
 to create one. He tells her she can't do it because she already believes it's impossible. He collapses from using too much
chakra
, and the head of the cat he created breaks off, threatening to crush him. Wasabi successfully uses her clan's jutsu to destroy the cat head and protect Iwabee. Her family is moved by her use of the jutsu.
Konohamaru
 declares to match over, pointing out Iwabee can no longer stand. Wasabi wants a proper victory, but Iwabee himself says he can no longer fight.
Naruto
 comments on how unusual the match was, and
Shikamaru
 comments it reminds him of Naruto and
Kiba
. Wasabi's family cries of joy.
Boruto
 and
Mitsuki
 discover where
Amado
 and his captors are. Konohamaru draws the names for the next match, Sarada and Chōchō, both shocked by it.
