The
Deva Path
 (
天道
,
Tendō
) grants the user the ability to manipulate
attractive
 and
repulsive
 forces with objects and people.
 These techniques, however, cannot be performed in rapid succession; the amount of time required to recharge after use varies depending on the scale of the technique used, five seconds being the basic minimum. If used at high intensities, not only will it result in a long downtime, but it could potentially shorten the user's lifespan. The Deva Path also grants another ability:
Chibaku Tensei
 which allows the user to create a huge makeshift terrestrial body from all the surrounding matter that is attracted to a black sphere released by this technique.

Though he used the powers of the Deva Path prior to being crippled, Nagato spent the remainder of his life channelling the power through the corpse of his deceased friend
Yahiko
, using him as the face of his Pain alias. In the anime, through Pain, Nagato demonstrated the ability to levitate in midair prior to levelling
Konoha
 and during his battle against
Naruto
 in his
six-tailed
 state.

Influences

In Buddhism, the
Deva realm
 is the realm of bliss. The Deva realm is sometimes also referred to as the "god's realm" because, compared to humans, its inhabitants are so powerful that they could be compared to deities. However, beings born into the Deva realm are still subject to reincarnation. Devas suffer from pride and the knowledge that their long lives and powers will not prevent their eventual rebirth.
