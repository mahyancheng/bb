Kōtarō Fūma
 (
風魔コウタロウ
,
Fūma Kōtarō
) is a
tokubetsu jōnin
 that serves as the head of the
Konoha Military Police Force
.

Background

When
Sarada Uchiha
 was still young, Kōtarō already knew her.

Personality

Kōtarō is a very serious and strict person who treats his work with dedication and zeal. However, he is able to act according to justice rather than the law, without inflicting harsh punishments in some cases, as was the case with
Hibiki
 and
Kodama
. Kōtarō is polite and, even when insulted, tries to respond calmly and with restraint. He is intolerant of those who constantly disturb the order, such as
Nezumi Kaitō
, and strives to get such individuals into prison as soon as possible. He doesn't require formal appeals due to his status, even from genin, rejoicing in meeting new people. Kōtarō longs for Sarada Uchiha to join the Konoha police force due to the fact that the
Uchiha Clan
 has served in it for generations.

Appearance

Kotaro is a rather tall man with wide brown eyes, thick eyebrows, and short brown hair. He wears the standard police uniform, consisting of blue pants and a shirt, along with a special blue vest and cap with the Konoha Military Police Force insignia. He also carries a huge shuriken behind him most of the time, secured by a large belt slung over his left shoulder.

Abilities

Being the head of the Konoha Military Police Force, he is assumed to be a talented
shinobi
. He is very responsible for his work and skilfully manages his subordinates, while personally delving into all the crimes, knowing everything about everyone who has even the slightest part in the committed action. Kōtarō has highly developed analytical skills, and he accurately points out non-coincidences that later turn out to be correct, helping to solve the crime. He pays attention to the smallest details and invisible people, bringing them to the fore to solve complex problems, which in most cases turns out to be a success. As a member of the Fūma Clan, he carries a
Fūma Shuriken
 on his back that he is presumably skilled in utilising. He also has a
tantō
 with a bandaged hilt in a sheath on his right leg.

Iwabee ignored the order by engaging the bang during another robbery, which resulted in Metal Lee being injured and taken to the hospital, their team being suspended from the investigation. When
Gekkō

controlled
 civilians to incite a riot against the
Kaminarimon Company
 as a distraction, Kōtarō deployed all available shinobi to protect the company. Despite being suspended, Denki reached out to Kōtarō to explain the possibility of the rioters being affected by genjutsu. When the theory was confirmed, Kōtarō passed it along to break the genjutsu calm the riot. After Naruto captured Gekkō, Kōtarō interrogated him.
