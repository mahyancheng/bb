Jakō Ryūdōin
 summons a tiger made of flames from the scroll on his back, inflicting massive damage to the player's team, additionally having the ability to attach to the opponent and explode with much impact. This technique is similar to
Fire Release: Great Dragon Fire Technique
 and
Exploding Dragon Strike
, except that it uses a tiger rather than a dragon. It is also somewhat similar to a
explosive tag
, but far stronger.
