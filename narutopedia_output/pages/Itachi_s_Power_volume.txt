Viz:
 Itachi's Power) is volume 17 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 145

"
Memories of Despair
" (
絶望の記憶
,
Zetsubō no Kioku
)

Not knowing who they are,
Naruto
 is surprised to see
Itachi
's
Sharingan
. He is even more surprised when they reference the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 sealed within him. As
Sasuke
 searches for Naruto, he thinks back to his childhood. Itachi seemed like an ordinary older brother who was simply distant with Sasuke. However, when Sasuke returned home one night to the
Uchiha clan
's living area, he found his entire family murdered by Itachi. As Itachi and
Kisame
 try to convince Naruto to leave his room, Sasuke arrives and vows to kill Itachi.

Chapter 146

"
Together with Hatred…!!
" (
憎悪とともに…!!
,
Zōo to Tomo ni…!!
)

Both
Naruto
 and
Kisame
 are surprised to learn that
Itachi
 and
Sasuke
 are brothers. Years ago, after Itachi killed their family, Itachi told Sasuke that he had done so in order to test his abilities. Frightened that this could be his motivation, Sasuke tried to escape, only for Itachi to assure him he was too weak to kill. He instead encouraged Sasuke to grow strong enough to kill him and avenge their family. Intending to finally do so, Sasuke attacks Itachi with
Chidori
, but Itachi easily deflects it. Naruto begins gathering
chakra
 so that he can help Sasuke when it is absorbed by Kisame. As Kisame moves to incapacitate him,
Jiraiya
 appears and stops the attack.

Chapter 147

"
My Fight!!
" (
オレの戦い!!
,
Ore no Tatakai!!
)

Jiraiya
 tries to make a grand entrance, but
Naruto
 quickly reminds him that he was gone because he was hitting on a woman. Since the woman was under the influence of a
genjutsu
, Jiraiya knows that
Itachi
 and
Kisame
 were trying to separate him from Naruto, thereby confirming that
Akatsuki
 really is after the
Nine-Tails
. Hearing Jiraiya's words, Itachi realises that Jiraiya was the one who informed Kakashi about Akatsuki. Jiraiya prepares to fight them but
Sasuke
 instructs him to leave them to him. Uninterested in their squabble, Itachi tortures Sasuke. Naruto tries to help him and Kisame pursues Naruto, prompting Jiraiya to coat the area in a
toad
's stomach.

Chapter 148

"
Itachi's Power!!
" (
イタチの能力!!
,
Itachi no Chikara!!
)

Itachi
 tells
Sasuke
 that he is still too weak.
Jiraiya
 tries to capture him and
Kisame
 but they flee, managing to escape from his
Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind
 with
Amaterasu
. Jiraiya takes a sample of the flames for future study and Naruto checks on Sasuke. While they are preoccupied,
Guy
 appears and attacks Jiraiya, having thought he was Itachi or Kisame. Naruto expresses an interest in going after the
Akatsuki
 members, but Jiraiya tells him he would stand no chance against them. Because of the condition Sasuke and
Kakashi
 have been left in after their encounters with Itachi, as well as
Lee
's predicament, Guy regrets that
Tsunade
 is no longer in
Konoha
. Jiraiya tells him that they are in the middle of searching for Tsunade, the world's greatest medic.

Chapter 149

"
The Legendary…!!
" (
伝説の…!!
,
Densetsu no…!!
)

Guy
 pleads with
Jiraiya
 and
Naruto
 to make sure they bring
Tsunade
 back to
Konoha
. When Naruto promises to do so, Guy, impressed by his dedication, gives him a jumpsuit before heading home with
Sasuke
. As they begin their search, Naruto asks why
Akatsuki
 is so interested in him. Jiraiya tells him that they are after the
Nine-Tails
 for some unknown reason and that, in the future, they are unlikely to give up so easily. Naruto concludes that he will need to get stronger, which he won't be able to do until they find Tsunade. Jiraiya explains that it will not be that easy since Tsunade periodically changes her appearance. Even if it will take a while, Naruto doesn't need to worry about missing out on his training since Jiraiya will be teaching him a new technique. Eager to begin, Naruto puts on his new jumpsuit.

Chapter 150

"
The Training Begins…?!
" (
修行開始…!?
,
Shugyō Kaishi…!?
)

Naruto
 and
Jiraiya
 stopped at a fair to gather information on
Tsunade
. When Naruto said that he wanted to enjoy the fair, Jiraiya took most of his money so that he, a ninja, will not over-indulge himself. After spending what little money he was allowed and buying Jiraiya some food as thanks, Naruto found that Jiraiya had not taken his own advice; not only had he surrounded himself with women and alcohol, but he had spent Naruto's money in order to do so. As Naruto yelled at him he earned the anger of
Gantetsu
. Jiraiya dealt with Gantetsu, at the same time demonstrating the Rasengan. To start Naruto on his way of learning the Rasengan, Jiraiya instructed him to pop a water balloon by spinning his chakra.

Chapter 151

"
Impetus…!!
" (
きっかけ…!!
,
Kikkake…!!
)

A few days after beginning his
Rasengan
 training,
Naruto
 reflects on his lack of progress in popping the water balloon.
Jiraiya
 reluctantly gave him some tips on how to spin his
chakra
, after which Naruto proclaimed that he would finish this first step and master the Rasengan in three days. Jiraiya informed him that the
Fourth Hokage
, the Rasengan's creator, created the Rasengan after three years' hard work. While thinking, Naruto sees a cat playing with the water balloon. When the cat pops the balloon after batting it around, Naruto gets an idea and finally manages to break the balloon himself.

Chapter 152

"
The Second Step
" (
第二段階
,
Daini Dankai
)

By spinning
chakra
 with both of his hands and forcing the energy into the water balloon from opposing directions,
Naruto
 is able to pop it. Though unorthodox,
Jiraiya
 is impressed and tells him about the second step to learning the
Rasengan
. The second step is very similar to the first; Naruto must pop a rubber ball. Since the ball is much sturdier than the balloon, he will need to improve the Rasengan's strength. Naruto once again struggles with the step as he cannot burst the ball, only managing to create a hole in it. Content with this development, Jiraiya draws a mark on the palm of his hand to help.

Chapter 153

"
The Searchers!!
" (
捜索者たち!!
,
Sōsakusha-Tachi!!
)

The mark on
Naruto
's hand is meant to give him a focal point for his
chakra
 output, concentrating the
Rasengan
's strength on one specific point rather than dissipating it over a larger area. This does little to help him. Meanwhile,
Orochimaru
 is in agony from the seal placed on him by the
Third Hokage
. With
Kabuto
 unable to do anything for him, they decide to go looking for
Tsunade
. Kabuto tells him that she is in
Tanzaku Quarters
, which
Jiraiya
 also finds out in the course of his own investigation. In Tanzaku, Tsunade, a gambler with terrible luck, hits a winning streak, which causes her great concern.
