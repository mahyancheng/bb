After forming the neccessary hand seals and reciting an incantation,
On Mayura Girante Sowaka
,
Mukade
 absorbs the seal placed by the
Fourth Hokage
, allowing him to
time travel
. Those caught in the blast are also sent through time.

Specifically, Mukade travelled back twenty years, six years before the seal was placed, though
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Yamato
 arrived six years later.

Trivia

This technique is not truly named when Mukade used it, but instead when he chanted the incantation. From the second line of his incantation, the kanji for "Peacock Wisdom Queen" came up, thus establishing the name.

In Buddhism, the
Wisdom King
 is the king of knowledge. Its female counterpart is the Wisdom Queen, and one in particular is known as the "Peacock Wisdom Queen", who rides a peacock.
