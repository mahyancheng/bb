Minato blasts the opponent into the air with a
Rasengan
 and then proceeds to throw one of his
Flying Thunder God Kunai
 behind them. As he teleports behind them, he strikes them in the back with another Rasengan that expands to a larger size before exploding and sending the opponent back to the ground.
