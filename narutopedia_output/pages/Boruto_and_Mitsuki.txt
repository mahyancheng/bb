"
Boruto and Mitsuki
" (
ボルトとミツキ
,
Boruto to Mitsuki
) is episode 12 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

At night,
Mitsuki
 discusses the incidents with someone through a white snake, mentioning a
Root
 heirloom and a possible user. Mitsuki recalls waking up in a tank. The
Academy
 teachers have their students run an obstacle course in groups of three.
Boruto
 and Mitsuki help
Denki
 when he struggles midway, at the cost of using up their time.
Shino
 fails all students, because the few who complete the course did so by leaving their teammates behind.
Konohamaru
 and
Moegi
 tell the students they'll occasionally drop by for the purposes of seeing who might be under their command, and encourage them to see which formations work better. The boys discuss the recent lack of ghost incidents, and whether they should continue investigating now that they know the adults are also looking into it.
 Mitsuki asks
Shikadai
 why he helped Denki, and Shikadai suggests Boruto got into him. Shino discusses the students with Moegi and Konohamaru. Moegi expresses interest in
Iwabee
 and Boruto. Mitsuki notices Boruto helping Iwabee with arithmetic problems. Mitsuki asks him if he feels more included because of Boruto. After class,
Inojin
 notes to Mitsuki he's been paying a lot of attention to Boruto. Inojin explains the lengths Boruto goes to not to be seen just as the
Hokage
's son. Mitsuki visits
Sumire
 alone. He asks her how she feels about Boruto, and she echos Inojin's sentiment of finding him fun. She asks if Mitsuki has any family. Sumire explains all of her family is dead, that her panicked behaviour stems from not being as skilled as her father was, but that she grew to find class funny. Mitsuki questions her feelings about whoever injured her, and she just wants it to be over. Boruto has Mitsuki come over to his home for dinner. In Boruto's bedroom, Mitsuki questions the exact nature of how Boruto feels about
Naruto
, but
Hinata
 calls them to dinner before he can answer. Naruto and Mitsuki are introduced to one another. At the Hokage's office,
Shikamaru
 informs Naruto's clone that a chakra signature linked to the incidents has been detected, and that
Sai
 has been dispatched to investigate. Naruto's clone disperses, and Naruto leaves dinner, causing Boruto to storm out. Naruto and Mitsuki exchange words. Boruto resents Naruto, because ever since becoming Hokage, he feels Naruto has neglected his family. Boruto explains that he is determined to never abandon those closest to him as he perceives Naruto to have done, doing something he couldn't do. This sparks a memory in Mitsuki, hearing his parent say something similar. Understanding Boruto better, Mitsuki confesses he knows who is behind the ghost incidents.
