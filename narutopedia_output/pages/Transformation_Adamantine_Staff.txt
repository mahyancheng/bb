The user
transforms
 into a staff for their
summoner
 to use as a weapon;
Enma
's staff form was the preferred weapon of
Hiruzen Sarutobi
, whose heavy use of it through decades of warfare contributed to his reputation as a "
God of Shinobi
". The staff is as hard as diamond, making it very destructive. This also renders it largely impervious to damage, making it useful as a defence;
 despite this, Enma still feels pain from clashing with the
Sword of Kusanagi
.
 The staff dimensions can be altered, becoming wider
 or extending to great lengths,
 enough that, in the anime, it could push the
Nine-Tails
 beyond the borders of
Konohagakure
.
 The user can produce any part of his regular body from the staff, such as his claws or fangs, to surprise opponents.

Enma is shown to
clone
 himself while in his staff form for use in the
Adamantine Prison Wall
.[

Trivia

The folkloric
Sun Wukong
 had an extendable staff called
Ruyi Jingu Bang
 (read in Japanese on'yomi as the "Nyoi Kinko Bō"). As in the story, Enma's transformation has golden-shaft ends.

A
nyoi
, which can be translated as
priest's staff
 but literally means
as one wishes
, is a decorative object associated with Chinese Buddhist rituals.

Vajra
 (
金剛
,
Kongō
) is a weapon used as a ritual object to symbolise both the properties of a diamond (indestructibility) and a thunderbolt (irresistible force). In Japanese, the term is also synonymous with
adamantine
.

This also references Sun Wukong's staff, which had to be made heavy and durable in order for Wukong to be able to use it (due to other weapons being wielded by him ending up broken).
