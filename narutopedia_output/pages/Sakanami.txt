Personality

shinobi
 from
Konohagakure
 who could foil his plan. Sakanami has shown dislike for the young ninja, outright calling them fools. Despite the fact that he and Tatsunami fight seemingly on an equal footing, it seems that Sakanami is under a little pressure from his comrade, which is especially noticeable when Tatsunami did not help his partner during his defeat by
Metal Lee
 but decided to save the gold instead.

Sakanami is a man of medium build with short brown hair and sideburns, as well as stubble on his face and fleshy lips. While working in the mine, he wore a grey turtleneck, dark pants and a belt with tool bags attached to it. He also wears gloves, boots, and a white rope around his head.

Abilities
