"
Return of the Morning Mist
" (
朝霧の帰郷
,
Asagiri no Kikyō
) is episode 81 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Two

hooded
 persons enter Konoha — a guard notices them at the village entrance, but is put to sleep by genjutsu.
Sasuke
 is seen thinking about the night of his parents' death and his inability to stop it — and throws a
kunai
 at the place where he perceived his memory. Naruto completes his morning training and meets up with
Konohamaru
, who is gazing at the
mountainside image
 of the Third. Konohamaru impresses Naruto with his commitment to rebuilding the village, and Naruto hands him a coupon for free ramen at
Ichiraku
. Somewhere in
Sunagakure
, the rotten corpses of the
Fourth Kazekage
 and his two guards are discovered by a shinobi team led by
Baki
, who curses
Orochimaru
 for his deception, while the latter is shown recovering in his hideout alongside
Kabuto
 while discussing the difficulty of his situation and his future goals.
Jiraiya
 is approached by the
village's

elders
, who offer him the position of Fifth
Hokage
, as he is one of the legendary
Sannin
. He declines, but adds that if they are looking for a Sannin to fill the position, then
Tsunade
 would be a much better candidate for the title. He offers to find her for
Konoha
, though asks that he be allowed to take
Naruto
 with him. Sasuke is called to a tea shop by
Kakashi
, where
Asuma Sarutobi
 and
Kurenai Yūhi
 are already there. Within the tea shop are the two hooded figures, which the three jōnin realise but don't convey; with a nod by Kakashi, the two jōnin head to meet up with the duo, while Sasuke is whisked away by Kakashi. Asuma and Kurenai demand to know the identities of the duo, and are surprised to see the infamous Itachi Uchiha and Kisame Hoshikagi in their village. The four engage in battle, though Itachi and Kisame quickly gain the advantage. As Asuma and Kurenai are about to be killed, Kakashi comes to their rescue.
