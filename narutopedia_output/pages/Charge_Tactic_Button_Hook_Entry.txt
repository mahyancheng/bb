"
Charge Tactic! Button Hook Entry
" (
突入!ボタンフックエントリー
,
Totsunyū! Botan Fukku Entorī
) is episode 18 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Neji
 uses his
Byakugan
 to see inside the hideout but is unable to locate
Gaara
, due to
Naruto
 constantly jerking him around. However, he manages to get a glimpse of the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, though he is unable to explain what exactly it is.
Guy
 attempts to break the boulder blocking their path, but is unable to do so due to the barrier seal on the boulder.
Kakashi
 theorises that the
Akatsuki
 must have used a
Five-Seal Barrier
. He explains that there are four other tags in the vicinity and that all five tags must be ripped off at the same time to deactivate the barrier. Using his Byakugan, Neji locates all the other tags, and using wireless headsets,
Team Guy
 sets off to find the four barrier seals. Meanwhile, most of the Akatsuki members end their
astral projection
 technique and leave the hideout.
Deidara
 and
Sasori
, who are the only members to be physically present, are ordered by the Akatsuki
leader
 to dispose of the intruders. However, he tells them that the
Nine-Tails
'
Jinchūriki
 is to be captured alive. Although Naruto's capture was a task personally assigned to
Itachi
, Sasori is now given that responsibility. Itachi tells Sasori that Naruto is the one who rushes in and barks first. With that, Itachi and
Kisame
 end their astral projection. The leader tells them that he expects results, and he too leaves. Deidara and Sasori then sit there waiting for their intruders to come to them.

On the outside, Team Guy locates the four tags. Kakashi rips off the one by the boulder at the same time that Team Guy rips off their seals, causing the barrier to break.
Sakura
 uses her
Chakra Enhanced Strength
 to shatter the boulder. With the entrance now open, the
Kazekage Rescue Team
 use the Button Hook Entry to sneak in, although they are immediately greeted by Deidara and Sasori, who are sitting on Gaara's corpse. This infuriates Naruto to tap into the Nine-Tailed Fox's
chakra
, causing his eyes to change from blue to red and for his whiskers to be defined more prominently. Sasori and Deidara realise that he is the jinchūriki that they must capture. Meanwhile,
sudden blobs
 began to form in front of the respective members of Team Guy.
