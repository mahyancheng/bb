Scrolls
 (
巻物
,
Makimono
) remain one of the most important pieces of equipment in a ninja's arsenal. The average-sized scroll is small enough that several can be carried at the same time, either in a
flak jacket
 or in a pouch. Larger scrolls are usually carried on the ninja's back.
 In addition to writing on scrolls, ninja use them to
summon
 creatures, people, and items, making transportation easier and providing more options when on a mission. Some
techniques
 can also be stored in scrolls.

The scrolls are an integral part of the
Shinobi Gauntlet
, a high-tech, forearm-mounted ninja tool that allows users to store techniques inside scrolls, which are then shrunken to pill-size and put inside the Kote. Afterwards, they can release the scroll and use any sealed techniques within the scrolls without chakra.

Summoning Scrolls

While looking for
Itachi
,
Sasuke
 handed
Suigetsu
 a summoning scroll containing the same seal as
Orochimaru
's summoning tattoo, and some of his blood. With these, Suigetsu was able to summon
Manda
 after Sasuke used him to escape
Deidara
's
C0
.

To get around his initial five minutes limit in
Sage Mode
,
Naruto
 devised a strategy to have back-up
shadow clones
 moulding senjutsu chakra. Once his own senjutsu chakra was spent, Naruto used a scroll to summon these clones and dispersed them, reclaiming their senjutsu chakra and entering Sage Mode again.
Fukasaku
 was also able to summon them, as Naruto has a contract with
toads
.
