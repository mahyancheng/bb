Kabuto Yakushi
. The team is seen again in the anime under the leadership of
Aoi Rokushō
. They try to prevent
Idate Morino
 from completing a race in the
Land of Tea
, but are stopped again by Team 7;
Naruto Uzumaki
 used an application of the first step of his

 training to create a whirlpool that sucked Team Oboro into a trench. Since it is likely their masks let them breathe underwater, it is assumed they survived.
