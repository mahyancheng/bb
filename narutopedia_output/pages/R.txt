Rō
 (
朧
) is an
Anbu
 of
Konohagakure
.

Background

When Rō was a
genin
, he was sent on a mission with a large team. The enemy ended up ambushing and killing every member of Rō's unit. Rō hid from the enemies under the corpses of his comrades for days suppressing his
chakra
, pretending to be dead. It was at this time, Rō learnt that he could
manipulate
 his
chakra
 signature. The Anbu later placed Rō in their ranks as a result of the technique.

Appearance

Rō has short, spiky brown hair and sideburns. He also has brown eyes, thick eyebrows, a strong jaw and stubborn, heavy-lidded eyes. Due to him having a very old-fashioned speech pattern, coupled with his round, boulder-like appearance, he seems more like a
samurai
 than a
shinobi
. While on duty, he wears a monkey-motif mask and the standard Konoha-nin attire.

Abilities

Rō, using the Chakra Disguise, has the ability to manipulate others chakra perspective freely, once creating a complex anachronism on one's chakra signature he can even erase all signs of his or others chakra completely or become another person's chakra signature, so that the enemy does not recognise it or is deceived by it like he showed when
Komori
 believes a chakra presence is hidden behind the wooden barrels, but it's only a rat. He, however, notes that this technique is only useful in deceit, and doesn't actually change the amount of chakra his target possesses.

Rō employs the use of
taijutsu
 mainly in battle, showing considerable physical strength befitting his large frame, able to initially hold down the very strong
Chōji Akimichi
. As an elite member of Anbu, he is presumably skilled in
kenjutsu
, to which he also wields a
tantō
.

When
Shikamaru
 was tasked with infiltrating the
Land of Silence
 with the dual purpose of finding missing shinobi, including
Sai
, and assassinating country head
Gengo
, the Sixth
Hokage
,
Kakashi Hatake
, assigned
Soku
 and Rō to aid him. After showing off his abilities, Rō and the rest of the group departed at dawn at the hidden back entrance to Konoha. After arriving in the Curtain Village and assessing the situation, Rō and the rest of his squad are quickly captured by
Gengo
's
Enlightened Ones
. During captivity, he is tortured by them.

When he and the rest are brought before Gengo, he nearly succeeds in placing him and the rest in his
mind-altering genjutsu
 until the timely arrival of
Temari
 and her
Suna
 and Konoha reinforcements breaks Gengo's hold on them. Rō engages the brainwashed shinobi by restraining them despite the injuries he received from torture. During Shikamaru and Gengo's fight in the darkness, the Anbu helps out his leader by disguising his leader's chakra so that the
missing-nin
 could not
sense
 his movements. With the mission accomplished, Rō prepares to escort Shikamaru back to Konoha with the rest of the Konoha personnel.

Shikamaru Shinden: A Cloud Dancing in Forlorn Falling Petals

Main article:
Shikamaru Shinden: A Cloud Dancing in Forlorn Falling Petals

Shikamaru, now advisor to the
Seventh Hokage
, meets with Rō and Hinoko. Since it's been a while since the three of them were together, Rō guesses that something serious has happened. Shikamaru reports the
Fourth Tsuchikage
's demand for Konoha's secret intel at the recent
Five Kage Summit
. Rō and Hinoko don't see the point of this, as the purpose of secret intel is that it remain secret. Shikamaru suspects that there's something else behind the Tsuchikage's demand and sends Rō and Hinoko to infiltrate
Iwagakure
 to find out what. Because getting into Iwa unnoticed would be difficult even before the current riff with Konoha, Shikamaru meets with the
Third Tsuchikage
 to draw some ninja away from Iwa, thus making Rō and Hinoko's mission easier.

Once inside Iwa, Rō and Hinoko discover that the village's ninja are preparing to invade the
Land of Flowers
 under orders of the
Land of Earth
's
daimyō
. Because this would result in war - something forbidden by the
Shinobi Union
 - the Fourth Tsuchikage needs an excuse to withdraw Iwa from the Union; she expects Konoha to refuse to share its intel, giving her the excuse she needs. Hinoko reports this to Shikamaru, who instructs her and Rō to remain in Iwa and continue to monitor the situation. They send regular updates to Shikamaru about Iwa's ongoing preparations until Shikamaru, through diplomatic channels, is able to stop the invasion. Shikamaru thanks them for all their work once they're back in Konoha and they offer to help him again any time he needs them.
