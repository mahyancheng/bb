"
High-Level Shinobi
" (
一流の忍
,
Ichiryū no Shinobi
) is episode 216 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

In his mind,
Naruto
 reminisces on his memories with
Sasuke
, recalling when he and Sasuke fought together to
trick

Zabuza
, how Sasuke
mocked
 Naruto after he cowered from seeing the
Demon Brothers
, and how repeated those words back to Sasuke when they were
attacked
 by
Orochimaru
 in the
Forest of Death
. He reflects upon the good memories he had, such as when they
tried
 to peek at
Kakashi
's face, as well as the not so good memory of their
fight
 at the
Valley of the End
. Sasuke tells Naruto that he would not stop in his quest for vengeance and that Naruto would simply have to kill him or get killed, but Naruto states that he would not let either option happen.

In the real world, the
Rasengan
 and
Chidori
 clash against one another and explodes, causing Naruto and Sasuke to fall backwards towards the rock walls. Naruto's
shadow clone
 flings Kakashi in Naruto's direction to catch him while one of
White Zetsu
's
parasite clones
 catches Sasuke. Knowing that Sasuke would not retreat, White Zetsu
visits

Madara
 at his
base
, where the latter has
Danzō
's corpse as well as various
Sharingan
 eyes stored. White Zetsu notifies Madara that Sasuke is in a bit of a bind, and Madara and Zetsu head to the
Samurai Bridge
.

White Zetsu and his clones prepare to engage in combat against Naruto, but Madara tells him to stand down, alerting him that he would lose and thus he would set up a fight between Naruto and Sasuke in the future in order to obtain the
Nine-Tails
. Before they leave, Naruto tells Sasuke that if he ever does decide to attack
Konoha
, he would be waiting there for him, and would shoulder the burden of Sasuke's hatred. In anger, Sasuke lashes out and demands to know why Naruto is fixated on him, to which Naruto replies that it is because they are friends. Naruto asks whether Sasuke remembers what he had
said
 during their fight at the Valley; how two high-level shinobi can reach others' minds when they exchange fists. Naruto tells Sasuke that he has finally understood what Sasuke is going through, and if it means exchanging blows, then he would continue to do so to further understand him. He asks Sasuke whether he read his mind too, but Sasuke shrugs him off and merely states that he does not wish to and that he would kill him. Smiling, Naruto tells him that if they fought, both of them would die; however, he is optimistic that at least in the afterlife they would be relieved of their respective burdens.

Kakashi tries to use
Kamui
 to take out Madara, who quickly informs Kakashi that such a technique would not work on him. As they warp away, Sasuke informs Madara that he has something to ask of him. Naruto and his shadow clones quickly fall down, having been poisoned by the cut inflicted by Sasuke earlier; as
Sakura
 administers the antidote, Kakashi locates
Karin
, who had witnessed the entire thing, and decides to bring her back with him to Konoha. At his base, Madara is asked by Sasuke to have
Itachi
's
Mangekyō Sharingan
 transplanted within his own, as he is beginning to lose his vision after having activated the
Susanoo
 three times in less than a day. When Madara asks why Sasuke thinks he is ready for it now, Sasuke states that he needs the power of the Eternal Mangekyō if he has any chance of killing Naruto.
