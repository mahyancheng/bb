The
Bouncy Bouncy Technique
 is a variation of the
Sexy Technique
. Using the skills
Naruto
 had taught them,
Konohamaru
,
Moegi
, and
Udon
 transform into three beautiful women: Konohamaru will transform into the night on the town "Custard Pudding" (
カスタードプリン
,
Kasutādo Purin
,
English TV:
 Fashion Model); Moegi into the beach going "Fire-roasted Pudding" (
直火焼きプリン
,
Jikabiyaki Purin
,
English TV:
 Movie Star); Udon into the nurse "Milk Pudding" (
牛乳プリン
,
Gyūnyū Purin
,
English TV:
 Tanning Salon Receptionist). All three will then bounce their breasts to titillate their opponents, and by doing so, the three were able to make their victims fall into unconsciousness. Naruto felt the technique still lacked "bon-kyu-bon" (Japanese for "big-small-big", referring to the ideal "three measures", "bust-waist-hip"), which got censored in the English version into "va va voom".

Trivia

Although プリン (
purin
) means "pudding", プリンプリン (
purin purin
) is a Japanese onomatopoeia for something shaking and bouncing like a pudding, especially female breasts.
