Five Kage Summit

Five Kage Summit

During his fight with
Danzō Shimura
, Sasuke summoned Garuda to avoid falling off the
Samurai Bridge
 after being injured by Danzō's
Wind Release: Vacuum Sphere
 technique. Sasuke later disembarked from him in order to evade the
Wind Release: Vacuum Wave
 while it flew towards them.

In the anime, Garuda further assists Sasuke in his battle by using one of his claws to clutch and direct one of Danzō's
wind-enhanced shuriken
 back at him, severing Danzō's right arm and having him release his grip on Sasuke, thus allowing Sasuke to slash Danzō in the chest; in the manga, it was Sasuke who severed the right arm with his
Sword of Kusanagi
. After Sasuke killed Danzō, Garuda was seen flying away from the battlefield.

Sasuke uses Susanoo to protect himself, Garuda, and Naruto.



Later in the war, Garuda was summoned again to stop Sasuke and
Naruto
 from falling into lava after
Kaguya
 teleported
Team 7
 above a river of lava. Kaguya then launched a
pinpoint attack
, striking Garuda's
tenketsu
 in its wings which effectively disabled his ability to fly. Naruto saves both Garuda and the rest of the team with his
chakra arms
, afterwards Garuda returned to his dimension.

Trivia






Garuda in the manga.



Garuda
 is a large mystical bird or bird-like creature that appears in both
Hindu
 and
Buddhist
 religions. He is known as the King of the Birds as well as the first bird.

In the anime, when Garuda débuted, a lot of its design is lost from the manga and the markings on the side of its beak are noticeably missing.

Since all summoning animals are located in the same dimension as humans, Garuda should've been caught in
Infinite Tsukuyomi
, as other animals were seen caught in the genjutsu. However, Garuda seemed to have bypassed the genjutsu. It is unknown if it was by chance, if all summoned animals were exempt from the technique, or if Sasuke was able to break the genjutsu when summoning it.
