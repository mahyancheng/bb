This technique is similar in practice to
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
, but has a specific target rather than a general area. To perform it, the user precisely pinpoints the enemy's vital points with the
Byakugan
 and releases a high-speed palm thrust. A "vacuum shell" compressed using the
Gentle Fist
 is formed to attack the opponent's vitals from a distance, blowing them off their feet with tremendous force before they even notice they were hit.

Trivia

In the anime, a
White Zetsu Army
 clone
disguised
 as Hinata performed this technique against
Shino
's
insect clone
.
