The
Thousand Hands Manipulation Force
 is a technique which is used through the puppet of the
Third Kazekage
.

Usage

From the Third Kazekage puppet's left arm opens several compartments. These compartments are prepared with summoning
seals
 in them, which
call forth
 a large number of long puppet arms that can bend and follow the opponent, then crush them with devastating force. The arms are modified with launchers, which can emit poison gas, binding wires with a kunai-anchor, or regular kunai. Sasori can detach the entire left arm (with the thousand arms) to regain mobility for the puppet, and a
buzzsaw
 takes its place.
