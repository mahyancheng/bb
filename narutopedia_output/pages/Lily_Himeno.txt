,

) is a popular idol of the
Land of Fire
.

Lily is described as having lovely facial features and blonde shoulder length hair that's styled in loose waves. She wears white boots and a mini-dress with ribbons and frills sewed onto it. Her hair is revealed as a wig. Her true appearance is short reddish brown hair and she wears a purple uniform.

Abilities

Despite not being trained as a kunoichi, Lily was taught to harness her innate talent for
Lightning Release
. Having trained constantly for five years, since her youth, she has the ability to generate powerful electric currents. Similar to
Magnet Release
, doing so produces a large electromagnetic field that allows her to freely manipulate metal objects, like
kunai
.
 Lily is able to fine tune her Lighting Release to send bioelectric signals into a target in order to completely manipulate their body. By sending commands directly to the brain, she is able to send orders that can shut down organs
 or prevent and neutralise techniques that require concentration, as shown against Boruto's
Transformation Technique
.
 By sending her Lightning Release through water, she is able to cause large explosions.
