This technique is deployed by the bandits and
shinobi
 from
Yumegakure
 by creating a wall of lightning bolts that repels anyone who touches it and causes damage to them. The technique is used to block off advancement to the next area and the only way to dispel the technique is by defeating the users or by stepping on certain switches on the ground near the wall.
