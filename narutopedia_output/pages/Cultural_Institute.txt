The
Cultural Institute
 is a large research bureau located in the
Land of Stairs
, developing various devices to help make people's lives easier. It was led by
Furie Kanhen
, before his arrest by the
Seventh Hokage
, due to Furie's selfish plans to monopolise the resource market. The Institute has several different departments, one of which is led by
Noto Chōmen
, and is similar in concept to the Institute for the
Advanced Technology Research Institute
, with which they finance a warehouse of flying ships in the
Land of Fire
.
