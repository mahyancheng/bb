While in his
Six Paths Sage Mode
, using the
Six Paths Senjutsu
 and
fully transformed
 into
Kurama
, Naruto creates two
shadow clones
 of the entire chakra construct. The shadow clones merge with the original, creating a three-faced, six-armed construct. In its right arms, it creates a Six Paths Big Ball Rasenshuriken (
六道大玉螺旋手裏剣
,
Rikudō Ōdama Rasenshuriken
),
 and in its left arms, it creates a
Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshuriken
, both infused with
natural energy
. It is strong enough to counter
Sasuke Uchiha
's strongest
offensive technique
.
