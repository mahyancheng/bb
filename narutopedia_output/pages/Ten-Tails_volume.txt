Chapter 608

"
Kakashi's Decision!!
" (
カカシの決意!!
,
Kakashi no Ketsui!!
)

Obito Uchiha
 and
Kakashi Hatake
 continue their battle, with the former unleashing a barrage of shuriken only to be stopped by Kakashi's
wall of earth
. As Obito
slips through the wall
, Kakashi continues to ask him why and to ask him if it is related to
Rin
, to which Obito tells him to shut up. Obito then warps Kakashi to the
other dimension
, but his victory is short lived, as Kakashi returns using Kamui. In the meantime,
Madara
's
Wood Dragon
 begins absorbing
Kurama
's chakra, causing
Naruto
's
Tailed Beast Mode
 to falter. Obito begins to overwhelm Kakashi, bringing him to his knees. Madara uses
Wood Release
 to bind
Killer B
 and
Might Guy
, then begins to activate his
Susanoo
 to finish things up on the battlefield. Resolved, Naruto notes that the Uchiha's ideals annoyed him to no end and, creating a
shadow clone
, he is able to stop both Obito's shuriken and Madara's
Susanoo Sword
 from making killing blows on Kakashi and Guy respectively. Hearing Naruto's words that he would protect his friends, Kakashi and Guy both spring into action with the former using
Lightning Cutter
 to destroy Obito's other shuriken and Guy using
Daytime Tiger
 to attack Madara. Turning to his former comrade, Kakashi tells Obito that what he still remembered what he had taught him in the past and what he could do now, was protect Naruto.

Chapter 609

"
End
" (

,
Owari
)

As
Obito
 questions
Kakashi
 statement that he would protect
Naruto
, the Copy Ninja's sentiments are echoed by
Guy
, who is severely weakened. Seeing this,
Gyūki
 notes that all
Konoha
-nin liked to act tough before taking advantage of the loosened grip of its
wooden
 restraints, warning Naruto that the Wood Release binding could suppress a
tailed beasts
 power. Obito uses his own wood technique to attempt to restrain Naruto while he attacked Kakashi, but Naruto intercepts Tobi with a powerful headbutt, which sends him reeling. Gyūki then decides to attack the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 before the
Ten-Tails
 could revive, leaving Obito to Naruto. Naruto declares that he can see Obito's suffering face, though Obito counters by saying it is Kakashi who is truly suffering. As Naruto notes that he had to do something for Kakashi, who was worn out,
Kurama
 switches places with Naruto, and throws the Copy Ninja at Obito who
warps
 him away to the
other dimension
, much to Naruto's shock. With no time to linger over this occurrence as Obito attacks, using Kamui to avoid Naruto's attack; he surprisingly starts to cough up blood. Kurama then reveals that Kakashi was attacking Obito from the other dimension and that it had given the shinobi some of its chakra when it threw him at Obito. As Kakashi returns to the real world thanking Kurama, Naruto and
Killer B
 both combined their
Tailed Beast Balls
 to create a massive sphere, firing it on the
barrier
 containing the Demonic Statue. After the explosion, they note that the statue's
chakra
 vanishes, causing Kakashi to question whether this is the end. However, when the smoke clears, the revived
Ten-Tails
 appears, prompting Obito to declare that it is was indeed the end of this world. Elsewhere, a now-recovered
Madara
, though disappointed that he did not capture the Eight, and Nine-Tails, notes that they should begin their plan.

Chapter 610

"
Ten-Tails
" (
十尾
,
Jūbi
)

Shocked to the see the
Ten-Tails
 before them,
Naruto
 surmises that they must have been tricked as he was unable to
sense
 the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
's malevolent chakra. However,
Kurama
 tells the young man that it was impossible to sense the beast in the
Tailed Beast Mode
 as the beast had neither feelings nor ideals and was akin to
natural energy
 and that using
Sage Mode
 to sense how powerful it was, would be a different matter. Meanwhile,
Obito
 and
Madara
 relocate atop the beast and attach themselves to it. Obito notes that he would like to commence the
plan
 immediately, but Madara is more in favour of testing out the beast's power. As Naruto's attempt to gauge the Ten-Tails' power in Sage Mode ends in Naruto realising that it was indeed truly immeasurable, Kurama asks
Gyūki
 to hand him
Might Guy
 and
Kakashi
 so he could restore their
chakra
. Taking command, Kurama devises a battle strategy to face the beast launching a
continuous
 stream of Tailed Beast Balls, which culminates with Gyūki seemingly being decimated by the Ten-Tails' Tailed Beast Ball, but it was later revealed that Kakashi had
warped
 it away while being launched by Naruto along with the latter's clone overhead the Ten-Tails where Kakashi released Gyūki who was aiming a Tailed Beast Ball right at the giant beast.

Chapter 611

"
Arrival
" (
到着
,
Tōchaku
)

As the
Tailed Beast Ball
 bearing down upon the
Ten-Tails
,
Madara
 and
Obito
 have the beast simply flick the ball back at
Gyūki
, leaving Naruto's
shadow clone
, and
Kakashi
 open for an attack. After the clone successfully pushes Kakashi out of the way, Obito reflects on how much Naruto was like himself before the Ten-Tails' attack disperses the shadow clone and sends Gyūki flying. With the
Tailed Beast Mode
 and
B
's full transformation at their limits,
Kurama
 and Gyūki tell Naruto and B to buy them some time while they generate more
chakra
 to use. As the opposition notices this, and his team-mates already somewhat incapacitated, Naruto prepares to create more shadow clones which Madara chides him for, calling him incompetent.
Kakashi
 also echoes these sentiments and Obito goes on to explain to Naruto that no matter how much he multiplied something, its nature would never change. He goes on to lament that all shinobi were powerless and that one day, they would all end up like he did. This causes Naruto to lash out at Obito once again stating his dream to become
Hokage
 which leads Obito to tell him that he would make him the Hokage inside the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
, and as the Ten-Tails prepared to fire a Tailed Beast Ball, asked that Naruto vanish together with this world. As the ball fires, the shinobi are shocked to realise that the beast had missed. Just then, from above,
Ino
,
Hinata
,
Hiashi
 and a few others arrive and it is revealed that Ino was able to shift the blast after taking
control
 of Obito for a split second. Immediately, several
Aburame
 use the
Insect Jamming Technique
, and a group of
Kirigakure
-nin
shroud
 the battlefield in mist to stop them from being sensed. Shortly after this, the entire
Allied Shinobi Forces
 arrive at the battlefield, causing the
Sensing Water Sphere
 at headquarters to distort. The Ten-Tails swipes one of its tails to clear the mist, and several shinobi use
Wind Release: Wind Cutter Technique
 to cancel the blast. Naruto announces that they were no longer a disorderly crowd before announcing a new technique — the "
Allied Shinobi Forces Technique
" — which is the strongest technique that ever existed in the shinobi world and that it could win against the Infinite Tsukuyomi.

Chapter 612

"
Allied Shinobi Forces Technique!!
" (
忍連合軍の術!!
,
Shinobi Rengōgun no Jutsu!!
)

Despite the swell in numbers of their opponents,
Madara
 and
Obito
 note that their efforts were still futile and that even after this war, history would only repeat itself and they would end up in this very same predicament.
Naruto
 chastises them both noting that when there was a difference of opinion in a group, the majority should rule. Accepting his premise, Obito simply notes that they would make their decision after exterminating the Alliance. Using this time
Shikaku
, through
Inoichi
's
telepathic
 ability, is able to relay the strategy he had formulated with the entire Alliance. With this, the Alliance launch their strategy, the first step being to slow down their targets by blinding them, which was executed by the
Kumo
-nin, with
C
 and a few others using the
Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar
 technique followed by
Darui
, and other
Storm Release
 wielders using the
Storm Release: Laser Circus
 technique to create a cloud of dust. Secondly the
Suna
-nin use the
Wind Release: Air Current Wild Dance
 to manipulate said dust to obscure their opponent's vision once again, adding it to what remains of the
Insect Jamming Technique
 and
Hiding in Mist Technique
 from earlier to completely impair the opponents'
sensory
 skills. Following this,
Kitsuchi
 and a group of
Iwa
-nin
sink
 the beast into a hole allowing
his daughter
, and other
Lava Release
 users to cover the beast in
quicklime
 which was mixed with
water
 by the
Kiri
-nin. Finishing off, members of
Konoha
's
Sarutobi clan

hardened
 the mixture using
Fire Release
. This leads Madara to state how surprised he was that
shinobi
 from different countries were able to pull off such a perfect combination. Shikaku informs them that they have to defeat Madara and Obito while the
Ten-Tails
 was still restrained recommending the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
 to coordinate with Naruto to exploit Obito's weakness and telling all shinobi who were skilled in
taijutsu
 to deal with Madara. As the Allied Ninja Forces bear down on them, Madara and Obito stare disdainfully as Obito notes that they clung onto hope that did not exist and that the Ten-Tails had finally reached maturity.

Chapter 613

"
Head
" (
頭
,
Atama
)

As various shinobi as well as techniques bear down on the two
Uchiha
,
Madara
 realises that they were being targeted this time. He notes, however, that in order to do that, the Alliance would have had to stop the
Ten-Tails
 first. With this, a powerful blast sends the incoming shinobi flying away and the further-matured Ten-Tails emerges from the pit. While the medical teams move out to tend to the injured,
Shikaku
,
Inoichi
,
Ao
 and the others discuss what was happening on the battlefield. Now finding it even harder to control the beast,
Obito
 and Madara use
Hashirama
's cells in order to fortify their control over the beast as the former agrees with the legendary Uchiha that it was time they showed the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 true despair. As the beast fires off a
Tailed Beast Ball
,
Kitsuchi
 is able to deflect its course using
Earth Release
 underfoot the beast. A second Tailed Beast Ball is launched which detonates in a nearby lake and a third which
Hiashi
 notes, destroys an entire town in an instant. Initially believing that the towns where the civilians were, was now unsafe, the fourth Tailed Beast Ball which is launched is noted to be heading straight for HQ as Shikaku surmised. As Inoichi asks for directives, Shikaku tells him that the only thing they could do was what they were assigned to until the very end, and for what appears to be the final time, Inoichi patches Shikaku through to the entire Alliance as the genius
Nara
 passes on his final strategy to defeat the enemy. Meanwhile, on the battlefield, Madara exclaims that they were finally able to get them with the Tailed Beast Ball, noting that it was a simple war tactic to take out the "
head
" of their opposition.

Chapter 614

"
By You
" (
お前に
,
Omae ni
)

Though
Chōji
 tries to console his best friend,
Shikamaru
 reminds him and
Ino
 that they were in the middle of war and that there was no time for unnecessary conversation, and that they had to carry out his father's strategy. Confused,
Naruto
 begins to question the situation, but before they can explain that
Inoichi
 and
Shikaku
 had been killed, the
Ten-Tails
 attacks once more. Leaping into action,
Neji
 and
Hiashi
 are able to
deflect
 the beast's attack, and as everyone begins to praise the
Hyūga clan
, Hiashi tells Naruto that he had to focus and that in war people might die, but if they lost the war, everyone would die. As he assures them that Inoichi and Shikaku were proud as
shinobi
 to have died before their children, Neji echoes his uncle's sentiments, referring to his own
father's sacrifice
. With this Neji, Hiashi, and
Hinata
 declare that they would protect him until the very end. Meanwhile atop the Ten-Tails,
Madara
 and
Obito
 discuss how to proceed with their plans and the fact that in order to become the beast's
jinchūriki
, Madara required a living body which could only be given by Obito
sacrificing
 his own, which left the legendary
Uchiha
, at the mercy of his descendant. With Obito deciding to teach the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 despair, the beast begins to attack again, sending
wooden projectiles
 flying towards the shinobi.  As the attacks are being deflected from Naruto by the Hyūga,
Kitsuchi
 builds his chakra in preparation to use his
signature technique
. With the beast's hand itself bearing down on the group, Hiashi uses the
Eight Trigrams Vacuum Wall Palm
 to deflect it. The beast then uses a pin-point attack which Hiashi realises they could not deflect in time. As Hinata throws out her arms to protect Naruto, Neji actually intercepts the attack, and while Naruto calls for the medics, Neji notes that it was already too late. As Hiashi looks on in horror and Hinata cries openly, Naruto questions why a genius from the Hyūga clan would throw away his life for him, and Neji, who notes that he finally understood his father's feelings, states that it was for that exact reason that he did it: because Naruto called him a genius. With this, the
juinjutsu
 on Neji's forehead disappears as it seals away his
Byakugan
. Obito then taunts Naruto, questioning if it had not been him who stated that he would not let his friends die.

Chapter 615

"
The Connected Ones
" (

,
Tsunagareru Mono
)

Mocking
Naruto
's earlier statement that he would not allow any of his comrades to die,
Obito
 points out the many shinobi who had died from the
Uchiha
's
last attack
. While others around them also realise that
Neji
 was dead, and
Hiashi
 silently apologises to his
brother
 for failing to protect his son, Obito begins a tirade against Naruto's beliefs — leading
Madara
 to note that Obito had become a great deal like himself — sending Naruto spiralling into shock. As Obito beckons to Naruto to join their cause,
Hinata
 snaps Naruto out of his trance-like state and reminds him of what Neji had said before dying as well as what, and why they were here fighting, reaffirming Naruto's
ninja way
, sentiments echoed by
Kurama
 in the beast's own special way, reminding its host that
his

parents
 had also died in a similar manner to Neji. Meanwhile, atop the
Ten-Tails
, Madara notes that Obito seemed to be awaiting a response from Naruto, not long before Obito decides to act, which Madara chides him for his rashness causing possible harm to the Ten-Tails. Dismissing this, Madara has the beast prepare a
Tailed Beast Ball
 which is deflected by
B
 who launches himself at the beast's mouth in his
Eight-Tails
 form with his own Tailed Beast Ball. Shutting the beast's mouth with his head stuck in there, B launches the Ball which explodes inside the beast causing it to fall and writhe in pain. With her words getting through to him, Naruto rallies around, and, holding Hinata's hand, Naruto enters
Tailed Beast Mode
, prepared to face his opponents once again.

Taka
 and
Orochimaru
 arrive in
Konohagakure
 as they continue their journey to their destination, sensing
Naruto Uzumaki
's
chakra
 as they press on at
Sasuke Uchiha
's behest. Meanwhile on the battlefield, everyone looks on in shock at the shroud that had surrounded
Hinata Hyūga
, which a wounded
C

comments
 on. Advising Naruto of what had happened,
Kurama
 commended
Shikaku Nara
's analysis of its chakra before telling Naruto, who had got the gist of the situation, that using some
shadow clones
 would be fine. Dispersing the clones around the battlefield, Naruto begins tapping the shinobi on the battlefield, thus transferring Kurama's chakra which envelops them in the same manner it did Hinata. Moving to attack once again, the
Ten-Tails
' tail is
rebuffed
 by Hinata, which leads
Hiashi
 to marvel at the fact that she had used that simple technique, to such devastating effects. Also noticed by
Madara Uchiha
,
Obito Uchiha
 nonetheless sends out several more of the beast's tails to attack the shinobi which are subsequently blocked by
Chōji Akimichi
 and several other
enlarged
 members of the
Akimichi clan
. Signalling to his team-mates,
Ino Yamanaka
 and
Shikamaru Nara
 prepare their techniques while remembering the final words their
fathers
 had left them with. Just as Obito was about to fire off several
wooden projectiles
, Ino is able to
take control
 of the
Uchiha
 once again and veer the attack off-course. Following through with an attempt to instead crush the shinobi with its tail, the beast's body is
bound
 by
Shikamaru
 and several other
Nara
 who boldly declare that their clan wasn't to be underestimated. With
Rock Lee
 mourning the loss of his close friend and comrade,
Might Guy
 and
Tenten
 try to comfort him. Decrying Guy's words as nothing more that the prolonging of a curse, Kakashi and Naruto rebuff Obito's sentiments, and Naruto tells the Uchiha that shinobi were meant to endure and that even if remembering your friends was a curse, he did not care as he wanted to keep the real
Neji Hyūga
 in his heart forever.

Reflecting on
Naruto
's words,
Lee
 remembers his time with
Neji
 growing up, and as Naruto
transfers
 some of his chakra to Lee, the young man — now resolved — respectfully closes his fallen comrade's eyes. Amazed by the chakra which also surrounded him,
Kakashi
 reflected on his previous conversation with
Shikaku
 as
Kurama
 thought about Naruto's ability to match his own chakra with that of the different
shinobi
. Noting his lineage, Kurama silently mused to
Kushina
 and
Minato
 that their son had surpassed them, but notes that this is the power they wanted to pass onto their son. Meanwhile, atop the
Ten-Tails
,
Madara
 decides to lend a hand to
Obito
 and is able to break out of the
Nara clan
's
Shadow Imitation Technique
. With the beast's tails bearing down on the Alliance, several shinobi attack them, causing the great damage to the beast. As
Hiashi
 declares that Neji's sacrifice would not be in vain, Obito mocks him and has the beast surround them with its tails, thus creating a makeshift cage. Obito then notes the irony that Hiashi's clan had a system in place that essentially left persons in a "
cage
" just waiting to die. Despite this, the newly-empowered Alliance charges forward as Naruto notes that Neji's will was not dead just yet, cutting through the Ten-Tails with one of his
Rasenshuriken
. With Lee declaring that he would take care of Madara, Naruto's left arm, which was still dislocated, is fixed by
Hinata
 via her
Gentle Fist
. Reaching the
Uchiha
, Lee delivers a powerful kick that bisects Madara and Naruto throws his Rasenshuriken which
phases
 through Obito; both of these attacks successfully cut off the Uchiha's connection to the beast, causing them to retreat. With this, Naruto states that, unlike Obito, he did not want to cut off bonds with his comrades, nor did he want them to cut off the ones from them. Meanwhile in
Konohagakure
,
Orochimaru
 and
Taka
 seemingly arrive at their destination.
