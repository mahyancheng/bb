Summary

Karin
 warns
Sasuke
 about
Jūgo
, but he is not concerned. Knowing little about Jūgo,
Suigetsu
 asks what the problem is. Karin explains that Jūgo willingly became a prisoner of
Orochimaru
 in order to find a cure for his murderous impulses. By experimenting on Jūgo,
Orochimaru's Juinjutsu
 were created. With Orochimaru now gone, recipients of one of these cursed seals run rampant at the base where Jūgo is held. One escapes and finds Sasuke and the others approaching the base. He attacks them, but Sasuke quickly cuts him down.
