Gaara
 creates an eye out of
sand
 that hovers in the air wherever it's created. Gaara connects the eye with his
optic nerve
 using
chakra
, allowing him to see whatever is in the Third Eye's field of vision. The eye gives Gaara a useful method of performing surveillance without being noticed;
 in
Sakura Hiden
, Gaara manipulates the Third Eye's sand to allow it to double as a
listening device
. Gaara also uses the Third Eye when fully surrounding himself with the
Shield of Sand
, allowing him to be protected without sacrificing seeing what opponents are doing.
 In
Gaara Hiden
, Gaara is capable of creating several Third Eyes and connect each eye to his optical nerve at once, allowing him to observe things from multiple angles simultaneously.

Rasa

makes
 his Third Eye out of
Gold Dust
. Rasa, like Gaara, must close one of his eyes before he can see through the Third Eye.
 In the anime, Shinki has displayed the ability of creating multiple Third Eyes with his
Iron Sand
, without the need of closing one of his, though it quickly drains his chakra.

Trivia

In Buddhism and Hinduism, the
third eye
 is considered to be the eye of knowledge and symbolises enlightenment, some deities being depicted with it.

In
Naruto: Shippūden
 episode 410
, the eye is depicted as blue, matching Gaara's eye colour.
