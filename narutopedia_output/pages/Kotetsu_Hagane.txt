Kotetsu Hagane
 (
はがねコテツ
,
Hagane Kotetsu
) is a
chūnin
 from
Konohagakure
.

Background

In the anime, captaining a
team

of

genin
, the shinobi were tasked with retrieving
Condor
 from the
Zeroth Training Ground
. Encountering the ostrich, he was beaten up multiple times, during which
Izumo Kamizuki
 arrived to assist him, followed by the pair
capturing
 Condor.

Personality

Kotetsu is never seen without his partner and best friend Izumo, whom he trusts explicitly in and out of combat. He is characterised as being the more carefree and irresponsible of the duo, more willing to shirk his duties to hang out in the
Jōnin Standby Station
 eating syrup, for example.
 Similarly, Izumo admonished Kotetsu's lack of pride in his work when the latter complained that they were simply
Tsunade
's errand-boys.
 He is also described as having an intrepid personality,
 as well as being curious by nature,
 which was seen from the time he and Izumo disguised themselves as
genin
 in order to see what type of people the new chūnin candidates were.
 Despite this, Kotetsu is a loyal and dutiful shinobi, with great love for his village and will carry out his missions despite complaining when they are trivial. Kotetsu was also noted to have great respect for
Asuma Sarutobi
 who established a great record in military prowess.

Appearance






Kotetsu in
The Last: Naruto the Movie
.



Kotetsu has long, spiky, black hair and dark eyes. He has a strip of bandage running across the bridge of his nose and a light-coloured marking on his chin,
 although it has the same colour as his hair in the anime. He wears the standard attire of a Konoha shinobi complete with a
forehead protector
 and a
flak jacket
. When deployed on missions, he usually carries a pair of
bladed weapons
 strapped to his back.

In
The Last: Naruto the Movie
, two years after the war, he has a slight difference in his appearance, donning the new standard Konoha flak jacket with high top sandals, and the
Uzumaki clan
 logo emblem on an armband on his left arm.

Abilities

As a
chūnin
, Kotetsu is a very capable shinobi. He is proficient in
genjutsu
, able to effectively make most of the genin participating in the
Chūnin Exams
 believe that they were on the third floor, which is where the written test would take place.

Bukijutsu






Kotetsu using his mace.



Kotetsu is skilled in melee combat. He carries two large
kunai-like blades
, which he and Izumo can use to simultaneously attack an opponent from either side.
 These kunai blades can also be attached with a chain to restrain an opponent.
 Perhaps, however, his greatest weapon is his
mace
, which he stores in a scroll.
 While his proficiency in it was not seen in the manga, in the anime, it was shown that it could perform aerial assaults and can burrow through the ground to attack from below.
 He has also been seen wielding a bō.

Izumo and Kotetsu disguised as genin.



Izumo and Kotetsu first appeared disguised, trying to convince those planning to take part in the Chūnin Exams not to bother.
Team 7
 recognised that they had cast a
genjutsu
 on the area, prompting them to give up in light of the group's skill. Seemingly somewhat impressed, Kotetsu attempts to attack
Sasuke Uchiha
 with a kick, which Sasuke reciprocates in kind only to be stopped by Lee. As they retreat and undo the transformation, he agrees with Izumo that the candidates this year seemed very interesting.






Kotetsu arrives alongside Ibiki and the other invigilators.



Later, Kotetsu and other chūnin arrive alongside Ibiki as invigilators of the first exam. Then, they sat on the outside of the examiners watching them for obvious sign of cheating, telling anyone who was caught five times that they had failed the examination. At one period in time during the exam, he threw a kunai onto the paper of a candidate that had failed, frightening Naruto as it had flown right past him.

He and Izumo were later seen together in the stands watching the preliminary matches. The two discussed Naruto's triumph over
Neji Hyūga
 and the talent that
Shikamaru Nara
 had shown in his battle, assuming he'd be an overall more suitable candidate than anyone else for promotion to the rank of chūnin.
