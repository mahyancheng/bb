Summary

Kiba
, remembering what a terrible student
Naruto
 was, claims that their fight will be an easy victory. He and his dog
Akamaru
, a permitted tool of battle, immediately attack, surprising Naruto by their speed and ferocity. Determined to not be looked down upon, Naruto writes off Kiba's attacks as pathetic. Kiba throws a
smoke bomb
 to block Naruto's vision while Akamaru attacks him. When the smoke clears Akamaru stands beside a defeated Naruto. Akamaru returns to Kiba but immediately bites him, being Naruto in disguise while a
shadow clone
 restrains the real Akamaru. The observers are impressed by Naruto's tactics.
