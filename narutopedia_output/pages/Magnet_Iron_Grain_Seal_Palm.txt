Shinki uses his
Iron Sand
 to seal an individual in a sphere. As long as the user is alive, the seal will remain active and the individual will be in stasis. Only the user can release the seal. The seal also keeps the victim alive, even if they have what would otherwise be fatal injuries, buying time for a medic ninja to heal them,
