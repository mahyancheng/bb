Team 15
 is a shinobi team from
Konohagakure
, led by
Hanabi Hyūga
, consisting of
Sumire Kakei
,
Wasabi Izuno
, and
Namida Suzumeno
. In the anime, after Sumire resigned from Team 15 to join the
Scientific Ninja Weapons Team
, she was replaced by
Tsubaki Kurogane
, making Team 15 the first official shinobi team to include a
samurai
.

The team participated in the
Chūnin Exams
, and although they were able to pass the first phase, they were eliminated in the second phase, having had their flag stolen from
Team Yurui
.

Team 15 temporarily began having declining success rates in their missions after Tsubaki joined. Primarily due to the lack of teamwork between herself, Wasabi and Namida. This later changed when Tsubaki learned not to attempt completing missions with her strength alone. Following Wasabi's chūnin promotion, she was appointed as team captain as Team 15 became a three-person team.
