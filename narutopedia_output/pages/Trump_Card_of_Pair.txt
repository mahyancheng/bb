Naruto creates several shadow clones to charge towards and beat the opponent before kicking the opponent into the air. Naruto and Sasuke each form a Rasengan and Chidori that they both use on the falling opponent.

Trivia

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3
, the technique is slightly changed as Naruto and Sasuke only thrust Rasengan and Chidori without shadow clones attacking them.
