With the body modifications of the
Asura Path
, the user can open parts of their body to reveal a cannon that fires a massive blast of chakra with explosive power strong enough to devastate an entire area.
 When
Nagato
 used this through his
path
, he opened the body's head to reveal the chakra cannon, and when he did so himself after his
reincarnation
, he used an arm-mounted cannon.
