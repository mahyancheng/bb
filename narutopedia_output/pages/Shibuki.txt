Shibuki
.

Shibuki
 (
シブキ
) is a
chūnin
 from
Takigakure
, who succeeds his
deceased father
 as
village head
.

Background






Shibuki as a child with his father.



Shibuki was born as the son of Hisen, the previous leader of the village. At some point, when Shibuki was very young, Takigakure became under attack from foreign powers and, during the fight, Shibuki's father died, after drinking the
Hero Water
 in order to protect the village. At some later point, Shibuki was trained by
Suien
, before the former's defection. As the leader of the village, Shibuki took great care in keeping
Fū
 protected. He also taught the kunoichi the importance of friendship and loyalty.

Personality

Due to his father's early demise, Shibuki became very cowardly, to the extent that being startled by a bird sent him into a near panic. Even though Shibuki is timid, he is a competent leader, and always comes through when necessary. As stated by Suien, Shibuki has a soft spot for the children of Takigakure. He can also be quite curious, as seen when he tried to read
Icha Icha
 over
Kakashi's
 shoulder. Over time, Shibuki has appeared to become more composed and self-confident, able to make thought-out decisions for the benefit of his village.

Appearance






Shibuki in his shinobi attire.



Shibuki has ink black eyes and has long, dark brown hair. He also wears a forehead protector symbolising his shinobi status. He wears grey pants, a green shirt, and shinobi sandals. In addition to his outfit, he has grey shoulder pad on his left shoulder with a brown strap over. As a village head, Shibuki wears a light yellow kimono jacket and light grey pants with a red scarf around his neck and a turquoise haori. He also ties his hair in a lower ponytail.

Abilities

Despite his lack of confidence, Shibuki is shown to be a fairly capable battler, demonstrating proficiency in several
water
-type techniques, ranging from
tornadoes
 and
dragons
, to
swords
, through his use of the latter, he is also competent in
kenjutsu
. Shibuki has also proven to be quite resilient, surviving a serious stab wound that pierced his abdomen and exited out his back, and still being able to stand and perform techniques despite his injury.

He also had the
Hero Water
 to increase his chakra several times for a duration, at the cost of a small portion of his lifespan.

Part I

Mission: Protect the Waterfall Village!






Shibuki after drinking the Hero Water.



Shibuki is first seen cowering behind
Sakura Haruno
 while Team 7 was protecting him after a bird flew out of nowhere and surprised him. Though he is often cowardly, his entire village loves him and sees him as a hero. The children especially seem to like him.

When Takigakure was attacked by his former teacher, Suien, upon his return, he was forced to make a terrible choice: to either protect the Hero Water and let his villagers be killed, or give up the water which Takigakure treasured.
Naruto Uzumaki
 convinced him a hero is willing to sacrifice himself for those they care about, like Shibuki's father had done.

He ended up drinking the Hero Water in an attempt to defeat his former master, but was unable to win even with the advantage. The combined efforts of Naruto and
Sasuke Uchiha
, however, finished the job. Although the hero's water is usually fatal, Shibuki survived, and became a better leader for his people.

Konoha Plans Recapture Mission

When
Tsunade
 mentioned that a training exercise would be taking place in Takigakure, a scene in the village showed Shibuki with his back turned to the camera. He was directing the other ninja present.

Interlude

In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths






Shibuki allows Fū to compete in the Chūnin Exams.



Shibuki received the invitation of the joint
Chūnin Exams
 held by
Konohagakure
 and
Sunagakure
, and agreed for
Fū
's participation where he believes that this would be a good chance to show the village's strength to receive more job requests. He, however, warns her to be cautious, and also not to reveal her status as a
jinchūriki
, instructing
Kegon
 and
Yōrō
 to protect Fū.

Trivia

"Shibuki" (
飛沫
) literally means "splash".

Shibuki is the only
OVA
 character that has appeared in both
Naruto

Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.
