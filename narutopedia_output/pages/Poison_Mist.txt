This technique combines ninjutsu, chemistry, and medical knowledge, thus requiring fine
chakra
 control and advanced ability in
medical ninjutsu
. The user converts chakra in their body into a special chemical that they then exhale from their mouth. When the chemical comes into contact with the air, it becomes a cloud of poison. Breathing in even a small amount of the poison will cause immediate death.

The Poison Mist used by
Ibuse
 differs from that used by
Shizune
. Rather than kill those that inhale it, Ibuse's causes victims to become paralysed after only a few seconds, allowing
Hanzō
 to attack them at his leisure with his
kusarigama
. Ibuse must first generate and store the poison within his body for five minutes before he can use it.

Trivia

Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3
, almost every character can use this technique by finding a Poison Book for Shizune.

In
Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
, "
Ibuse's Poison Mist
" is part of
Hanzō
's moveset.
