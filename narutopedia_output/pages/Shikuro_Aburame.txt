Shikuro Aburame
 (
油女シクロ
,
Aburame Shikuro
) was a
shinobi
 from
Konohagakure
's
Aburame clan
.

Background

Shikuro was one of the few Aburame to use the rare
rinkaichū
.
Tobi
 claims Shikuro and his kin had the
antidote
 to their poison as well as having the antibodies in their blood to make them immune to their poison.
 His son,
Torune
, was known to possess these insects as well. In the anime, it was revealed that Shikuro died while his son was still young, leading Torune to be raised by
Shibi Aburame
.

Abilities

Like all other Aburame, Shikuro's body was used as a
host
 to house insects. However, unlike most other Aburame who use
kikaichū
, Shikuro had
rinkaichū
 which, instead of consuming an opponent's
chakra
 were used to destroy their cells with
poison
.

Trivia

Shikuro's name may be a corruption of the Japanese romanization of the word cyclone, "Saikuron" (
サイクロン
), similar to his son and
Tatsuma
, who may be named after tornadoes, and fellow clansman
Harika
 after hurricanes.
