Synopsis

Omoi
 and his team-mates approach the genin and question them about the recent events.
Konohamaru
 and
Mugino
 arrive before a fight breaks out. Omoi and Konohamaru compare intel. Omoi recognises the poison and murder weapon used on
Sakuya
 as belonging from
shinobi
 from the
Land of Haze
. He spirals thinking of worst case scenarios. Knowing that
Hashirama
's cells are unstable, they determine the route the Haze shinobi are most likely to take. The Haze shinobi go on their way, checking for pursuers.
Deepa
 kills various looters at Fushū Castle as he investigates the whereabouts of the Hashirama Cell. The Haze shinobi alternate carrying the Hashirama Cell and think back about
Yoruga
.
 Deepa catches up to the
Konoha
 and
Kumo
 shinobi, and finds out they don't have the cells. The Kumo shinobi stay behind to fight Deepa, while the Konoha shinobi continue after the Haze shinobi.
Asaka
 notices approaching pursuers, so
Yūga
 offers to stay behind and stall them. The Kumo shinobi manage to shock Deepa with clones, but he fakes being paralysed, managing to defeat
Marui
 and
Kakui
 when they approach. The Konoha shinobi find the Haze shinobi's tracks. Deepa has no problems blocking or evading all of Omoi's attacks. The Konoha shinobi find it strange the Kumo shinobi have not yet joined them, and wonder about who Deepa is. Yūga intercepts them.
