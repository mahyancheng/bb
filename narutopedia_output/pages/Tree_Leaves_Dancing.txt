"
Tree Leaves, Dancing…!!
" (
木の葉、舞い…!!
,
Konoha, Mai…!!
) is chapter 109 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Naruto
 leaps into the arena to ask
Shikamaru
 why he would forfeit a match he was clearly winning. The observing veteran ninja recognise that Shikamaru was fully aware of his abilities and was not willing to claim victory just to risk his safety in a later match, the true mark of a
chūnin
.
Lee
 and
Guy
 arrive at the stadium to watch the finals, but are surprised to learn that
Neji
 was defeated by Naruto. Lee is happy for Naruto. With all of the other first-round final matches done, the audience wonders if the remaining match between
Sasuke
 and
Gaara
 will occur. Sasuke arrives with
Kakashi
 at the last moment, allowing the match to proceed.
