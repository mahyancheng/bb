Hinata Uzumaki
 (
うずまきヒナタ
,
Uzumaki Hinata
,
née

Hyūga
 (
日向
)) is a kunoichi of
Konohagakure
. Formerly the heiress of the
Hyūga clan
, she lost the position upon being deemed unsuited for the responsibilities of leading the clan. Nonetheless, Hinata
persevered
 and from her observation of
Naruto Uzumaki
 especially, Hinata found an example to follow. Through her membership with
Team 8
, she sought to become strong enough to change herself, if even a little at a time. A few years after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Hinata joined the
Uzumaki Clan
 after marrying Naruto.

Background






Hinata and Hanabi fight for the heiress position.



Hinata is the oldest daughter of
Hiashi Hyūga
. When she was still a child, Hinata was almost kidnapped by the-then
Head Ninja
 of
Kumogakure
, who was visiting Konoha under the guise of signing a peace treaty between their two villages. Hiashi killed him and saved Hinata, setting in motion the events that would become known as the "
Hyūga Affair
".

Because Hiashi was the head of the Hyūga clan, Hinata was raised to be its heiress and her family expected great things from her. But even at a young age, her father came to believe that Hinata was not suited for the role of heiress, as she struggled under his gruesome training regime, on top of him also believing that her timid personality prevented her from truly excelling. When Hinata's younger sister
Hanabi
 started displaying superior talent, Hiashi began to reconsider Hinata's selection as heiress. In the anime, Hinata and Hanabi were pitted against each other to determine who would one day lead the Hyūga. Because Hinata was unwilling to harm Hanabi - a hesitation Hanabi did not share - she was defeated, disappointing her father.
 Hinata was then disinherited and turned over to the care of
Kurenai Yūhi
.






Hinata meets Naruto.



On the day of her enrolment in Konoha's
Academy
,
 Hinata was picked on by three bullies because of her
unusual eyes
. Naruto, despite not knowing her, immediately came to her defence, but he was outnumbered and knocked unconscious, and the bullies damaged the red scarf he was wearing. When he regained consciousness, Hinata thanked him for helping her and returned his scarf to him, but he let her keep it. Hinata started watching Naruto from that point onwards, and by doing so saw Naruto's desire to gain attention and his struggle to exceed the extremely low expectations others had for him. Despite this, Naruto never lost faith in himself or his dream to become the
Hokage
. Hinata was inspired by this and started emulating Naruto, adopting his refusal to never give up as a means of earning her father's approval. In the anime, Hinata's growing affections for Naruto were noticed by the Hyūga's elders, who warned her to stay away from him.

Personality






Hinata's anxiety kicks in.



As a child, Hinata was soft-spoken and polite, always addressing people with proper
honourifics
. She is kind, always thinking of others more than for herself, caring for their feelings and well-being. She doesn't like being confrontational for any reason. This led to her being meek or timid to others, as her overwhelming kindness can render her unable to respond or act for fear of offending somebody.
 Her father's constant push to alter this personality trait when she was younger only made it worse, eroding Hinata's self-confidence and making her even more bashful because she gained so little faith in herself and opinions.
 Despite being disinherited, Hinata loves her family very much, as shown when she "agreed" to marry Toneri in order to rescue Hanabi even though she knew it meant breaking Naruto's heart and the possibility she and Toneri actually would get married.

Hinata's outlook sees a shift after her appointment to Team 8. Whereas her father and much of the Hyūga clan had decided she was a lost cause who would never amount to anything,
 her team considers her a valuable member with her special strong points. Originally, she would over-rely on her teammates, looking to them in times of difficulty to save her from situations that make her uncomfortable. It is for her teammates - among other reasons - that Hinata starts seeking to change herself, as she wishes to help the team rather than burden it.






Hinata dreams of being with Naruto.



Hinata's primary motivation is Naruto Uzumaki, with whom she has been fascinated since meeting him. He initially gained her attention because of his kindness to her and outspoken nature, and then kept her attention because of similarities that Hinata perceived to herself: Naruto had a painful childhood without the love of parents, a fate worse than the mere difficulty she had with her own father, and he craves the attention and acknowledgement of anybody, just as Hinata wants to please her father.
 But whereas Hinata lost faith in herself, Naruto always believed he can accomplish any given task if he tries hard enough. She admires him deeply for this courage and over time fell deeply in love with him, which manifests as increased shyness and speechlessness when around him, something that became apparent to everyone, apart from ironically Naruto himself. Hinata strives to prove herself to others, but mostly to gain the attention and worthiness of Naruto. She emulates him to this purpose, adopting his
nindō
 of never giving up to improve herself. To that end, she stops running from confrontation, instead doing all that she can to face it, even in the face of failure to keep trying, and willing to risk her life for her loved ones and village.
 By the end of Part I, her clan's faith in her is restored and strengthened.






Hinata's intimidating demeanour.



Throughout the years, Naruto remains her primary motivation; she willingly faced Pain to protect Naruto, despite knowing she has no chance of winning.
 She even defends Naruto from himself when he's in doubt, repeating to him his refusal to never give up.

Two years
 after the war, upon achieving her
greatest dream
 of having her love reciprocated by Naruto to form a deep and committed relationship together, she became more expressive about her feelings. In the anime, she is able to laugh openly because of it.
 After marrying Naruto and he becomes Hokage, Hinata remains supportive of him and his increased responsibilities, even though she yearns for him to be home more often. Valuing her family more than her ninja life, Hinata turned down becoming a jōnin just so she could focus more time caring for her family. As a mother and wife, she has become a master homemaker, keeping the family well-structured yet well-adjusted and happy. While very loving and supportive of her family, she is equally strict and assertive. Her newfound structured nature made her very intimidating and more easily angered when her family acts up, easily keeping them in line and swiftly punishing them for their misconduct.
 She is also insightful and wise with her words, realising that her children, particularly Boruto, take after Naruto in the desire to prove themselves to others and that she must believe in them to do things on their own.

Appearance

Hinata is a slender girl of fair-complexion and average height who, as a Hyūga, her most distinguishing trait is the
Byakugan
, giving her featureless white eyes (lavender in the anime). She is noted to be beautiful by Naruto and
Toneri Ōtsutsuki
.
 She has dark blue hair that she keeps in a bob-cut of different lengths: in Part I, her hair is cut just above her forehead akin to a bowl-cut with chin-length strands framing her face; in Part II, her hair reaches her lower back and the framing strands reach shoulder-length; in
The Last: Naruto the Movie
, her hair extends beyond her hips and she would at times tie it into a ponytail. By the time Boruto entered the Academy, she cut it into a bob-style reaching her shoulders.

In Part I, Hinata usually wears a cream-coloured hooded-jacket with a fire symbol on the upper sleeves and fur around the cuffs and hem. She also wears navy blue pants and keeps her
forehead protector
 loosely around her neck. In Part II, she dons a lavender and cream hooded-jacket with lavender cuffs over mesh armour. She also wears navy blue pants, black, low-heeled sandals, and changes the cloth of her forehead protector from blue to black. Hinata switches to the standard Konoha infantry
flak jacket
 and assorted clothing during the Fourth Shinobi World War, though she does not appear to wear a forehead protector.

Two years after the war, Hinata's mission attire is a form-fitting light lavender, sleeveless kimono-style blouse with vertical lines, tied with a dark purple obi around her waist and short dark navy shorts. She also wore thigh-high stockings with black, open-toed boots. She does not wear her forehead protector at all. Her outfits become more varied after that, changing to match the occasion or simply being more casual than her prior garb. During Hinata's and Toneri's wedding, she wore a  black long and sleeveless dress with a high collar, a long grey sash around her waist and matching long gloves. She also wore short puffy pants with black lace socks and sandals. On her head was a black turban with a black and light yellow veil over and yellow crescent moon earrings. During Hinata's and Naruto's wedding, she wore a traditional white kimono with a flower in her hair. After getting married, she consistently wears a light purple short-sleeved jacket, a long-sleeved white shirt with a two pink coloured strips underneath it, light brown shorts and purple open-toed boots. In the
Boruto
 manga, Hinata has a necklace with the Uzumaki symbol on it. She also wears her wedding ring on her left hand. She also wears a long light purple shirt, a dark vest over the shirt, short pants and small open toe shoes.

Abilities






Hinata repelling a Ten-Tails mini-clone with the Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms.



Originally, Hinata's meek nature hindered her performance, to which she was deemed too weak and unworthy for the role of Hyūga Clan heir.
 After committing herself to getting stronger in her training for Naruto, she began receiving consistent praise from her team and clan for her improving skills and strengthening character.
 Two years after the war, Hinata, having been recognised by
Hamura Ōtsutsuki
 as the Byakugan Princess, proves to be crucial in the destruction of the
Tenseigan
, even though she herself can't destroy it.

Over a decade later, Hinata's prowess continued to improve, reaching
Jōnin
-level prowess despite declining the promotion to it. Likewise, while unprepared and reluctant to fight Hanabi, an active jōnin and the next Hyūga Clan leader, Hinata proved was able to decisively defeat her sister in a match.

Chakra Prowess and Control






Hinata's Gentle Step: Twin Lion Fist using Hamura's chakra.



As a member of the Hyūga Clan, Hinata possess an innate ability to expel chakra from any of the 361
tenketsu
 in her body.
 Likewise, from her special clan training, Hinata has advanced control of her chakra. In the anime, Hinata's additional training during Part I allowed her to free herself from constraints
 and manipulate nearby water sources, turning them into
projectiles
.
 By Part II of the anime, Hinata's control proved on par with a
medical-nin
's, for which reason she is assigned to help perform the
Four-Corner Sealing Barrier
.

When she met Hamura, Hinata inherited some of his
chakra
 as a member of the Hyūga Clan's main house. It is the strength and purity of her chakra that attracts
Toneri Ōtsutsuki
. It is also because she is a member of the Hyūga clan's main house and direct bloodline from Hamura that she can touch and find the Tenseigan, something that someone without both could not do. However, she couldn't destroy it by herself, so she instead combinded her efforts with Naruto to accomplish such.

Byakugan






Hinata's Byakugan.



As a Hyūga, Hinata possesses the Byakugan, a
dōjutsu
 that grants her penetrative vision in a near-360° around herself, with a small blind spot at the back of the neck above the first
thoracic vertebra
.
 With it, she is able to assist others frequently in tracking, scouting the area for their target(s); by focusing her vision in a single direction, Hinata can see across vast distances, able to see at least 1 kilometre during her first Chūnin Exam, and reaching as far away as 20 kilometres by the battle against Toneri. Hinata's Byakugan grants her attacks pinpoint accuracy, which she can share with others to also improve their own.
 She can also use it in order to identify
genjutsu
, searching for the caster in the nearby area.
 In the anime, Hinata can use
infrared
 vision and magnify in to see tiny targets.
 By adulthood, the chakra sensitivity provided by the Byakugan allows her to pick up on the slightest presence of chakra.

Physical Prowess

As is traditional in her clan, Hinata has been extensively trained in the
Gentle Fist
 fighting style. In unison with her Byakugan, Hinata can attack accurately target an individuals'
chakra pathway systems
 and the 361 tenketsu that run along it, constricting or cutting off their chakra flow from only minimal contact.
 Although this enables Hinata to attack an opponent's internal organs, she can also use it in a supplementary function, such as by setting dislocated shoulders back in place.
 Even by Hyūga standards, Hinata has exceptional agility and coordination in her movements, able to seamlessly maneuver around obstacles with no wasted effort or loss of balance.






Hinata and Neji combining their Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palms.



While Hinata hadn't yet mastered her clan's more advanced techniques in Part I, in the anime, she created the
Protecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
 as an alternative, which effectively protects her and attacks anything within range with sharp streams of chakra emitted from her palms.
 By Part II, she had grown accustomed to more of her clan's techniques. This included the
Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists
, a technique that drains the target of their chakra where struck. Hinata can use the
Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm
 to attack targets outside her physical range or deflect incoming attacks,
 which increases in power if used in
conjunction with others
.
 She also mastered the
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
 in the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.
 Two years later, despite her chakra being suppressed and unable to access her Byakugan, she was able to physically fend of many of Toneri's puppets be he needed to intervene. By adulthood, she became well-known for her mastery of the Gentle Fist,
 her knowledge and understanding able instantly determine the nature and extent of one's damage caused by it.
 As an adult, she could even knock out a target with a single strike to their tenketsu.

Other skills

While Hinata doesn't usually use
ninjutsu
, by Part II, her
nature transformations
 included
Fire
 and
Lightning Release
.
 In the anime, she also demonstrated proficiency in
medical ninjutsu
, able to use the
Mystical Palm Technique
 to heal the wounded.
 Hinata is also proven to be a very talented knitter and cook.

Prologue — Land of Waves

Main article:
Prologue — Land of Waves

In the anime, while the graduates of her
Academy
 class are being assigned to teams, Hinata hopes that she will be on the same team as
Naruto Uzumaki
. To her disappointment, she is instead added to
Kurenai Yūhi
's
Team 8
, along with
Kiba Inuzuka
 and
Shino Aburame
. Kurenai reports this to Hinata's father,
Hiashi Hyūga
, but he is unconcerned and in fact abandons Hinata to Kurenai's care, feeling she is unworthy of the
Hyūga clan
.

Chūnin Exams

Main article:
Chūnin Exams






Hinata lets Naruto copy her test.



Despite how recently they graduated from the Academy, Kurenai enters Team 8 in the
Chūnin Exams
 being held in
Konoha
; Hinata agrees to participate because she wants to change herself. For the exams' first stage, Hinata is seated next to Naruto as they take a written test. The objective in the first stage is to cheat off of other examinee's paper without getting caught, but Naruto doesn't realise this and agonises about potentially failing. Seeing this, Hinata offers to let him copy off of her paper. He suspects she's trying to trick him, but she assures him that she only wants to be helpful. Although he considers taking her up on her offer, Naruto ultimately declines, fearing that he'll get her disqualified if they're caught and claiming that, besides, he isn't the type to cheat.






Team 8 paralyzed with fear from Gaara's bloodlust.



Although Naruto is given the opportunity to forfeit, he refuses to do so, and for his determination, he passes the first stage along with Hinata and their teams. For the second stage, participants enter the
Forest of Death
 with the objective of obtaining a set of two scrolls, one of which they are given at the start. Team 8 manages to collect their second scroll right after the second stage has started, and so they head for the centre of the forest where they're supposed to turn in the scrolls. Along the way, Kiba's partner,
Akamaru
, senses the
Three Sand Siblings
' fight with
Team Shigure
. Team 8 watches the fight from the cover of some nearby bushes and is horrified when
Gaara
 mercilessly kills all of Team Shigure. After they're certain Gaara won't kill them too, they proceed to the centre of the forest.

After passing the second stage, the remaining participants take part in one-on-one preliminary matches. During Naruto's fight with Kiba, Hinata's loyalties are torn; she wants to cheer for Naruto, but fears that would be rude to Kiba. When Naruto wins the fight, Hinata gives both him and Kiba some of the
Hyūga Clan Secret Ointment
 so that their wounds will heal faster. As he's being taken away to rest, Kiba pleads for Hinata to forfeit if she's matched against Gaara or her cousin,
Neji Hyūga
. She is indeed matched against the latter, a member of a Hyūga clan branch house who hates all members of the main house. Neji, like Kiba, tries to convince Hinata to forfeit, telling her that she's too meek and insecure to be a ninja. She begins to offer arguments in her defence, but Neji persists, claiming that she is fated to be a failure, a fact that he believes she's aware of due to her frightened reaction to what he says.






Hinata fights Neji.



Neji's words cause Hinata to cry, but also anger the watching Naruto, who insists that Hinata can change herself if she wants to and who encourages her to defeat Neji. Because Naruto has faith in her, Hinata refuses to forfeit and prepares to fight; Neji is surprised by the new confidence in her. Hinata and Neji exchange
Gentle Fist
-blows, but only Neji's are effective, which he reveals to be because he sealed her
tenketsu
 at the start of their fight. Although her attacks are ineffective against him, Hinata continues fighting, in the process enduring mounting internal trauma from Neji's counterattacks. Neji repeatedly tells her to forfeit, but Hinata refuses, unwilling to back down both as a matter of principle and because Naruto continues to cheer for her.






Hinata is saved from Neji.



Neji directly attacks Hinata's heart, leading all but Naruto to believe she's been defeated. When
Hayate Gekkō
 is about to declare Neji the winner, Naruto stops him and motions to Hinata struggling to her feet. Neji tells her that her attempts to fight her destiny are only bringing her harm, but she rebuts that his own attempt to fight the destiny of the branch house brings him even more harm. Neji is enraged and attempts to kill her, but he is stopped by the observing
jōnin
. Hinata collapses, the damage to her organs being too severe, and before she loses consciousness she sees Naruto checking on her; she wonders if she managed to change at all. She's taken away by a team of
medical-nin
 to be given emergency medical attention.






Hinata motivates Naruto before his fight with Neji.



After a month, on the day of the Chūnin Exams' final matches, Hinata has recovered somewhat. Although she's supposed to take it easy, she practices at the
Third Training Ground
. Naruto stops there on his way to finals and is glad to see she's better. Because he's scheduled to fight Neji, Naruto shares his concerns that he might not be strong enough to defeat him. Hinata says that she believes he is strong enough, and that even if he isn't physically strong he still has strength of perseverance: a willingness to keep trying despite apparent failure until he finally conquers his obstacle. She admires him for that. Naruto is put at ease, thanks her, and informs her that his impression of her as "weird" was wrong, as he actually likes her. Hinata is left speechless as he walks away. Later, Hinata watches Naruto's fight against Neji with Kiba. Seeing Naruto receive so many of Neji's attacks upsets Hinata and causes her internal injuries to begin bleeding again. Kiba gets an
Anbu
 (
Kabuto Yakushi
) to treat her. Although the Anbu heals her, she is rendered unconscious and thus is unable to watch Naruto's defeat of Neji.

Kamizuru clan

Main article:
In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths

In the anime, Konoha and
Sunagakure
 hold a joint Chūnin Exam two years after Naruto's departure, which Team 8 once again enters. During the first exam, Hinata, Kiba, and Shino are seated in different rooms and are tasked with getting a combined score of exactly 100 points on their written test despite their separation.
 Neji comes up with the idea for teams to communicate which questions to answer by producing vibrations on the walls. After the initial testing period is over, they are given a bonus question: each team must unanimously select one of their members to disqualify from the rest of the exams. Team 8 selects nobody, which is the correct answer and which qualifies them for the next phase.






Team 8 awaiting to begin the second stage of the Chūnin Exams.



Those who pass the first test must reach the
Demon Desert
 within three days in order to participate in the second exam. Ultimately,
Team 8
 were among the first 30 teams to make it. The following night, as all the genin were ready to eat dinner, everyone grew nervous about the overly-sweaty
Burami
 ruining the food, which caused the genin to quickly try to stop him, resulting in
Neji
 using the
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
 and accidentally destroying the food. As tension grew between everyone over the recent event, an all-out brawl began. Eventually everyone lost their desire to fight when Fū arrived with her optimistic ways.

Hinata faces off against Kazami.



Following a simple plan by Kiba, Team 8 began talking loudly for all to hear, waiting for another team with a Heaven scroll to come after them. Ultimately, they encounter
Team Kazami
, with Hinata facing off against
Kazami
. Deciding to make the first move Hinata begins
attacking
 Kazami. Realising Hinata's goal was to attack his
Chakra Pathway System

sharp air currents
 which she counters  using the
Protecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
. During the ensuing fight the other team is able to steal their scroll. Despite Team Kazami's attempts to prevent Team 8 from pursuing them, Shino is able to track them using his
kikaichū
.
 During their search, Team 8 is ambushed by Team Kazami, though they are able to escape thanks to Shino's
insect clone
. They regroup and then reengage battle against Team Kazami, with Kiba ultimately defeating them. With their own scroll back and with Team Kazami's scroll now in their possession, Team 8 heads to the centre of the desert to turn in the scrolls.

Team 8 eventually gets lost in a sandstorm along the way.
 They are rescued by one of the exam's proctors, who brings them to where all of the other examinees are being assembled. They are informed that the Chūnin Exams have been cancelled; reports on the participants' performances will be sent back to their villages, leaving their promotion up to their superiors.

, is not as fortunate, but he refuses Hinata's attempts to find him medical attention. Hinata watches as Naruto fights Pain alone, initially obeying Katsuyu's and Kō's instructions not to interfere. After Naruto is captured by Pain's
Deva Path
, however, Hinata does not hesitate to come to his defence, forcing the Deva Path away from him. Naruto pleads for her to run away, telling her that she can't defeat Pain. Despite knowing this already, she tells Naruto that she will fight Pain because, after years of watching him and improving herself by following his example, Hinata loves Naruto and will do what she can to protect him.

Hinata starts attacking the Deva Path with her
Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists
. In the anime, she succeeds in removing some of the
black receivers
 that restrains Naruto and even hitting the Deva Path, but the outcome remains the same: the Deva Path quickly defeats her with
Shinra Tensei
. The Deva Path then stabs her with another black receiver, leading Naruto to believe Hinata has been killed and thus causing him to enter a
version 2
 form. Hinata, however, is still alive, and when
Team Guy
 finds her, Neji gets her immediate medical attention.
Sakura Haruno
 heals Hinata's injuries, allowing her to tearfully join in the village's celebration when Naruto returns after defeating Pain.

Hinata attends the Hyūga clan meeting to discuss upcoming war.



In the anime, Hinata was present at the Hyūga clan meeting convened by her father, Hiashi. After hearing Hiashi declaration that Neji was to lead the clan's forces during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, she was quite shocked. After the meeting she overheard Kō contest with her father about his decision, reminding him of how much Hinata had grown and that she was from the main house. Hiashi, however, told him that it wasn't because he lacked faith in Hinata but because she still lacked enough self-confidence to lead the shinobi during war.

Later, Hinata met with Kurenai and was told that several members of the Konoha 11 have encountered Naruto while he travelled to the
Land of Lightning
. When Hinata was summoned to a meeting with the
Fifth Hokage
, she was hopeful that she would also get sent on such a mission. After much searching for where exactly the Hokage was, Hinata was disappointed to learn that the Hokage only wanted to discuss Neji's selection to lead the Hyūga during the approaching Fourth Shinobi World War. She was later invited to
Yakiniku Q
 to have dinner with other girls in her age group. The dinner's conversation turned to Naruto, during which Hinata realised that she doesn't need to go on a mission with Naruto to be able to help him.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Main article:
Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Hinata and Neji protecting each other.



When the Fourth Shinobi World War begins, Hinata is placed alongside Neji in the
Second Division
. Their entire division is sent to intercept a large segment of the
White Zetsu Army
, which Neji and Hinata
join forces
 in attacking after
Kitsuchi
 unearths the Zetsu army. Although the Zetsus suffer heavy casualties, their numbers are too great and the fight becomes one of attrition. After a day of fighting, Neji collapses from exhaustion, at which point Hinata takes responsibility for monitoring the Second Division's perimeter with her Byakugan. Shino encourages her not to over-exert herself, but she assures him that she doesn't mind since she's fighting to keep Naruto safe.

In the anime, Hinata, Kiba, and Shino investigate a possible breach of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
' perimeter. They discover several White Zetsus within Allied territory, and in the fight to destroy them Hinata is knocked unconscious. One Zetsu
impersonates her
 and successfully pretends to be her for a time using its knowledge of her feelings for Naruto, but Kiba and Shino eventually discover it and, after defeating it, rescue Hinata.
 On the second day of the war, Hinata helps members of the Second Division escape the area of Neji's fight with the
reincarnated

Kidōmaru
. She later finds Neji unconscious with Kiba and
Akamaru
. Hinata examines their bodies with her Byakugan and discovers that their chakra flow has completely stopped. She reports this to
Inoichi Yamanaka
, who is able to use the information to help Naruto save them. Hinata tearfully hugs Neji when he wakes up.






Naruto saves Hinata from disguised White Zetsu.



With all levels of the Allied Shinobi Forces infiltrated by disguised White Zetsus, Hinata and the others are placed on high alert due to periodic surprise attacks by what they thought were their allies. When Naruto reaches the Second Division's location he starts identifying and defeating the disguised Zetsus, including three that attempt to attack Hinata. Although Neji is suspicious that Naruto may also be a White Zetsu, Hinata insists it's the real Naruto, which she can tell by looking in his eyes. Hinata apologises to Naruto for the suspicion he's receiving and regrets that he is still needing to save her when she's the one trying to fight for him. Naruto reassures her that she's strong enough to look after herself; he's merely returning the favour for all the times in the past she's helped him. She silently thanks him as he leaves.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax






Hinata preparing to sacrifice her life to shield Naruto.



Hinata and the rest of the Allied Shinobi Forces are sent to assist Naruto in his battle with the
Ten-Tails
. Recognising how crucial Naruto is to the war's victory, Hinata, Neji, and Hiashi join forces to block attacks directed at him. Neji and Hiashi quickly become preoccupied protecting other Allies from the Ten-Tails too, leaving only Hinata to defend Naruto. The Ten-Tails fires several volleys of
wood
 projectiles at him, which Hinata uses her body to defend him from. Neji in turn uses his body to defend her and is mortally wounded because of it. Watching Hinata crying for him as he dies, Neji observes that Hinata was willing to die for Naruto, which he uses as evidence that Naruto is responsible for more lives than his own. He then dies from his injuries.






Naruto shares Kurama's chakra with Hinata.



Naruto is disheartened by the deaths of Neji and others in the Alliance. When he starts to show signs of giving up, Hinata brings him back senses by reminding him of his vow to not let any of his friends die. Although Neji may be dead, he will live on so long as others continue the fight that he gave his life for. Therefore, Naruto must stay true to the creed he has been using for so long and that she has long since adopted for herself: to not give up. Naruto's resolve is renewed and he thanks her for standing by his side. He then takes her hand and transfers some chakra to her, giving her a
version 1
-like shroud that protects her and augments her attacks against the Ten-Tails.

As Naruto leads the Alliance's attacks against the Ten-Tails, his arm becomes dislocated. Hinata sets it back in place, allowing him to remove the Ten-Tails from the control of
Madara
 and
Obito Uchiha
. The extended fighting eventually starts to tire Naruto out, so Hinata rallies a defence around him while Sakura Haruno heals him. She later joins Team 8's attack on the
Ten-Tails' clones
: she starts performing the
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
 on a
Ten-Tails

mini-clone
, but stumbles midway and fears she may not be able to complete it. By thinking of Neji and Naruto, she finds the resolve to follow through to its end and defeats the clone. She then prepares to use her
Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists
.

When the Ten-Tails suddenly disappears from the battlefield, Sakura asks what Hinata saw with her Byakugan. Hinata explains that she saw the Ten-Tails being absorbed into Obito, meaning he has become its
jinchūriki
. Because of the abilities this grants Obito, Hinata and most of the rest of the Alliance stand no chance against him and must leave the fighting to others such as Naruto and Sasuke. But Hinata remains alert for opportunities to contribute and pitches in when they emerge, first by joining the rest of the Konoha 11 in hitting Obito with one of Naruto's
Rasengan
, and then by assisting the rest of the Alliance with pulling the tailed beasts' chakra from Obito's body.






Hinata caught in the Infinite Tsukuyomi.



With Obito defeated, Naruto goes off to fight Madara, leaving the Allied Shinobi Forces to fight a final
Zetsu
. As they struggle against the Zetsu, Kiba senses Naruto's return to their battlefield and Hinata seeks him out with her Byakugan. She becomes horrified as she notices that his heartbeat is slowing and runs to him to provide assistance, but she collapses from exhaustion midway and can only plead Neji to help Naruto. When Madara cast the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 upon the world, Hinata alongside most people are immobilised by the

The Last: Naruto the Movie






Hinata knits Naruto's present.



Two years after the war, as the
Rinne Festival
 approaches, Hinata decides to confess her feelings for Naruto by knitting a scarf for him, a replacement for the one he gave her when they were children. Although she completes the scarf, Hinata struggles to bring herself to give it to him, and it is only at the encouragement of Sakura and Hanabi that Hinata finally approaches Naruto. Once she finds him at
Ramen Ichiraku
, Hinata is intimidated, first by Naruto's many other
female admirers
, and then by the fact that he is already wearing a scarf that he clearly cherishes. Assuming she lost her chance to be with him, Hinata runs off. As she cries over the scarf alone, she is approached by
Toneri Ōtsutsuki
, who requests to be given the scarf instead. He captures her with his
puppets
 and they try escaping Konoha with her, but Naruto defeats the puppets and rescues her; the scarf she made is ripped in the battle.






Hinata links with Naruto.



In place of Hinata, Toneri is successfully able to kidnap Hanabi. Hinata requests to be added to the
team
 sent to rescue her. After leaving Konoha, Hinata is able to find Hanabi's trail using her Byakugan, which leads them to an underground passage. Shortly after entering the passageway, the team is trapped in a
genjutsu
 that dredges up old memories. While Hinata relives moments from her past that relate to Naruto, the scarf - which she's in the process of repairing - gets loose from her bag and wraps around Naruto, sharing her memories and corresponding feelings with him. Sakura is able to release them from the genjutsu and they start to continue ahead. Hinata is held back by Toneri, who expresses his desire to marry her. He explains that he has taken Hanabi's Byakugan for himself in order to carry out
Hamura Ōtsutsuki
's decree to destroy the Earth, after which he can create a new world with Hinata's help.

Hinata refuses his proposal and vows to save Hanabi on her own, to which Toneri observes that she doesn't know where Hanabi is. Naruto interrupts them and defeats Toneri, who turns out to only be another puppet. Toneri tells Hinata that he'll return later for her answer. Naruto and Hinata reunite with the rest of the team and exit the underground passage, arriving in what they later discover is the
Moon
's interior. They split up to explore the surrounding landscape, with Naruto spending more time with Hinata. He now displays a greater interest in her thoughts and well-being, pleasing Hinata and giving her greater resolve to complete the scarf. As she is about to confide in him what Toneri told her, the rest of the team locates them and asks Hinata to look at a crypt they've found. There, Hinata is confronted by another member of the
Ōtsutsuki clan
, who shows her visions of how to stop Toneri and who introduces her to Hamura himself, who asks her to save the Earth.






Naruto tells Hinata he loves her.



Hinata does not share her visions with the others and starts diligently trying to complete the scarf. When they make camp later that night, Naruto confronts Hinata and assures her they will save Hanabi. He also tells her that he loves her, leaving her speechless. Rather, when Toneri comes for Hinata's answer, she gives the finished scarf to Naruto with her goodbyes and leaves with Toneri. When Naruto asks Hinata if it's a lie that she will marry Toneri, she reluctantly does not deny it. Upon seeing Naruto being hit by Toneri's attack, Toneri immediately put her to sleep. After she wakes up in Toneri's castle, Hinata checks on Hanabi to make sure she's alright and locates the
Tenseigan
 that Toneri is using to control the Moon's movements against the Earth. She spends her time making yet another scarf, and when she has a chance she slips away to try to destroy the Tenseigan. She is found by Toneri's puppets and Toneri himself detains her. Hinata tries to reason with Toneri that Hamura never wished to destroy Earth, but he doesn't listen. After which Toneri destroys the new scarf, that is actually meant for Naruto, and places her under his control. After being placed inside a picture frame, Hinata shed a tear over her regret about "betraying" Naruto.

Hinata is forced to go through with a wedding ceremony, but as Toneri is about to kiss Hinata, Naruto interrupts the wedding. After Toneri leaves with her, Naruto is able to release her from Toneri's control, at which point she apologises to him for her earlier behaviour, though he states he already understands and forgives her. Toneri becomes distracted by his own awakening
Tenseigan
, allowing Hinata to escape with Naruto to the primary Tenseigan's location. Because she possesses Hamura's chakra, only Hinata is able to destroy it. However, she lacks the raw strength to do so, and must instead channel her chakra into Naruto so that they can destroy it
together
. With the Tenseigan gone, the Moon's movements stop and the puppets that the rest of the team is elsewhere fighting are rendered inert. The team reunites with them, bringing along a rescued Hanabi and the remains of Hinata's scarf. Even though it's in tatters, Naruto asks if he can have it anyway, which Hinata happily complies with.






Naruto and Hinata share their first kiss.



Toneri uses his own awakened Tenseigan to resume the Moon's movement towards the Earth. He then attacks them and captures Hinata, forcing her to watch as he tries to kill Naruto. Naruto ends up defeating him instead and Hinata, once freed, takes back Hanabi's eyes. Toneri tries to make one final attack and Naruto and Hinata prepare to face him together, but Toneri is knocked into space by the
statue
. Naruto saves him and Toneri gives up, allowing Hinata to tell him Hamura's true wishes: to protect the Earth, not to destroy it. Toneri is repentant and remains behind when they head home, vowing not to let the Moon endanger the Earth again. As they return through the same passage they used before, Hinata asks Naruto about the scarf he's been wearing. He tells her it was a gift from his
mother
, causing her embarrassment that she would be jealous. Upon hearing Naruto say that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her, Hinata sheds tears of joy. As the passageway disintegrates behind them, Naruto propels himself and Hinata back to Earth, where they share their first kiss.

seeing
 strange things that others couldn't, he asked Hinata about the Byakugan, which she explained to him.

Hinata advised Boruto to go to Hiashi for better answers about his dōjutsu.

Later, when she discovered that Boruto was skipping classes (thanks to a poorly written excuse from his classmate
Mitsuki
), Hinata quickly confronted her son. The following day, Hinata met with Shino and it was ultimately decided that Boruto would have to make up the time he missed with after-school classes. After Boruto left, Hinata talked more with Shino, apologising for the trouble Boruto was causing, noting that he wanted her husband's attention to the point where, like his father, Boruto wants to make a name for himself. Shino then convinced Hinata to talk to Naruto about Boruto's actions. When Naruto came home late briefly for a change of clothing, the two spoke. Naruto expressed regret at not being a more attentive father, feeling that his lack of actual parenting growing up made him subpar as one himself, Hinata insisted that for all of Boruto's actions, deep down he understands Naruto's responsibilities as Hokage.

Later, Hinata made a big feast to welcome Mitsuki. Much to her joy, Naruto was also joining them for dinner as he finished work early. However, as dinner was about to begin, learning from one of his dispersed clones, Naruto left to investigate a strange release of chakra spreading throughout the village.

Naruto is eventually rescued and life in Konoha returns to normal. After having breakfast with her family, Hinata starts to repair the damage Boruto received to his own jacket, but he asks her not to, believing it looks "cooler" while damaged, much to her pleasant surprise.

Hinata told her kids about Jiraiya's greatness as a ninja and how influential he was to Naruto, even becoming a father-figure. Later that night, Hinata found Boruto looking through Naruto's belongings for the
Icha Icha
 series, hoping to learn more about Jiraiya and the "wisdom" it gave. After glancing at a few pages and seeing its adult content, Hinata sternly forbade Boruto from reading the books, insisting that he was too young.

Instead, Hinata suggested that Himawari helped cheer Boruto on by helping her mother make a bento and deliver it to him.

In the following days, as Hinata continued to provide support for Boruto by bringing him lunches while training, she discovered that Sakura was growing concerned for Sarada's well-being in her own training, especially given the Uchiha's history with loss. Ino and Hinata decided to take Sakura out on a girl's night to talk.

Kara
, was able to infiltrate Konoha and critically injured Naruto and Sasuke in an attempt to reclaim Kawaki, Hinata and her family were relieved when Naruto made a quick recovery. Later, following Isshiki's permanent death, they decided to throw a welcome dinner party for Kawaki, to show he was truly welcomed in the Uzumaki home. While Kawaki asked to throw away a box of old magazines, Hinata watched a movie with Naruto with emotion. Later, Boruto rushed in to alert his parents that Kawaki had evaded surveillance and left the village.

When learning that Boruto and Kawaki were in trouble, Hinata was determined to help her husband in the rescue, only to be reminded that she needed to look after Himawari should the worst happen. She reluctantly conceded, praying for all of them to return safely.

When Boruto was called in for his first mission in a long time, Hinata cried, worried that this time he might not come back, despite his assurance he would return. After he left, Himawari told her she could help Boruto if she became a shinobi, and asked if it would make her worry more instead.






Hinata slaps her adopted son.



While preparing for dinner with Naruto, she wished that their sons, Boruto and Kawaki, could join them. She asked Naruto how long their mission might take. After leaving the house, Kawaki joined them, wanting to talk to Naruto. Kawaki expressed how much Naruto meant to him and how far he was willing to go to eliminate all the Ōtsutsuki, including Boruto. Hinata, hurt by hearing her own son say he would kill his brother, slapped him. Kawaki conceded that he might be insane for what he was willing to do, even if it meant killing his own brother. He then sent Naruto and Hinata away through a rift to prevent them from interfering, ready to bear their hatred and welcoming them to kill him when he was done. Naruto and Hinata were trapped in
Daikokuten
, suspended in time, unable to think, age, or require air or sustenance.

In later instalments of the
Clash of Ninja
 series
, Hinata is playable in an "awakened" form. In this form, her clothes are similar to what she wore during the
Bikōchū Search Mission
, though the form itself is not based on the events of that arc. Awakened Hinata has a personality similar to Neji's during the Chūnin Exams, arrogantly challenging opponents and boasting about the power of the main branch of the Hyūga clan. While in this form, she is also able to use techniques such as
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
 and
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
. Most
Clash of Ninja
 games require that this awakened Hinata be selected separately, but in
Clash of Ninja Revolution 3
, normal Hinata can transform into her in the middle of battle by activating her Byakugan. A similar form appears in
Ultimate Ninja 2
, dubbed "Byakugan Hinata", with the main difference being she wears the traditional Hyūga attire.

In several of the
Ultimate Ninja Storm
 games, the team combination of Hinata and Naruto is titled "Secret Lovers" or "Joined Hands".

Hinata is featured in the online game,
Fortnite
, as a playable skin, and she can be used with her Part II look as well as her new era look. Her Part II skin is labelled as "Hinata Hyuga", whereas her new era skin is labelled as "Hinata Uzumaki".

Quotes

(To
Neji
) "
I will never go back on my word… Because that too is my nindō, my ninja way!
"

(To herself) "
Naruto… I have always watched you… Watched you for many years… Why? I don't know why, but whenever I look at you… I feel more courage within me… It makes me feel like I can accomplish something if I try… It makes me feel like I am worth something…
"

(To
Naruto
) "
In my eyes… you're a proud failure! When I look at you, I get an intense feeling in my heart… Because you're not perfect… Because you fail… you have the strength to get back up… Because I believe that is what true strength is…
"

(To Naruto) "
I used to always cry and give up… I made many wrong turns… But you… You helped me find the right path… I always chased after you… I wanted to catch up to you… I wanted to walk beside you all the time… I just wanted to be with you… You changed me! Your smile is what saved me! That is why I'm not afraid to die protecting you! Because… I love you…
"

(To herself) "
Naruto… I've always been chasing after you… Even now… But once this war ends, I'm going to stop once and for all… Because next time, I will be by your side, holding your hand… walking with you! Please wait for me!!
"

(To Naruto) "
Neji just said… that your life is not just your own anymore… Do you understand what he meant? Your words and desire to not let your comrades die… Neither of them are lies! What inspired Neji and carried him this far were those very principles! It's not just you, Naruto… we all hold those same words and feelings within our hearts. They're what bind our lives together and make us comrades. If we all give up and discard those words and feelings now, Neji's sacrifice will have been for nothing… And that is when your comrades truly die, for you are no longer comrades then. That's how I feel… Therefore… stand up together with me, Naruto… Because never going back on one's word… is my ninja way too!
"
