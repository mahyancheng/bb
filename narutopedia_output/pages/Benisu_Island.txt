The
Benisu Island
 (
紅州島
,
Benisu-tō
,
literally meaning:
 Crimson Sandbank Island) is an island located somewhere in the south of the
Land of Fire
 and the
Land of Lightning

 So far, the only known shinobi from Benisu Island are the three members of
Team Bandō
. Their supposed leader,
Bandō
, refers to Benisu Island as a nation. A sign on
Nanakusa Island
 refers to the shinobi and/or people of Benisu simply as "The Benisu".
