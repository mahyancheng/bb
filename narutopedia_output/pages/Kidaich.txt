The insects after feeding on a target.



The
kidaichū
 (
寄大蟲
,
English TV:
 Parasitic Giant Beetles,
literally meaning:
 Parasitic Giant Insects) are a species of
beetle
-like insects that are bred and utilised by select members of the
Aburame clan
 as part of their
Parasitic Destruction Insect Technique
.

Though initially small in size, if provided with the incorrect amount of
chakra
, these insects immediately begin to devour the flesh of their host, causing them to undergo rapid growth to ultimately giant proportions.
 While this trait makes them effective at
damaging enemies
, as noted by
Shino Aburame
, it also makes these insects particularly troublesome to harbour even within the user's own body.

Trivia

According to the
Fourth Databook
, these insects are a favoured species of Shino's.
