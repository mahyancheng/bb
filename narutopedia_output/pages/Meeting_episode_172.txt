Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Nagato
 decides to indulge
Naruto
 and share the tale of how he came to be the leader of the
Akatsuki
. When he was young,
Amegakure
 was a war-torn battlefield, due to a war created by
Konohagakure
. One day, two Konoha
shinobi
 broke into his house in order to find food. Nagato's
father
 decided that they should leave quietly as to not alert the shinobi of their presence, only for Nagato to accidentally drop a vase. The Konoha shinobi then lunged at them, while Nagato's
mother
 shielded him. As both of his parents were killed with
kunai
, the shinobi realised that the two parents were not their enemies and attempted to apologise to Nagato for killing them. Nagato, enraged, activated his
Rinnegan
 and killed the two shinobi.

Now an orphan, Nagato took to the streets, where he soon collapsed in the rain out of hunger. He was brought back to consciousness by a dog whom he named
Chibi
, and the two travelled together. As Nagato and Chibi began to weaken from their hunger, a girl named
Konan
 approached them and offered them bread, and proceeded to take the two back to her hideout, where she lived with a boy named
Yahiko
. Yahiko explained to Nagato that they only had food because they stole it, and that thievery was a necessarily evil in order for them to survive. As the three
Ame Orphans
 and Chibi continued their thievery, Yahiko revealed his dream to Nagato — to become a god of the world in order to reshape it and eradicate war and poverty. However, their conversation was cut short by a kunai rigged with an
explosive tag
 that fell from above. The three orphans managed to dodge the blast, but Chibi did not. As Nagato and Konan mourned the dog's death, Yahiko noticed that the kunai came from a fight between
Hanzō
, the ruler of Ame, and the three legendary
Sannin
.

Yahiko declared that in order to protect themselves, they would find the Sannin and learn
ninjutsu
 from them. After returning the food they stole, with the exception of non-perishable items, the three orphans waded their way through the battlefield. They had almost been killed in an explosion, but were saved by Nagato, who used his Rinnegan to shield them from the blast. Eventually, they made their way to a cave, where they found the three legendary Sannin.

Trivia

Gamabunta
 is shown to be just slightly bigger than
Gamamaru
; however, in
Part I
, he was as tall as the
One-Tailed Shukaku
, towering over the forests. In addition, he retained that giant size both times when he came to
Konoha
, the
first time
 being when Naruto was told about
Jiraiya
's death and the
second time

when he arrived
 to battle Pain.
