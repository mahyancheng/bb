Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Shino
 begins teaching
shurikenjutsu
 to his class. Most of the class ignores his instructions.
Sumire
 struggles, while
Inojin
 and
Shikadai
, who were made to practice at home by their parents, breeze through it.
Metal Lee
 practices with ease at first, but when Inojin and Shikadai notice him, he becomes self-conscious, his performance suffering.
Boruto
 throws a
fūma shuriken
 at the target. Lee thinks he can deflect it, but with eyes on him, he falters, instead getting his foot stuck on the shuriken and getting dragged by it. Shikadai asks Boruto where he got a fūma shuriken, as they're not supposed to be using that yet.
 Boruto says he got it in a locker, which turn out to be
Iwabee
's. Shino calls everyone involved to his office, where he commands the ones involved to do voluntary work. They're assigned to help repair
Naruto
's face at the
Hokage Rock
, which Boruto damaged. After a break, they notice only Lee's part is missing, and getting anxious, he messes up his carving, causing more damage to Naruto's face. At the end of the day, Shikadai points out to Lee it's obvious he makes mistakes when nervous, and that sometimes it makes things worse for others. At home, Shikadai is scolded by his mother for getting into trouble.
Shikamaru
 isn't as concerned, and considers getting in trouble part of becoming a shinobi.
Temari
 scolds him as well. The next day, when Shikadai goes to apologise to Lee, Boruto notices the same darkness that took over
Denki
 over him with his right eye. Lee lures Shikadai away, and begins attacking him. Boruto and Inojin find them, and Lee attacks them as well. Lee chases the three through the Academy. Shikadai comes up with a strategy. Boruto distracts Lee with shadow clones, giving Shikadai an opening to pin his shadow, but Lee gets out of his range. Inojin distracts Lee with ink birds, and Lee gets paralysed. Another shadow paralysed him from another angle, revealing the real Shikadai, the previous one being a disguised Boruto, and the shadows he used actually ink snakes drawn by Inojin. Lee begins breaking free of Shikadai's hold, who urges Boruto to knock him out. Lee breaks free by accident, and knocks himself out, the darkness taking over him dissipating. When Lee comes to it, Shikadai apologises for the day before. The four head to class. At home, Boruto asks
his mother
 about the
Byakugan
, wondering about what he's seen. Naruto arrives exhausted, and goes straight to bed. The next day, Boruto, Shikadai and Inojin try getting Lee to play video games to get him less anxious, but he ends up breaking Boruto's game.
