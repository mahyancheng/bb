Kō Hyūga
 (
日向コウ
,
Hyūga Kō
) is a
shinobi
 from the main house of
Konohagakure
's
Hyūga clan
.

Background

In the anime, Kō was
Hinata
's caretaker for several years. It was his duty to watch over her whenever she was not at the
Academy
. He showed to have a great care and concern for Hinata's happiness and well-being, disheartened whenever he saw her sad. Kō often told her not to associate with
Naruto Uzumaki
, most likely because of the young boy's status as a
jinchūriki
. In fact, he accidentally mentioned the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 in Hinata's presence, but when she questioned him about it, Kō told her not to worry about such things.

During the
Konoha Crush
, Kō accompanied
Hiashi
 to rescue Hinata after she was kidnapped by a pair of
Kumogakure shinobi
. He stopped en route to aide
Tenten
 in defeating the
mud wolves
.

Appearance






Kō's casual look.



Kō has brown hair, which is short, with backwards spikes. He has featureless white eyes and his nose is broad and well-defined. He wears the standard Konoha uniform inclusive of a
flak jacket
 and
forehead protector
 that he wears like a bandanna. Casually, Kō wears the Hyūga clan's signature black kimono.

Abilities






Kō activates his Byakugan.



While little is seen of his abilities, the fact that he was tasked with protecting Hinata while Hiashi and Hanabi were away indicates that Kō is a very skilled shinobi. Like all members of his clan, he possesses the
Byakugan
. These eyes grant him a near 360º of vision, and the capability to see through solid objects, amongst other various abilities.

Pain's Assault

During
Pain
's attack on the village, when Hinata initially attempted to aid Naruto in his fight against Pain, Kō having been tasked with protecting her during her father's absence called her back, claiming that she would only be a burden to Naruto.
  Later, he watched in horror with his Byakugan as Hinata went ahead regardless. He was unable to restrain her, due to a broken leg he had sustained when Pain had used his
Shinra Tensei
 on the entire village.

Kō attends the Hyūga clan meeting to discuss upcoming war.



Kō was present at the meeting of the Hyūga clan convened by Hiashi. After hearing Hiashi's declaration that Neji was to lead the clan's forces during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, he contested Hiashi's decision reminding him of how much Hinata had grown and that she was from the main house. Hiashi, however, told him that it wasn't because he lacked faith in Hinata but because she still lacked enough self-confidence to lead the shinobi during war.

Trivia

Kō's name can mean anything from "
filial piety
" (
孝
) to "body cavity" (
腔
), but due the fact that most Hyūga clan members have light-related names, it is most likely his name means "light" (
光
).

In the anime, Kō's appearance was changed. Instead of having light, spiky hair and a broad nose, he has a small nose and dark, straight hair. This made him look identical to the unnamed Hyūga that was with Sakura after Pain destroyed Konoha, hinting that the anime creators either conflated the two characters or, mistook them for one another.

Studio Pierrot projected Kō to be 9 years older than Naruto and Hinata, and made him 170cm at the age of 17 at that projection.
