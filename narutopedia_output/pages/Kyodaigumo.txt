Kyodaigumo
 (
巨大蜘蛛
,
literally meaning:
 Giant Spider) is a giant
spider
, and the personal summon of
Kidōmaru
.

Appearance

Kyodaigumo is a gigantic black spider with orange stripes going down the back of her abdomen. She greatly resembles a
tarantula
.

Abilities

Once summoned, Kyodaigumo can quickly release an egg sac full of baby spiders roughly the size of a small dog. To perform
Rain of Spiders
, Kidōmaru then cuts open the sac, causing the rapidly hatched spiders to rain down on his opponent. The spiders will spin a strand of webbing as they fall, circling the opponent in webbing and sticking them to the ground. These spiders converge on their victim's location, ensnaring their victims in spider-webs, cutting off the victim's exits and restricting their movements until the victim is completely encased in a cocoon. Kyodaigumo can also explode into webbing if hit, as demonstrated when she was struck by Neji Hyūga's Gentle Fist.

Part I

Sasuke Recovery Mission






Kyodaigumo and Kidōmaru attacking Neji Hyūga.



Kyodaigumo was summoned into battle against
Neji Hyūga
 by Kidōmaru. Immediately after being summoned, Kyodaigumo releases an egg sac which Kidōmaru slices open, releasing hundreds of baby spiders to attack Neji. After these assaults fail, however, Kyodaigumo attacks Neji directly but she is defeated by Neji's
Gentle Fist
 technique which causes her to explode into webbing. This webbing however successfully binds Neji's movements leaving him open to an attack from Kidōmaru.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

In the anime, Kyodaigumo was summoned into battle by a
reincarnated
 Kidōmaru. She was later defeated once again, by Neji's Gentle Fist attack. This time, however, the spider explodes into sticky gold.
