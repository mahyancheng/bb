Ami
 (
アミ
) is a former
academy student
 of
Konohagakure
.

Background

She appeared during a flashback to
Ino Yamanaka
 and
Sakura Haruno
's time in the
Academy
. During a
kunoichi
 lesson she,
Kasumi
, and
Fuki
 taunted Sakura about her forehead, prompting Ino to throw a flower (that she claimed was poisonous) into Ami's open mouth. Ami quickly ran away to tell their teacher,
Suzume
. In the anime, she was also seen in
Naruto Uzumaki
's flashback during
shuriken
 training as one of
Sasuke Uchiha
's admirers.

Personality

She seems to be very boastful and likes to bully Sakura due to her large forehead. In the anime, she appears to be a popular girl in a gang with a lot of arrogance, thinking she was better than both Sakura and Ino, and dependent on her friends. Because of that, her arrogance was brought out as she thought that her "gang-members" would protect her.

Appearance

Ami has purple hair styled in an asymmetrical cut and brown eyes. She wore a striped blouse that was tied at her neck and waist over a dark blues dress that had a marking on the left sleeve but none on the right which she wore along with a pair of dark pants and sandals.

Trivia

"Ami" can mean "net" or "web" (
網
) and is also the Japanese name of the
opossum shrimp
 (
醤蝦
). Ironically, when written in
katakana
, it means "friend" (deriving from the French word "amie"), which stands in stark contrast to her behaviour towards Sakura and Ino.
