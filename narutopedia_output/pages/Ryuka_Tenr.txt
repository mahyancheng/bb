Ryuka Tenrō
 (
天狼リュカ
,
Tenrō Ryuka
) is a
kunoichi
 from
Yumegakure
's
Tenrō clan
 and the daughter of
Enzo Tenrō
.

Personality

She is good friends with
Yomito Hirasaka
 and
Taisa Amagiri
. After her village was destroyed by the fake
Nine-Tails
, she wanted revenge more than either of her friends on
Naruto Uzumaki
. She was, however, against her father's idea to use the
Three-Headed Guardian Beast
, not wanting to endanger innocent villages.

Normally, Ryuka is an upbeat and cheerful girl. She was very grateful to Naruto and
Konohagakure
 after they destroyed the Three-Heads which she herself unsealed on her father's orders while they were still being manipulated by
Gensui
.

Appearance

Ryuka has messy purple hair, amber eyes, wears red lipstick and has a marking of the same colour under each eye. She wears the same forehead protector as her father: a happuri-styled face plate with the exception of the two extensions upward. She wears a sleeveless pink kimono with a furry collar, and the necklace worn by members of the Tenrō clan consisting of rings attached together by red strings, ending with a tassel to the left. She wears furry wristbands on each wrist followed by bandages that go up to her elbows. She also wears a short violet skirt and dark brown pants that have furry endings right below her knees, the rest being bandaged up.

Abilities

Ryuka is very skilled in
Taijutsu
 and relies mainly on it in battle. Despite her slender and feminine appearance, Ryuka has a great deal of physical strength, being able to knock enemies away with strong punches.

Ninjutsu

Like her father, she is able to use the
Tenrō-Style Ninjutsu: Beast-Human Transformation Technique
, which transforms her into a wolf-like creature with greatly enhanced speed, strength and durability. In this form, aside from powerful kicks and punches, she can launch volleys of needles from her body in all directions, nearly impossible to evade.
