Hashirama causes multiple wood tendrils to rise up from the ground, weaving into a wooden wall around the opponent's limbs binding them in place. He then concentrates his
chakra
 into his fist and then strikes the opponent, breaking them free of the woven wooden wall.

Trivia

Although this technique is listed as "Wood Release: All Creation", Hashirama says "Wood Release Secret Technique: All Creation".
