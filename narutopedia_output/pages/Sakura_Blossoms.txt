 anime.

Synopsis

With
Rock Lee
 unconscious,
Sakura
 has to defend herself and her teammates. One of the
Otogakure

genin
,
Kin Tsuchi
, takes hold of her hair and insults her for spending so much time on her looks. This remark spurs her into cutting her hair to free herself from Kin's grasp. Freed, Sakura battles
Zaku Abumi
 by using several substitutions, slashing him with a
kunai
, and pinning him to the ground while biting him to immobilise his other arm, though he quickly gains the advantage. Zaku then proceeds to beat Sakura's head until she begins to bleed. Unknown to Sakura,
Team 10
 is watching from a distance while
Ino
 remembers their childhood memories. Team 10 runs to Sakura's aid before Zaku can kill her, Ino stating that she promised never to let Sakura show her up.
