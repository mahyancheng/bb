Abilities






The twins' coordinated attack.



Gōzu and Meizu are a paragon of
coordination attacking
. Gōzu's large metal gauntlets house a retractable
shuriken
 chain running between the two of them, which they can use to bind an enemy and then slice them to pieces. In the event that the shuriken chain is neutralised, Gōzu also has a release mechanism to free him from Meizu for individual attacks. He uses the sharp,
poisoned
 claws on his gauntlet to shred his foes. Gōzu was also skilled in stealth, being able to hide right outside the gates of Konoha without being detected.
