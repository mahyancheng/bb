This flower is a medicinal plant that can save many lives. The Gekkōran flower grows on a mountain near
Konohagakure
, but is difficult to obtain due to the fact that it only blooms once every four years and only on a full moon. At the same time, a
specially trained pig
 is needed to search. Because of all this, the Gekkōran flower is very expensive and highly valued on the black market.
