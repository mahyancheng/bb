Yashamaru
 (
夜叉丸
) was an
Anbu
 from
Sunagakure
. He was also the right-hand-man of the
Fourth Kazekage
.

Background

Yashamaru's elder sister,
Karura
, died shortly after giving birth to her youngest son
Gaara
, within whom the
One-Tailed Shukaku
 had been sealed. After her death, Yashamaru was appointed as Gaara's caretaker by the Fourth Kazekage. Unlike his fellow villagers, he attempted to understand his nephew's plight as a
jinchūriki
, and believed that the sand that flew to Gaara's aid in moments of danger was actually the will of Karura protecting her child.
 However, when Gaara's inability to control Shukaku proved a problem, the Fourth Kazekage tasked Yashamaru with the duty of attacking the boy both physically and psychologically to test his actual mastery over the beast's power. Yashamaru reluctantly accepted his role in order to teach Gaara about physical pain, emotional pain and love.






Yashamaru before he commits suicide.



The test became a suicide mission after Yashamaru was gravely injured by Gaara's
Sand Binding Coffin
. He lied to Gaara, telling him that he hated him and that his sister gave him his name from the phrase "a self-loving carnage" (
我を愛する修羅
,
Ware o aisuru shura
) to reflect the undying hatred she felt towards the village, rather than out of love for her son. Yashamaru then told Gaara that nobody would ever love him, and then detonated a series of
explosive tags
 hidden within his flack jacket in an attempt to take Gaara with him. Yashamaru's cruel words and his suicide caused Gaara to become a
sociopath
 and even more of an emotional wreck than he already was.

It would only be years later during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 that Gaara learned the truth of the mission he was given and that he had in fact lied to him about his mother under direct orders from the Fourth Kazekage.

Personality






Yashamaru protects Kashike when he is accidentally attacked by Gaara.



Yashamaru was a very warm, devoted, and caring person who loved his sister Karura, above all. Under the test set by the Fourth Kazekage, Yashamaru claimed that he tried to love Gaara, but could never let go of the fact Karura died giving birth to him. In reality, he was the only person to understand Gaara's accidental attacks on the villagers, and tried to persuade others to understand as well, while teaching the young man about love, and pain. He was also willing to sacrifice his own life in order to test out Gaara's control over Shukaku, acting as though he was unforgiving and murderous towards his nephew, and always hated him, ending their relationship with bitter and aloof lies.

The person Yashamaru truly hated was his brother-in-law, the Fourth Kazekage, for implanting Shukaku within Gaara while still in his sister, and thus taking away Karura's life. He also loved Gaara dearly, having fulfilled a role similar to Iruka with Naruto, keeping Gaara from falling off the edge with his sanity. However, as an Anbu and the right-hand man of the Kazekage, Yashamaru still did as he was ordered, even acting as to betray his own nephew.
 This would prove to drive Gaara off the edge.

Appearance






Yashamaru's full appearance.



Yashamaru bore a striking, if not identical, resemblance to his sister with his sandy-blond hair, fair skin, and violet eyes, which made him look somewhat feminine. He was usually seen in a simple, dark blue, kimono-style shirt with white trim that was held closed by a white sash along with grey pants. He also wore a pair of black shinobi sandals and a beige apron with the Sunagakure village symbol at the top—the latter of which he wore optionally. He also wore bandages around his head. As an Anbu, he donned the traditional uniform of the Sunagakure-nin which included a turban, the village's
forehead protector
,
flak jacket
 as well as a cloth that hid the lower half of his face, leaving only his eyes visible.

Abilities

 and the right-hand man of the Fourth Kazekage. He was also a

 to guide and launch them at a target.

Trivia

Yashamaru's name, 夜叉丸, is composed of three kanji. The first two, Yasha (
夜叉
) refer to creatures in Japanese mythology known as
Yaksha
. The Hindu version of the Yaksha usually portray them as having two sides: a darker, more sinister side, and a benevolent, lovable side. Yashamaru's betrayal could be a reference to this "dark side" of Yaksha. Maru (
丸
) is a common ending for male names.

According to the databook(s):

Yashamaru's favourite word was "affection" (
愛情
,
aijō
).

Yashamaru had completed 734 official missions in total: 384 D-rank, 240 C-rank, 96 B-rank, 14 A-rank, 0 S-rank.

Yashamaru, along with many other deceased characters within the
Naruto
 series, made a cameo in the ending omake of
Shippūden
 episode 129.

The second databook initially listed Yashamaru as a
chūnin
 but in
chapter 548
, he was stated to be an Anbu.

In the Brazilian, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Polish and Portuguese versions of the
Naruto
 manga, Yashamaru is portrayed as female rather than male.

Quotes

(To
Gaara
)
"A wound of a heart is different from a flesh wound. Unlike a flesh wound, there are no ointments to heal it, and there are times when they never heal."

(Last words to Gaara)
"This is it. Please die."
