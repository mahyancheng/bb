Merz
 (
メルツ
,
Merutsu
) is a character from
Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
.

Background

A former
Amegakure
 shinobi who idolised the goals of
Pain
, and followed the
Akatsuki
. He was blinded during the Amegakure civil war. He would later gather a following of destitute ninja who wished to return to the age of warfare and founded the organisation
Zero
.

Personality

Merz seemed fundamentally polite, but believed in obtaining godhood in the same vein as Pain, without the same interest in the peace that would follow the inevitable conflict. He has no issues using others for his own ends, treating them as weapons.

Abilities

Merz was a powerful shinobi, considered worthwhile enough by
Pain
 himself to consider an ally. While inferior to
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Sasuke Uchiha
, Merz was still capable of fighting them both off, though they had been weakened by fighting each other during the prelude to the Fifth Shinobi World War.

Dōjutsu

Sharingan






Merz's artificial Sharingan.



Due to the machinations of
Teguse
, who used
Scientific Ninja Tools
, Merz was able to be implanted with artificial Sharingan. Unlike other implanted Sharingan users, Merz showed neither fatigue nor severe chakra drain from utilising the Sharingan. He did, however, keep them sealed, until it was time to use them, similarly to
Ao
. Unlike normal Sharingan, these artificial eyes were capable of copying other dōjutsu that could only be used by certain bloodlines. Notably both of his new eye sockets incorporated machinery. His left eye socket being almost completely cybernetically rebuilt. This had left his new eye bulging out and a poor fit.

Mangekyō Sharingan

Due to his artificial Sharingan, Merz also possesses an artificial Mangekyō Sharingan, an exact mirror of
Nanashi Uchiha
's. His Mangekyō Sharingan gave him access to
Yachihoko
, the
Engraved Tsukuyomi
, and the vast reserves of chakra from all those effected by it. Using it, Merz was able to recall the chakra of everyone under the blemish, even Naruto Uzumaki. Merz was not seen suffering from either blindness or the other debilitating effects commonly associated with the Mangekyō Sharingan, though he did require the chakra of the shinobi world at large to utilise it to its full potential.

As he had Mangekyō Sharingan in both eyes, Merz was capable of using
Susanoo
, a feat which surprised
Sasuke Uchiha
. Having trained to master the eyes, Merz's Susanoo is a
Complete Body — Susanoo
. It takes a gargantuan size, dwarfing even Sasuke's Susanoo. With this, Merz can use the
Yasaka Magatama
, and fend off a weakened
Majestic Attire: Susanoo
 from Naruto and Sasuke.

Plot Overview

Merz recruited Teguse from Konoha's Scientific Weapons Team to join his organization after Katasuke and Konoha found that Teguse was performing inhuman experiments. He tasked Teguse to make a virtual game called Ninja Heroes with a virtual playset and invisible seal that would steal the player's chakras and gain access to their memories under the false pretense that whoever wins the game will win a replica of the
First Hokage's Necklace
. After people worldwide were getting tired and fainting without reasons, Naruto opened an investigation about what was happening. Naruto was able to connect the symptoms to the Ninja Heroes virtual game and warned Boruto about it and he putted the village on high alert shut down where genins stayed at the village and chunin and jounin level personnel were to complete their missions within a time limit.

Merz caused a fake
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 which lead to the people marked with "blemishes" to be controlled which almost caused the Fifth Great Shinobi War. Hinata immediately told Boruto what has happened where he meet up with Sarada, Mitsuki, Shikadai, Inojin, Katasuke, and Sasuke to explain the details of the investigation of what was happening. Sasuke immediately deduced that there was a seal jutsu invisible to the naked eye on the virtual game headset with his Rinnegan. Sasuke went to stop Naruto. Boruto was to retrieve Naruto's memories with Toneri's help. The rest of the group were to locate Zero's hideout. Everyone succeeds with their tasks.

Merz is confronted by Boruto, Sasuke, and the cured Naruto. Merz was unable to defeat Boruto, Sasuke, and Naruto despite he had the implanted artificial sharingans. With the incident resolved, everything was put back to normal.

Trivia

Merz is a nonsense German word created by dada artist Kurt Schwitters to describe his scrap assemblage works.
