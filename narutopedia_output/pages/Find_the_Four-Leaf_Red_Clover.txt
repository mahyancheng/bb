Find the Four-Leaf Red Clover!
 (
紅き四つ葉のクローバーを探せ
,
Akaki Yotsuba no Kurōbā o Sagase
) is the first
Naruto
 OVA.

Synopsis

Konohamaru
 wakes up
Naruto
, claiming that he is now appointed leader of the Konohamaru Corps and that his mission is to find the crimson four leaf clover, located in a dangerous and forbidden place called
Akagahara
. As Konohamaru explains, it becomes clear that he wants to impress a girl,
Kaede Yoshino
, who has caught his attention at the
academy
. However this girl is quitting the academy and moving to a different village because her father has to go on a mission. Believing the flower will get her back, due to a legend claiming the wish of the finder comes true, the two set out. On their way they meet
Sasuke
 and
Sakura
, waiting for
Kakashi
, whom they later inform on the plan of the pair. After activating almost every trap on the way to the clover (including falling into a hole, tripping a
wire
 that launches
kunai
 and stepping on explosive mines), they find that there are many clovers but none seem to have four leaves. When Konohamaru discovers one beneath a statue, the pair are attacked by puppets. It is only when Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi arrive that they are rescued by placing the statue back to its original position. Then one of the leaves fell off the clover Konohamaru picked. Konohamaru still gave the clover to Kaede, and she kissed him on the cheek.
