"
The Death of Gaara!
" (
我愛羅死す!
,
Gaara Shisu!
) is episode 17 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Team Guy
 and
Team Kakashi
 both finish resting up and go back to pursuing
Gaara
.
Neji
 notices that there is no one in their vicinity, meaning that their enemies are confident that they have been successfully delayed, which he finds uncomfortable.
Chiyo
 and
Kakashi
 come to the same conclusion as well.
Naruto
's anger and frustration causes him to slightly tap into the
Nine-Tailed Fox
's
chakra
, causing his whiskers to become more prominent, changing his eyes from blue to red and increasing his stamina. Chiyo asks Kakashi why Naruto is so keen on rescuing
Gaara
 when they're not even from the same village. Kakashi explains that Naruto is also a
jinchūriki
, that he harbors the spirit of the Nine-Tailed Fox within him. Kakashi tells her that since all jinchūriki are treated the same no matter what village they're raised in, Naruto understands the pain Gaara suffered through, and therefore he wishes to save Gaara from any more pain and suffering. Chiyo is surprised at this, and tells Kakashi that at her old age, she thought she knew how the world worked. She believed people only looked out of themselves and that alliances with neighbouring lands were nothing more than a farce. Wanting only to do what was best for
Sunagakure
, Chiyo tells Kakashi that it was she, with the permission of the
Fourth Kazekage
, who sealed
Shukaku
 inside of Gaara. Despite being an old woman, she believes that perhaps there is still something she could do for the good of the village.

Meanwhile, the Akatsuki finish
sealing
 Shukaku inside of the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
. The extraction kills Gaara, who in his last moments contemplates on the nature of his existence.
Deidara
 states that the entire process took three days. Gaara's dead body falls the floor, and Deidara and
Sasori
 prepare to deal with the intruders headed their way. Outside of the hideout, Team Guy arrive.
Lee
 decides to break their way in, but
Guy
 notices the
barrier seal
. At the same time, Team Kakashi arrive. Lee is ecstatic to see Naruto and
Sakura
 once more, but Naruto, still under the influence of the Nine-Tails' chakra, is too agitated and restless to have a reunion. Guy and Kakashi then decide to work together to find a way inside the base.
