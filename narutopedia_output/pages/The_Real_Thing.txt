"
The Real Thing
" (
本物
,
Honmono
) is chapter 700+8 of the
Naruto Gaiden
 mini-series.

Summary

After calming down from her tirade,
Sarada
 explains to
Naruto
 that since everything she knows has been a lie, she intends on leaving the village and continuing her journey alone. As she attempts to leave, Naruto stops her and tells her that even though they aren't blood-related, Sarada and everyone else from
Konohagakure
 are like family to him. Sarada accuses Naruto of not knowing anything about her situation, which triggers his childhood memories of
Iruka
 and
Sasuke
. Naruto informs Sarada that a family is not about blood relation but the connections that are made between people.
After asking Sarada to try and remember this feeling one more time, she begins to reminisce about her history with
Sakura
. Realising that she does genuinely care about Sakura, Sarada decides that she wants to help her, and they return to the group. Sasuke chastises them for wandering off, and Naruto responds that they need to have a serious talk after rescuing Sakura.
Orochimaru
 comments that it's possible Sakura has already been killed, though Sasuke states that she is strong enough to protect herself. Sasuke activates his tomoe
Rinnegan
 and
Mangekyō Sharingan
, stating that he has finally regained the chakra he had lost after travelling through
Kaguya's dimensions
 in search for the mysterious enemy. Manifesting his
Susanoo
, Sasuke declares that he is taking everyone to save his wife from
Shin
. Meanwhile, Shin completes his surgery and reveals that it is his goal to eliminate the genes of peace-lovers. Sakura refutes this fact, prepared to take him down.

Trivia

In one panel, Sasuke's right
Mangekyō Sharingan
 is depicted in its base form, without
Itachi
's straightened Mangekyō pattern that makes up Sasuke's Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan. However, it was corrected in the tankōbon version.
