The user initiates the attack by striking the opponent with multiple
Truth-Seeking Balls
. Utilising the flight ability acquired through
Six Paths Senjutsu
, the user soars above the adversary and channels their power into transforming their
shakujō
 into the formidable
Sword of Nunoboko
. With precision, the weapon is thrust into the ground, piercing through the target and triggering a shockwave infused with black and purple hues. This manoeuvre inflicts substantial damage upon the opponent.
