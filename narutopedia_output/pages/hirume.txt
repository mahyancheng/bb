Ōhirume
 is a
dōjutsu
 that can be used with
Sarada Uchiha
's
Mangekyō Sharingan
.

Overview

Ōhirume allows Sarada to create up to a maximum of four black spheres, each of which has a diameter ranging from 5 to 250 centimeters. These spheres have a gravitational pull disproportionate to their mass, allowing them to generate a powerful gravity, which Sarada can freely control to attract matter, including weapons, jutsu, and living beings. By altering the gravitational force she can pin enemies against the spheres and crush them, or even detonate the spheres to produce an explosion.

Only targets directly targeted by Sarada's gaze are affected by the gravitational force, though if the target is a living being then she is susceptible to the gravitational pull as well. To combat this drawback, Sarada can control each of the four spheres to balance the gravity applied to her, allowing her to levitate. By moving in synch with the spheres, she can also fly at high speeds, similar to the
Ōtsutsuki
.

The major drawbacks of the jutsu are that it consumes a tremendous amount of
chakra
 and, like other Mangekyō Sharingan abilities, causes eyesight deterioration and eventual blindness.
 Amplifying the gravitational forces of a sphere places significant strain on Sarada, causing her used eye to bleed. The first time she used the technique, she fell unconscious from the exertion.

Influence

Ōhirume or Ōhirume-no-Muchi (
大日孁貴
, lit. "Great Lady/Maiden of the Sun") is one of the many names that, in the
Nihon Shoki
, is ascribed to
Amaterasu
, the Japanese goddess of the sun and chief
kami
 of the Shintō pantheon. This makes this technique the second Mangekyō Sharingan ability named after said deity, following
Sasuke
 and
Itachi Uchiha
's
Amaterasu
.

Trivia

According to
Koji Kashin
, Sarada awakening the technique is one of the most critical goals to battling the
Human God Trees
.
