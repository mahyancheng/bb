Akane
 (
アカネ

Akane
) is a
kunoichi
 of
Konohagakure
.

Personality

Akane is deeply infatuated with
Naruto Uzumaki
 to the point she and her friends would chase after him repeatedly for his affections. However, it appears her affections for him are rather vain and solely because he is the hero of the village. In fact, she would rather flirt with Naruto than focusing on her training or missions as a shinobi.

Blank Period

Sixth Hokage
's inauguration, Akane,
Kaede
 and their other friend, stood amongst a crowd at Konoha's entrance, shouting to see Naruto.
