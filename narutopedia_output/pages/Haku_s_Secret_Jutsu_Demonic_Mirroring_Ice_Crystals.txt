" (
白の秘術・魔鏡氷晶
,
Haku no Hijutsu - Makyō Hyōshō
) is episode 13 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Two of
Gatō
's thugs arrive at
Tazuna
's house to kidnap
Tsunami
 for leverage against Tazuna.
Inari
 faces his fear and attempts to stop them, giving
Naruto
 time to arrive, and an opportunity to defeat them. Before leaving to join the others at the bridge, Naruto apologises to Inari for calling him a coward and acknowledges his bravery.

Meanwhile,
Sasuke
 and
Haku
 fight, and Sasuke's new-found speed gives him an advantage out in the open. Zabuza comments that they will be the ones to die if this continues, urging Haku to use his
Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals
. With the mirrors surrounding Sasuke, he emerges himself inside of them, throwing needles that violently cut Sasuke at various parts of his skin.
Sakura
 attempts to save Sasuke by throwing a
kunai
 in their direction, but Haku catches it. However, before Haku can return it, he is knocked out of the mirrors by shuriken, thrown by none other than Naruto, who got there just in time.
