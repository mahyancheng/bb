Heiji
 (
ヘイジ
), also known as
Heiji of the Rain Shelter
 (
雨宿りのヘイジ
,
Amayadori no Heiji
), was a
shinobi
 from
Amegakure
 as well as the right-hand man of
Kandachi
.

Background






Heiji is mistakenly reincarnated by Kabuto.



Heiji was a subordinate in
Hanzō
's regime and the right hand of
Kandachi
 who in turn was the right hand of Hanzō. At some point, he was killed within the walls of Amegakure. Some time later, he was accidentally
reincarnated
 by
Kabuto Yakushi
 who was looking for Hanzō instead.

Personality

Heiji seemed to be a relatively quiet man. He was prideful enough to express annoyance at being controlled.

Appearance






Heiji during his lifetime.



Heiji had purple eyes. He had a dark hat on his head and his lower face was mostly obscured by a helmet-like
respirator
, nearly identical to Hanzō's. The upper portion of this mask bore the symbol of his village and was mirrored by four indentations on the part covering his mouth. He wore the costume, which consisted of a diving equipment — as typical loose of his village, accentuated by bandages wrapped around their wrists over the blouse and lower legs, a
flak jacket
 with swirls in the chest-plate and standard shinobi sandals.

Abilities






Heiji using his Winding Smoke Technique.



Heiji was capable of using a tag with a technique formula on it to
create a smokescreen
. It was effective in allowing other reincarnated shinobi to escape the battlefield, but he was not capable of escaping himself.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Heiji being sealed.



During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Kabuto deployed Heiji, whom he saw as one of his weaker assets, in an attempt to unseal his other, stronger pawns. During a scuffle between Kabuto's weaker reincarnates and the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, Heiji created a smokescreen diversion so some of the reincarnated shinobi could escape. Afterwards, he was cornered by the
Fourth Division
 and sealed.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

Later, when the Impure World Reincarnation Technique was cancelled, his soul was returned to the
afterlife
.
