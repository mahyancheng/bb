Konoha Hot Springs.



The
Konoha Hot Springs
 are a public bath in
Konohagakure
, divided down the middle between genders.
Shinobi
 can use the baths as a training ground for
basic chakra training
. Using the hot water as a form of motivation, the trainee is more focused in using their chakra to support themselves on the water. This is where
Naruto
 is taken by
Jiraiya
 to relax during his training. Like everything else in Konoha except for the
Konoha Archive Library
, it was destroyed when
Deva Path
 used a massive
Shinra Tensei
 to destroy the village.
