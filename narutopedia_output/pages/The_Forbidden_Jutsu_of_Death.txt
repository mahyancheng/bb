 anime.

Synopsis

After exchanging brief words,
Yūga
 activates his
kinjutsu
, calling on a
creature
 from another world. The jutsu consumes him, releasing a creature and creating a barrier around them all.
Hiruga
 and
Asaka
 notice the use of the kinjutsu, mourn their brother, and carry on. The creature attacks the
Konoha
 shinobi, being both strong and fast. When it blocks
Boruto
's attack, it begins draining his chakra.
Konohamaru
 breaks the creatures arm with his
Rasengan
, grabs Boruto, and retreats. The creature drains the chakra of a nearby deer, and begins regenerating its arm. Konohamaru recalls Yūga's words, and compares the creature to the
Shinigami
 and
Sōma
. They evaluate what they know about the creature. Boruto considers attacking the creature again, as Konohamaru's Rasengan damaged it before, but
Mugino
 wants to destroy the barrier, reminding them their mission is to retrieve
Hashirama
's cells. Mugino accuses Konohamaru of spoiling his genin. Konohamaru understands Mugino, but assures him the genin are dependable.
Mitsuki
 is warned by his snake that the creature is coming their way, having absorbed chakra from the wildlife inside the barrier. They move close to the barrier, Konohamaru and Mugino
attempt to break it
, while the genin guard them. Despite accepting his decision, Boruto is disappointed that Mugino trusts them so little.
 Mitsuki warns them the creature is closing in. Using clones and snakes, Boruto and Mitsuki hold the creature in place, allowing
Sarada
 to
hit it
. The attacks cracks a jewel in the creature, but otherwise appears to not have done significant damage. The creature notices cracks on the barrier, and ignores the genin, rushing to the edge of the barrier. It attacks Konohamaru and Mugino. Mitsuki arrives and distracts the creature with his
snakes
. Seeing the situation has changed, Mugino wants Boruto and Konohamaru to prepare their Rasengan, and asks Sarada to back him up. Mugino holds the creature up, allowing Boruto and Konohamaru to strike it. They destroy its jewel, defeating the creature and breaking the barrier. Mugino collapses, having had a lot of his chakra drained. Mugino criticises Boruto for not thinking ahead, and Boruto criticises his communication skills, which Konohamaru supports. They resume their pursuit of the Haze shinobi.
Omoi
 refuses to tell
Deepa
 where Hashirama's cells are, but his subordinates cave in and tell him of the Haze shinobi. Deepa kills
Kakui
 and
Marui
, and leaves. Omoi passes out.
