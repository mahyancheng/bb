Yakumo Kurama Rescue Mission

Several years later, Unkai was set on stopping Yakumo once and for all since her unconscious mind held a terrible beast which had killed her parents years earlier. Even though her powers were now sealed away, the beast would only grow over time and threaten the village. With the help of other members of the clan, they began to assault the compound to capture Yakumo. However,
Kurenai Yūhi
 managed to arrive and spirit the young woman away. When Unkai confronted them,
Naruto Uzumaki
,
Sakura Haruno
,
Hinata Hyūga
,
Shino Aburame
,
Kiba Inuzuka
, and
Might Guy
 confronted him and caused him to flee. The group was then trapped in Yakumo's genjutsu. He returned to explain to them Yakumo's dark history and helped them escape, suffering burns from Yakumo's powers. After helping Naruto out of the genjutsu which showed a fiery room by having them shut off their mind, Unkai ended up burned. Unkai remained behind to have his burns treated by Sakura and other
medical-nin
 while Naruto and Kurenai confronted Yakumo and helped her come to terms with her powers and put an end to her deadly subconscious.

Trivia
