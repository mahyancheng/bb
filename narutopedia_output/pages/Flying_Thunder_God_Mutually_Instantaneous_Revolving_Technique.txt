The
Flying Thunder God Mutually Instantaneous Revolving Technique
 is a technique which can be utilised when at least two Flying Thunder God Technique users are present.

Usage

Both persons will mark each other with their respective seals, this grants them the ability to switch their positions at any point in time during a battle. In one instance of use, Minato and Tobirama used this technique to take
Obito Uchiha
 by surprise on the battlefield where Minato — who was originally struck by an
attack
 — switched places with Tobirama to cause the attack to land on their intended target.

Trivia

Because of the way that Tobirama and Minato had intended to use this technique to take Obito by surprise, Minato noted that their
immortal
 bodies would be beneficial to them.
