Shizune
 wears a device on her forearm that's loaded with five
senbon
. While contained within the device, the senbon are immersed in a poison potent enough to leave victims near-death from a mere scratch. The device is fired by pulling an attached string, which quickly shoots the five senbon at any target Shizune aims at. Because of how the device is configured, the senbon cannot be fired individually. However, by channeling her
chakra
 into the string, Shizune can alter the trajectory of the senbon, either to concentrate them on one point, spread them over a larger area, or even change the direction of the senbon from what the device is aimed at. Shizune generally uses this as a surprise attack, as the device is hidden by her sleeve, is not bulky enough to be noticed, and furthermore she does not give the impression of being able to fight, thus lowering an opponent's guard.

Trivia

Shizune has also been shown spitting senbon from her mouth,
 but
Tō no Sho
 gives no indication of it being this technique.
