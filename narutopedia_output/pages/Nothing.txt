Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Kabuto
 attacked the
Uchiha
 brothers with his
Sage Art: Inorganic Reincarnation
 technique, causing the
cave formations
 to attack them. Having used his
Susanoo
 to protect
Sasuke
,
Itachi
 was incapacitated between the rocks. As Kabuto retrieved a talisman from his snake, he attempted to rewrite Itachi's mind. Sasuke created a ring of
Amaterasu
 flames to prevent Kabuto from taking any further action. Commending Sasuke's
strategy
, Kabuto told him nonetheless that they were not capable of defeating him. Continuing to brag about his accomplishments, he states that of anyone currently alive, he had come the closest to the
Sage of the Six Paths
 and that compared to him, the Uchiha were nothing. This prompts Sasuke to lash out at him, but he was stopped by a fully-regenerated Itachi. Itachi told Kabuto that he reminded him of his former self though the two of them were very different. He then told him that because he did not understand his own limitations, the value of comrades and who he really was, he was doomed to fail as he did when he was alive. With this, Kabuto retorted that they were the ones that knew nothing about him and that for his whole life, he had tried to find who he really was. Kabuto also had a flashback to his earliest memory of being found by
Nonō
 and
Urushi
. He then stated that for his whole life, he had nothing.
