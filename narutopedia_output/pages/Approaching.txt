Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Kabuto
 examines
Orochimaru
, concluding that there is nothing he can do to remove the
Third Hokage
's seal. He at least finds a positive in
Sasuke
's progress, though regrets that Orochimaru has had to go through so much for Sasuke since he could not defeat
Itachi
. Meanwhile,
Koharu Utatane
 and
Homura Mitokado
 approach
Jiraiya
 and tell him that, after
Sunagakure
 found the
Fourth Kazekage
's body, they surrendered to
Konoha
, their entire involvement in the
Konoha Crush
 having been Orochimaru's doing. With the village's situation and the Third's death, they ask Jiraiya to become the next
Hokage
. He declines, offering to find
Tsunade
 for the position instead, but requests that
Naruto
 be allowed to come with him. Meanwhile,
Kakashi
 tails
two suspicious individuals
. Because he has business with Sasuke, he has
Kurenai
 and
Asuma
 follow the two.
