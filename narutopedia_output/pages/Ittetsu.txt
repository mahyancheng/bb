flak jacket
 over a short-sleeved, blue shirt along with a pair of dark pants, with his

Part II

Kazekage Rescue Mission

He was part of the group of Suna-nin who went to rescue the
Fifth Kazekage
 from the
Akatsuki
. When he heard the Kazekage was fine, he was so relieved he began to cry stating his fear that the Kazekage had actually died, which
Matsuri
 slugged him for saying there was no way someone like Gaara would die like that.
