The
Parasite Clone
 technique is one utilised by
Akatsuki
's
White Zetsu
.

Usage

This technique allows White Zetsu to biologically produce clones of himself, of which he is able to communicate and control remotely.
 Being his perfect duplicates, they resemble him closely, aside from pants, sandals, and his flytrap like appendage. Unlike normal clones, they don't dispel when they are dealt damage or killed.
 Even if the original user is killed, they will not dispel.
 They can also be used with White Zetsu's
Substitute Technique
 to assume the form of any individual that he has touched, even copying their unique
chakra
 and items.
 The independent, living nature of the clones is further exemplified by the fact that they can be used as sacrifices for the
Impure World Reincarnation.
