 anime.

Summary

Still in disbelief over what has happened,
Obito
 walks over towards
Rin
's body after slaughtering the
Kiri
-
nin
 while ignoring the unconscious
Kakashi
. Obito then remembers
Madara
 and
White Zetsu
's words as he cradles her lifeless form while vowing to
change the world into one where she is still alive.
 After returning to Madara, as the elder
Uchiha
 expected, Obito accepts becoming his apprentice. From there on, Madara uses his
genjutsu
 to tell Obito the legend of the
Sage of the Six Paths
 and the
Ten-Tails
.
 After teaching Obito the means to summon the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 along with imparting all his skill and knowledge, Madara infuses White Zetsu with his
will
, completing Zetsu with the birth of
Black Zetsu
. After disconnecting himself from the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, Madara finally dies telling Obito that he will be Madara until the day he is to be
resurrected
 by the one he transplanted his eyes into:
Nagato
. Soon after, now going by the name Madara Uchiha with White and Black Zetsu accompanying him, Obito arrives in
Amegakure
 where he meets Nagato and
his

friends
. Though Obito tempts Nagato with his knowledge and offers to aid him in achieving peace, Yahiko gets his friend and Konan away. Despite being warned by Yahiko to stay away, Obito tells Nagato that he would reappear at the same time and place everyday until he accepts the truth of words. Soon after saving orphans and gaining a new member of their growing group, Yahiko decides to name their group
Akatsuki
.

Trivia

In one scene, an unconscious Kakashi is mistakenly depicted wearing a
Konoha

forehead protector
, despite not having it on by the time Obito arrived.
