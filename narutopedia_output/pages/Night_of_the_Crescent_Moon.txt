 anime.

Synopsis

Yūgao
 thinks about the time she used to spar with
Hayate
, learning
kenjutsu
 as she and the search party hunt for Hayate's team. When they finally found them, the sealing team quickly put an end to the actions of the other members of Hayate's team and continue over to Hayate himself. However, they are injured in the process on protecting Yūgao from Hayate's blow. After they retreat, Sakura and Yūgao tend to
Iō
 and
Yokaze
's wounds and are told that they cannot carry on further. When Yūgao prepares to leave,
Sakura
 stops and asks why she cannot fight anymore. Once Yūgao explained that carrying a sword only reminds of her Hayate's death, Sakura says that they had to fight because of the "unforgivable" technique that
Kabuto
 used to wage the war and goes to retrieve the KIA scroll on her own.

Sakura catches up to and engages Hayate, who immediately recognises her from the
Chūnin Exams
. She battles him and seems to be on even grounds with him until he uses the
Transparent Escape Technique
. He manages to cut her but it is revealed to be a
Body Replacement Technique
 and Yūgao arrives soon after. Yūgao tells Sakura to fetch the sealing corps despite her offer to join the fight. The fight ensues during which Hayate commends Yūgao on her improvement in swordsmanship. During the fight, Kabuto senses the delay and tries to take over Hayate's consciousness, who seemingly pins Yūgao to a tree, but is saved by the efforts of Hayate to take back control and gets himself pierced by Yūgao's sword and falls. He is finally
sealed
 and the mission to retrieve the KIA scroll became a success.
