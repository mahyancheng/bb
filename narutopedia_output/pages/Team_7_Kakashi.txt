Team 7

Team 7
 was a
Konohagakure
 team formed under the leadership of
Kakashi Hatake
. Two-and-a-half years after
Sasuke Uchiha
 left the village, Kakashi filled out paperwork to form
Team Kakashi
, with his former pupils
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Sakura Haruno
 now being treated as equals alongside their teacher. Following
Yamato
 and
Sai
 joining the team, the group went by
Team Yamato
 during the former's leadership.

History






Team 7's first meeting.



Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura were organised into a team following their graduation from the
Academy
 in order to balance out their talents: Naruto, the worst student in his class, would benefit from Sakura's intelligence and Sasuke's proficiency with
ninjutsu
; Sakura would benefit from her more battle-capable teammates; Sasuke would benefit from being forced to work with others. Kakashi was selected to lead them in order to keep an eye on Naruto,
Nine-Tails
'
jinchūriki
 and, in the anime, to help Sasuke cope with life after the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
, and as well to develop his Sharingan. As with all the previous
genin
 teams he was put in charge of, Kakashi gives them a
bell test
 in order to determine if they give the proper importance to teamwork. Unlike all previous genin teams, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura pass the test.

Team 7's early missions were all
D-rank
, which Naruto believed they are over-qualified for. He was able to pressure the
Third Hokage
 into giving them a
C-rank
 mission: escorting
Tazuna
 to the
Land of Waves
. After starting the mission they discover that Tazuna lied about the mission details and that the mission is actually
A-rank
, far above the skills of genin. Despite this, Team 7 sticks with the mission and is able to see it through to its completion. When they return to Konoha they resume their menial, D-rank assignments, but from their performance, Kakashi believes they are qualified to participate in the
Chūnin Exams
. Despite strong showings from all three, particularly Naruto and Sasuke, none succeed in becoming
chūnin
, although they were crucial in helping put an end to the
Oto-Suna invasion
 of Konoha, culminating in Naruto defeating the
One-Tail

jinchūriki

Gaara
.






Team 7 implodes.



In the anime, they go on a few additional missions, including an
escort mission
 in the
Land of Tea
, but events during and after the Chūnin Exams lead Sasuke to believe that his membership in the team is preventing him from achieving his goal of killing his brother,
Itachi
, as well as his personal jealousy and resentment of Naruto's rapidly growing strength in a short period of time in contrast to his own. After a confrontation with the
Sound Four
 in which he was severely outclassed, Sasuke defects from Konoha, joining forces with
Orochimaru
. Sakura unsuccessfully tries to convince him not to, Naruto is unable to stop him, and by the time Kakashi learns of what Sasuke has done, it was already too late. In the aftermath, Naruto leaves the village to train with
Jiraiya
 and Sakura becomes the disciple of
Tsunade
, in effect disbanding Team 7.

When Naruto returns to the village after two-and-a-half years, he, Sakura, and Kakashi form a "Reborn Team 7" (
新生第七班
,
Shinsei dainanahan
).
 Kakashi gives them another bell test, but this time the only objective is to demonstrate how their skills have improved. As the team's first mission, they are sent to
Sunagakure
 to rescue the
Fifth Kazekage
 from
Akatsuki
, for which task they are reorganised into the
Kazekage Rescue Team
 upon arrival in Suna. During the course of the mission, they learn of an opportunity to reunite with Sasuke, but Kakashi overexerts himself and needs extended bed-rest when they return to Konoha. Because they have only a limited amount of time to make to use of the intel, an
Anbu
 codenamed Yamato is assigned as Kakashi's replacement. To provide additional manpower to the team, Sai of
Root
 is added to the team as Sasuke's replacement.






Team Yamato's first mission.



Although the team is successful in infiltrating one of Orochimaru's hideouts and meeting with Sasuke, his growth over the last few years is more than any of them can compete with and they can do nothing but let him escape. From the mission, however, Sai becomes a trusted and lasting member of the team and Yamato takes on a recurring role as leader and advisor to Team 7's members, especially as Kakashi increasingly commits himself to other tasks. When a Kakashi-led
Team Asuma
 struggles in another confrontation with Akatsuki, Yamato leads Team 7 in providing backup. Shortly afterwards, when they come up with a plan to find Sasuke by first finding Itachi, a Yamato-led Team 7 combines with a Kakashi-led
Team 8
 into the
Eight Man Squad
.






The original Team 7 reunited.



The Eight Man Squad is unsuccessful in stopping Sasuke from falling into the clutches of the Akatsuki. When, following
Pain's Assault
, recent news of Sasuke's criminal activity with Akatsuki reaches Konoha, Naruto tries to secure a pardon for him from the
Raikage
, who refuses. Meanwhile, Sasuke's
former classmates
 decide that they should be the ones to personally kill him for what he's done and to prevent the chaos his actions could bring. Sakura accepts the responsibility, yet plots to kill him on her own due to Sai's unwittingly encouraging her to do so, but ultimately can't bring herself to do so, and nearly lost her life. Kakashi, on learning of her plans and believing the crisis to be his responsibility due to his own failure to prevent Sasuke from going rogue, offers to do it himself as Sasuke's former teacher. Naruto intervenes before anybody is able to kill anyone else, in the process reuniting all of Team 7's original members for the first time in more than three years. Naruto and Sasuke briefly clash, but both accept they are too evenly matched and postpone a final resolution between them for another time.






Team 7 defeats Kaguya.



Despite the nature of their prior meeting, all the members of Team 7 emerge on the same side during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, with not even Sasuke wanting the world to fall victim to the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
. They join forces first against the
Ten-Tails
, then its jinchūriki
Obito Uchiha
, and then
Madara Uchiha
, but through various setbacks and despite various successes the world is enslaved by the Infinite Tsukuyomi. Sasuke is able to protect Naruto, Sakura, and Kakashi from the Infinite Tsukuyomi's effects, leaving them the only ones to face a new and final threat: Princess
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
. After a prolonged fight, Kakashi is able to create an opening with assistance from Obito, Sakura is able to block Kaguya's escape, and Naruto and Sasuke are able to
seal her
, ending the war. However, Sasuke revealed his alliance with them was a means to an end, stating his plan to start a revolution by killing the tailed beasts and the current Kage. Naruto opposes him and they fight in order to settle their feud once and for all. Ultimately, after they are injured to the point of being unable to move and lost a respective arm, Sasuke surrenders and accepts his friendship with Naruto.






The original Team 7 (minus Kakashi) as adults.



For his contributions during the war, Sasuke is pardoned for his previous crimes on the good words of Naruto and Kakashi. He re-allies himself with Konoha, but leaves the village to wander the world. At the same time, Kakashi becomes the Sixth
Hokage
 and Naruto, Sai and Sakura all take on new roles, effectively disbanding Team 7 on good terms. Over the next several years, Naruto marries
Hinata Hyūga
, they have two children,
Boruto
 and
Himawari
, Naruto succeeds Kakashi as the Seventh Hokage. Sasuke and Sakura get married and have a daughter,
Sarada
, and Sai marries
Ino
 with whom he has a son,
Inojin
. The original Team 7, with the exception of Kakashi, briefly reunited to battle against
Shin Uchiha
 and his
army of clones
, where they prevented the rebirth of the Akatsuki and stopped Shin's desire for war before it even began.

Years later, Boruto and Sarada, alongside Orochimaru's son
Mitsuki
, are placed together for their genin team. Influenced by their parents' past, Sarada requested that their assigned team designation be changed from Team 3 to
Team 7
, which Naruto granted.

Sannin
 during the timeskip: Naruto was trained by
