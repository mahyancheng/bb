Kagerō Village
 (
陽炎の里
,
Kagerō no Sato
,
English TV:
 Heat Devil Village,
literally meaning:
 Heat Haze Village), was a small village located in the
Land of Mountains
.
 Thirty years before the start of the series, it was at war with
Konoha
. Three months after a surprise attack by the
Third Hokage
,
Jiraiya
 and several other Konoha ninja, they declared a cease-fire. Two weeks later, however, they were wiped out by shinobi from
Tanigakure
. Only
Gennō
, who had been in Konoha at the time planting
explosive tags
 for a possible counter-attack, survived its destruction.

Trivia

Despite being a
shinobi
 village, it is not a
hidden village
, thus never called Kagerōgakure, as is the case with other shinobi villages.
