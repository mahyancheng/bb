By exhaling the
Kotarō
 that their bodies are able to produce, members of the
Kodon clan
 hypnotise
Rōen
, putting it under their control. Most forms of attack that might be directed against Rōen won't disrupt the hypnotism, but large quantities of
blue fire powder
 will. The jutsu can also be used on those that Rōen has been
sealed into
, dulling its influence over them and altering their memories if desired. If anyone else inhales the purple smoke, they will simply lose consciousness.
