This article is about the technique used by Deidara.  For other uses, see
Garuda (disambiguation)
.

A truly fearsome
 technique created by Deidara to counter the
Sharingan
 and the
genjutsu
 it produces.

Overview

Deidara uses his own mouth instead of the ones on his hands to create a giant doll in his image. When the doll ruptures, it releases a cloud of microscopic bombs that enter the bloodstream of anyone who inhales them. On Deidara's command, the micro-bombs' detonation causes the victims' bodies to disintegrate at the cellular level; literally turning them into dust.

While fighting
Ōnoki
, Deidara utilises an alternate method of C4 by forming a small, chibi-like clay statue of himself with the mouths in his hands.
