 assigned
Naruto
 to spend the day babysitting
Kunihisa
, the son of Tsunade's rich friend
Kunijirō
. Naruto quickly found the boy very annoying from how he believed he can do and get anything he wanted simply by buying it, what he calls "Money Release Techniques". As the day progressed, Naruto helped Kunihisa begin to understand the importance of working for something through showing him a few ninja skills like
kunai
 throwing. He was later kidnapped by a couple of goons who bribed Kunihisa's own bodyguards with money Kunihisa threw away. Naruto was able to save Kunihisa but then found himself hanging over a cliff for dear life. Not wanting his first real friend to die, Kunihisa used a rope to save Naruto. They were both proud of Kunihisa's action, especially because he really tried for it.
