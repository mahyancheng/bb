This article is about the anime-only genjutsu used by Kosuke Maruboshi. For the taijutsu used by Kimimaro, see
Dance of the Willow
.

The user waves their
sword
 back and forth, which when seen by the target locks them in a genjutsu which causes them to hallucinate multiple waving arms out to slash them. The movement resembles that of a
willow tree
 blowing in the wind. With the enemy off guard, the user is free to cut them down.
