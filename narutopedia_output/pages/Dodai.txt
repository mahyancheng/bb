Dodai
 (
ドダイ
) is a
jōnin

shinobi
 from
Kumogakure
 and an official attendant to at least two of the village's
Raikage
.

Background

During the
Third Raikage
's reign, Dodai instructed a select group of children, informing them that only one amongst their number would earn the name "B" and become
A
's tag-team partner in order to protect the future Raikage. He then instructed them on how to perform the
Lightning Release: Double Lariat
 on a rubber training dummy, while indicating that the result would reveal their capacity to fulfil the duty of "B". As the prospective candidates failed one after the other, he lamented that the day seemed as though it would end in failure, until he observes A and a young
Killer B
 decapitate the dummy.

Personality

Stemming from his extended tenure as a shinobi, Dodai displays a calm, and level-headed demeanour even when in under the dire straits of war. This along with his tactical and methodical nature was shown during his battle against the Third Raikage, where he calmly explained the Third's abilities and assessed his actions to form successful strategies in the heat of the moment. Also not one to shy away from tough decisions, when Naruto's clone asked why Dodai chose to save him, rather than actual people, a saddened Dodai frankly states that Naruto's clone was an integral component to combatting Madara at that point in time.

Appearance






Dodai in his youth.



In his youth, Dodai had short and spiky, dark-coloured hair that was largely obscured underneath a stylised
forehead protector
 in the form of a hat. Along with this item, his typical attire consisted of the standard outfit of most Kumogakure shinobi including the distinctive single-strap
flak jacket
, as well as an eye patch worn over his left eye.

In his old age, the contours of his face have become more pronounced and he has grown a small goatee. He wears the high-collared variant of the Kumogakure outfit along with
flak jacket
 and his signature hat-styled
forehead protector
. His eyepatch now has the stylised kanji for "lightning" (
雷
,
kaminari
) inscribed upon it.

Abilities

Dodai is a highly skilled shinobi, able to teach others the basic mechanics behind the
Lightning Release: Double Lariat
 with
A
 while in his youth. He is also a member of the
Allied Shinobi Forces

Communications Team
, able to patch people through directly to HQ. Dodai has shown that he can react and think very quickly in combat.
 Upon noticing one of the Third Raikage's attacks he immediately told his comrades to put up an appropriate defence which he then fortified.
 He could react to the Third Raikage's speed mid-attack, while at the same he set up a decoy for the Third to follow.

Nature Transformation






Dodai using Lava Release.



Dodai possesses the
Lava Release

kekkei genkai
, allowing him to combine both
fire
 and
earth
 natured chakra, which he can use to create and manipulate the form and movements of an extremely durable and rubber-like substance, that was strong enough to withstand multiple of devastating techniques. The rubber-like substance created can be manipulated to serve multiple purposes, such as a
rubber wall
 for defence, or large
rubber balls
 to serve as a crafty distraction. He has also shown that he can manipulate the lava to form a
rope
 out of this rubber that can be used to grab things with and a
large tube
 for added defensive purposes, which was strong enough to absorb and dissipate the impact from Madara's
meteorite attack
. Unlike the other known users of the Lava Release, Dodai is not only shown to emit the substance from his mouth, but is also able to summon it within his vicinity and from his body.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Main article:
Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Dodai was assigned to the
Fourth Division
 as a member of Communications Team where he fought against several
reincarnated
 shinobi, including the
Third Raikage
 whom he had once served under. While confronting the Third, he revealed the strengths and weaknesses of his deceased superior to the other members of the division, before asserting that to adequately counter the Raikage's endurance they would require a far stronger
wind
 release technique than
previously
 used. When later asked by
Temari
, he recounted the story of how the Third had died.

After observing
Naruto
's arrival and the Third's evasion of his
Rasenshuriken
, Dodai tells him that the Raikage won't be hit while using his
Lightning Release Chakra Mode
. However, when the attack finally collides, Dodai is more surprised by the Third's terrifying rate of recovery. Informing the division of his suspicions about the Kage's strange behaviour, he urges the others to disperse when the Raikage begins charging his
strongest technique
, before instructing the Earth Release users to prepare a
defensive wall
 that he himself later reinforces with his
Lava Release: Rubber Wall
 technique. Retrieving Naruto, he details the Third's technique and comments upon the foolish attempts of some shinobi to attack the Raikage as he breaks through the wall, in spite of his warnings. As Dodai continues his explanation, Naruto asks how the Third received his scar despite his resilience and so, he describes how the Third confronted the
Eight-Tails
 alone but never disclosed the specific details to anyone.

Curious about how a human can manipulate such dense
chakra
, as Naruto attempts to form a
Tailed Beast Ball
, Dodai isn't shocked when the technique fails but is instead concerned by Naruto's apparent overexertion. Responding to Naruto's later inquiry into contacting
Killer B
, Dodai identifies that he can patch him through via
Inoichi Yamanaka
, just as the cliff beneath them is destroyed. Seeing the Raikage prepare to knock out Naruto, Dodai seemingly encases him within a
ball
 that the Third then pursues, unaware that Naruto had actually been removed.






Dodai contacts Inoichi, while the Third Raikage is distracted.



This provides a small opportunity to reach both B and the
Eight-Tails
, which Naruto uses to formulate a strategy. Placing his faith in this plan and commanding the
Sealing Team
 to assemble, Dodai observes the Third impale himself with his own technique, realising that this must have been how he received his only scar. After the Third is sealed, he states that it was indeed contradictory for a shinobi to possess both the strongest spear and shield, and that in the end, the spear was the stronger of the two.






Dodai and the Hokage Guard Platoon pursue Mū.



When
Madara Uchiha
 devastates the battlefield by dropping two meteorites on it, he
saves
 the clone of Naruto located there. In response to Naruto's question, Dodai laments that even though Naruto was just a clone, he saved him instead of other shinobi because he was integral to winning the battle. He then heads over to the Tsuchikage along with the rest of the shinobi. As reinforcements in the form of the remaining Kage arrive, he tells the others that he informed HQ of their coordinates.

As
Mei
 and
A
 engage Madara in battle, Dodai enlists the help of the
Hokage Guard Platoon
 members to go after the
Kabuto
-controlled
Mū
, who had begun to emerge from the debris. The four men then give chase to him but their target is soon slapped away by A. As the battle between the Kage and Madara wages on, they continued to give chase to the evasive Mū.

With the Impure World Reincarnation released, Dodai watched alongside his comrades as Mū was enveloped in a light of sorts before beginning to deconstruct.

Trivia

"Dodai" can mean either "rough draft" (
土代
) or "foundation" (
土台
) in Japanese.

The kanji for "lightning" (
雷
,
kaminari
) inscribed upon his eye-patch, is the same stylised kanji that the users of
Black Lightning
 tattoo on their shoulders to signify their possession of this ability.

According to the fourth databook, Dodai is described as the village's greatest myth storyteller.

In the manga, his eye-patch is circular, while in the anime, it is depicted as being square.
