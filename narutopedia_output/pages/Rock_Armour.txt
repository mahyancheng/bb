The user flows earth-chakra through their body, absorbing the properties of earth around them to form a skin-deep armour that is transparent and is only visible when light reflects off it. The armour is shown to be able to defend from all forms of blunt-force trauma. At the same time, it enhances the user's strength, allowing them to deliver powerful strikes and break free of restraints. Because this technique works by constantly absorbed earth properties, it requires no extra chakra after initiating it, yet still needs a sufficient amount of stone to be performed.
