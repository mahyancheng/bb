While in
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
, Naruto gathers and balances the necessary black and white chakra to form a condensed, miniaturised
Tailed Beast Ball
. Upon impact, the ball explodes resulting in a very sizeable blast radius. As with the
Rasengan
, he can extend the ball forward with the use of a
chakra arm
. Naruto can use a
shadow clone
 to help him form the ball,
 while in
Tailed Beast Mode
 he can form it on his own.
