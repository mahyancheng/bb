Hiruzen
 leads a mission along with his
Anbu
 to capture
Orochimaru
 at one of his many caches. Avoiding a battle, Orochimaru escapes from the man who once was his teacher, putting himself on the run in the process. On the way to the country's border, Orochimaru suffers an attack by
Kakashi
, who is easily defeated. A snake then approaches Orochimaru, who, unaware of an
explosive tag
 concealed in it, is critically injured in the resulting explosion.
 Sent by
Danzō
,
Kinoe
 is on his way to a venue to help Orochimaru cross the
Land of Fire
's border, but once at the place where he should wait for Orochimaru, Kinoe finds
a very peculiar clan
 who lives there to serve Orochimaru. One of its members, a
young girl
 is convinced that Kinoe is her long-lost brother, Tenzō.

Trivia

When Kakashi confronted Orochimaru during the third round preliminary of the
Chūnin Exams
, Orochimaru said that Kakashi did not have the
Sharingan
 last time they met, but this episode contradicts that.
