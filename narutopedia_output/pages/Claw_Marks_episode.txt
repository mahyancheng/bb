 anime.

Synopsis

Isshiki
's vanishing soul addresses
Code
, instructing him to carry on the
Ōtsutsuki
 will. He tells Code to eat the Chakra Fruit from
God Tree
 after feeding either
Kawaki
 or
Boruto
 to the
Ten-Tails
, and become an Ōtsutsuki himself. Code vows to fulfil Isshiki's wish.
Yurito
 takes Kawaki to
Sai
 and
Shikamaru
, who confirms to them that the marks they found are Code's
Claw Marks
. Code makes his way to a still
staffed facility
 from
Boro
's
Ōtsutsuki Cult
. Kawaki finds Boruto at the
Hokage Rock
, and admonishes for taking
Amado
's medicine. He tells Boruto about the Claw Marks, and warns him that Code is special among the Inners. At Boro's facility, the guards refuse to let Code in and attack him. Code uses his Claw Marks to evade and kill them. Kawaki explains Code's ability, and reveals to Boruto that Code acquired a
Kāma
 despite being unable to become a vessel. More guards show up to attack Code, including one who injects himself with multiple enhancer syringes to become more powerful. He still fails to land a blow on Code.
 Kawaki adds that unlike other Inners, Code's combat abilities exceeded
Jigen
's, and asked that his modifiers restrain his strength so as not to undermine Jigen in deference to Isshiki's vessel. Amado created several cyborgs more powerful than Jigen, but Jigen ordered them to be destroyed. Code finishes killing the guards and enters the facility. Sai and Shikamaru notify
Naruto
 of the Claw Marks, comparing them to the
Flying Thunder God Technique
. They've assigned teams to monitor the four marks they found, but consider the possibility those are meant as decoys to decrease their forces inside the village. They confirm that
Sasuke
 has made no contact, and Naruto tells him to inform Sasuke about the Claw Marks. Sai is certain Code is hunting those involved in Isshiki's death. Shikamaru informs Amado he'll have increased security, as he's the only one who can rescind Code's limiters. Amado thinks it's just another person to spy on him, but the increased protection is appreciated. He does warn Shikamaru that if he is captured, he's likely to comply to avoid torture. Shikamaru finds him a parasite, Amado retorting it's the only way someone weak like him can survive. Code finds a facility member called
Bug
, and asks him about
Ada
, a cyborg that Boro stored instead of destroying as ordered by Jigen. Bug caves in to the implied threat, and takes Code to storage. Kawaki suggests Boruto brand Code with a Kāma, which is has survived before, making him into Boruto's vessel. This way, they can get rid of Code and secure Boruto's life if
Momoshiki
 takes him over. Kawaki chides Boruto for being apprehensive about sacrificing Code to save himself. Boruto decides to train. Bug takes Code to Ada. Code is surprised that Boro disobeyed Jigen, and kept his transgression a secret because he wasn't sure of it himself until now, also disliking the idea of taking Boro down if Jigen ordered it. Bug thinks he would do it without blinking. Code only knows that Ada knows everything, and wants Bug to wake her up, but he is apprehensive about it, explaining Code can't force her to obey him. Before Bug can explain further, Code slashes her storage open, figuring he can just kill her if she defies him. Ada wakes up and ignores Code. He threatens to kill her, and she tells him to try.
