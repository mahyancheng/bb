Summary

Sasuke
 was pleased to have
Fugaku
 accompany him on his first day at the
Academy
. However, the weight of his father's, his instructors', and even his classmates' expectations for him to measure up to
Itachi
's achievements left him disheartened. Despite Sasuke's best efforts and initial praise from his father, the pressure intensified. Meanwhile, Itachi, burdened by the anticipated responsibilities as the future of the
Uchiha clan
, began showing signs of strain. At one point, he speculated that Sasuke harbored resentment towards him. Sasuke tried to convey that this wasn't the case, but Itachi insisted that, as an older brother, his role was to serve as an obstacle for Sasuke.
