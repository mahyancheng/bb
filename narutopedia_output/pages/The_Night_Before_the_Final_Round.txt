 anime.

Synopsis

The
genin
 are disheartened at considering they might have to fight their own team-mates.
Hōki Taketori
 asks if they'll be told who their opponent is that day. The proctors explain they'll be judged on their ability to improvise and adapt to the situation, so their opponent will only be announced the day of the match. They're free to spend the next day training or resting.
Denki
 and
Iwabee
 comfort
Metal Lee
 over not advancing to the final round.
Team 7
 discuss their motivations for becoming
chūnin
, and promise not to hold back if they have to fight each other. The next day,
Kawaki
 passes on training with
Boruto
 and
Mitsuki
. Metal offers to help Denki and Iwabee train. They go to
Katasuke
's lab, where according to exam rules, Denki's allowed to use
Scientific Ninja Tools
 of his own creation. He's motivated because this allows him to showcase his skills, even when he's less combat oriented. They discuss which genin they might fight. Denki asks Metal to be his practice opponent, and soundly defeats him.

Shikadai
 takes
Inojin
 and
Chōchō
 to barbecue. Inojin tries
taking over
 Chōchō to avoid their bill getting too big, but she overpowers him. They think back to going there since they were babies, and Shikadai offers to handle the bill, and when they're chūnin, they'll split the bills. Inojin and Chōchō later discuss that Shikadai was wearing his chūnin
vest
 under his clothes, as an encouragement for them to earn their own.
Sai
 checks on
Team 25
, and they focus on his
Anbu
 teachings.
Wasabi
 and
Tsubaki
 train together, but Tsubaki says it's enough for the day, not wanting Wasabi to be exhausted the next day. Tsubaki receives a message from the
Land of Iron
. She's happy because she's being called back for a leadership position after the exams are over, seeing it as the result of her training with shinobi. Namida and Wasabi are happy for her success, but sad over her imminent departure.
Team 5
 arrives, and Iwabee and Wasabi begin arguing. Denki tells them to stop, and Tsubaki notices his battered appearance. Denki explains he's been testing a Scientific Ninja Tool in the lab all day.
Sarada
 asks
Sasuke
 for advice, and he tells her the same he told Boruto, that a shinobi must always be prepared. She hears a loud noise, and finds Chōchō training by herself. Chōchō confesses feeling jealous over Shikadai being the only chūnin in their team, despite them being like family. The genin prepare and celebrate for the next day. Four men arrive at
Konoha
.
