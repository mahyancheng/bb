The
Space–Time Technique Formula: Underworld Turnover
 was a technique designed by
Orochimaru
 for the sole purpose of revenge. It was utilised by the
reincarnated

Sound Four
 releasing their hatred within their
cursed seals
.

Overview

The seal activates around the user, trapping anyone within its range. The souls of both targets and users are separated from their bodies and confined to a special barrier.

 ninja and even the
Byakugan
 cannot sense and see through this technique respectively. The targets are left in a state similar to suspended animation, still alive, but just barely, so much their chakra flow stops. To restore the trapped souls to their bodies, it is necessary to touch them with chakra.
Inoichi Yamanaka
 likens this to a
genjutsu cancel
.

Inside the barrier, the souls of those trapped still feel like themselves, and are capable of using any techniques they know. Even if the casters of this technique are defeated it will not end. As such, it is only a matter of time before the life of those who are trapped by the barrier ends, as their physical bodies will eventually die. However, it sacrifices the lives of the users so the targets can be trapped and the users' malice is not blocked by the barrier so a ninja who can
sense ill will
 can locate the barrier and break it, freeing the souls trapped within, while the users' disappears.
