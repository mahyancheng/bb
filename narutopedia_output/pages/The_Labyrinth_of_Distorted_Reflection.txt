"
The Labyrinth of Distorted Reflection
" (
乱反射の迷宮
,
Ranhansha no Meikyū
) is episode 97 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

In
Konoha
, the crystallised bug is analysed and
Tsunade
 confirms her suspicion to
Shizune
 about
Orochimaru
's follower using
Crystal Release
, an ability thought to be non-existent.
Team Yamato
 finds themselves lost as
Kakashi
 had not left any trails or signs for them to follow;
Sai
 creates an
ink bird
 to fly above the perimeter to scout for any signs while
Naruto
 excuses himself from the group on the pretence of relieving himself. However, once he finds himself secluded, he attempts to continue his training in secret until he notices a light mist settling in and spots
Yūkimaru
, the young boy he had met at the hot springs. Yūkimaru is cryptic, but after Naruto reaffirms that the people who are thinking about you is where your home is, Yūkimaru disappears, along with the mist.
Sakura
 arrives, and believing that Naruto is lying about having encountered someone, ushers him off as
Yamato
 had found one of
Shino
's bugs.

In the meantime,
Guren
 berates
her team
 for failing to dispose of their pursuers and launches her own plan. She proceeds to create a
jade crystal dome
 that traps
Team 8
. Guren then produces a
crystal mirror
 in order to create six
jade crystal clones
. Team 8, meanwhile, finds themselves lost in the woods as Shino's bugs are unable to locate the enemy, having lost their movement; to make matter worse,
Hinata
 finds herself unable to effectively use her
Byakugan
 to find their foes, as she can only see the images of her team refracted over and over again. Guren and her clones arrive to deal with Team 8, generating
jade crystal blades
 from her forearms. Kakashi uncovers his
Sharingan
 to give him an edge, but Guren reveals that her Crystal Release cannot be copied. Elsewhere, Hinata manages to defeat one of the clones with her
Eight Trigrams Thirty-Two Palms
, though she is encased within a
jade crystal prison
 by another crystal clone. The other crystal clones stop their fight with their respective opponents in order to lure them into a clearing, where Guren warns them that should they interfere any further, the confined Hinata would disintegrate into shards.

On the outside, Team Yamato finds themselves unable to break through the crystal labyrinth. Using his ink bird, Sai notifies them that the dome is a kilometre in length with the top covered, and does not have any weak spots. Using his
Wood Release: Great Forest Technique
, Yamato attempts to penetrate through the labyrinth, only for the crystal to not respond; he attempts to create a tunnel, but finds out that the crystal is embedded underground as well. Confident that his new technique would do the trick, Naruto
summons

Gamakichi
 and
Gamatatsu
, surprising Sakura and Sai, with the latter asking when he had learned such an impressive technique. Infusing his
wind chakra
 with Gamatatsu's
Water Release: Water Gun
, the duo manage to create
Wind Release: Toad Gun
, which manages to puncture the crystal.
