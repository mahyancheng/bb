 The Sixth Round Match, and Then…!!) is chapter 74 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Shikamaru
 and
Kin Tsuchi
 are selected for the sixth match. Shikamaru immediately tries to catch Kin with his shadow, but she dodges and retaliates by throwing
senbon
 at him. He avoids them only to be distracted by a sound behind him. He finds that there are bells attached to the senbon which, in turn, are attached to strings that Kin can use to ring them from a distance. She attacks him with another volley, but then finds she is paralysed, Shikamaru having snuck his shadow over to her via the strings' shadows. Shikamaru throws a
shuriken
 at Kin, who, forced to copy his movements, does the same. As they both lean back to dodge, Kin hits her head on the wall, not having realised how close she was. Shikamaru wins, and
Naruto
 and
Kiba Inuzuka
 are chosen for the seventh match.
