 manga.

Summary

As
Naruto
 reaffirms
Obito
's existence, the
Uchiha
 notes that it did not matter anymore as he had transcended into the "
Second Six Paths
". Unsupportive of this, Naruto says that both of them were similar in a lot of ways including their upbringing, goals and beliefs. Naruto then tells Obito that nobody would acknowledge him for his
dream
 that robbed them of their freedom. Obito responds that both of them were actually indeed very similar and that was the reason he wanted Naruto to think that the world was hopeless. Obito explains that he saw his old self in Naruto, and wanted him to abandon his
ideals
 before they brought him nothing but misery.
 Chiding Obito for running away from life, the young Uchiha, however, sticks to the fact that he is actually doing what a
Hokage
 should do by bringing peace to the world; noting that he had simply found a shortcut to achieving this. Adamant in his beliefs, Naruto tells Obito that there was no shortcut to the dream of being Hokage who was a person who was supposed to go before everyone and make the way easier for them to follow. Obito reflects more on his past and
Rin
, and Naruto says that Obito still has bonds with his friends, as seen when the
Ten-Tails
 tried to take control over his body and how he had maintained control of his consciousness by remembering his
old team
. Naruto asks Obito to accept himself as a shinobi of
Konoha
, atone for his crimes, and come to the side of the Shinobi Alliance and then reaches out his hand to Obito.
