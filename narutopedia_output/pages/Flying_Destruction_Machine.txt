This giant flying machine is operated by three people while a fourth person sits in an extendable compartment where he focuses his
chakra
 into an explosive beam capable of producing mass destruction. It was used by the
Land of the Sky
 in their assault on
Konohagakure
. It was crushed when
Shino Aburame
 used his
kikaichū
 to devour the fleet, causing debris to fall on the machine.
