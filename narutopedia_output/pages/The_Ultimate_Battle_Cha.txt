"
The Ultimate Battle: Cha!
" (
ベストバトルはしゃーんなろー!!
,
Besuto Batoru wa Shānnarō!!
) is episode 42 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Sakura
 and
Ino
 continue exchanging blows with neither able to gain the upper hand, and running out of chakra. She berates Ino for being too focused on beauty rather than her
kunoichi
 skills, causing her to cut her hair off, and throw it on the ground.

Desperate, Ino decides to use
Mind Body Transfer
 to force Sakura to forfeit, despite knowing how inaccurate it is, and that she will be left immobile if it misses. Sakura dodges the attack and appears to have won, but finds herself trapped by the strands of Ino's cut hair which have been infused with
chakra
 to form a binding rope. Ino reveals to only have pretended to miss on purpose, intending to lead her into the trap. She uses Mind Body Transfer again, knowing it can’t miss now, and succeeds on gaining control of Sakura's body.

Having gained control,
Ino
 tries to make Sakura forfeit the match. Just then,
Naruto
 yells at her to not to give up, prompting
Inner Sakura
 to appear and force Ino out of her head. Although confused by what happened, Ino lacks the energy to try again.
Kakashi
 presumes that Ino's lack of
chakra
 was a factor in Sakura’s small victory but also takes note of her strong will. They both charge at each other to exchange final blows, resulting in a double knock out.
Hayate
 decides that neither of them will pass to the next round.
