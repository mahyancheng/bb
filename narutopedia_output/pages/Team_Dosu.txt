This team was one of the three groups
Orochimaru
 included in his plan to infiltrate the
Chūnin Exams
 in
Konoha
. While this team entered the exams as
genin
 representing
Otogakure
,
another team
 posed as Konoha-nin, and Orochimaru himself
assumed the identity
 of
another
. Accordingly, due to various modifications, all three members used sound-based techniques. The team leader is
Dosu Kinuta
 with
Kin Tsuchi
 and
Zaku Abumi
 as his teammates.

Though instructed to kill
Sasuke Uchiha
 in the
Forest of Death
, the three were actually sent by Orochimaru to test his potential host's abilities and barely survived Sasuke when he was under the influence of the
Cursed Seal of Heaven
. Since then, though he fared well in the exams while Kin and Zaku lost in their respective matches with
Shikamaru Nara
 and
Shino Aburame
, Dosu realised that they outlived their usefulness and are now disposable. Though he made it through the preliminaries, wanting to kill Sasuke out of petty revenge against Orochimaru, Dosu later got himself killed by
Gaara
 while challenging him for the right to battle the Uchiha in the finals. Zaku and Kin were later used as sacrifices for Orochimaru to
reincarnate

Hashirama
 and
Tobirama Senju
 during the
invasion of Konoha
.

Trivia

All three member's names are written in Western order (given name first, family name last) in the Japanese version, similar to
Rock Lee
 and
Might Guy
.
