This article is about the shinobi. For Kakashi Hatake's summon, see
Urushi

Urushi
 (
ウルシ
) is a former
shinobi
 of
Konohagakure
, and a caretaker at the village's
orphanage
.

Background

At some point in time, Urushi along with some other children and
Nonō Yakushi
 from an orphanage, found a young boy under a tree wounded. After she had healed him, Urushi assisted the young boy in getting back to the orphanage with them. The next day, he stated that it was odd for someone to have no name, and as such the nun decided to call him
Kabuto
 after the helmet Urushi put on Kabuto's head.

Over the years, as the orphans aided Nonō and Kabuto in treating some Konoha shinobi, Urushi protested having to help ninja, but understood that they needed the money and dutifully helped them.

Personality

Urushi is a very unreserved and outspoken individual. This is seen from him chastising Kabuto, telling him to thank the nun that had healed him. He is also a little crass, seen when he slammed a helmet on Kabuto's head telling him to wear that so he didn't hurt his head again. Despite this, he is seemingly a kind individual as he unbegrudgingly assisted Kabuto when he was first found and noted that the young man needed a name. He also viewed the other children in the orphanage as his siblings and cared for them. During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, when he learns that a shinobi he was treating was apparently homeless, he immediately offers him a place in the orphanage. Also, despite his harsh treatment of Kabuto, Urushi actually saw him as a brother and had been eagerly awaiting his return for years. This shows he's either optimistic or has the utmost faith in Kabuto's abilities, or both, as he doesn't even seem to be considering the possibility Kabuto had died from his duties.

Appearance






Urushi as a child.



Urushi has dark eyes and hair and slightly bulbous nose, with a large birth mark covering it. As a child, he wore a cap with three pins which had the orphanage's symbol on them, a black shirt with white shorts and sandals. As an adult, Urushi wears the standard attire of the Konoha-nin inclusive of
flak jacket
 and since the war — the forehead protector of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 — which has the pins with the symbol of the orphanage which he had on his hat. He has also grown a small goatee.

Abilities

Though not much is known of Urushi's abilities, he is at the very least competent in first aid which he used in the past to help Nonō and Kabuto with their duties and most recently to aid his comrades during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 while on the battlefield.

Realising that it was already 9 o'clock he notes that he wanted the war to be over so he could go back home and get some sleep. His comrade tells him that he wished he had somewhere to return to, to which Urushi replied that he was welcomed to stay at the orphanage with him. He also notes that he has since been waiting for his
brother
's return and hoped that he'd return home soon.

Trivia

"Urushi" (
漆
) is the Japanese name of the "
lacquer tree

In the manga, when Urushi made his début during the Fourth Shinobi World War, he was depicted wearing a Konoha forehead protector, this was later corrected in the tankōbon version to wear the one of the Allied Shinobi Forces.
