Might Guy
, using his great talent with
taijutsu
, concentrates all his skill into a spinning backwards kick. The kick is so fast that it cannot be seen, much less dodged, and it is delivered with such power that targets are unlikely to get up once they're struck, much less block.
 In the anime, this technique generates a powerful whirlwind around the user, which can be used to attack multiple opponents at once.

Trivia

Infinite Tsukuyomi
 dream.
