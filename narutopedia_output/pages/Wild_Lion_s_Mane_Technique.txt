This technique uses chakra to temporarily enhance the head's metabolism and manipulate the hair that grows longer as a result of it. There is also chakra flowing through the lengthened hair, making its hardness comparable to that of steel wire. By thickly bundling the hair, its strength is further increased, also increasing its destructive power. Its name may come from the fact that, as seen just before striking
Pain
, it takes the shape of what resembles a lion's mouth.
