Flash Mode is a recurring awakening mode used by
Minato Namikaze
 throughout the
Naruto Ultimate Ninja
 and
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Heroes
 series. It greatly increases Minato's dash, attack and jump speed in all of its depictions.

The flash mode moveset is not reliant on the use of Minato's trademark
Flying Thunder God Kunai
, which may imply it is based on his mastery over the
Body Flicker Technique
 instead, which both his enemies and students confused with the
Flying Thunder God Technique
.
