This technique can create up to five fast jets of purple-blue chakra running through the ground in all directions, making it very difficult to evade. The jets are difficult to avoid but they do not cause fatal damage to their targets. They can, however, seal the chakra of anyone they hit for a time.

Mask Variation

At times, Yomito would remove his mask on his right arm and use it as a slicer for greater damage. Unlike the normal slicers, which seal opponent's chakra, this mask slicer would confuse the opponent, often leading them to attack their own friends. After attacking, the mask would mysteriously reappear on Yomito's arm.
