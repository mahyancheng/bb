Personality

Morio first appeared to be a suspicious individual, lurking about the medical compound and hiding in the shadows, but, in reality, is a soft-hearted, albeit shy individual, and ever since Sakura treated his wounds, he became infatuated with her, and in fact, even gave her a love letter. Sakura kindly refused the love letter saying that her heart was already taken.

Appearance

Morio has black hair, eyes, and wears the standard Iwagakure
flak jacket
 and one sleeved uniform, which is half torn. He also wears the standard
forehead protector
 of the
Allied Shinobi Forces

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Morio was first seen in the compound of the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
, being healed by
Sakura Haruno
. Shortly after his arrival,
Neji Hyūga
 spots him lurking outside the barracks several times. Morio later goes back to the tent where Sakura is in and hands her a love letter, saying he couldn't stop thinking of her after she tended his injuries and that he wanted her to have the letter because he did not know if he was going to survive the war. Sakura thanks him, but tells him that there is already
someone
 she likes. Upon hearing this piece of news, he apologises for the trouble and tells Sakura that the one she adores must be a lucky man. After leaving the tent, Morio sighs disappointedly.

Trivia

A shinobi resembling Morio was seen in chapter 522 as a member of the
Third Division
 being healed by Sakura.
