"
Hopes Entrusted to the Future
" (
未来に託す思い
,
Mirai ni Takusu Omoi
) is episode 413 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

As the
Suna
 ninja search for their
Kazekage
,
Gaara
 appears and orders for the continuation of the
Chūnin Exams
. He later communicates with
Fugi
 via
sand clone
, making the latter realise that
Hōichi
 had failed in his assassination and had been defeated. As Gaara talks about his changes as a person and his hopes for the village, Fugi slowly realises that he had misjudged Gaara.
 Feeling ashamed of his actions in attempting to usurp Gaara, he commits
seppuku
. Meanwhile,
Matsuri
 challenges
Shira
 to a battle in order to see whether the will of the Kazekage has passed on to them, as his students. Shira then wins the battle, which prompts Matsuri to offer her team's scroll; however,
Team Shira
 declines due to them having the same scroll. Due to domestic complications within the village, Gaara announces the cancellation of the third stage of the exams. In order to assess the participants' performance in the exams, detailed reports of each team were sent to their villages, leaving the decisions of promotion to their respective
Kage
. After the exams,
Team Ajisai
 is promoted to
chūnin
 by
Konan
 and is immediately assigned an S-rank mission, which results in Ajisai's death. Her corpse is then delivered to a tower, where it is picked up by Konan. Meanwhile,
Fū
 and her team are ambushed by
Hidan
 and
Kakuzu
. In
Konoha
,
Tsunade
 promotes
Kiba
,
Shino
,
Hinata
,
Sakura
,
Chōji
, and
Ino
 to chūnin, while declining the promotion of
Team Komugi
. Despite being unable to attain the two scrolls needed,
Tenten
 and
Lee
 are promoted to chūnin while
Neji
 is given a double-promotion to
jōnin
 for his actions in saving the Kazekage. Elsewhere,
Naruto
 and
Jiraiya
 start to return back to Konoha after Naruto's training.

Trivia

During the speech between Shira and Matsuri, the word "Kazekage" is wrongly spelled as "Kazakage" in the subtitles.
