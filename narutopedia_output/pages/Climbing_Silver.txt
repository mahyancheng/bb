" (

,
Bōgin

Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

The other teams reach the other
Land of Fire Bounty Stations
 but are unable to locate the
Akatsuki
. As
Hidan
 sits outside one of the bounty stations, he turns around to greet what he thought was
Kakuzu
, but turns out to be none other than
Asuma
. He recognises the
Twelve Guardian Ninja
 sash Asuma wears; as Asuma attempts to attack him, Hidan attempts to move out of the way, but is frozen in place by
Shikamaru
's
Shadow Sewing Technique
.
Izumo
 and
Kotetsu
 then rush at Hidan and impale him in his vital spots, but are surprised to see Hidan is still alive. Hidan confirms that he is immortal, and that they messed up their play by attempting to kill someone who happened to be unkillable. Just then, Kakuzu comes from behind, attempting to strike Shikamaru; Shikamaru dodges, but in doing so is forced to release Hidan.

Kakuzu recognises Asuma as someone who has a bounty on his head and praises Hidan for catching him, but Hidan tells Kakuzu to stay out of the fight, wanting to use the other three for his
Jashin
 rituals. Using his blood to draw a diagram on the ground, he prepares to attack Asuma with his
Triple-Bladed Scythe
. Asuma offers to attack Hidan while the others back him up, with Shikamaru providing support with his Shadow Sewing Technique. Shikamaru remarks how Asuma is not the one to make a sacrificial play, and remembers the day Asuma taught him how to play shōgi, and how he had beat Asuma using a sacrificial move known as the Climbing Silver. Shikamaru asks Asuma if he is intending to use that same strategy, but Asuma comforts him by telling him that he does not intent to sacrifice his life.

Using his
chakra blades
, Asuma engages in a fight with Hidan, who not only has to dodge Asuma but has to evade being caught by Shikamaru's shadows. Hidan attempts to use his scythe to kill Shikamaru, Izumo and Kotetsu, but the attack is blocked by Asuma's
Welcoming Approach: Thousand-Armed Murder
, which is the ultimate technique of the
Fire Temple
 and a specialty of
Chiriku
's. Although Asuma saved his teammates' lives, Hidan manages to use his scythe to cut Asuma's cheek. Asuma uses his
Fire Release: Ash Pile Burning
 technique to spew a stream of
chakra
-infused gunpowder to engulf Hidan, but the immortal Akatsuki member calmly walks to the centre of his Jashin diagram and ingests the blood he had nicked from Asuma.
