This
bubble pipe
 was used by Utakata to perform his
Soap Bubble Ninjutsu
. It's golden in colour and bent in the middle. It also has a tassel attached to it. It can create bubbles for many different purposes and could also be used as a melee weapon as it is very sturdy (able to block a
kunai
 without any apparent damage to it).
