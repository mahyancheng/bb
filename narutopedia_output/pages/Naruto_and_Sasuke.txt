"
Naruto and Sasuke
" (
ナルトとサスケ
,
Naruto to Sasuke
) is episode 477 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Sasuke
 channels the sealed
tailed beasts
'
chakra
 into his
Susanoo
.
Kurama
 marvels at how similar and different Sasuke is from
Hagoromo
, and warns
Naruto
 not to let his guard down. Sasuke's enhanced Susanoo takes shape, and Naruto creates shadow clones, all of them in Tailed Beast Mode. Sasuke derides Naruto for using it, seeing it as a cover for Naruto's loneliness. Sasuke sends a couple of the clones crashing down, while cutting down limbs from others. Naruto manages to immobilise Susanoo for a moment, but his attacks do nothing against it. Naruto and Sasuke take the fight above the clouds. Sasuke uses lightning arrows against Naruto's
Tailed Beast Balls
, creating massive explosions.
 As Sasuke prepares his next
arrow
, a previously downed Kurama shadow clone disperses, sending Naruto a massive amount of natural energy. Naruto merges the remaining Kurama shadow clones into a single, multi-armed, multi-faced avatar, creating a massive
Rasenshuriken
 and
Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshuriken
. Naruto reiterates his desire of beating Sasuke fair and square, though not the current Sasuke. Naruto and Sasuke's attacks clash, causing a titanic explosion. The two crash down in a heavily damaged
Valley of the End
, exhausted. Seeing Naruto still alive, Sasuke uses
Amaterasu
. Naruto blocks it, coating himself in Kurama's chakra, and throws it aside. Naruto lands a few hits, and after Sasuke lands one himself, he paralyses Naruto's clones with electrified shuriken. Sasuke thinks he's hit the real Naruto with
Chidori
, but the real one hits him from the side. Sasuke doesn't have enough chakra to maintain Chidori, and Naruto stumbles with his Rasengan. Sasuke gets on top of Naruto and begins punching him. Naruto pulls him closer and headbutts him. The two continue landing hits on each other.
Sakura
 wakes up, just remembering Sasuke and Naruto sparring in the
Academy
. It's dusk, and Sakura asks
Kakashi
 where Naruto and Sasuke are. Kakashi tells her they're fighting. Naruto and Sasuke keep fighting, barely able to stand, or even land hits on one another. Kurama manages to mould some chakra, but Sasuke absorbs it with the
Rinnegan
. Sasuke uses it to attack with Chidori, but Naruto uppercuts him at the last moment, sending him back. Sasuke tells Naruto to let him kill him, but Naruto refuses. Kurama notices Sasuke's
Kagutsuchi
-infused Chidori. Kurama fist-bumps Naruto, giving him the last of its chakra, and thinks back to Naruto's resolve in saving Sasuke. Naruto and Sasuke clash, the explosion of their attacks destroying what little is left from the Valley of the End.
