This technique is used by Ibiki to summon an iron torture chamber around himself and the opponent. First, the enemy's arms and legs are captured by four chains, and then the walls of the cage appear flat on the ground, quickly folding together to box them in. Finally, a large statue falls atop the cage, which is then tightly bound in chains.

The floor of the cage is outfitted with a number of gears that can be turned to constrict garrotte wire, which is tightly wrapped around the victim's body. It appears that Ibiki can control the force of the gears using hand seals and chakra, using it as a method of torture and interrogation. He is also able to perceive the pain of the victim.

Trivia

The statue which crowns the torture chamber is of
Fukusuke
, the Japanese god of merchant prosperity. One of the lesser known luck gods, statues of Fukusuke can sometimes be found at the entrances to businesses, similar to the
maneki neko
 statue in Ibiki's
Summoning: Iron Maiden
 technique.
Fukusuke
 is typically depicted in a formal kimono, showing respect and appreciation to patrons and customers by deeply bowing.
