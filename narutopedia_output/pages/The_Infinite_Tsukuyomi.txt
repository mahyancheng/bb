"
The Infinite Tsukuyomi
" (
無限月読
,
Mugen Tsukuyomi
) is episode 426 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

By reflecting his
Rinne Sharingan
 on the
moon
,
Madara
 activates the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
. The bright light interrupts the ongoing fight between
Tobi
 and the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 and traps every living being on the planet into the irresistible
genjutsu
. The only exceptions are
Team 7
, protected by
Sasuke
's
Susanoo
, and the
reincarnated

Hokage
.
 The trapped shinobi on the battlefield get
caught
 in the bark of the roots of the
God Tree
 one by one, despite the interventions by
Hiruzen
. Tobi, deeming his host not needed any more, releases a traumatised
Yamato
, who is approached by the Third Hokage before being trapped in the genjutsu as well. He envisions himself becoming the new leader of Team 7 and considers it the place he belongs to, unaware of it being merely a dream. Meanwhile,
Minato
 awakes in
Konohagakure
, witnessing to his horror that all the citizens were caught by the roots as well.

Trivia

In the preview of this episode,
Kaguya
 is depicted in the sky normally, while in this episode, she appears transparent.

In the manga, Naruto had only six
Truth-Seeking Balls
 left to turn into
Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshuriken
. In the anime, he had seven.

Kabuto
 is mistakenly depicted with his right horn intact.

In the manga, Yamato was already caught by the Infinite Tsukuyomi as Tobi released him, while in the anime, Yamato was able to have a brief talk with the Third Hokage before falling into the Infinite Tsukuyomi.

In the manga, Minato is erroneously depicted with six Truth-Seeking Balls on his coat, but is corrected to five balls in this episode.

Hiruzen somehow knew about Yamato's codename, despite having died before he was given the codename "Yamato".
