Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 28

"
Nine-Tails…!!
" (
九尾…!!
,
Kyūbi…!!
)

In his anger,
Naruto
 unknowingly taps into the
chakra
 reserves of the
Nine-Tails
.
Kakashi
 senses this and, worried that the seal that keeps the fox sealed within Naruto has been broken, decides it is time to finish his battle with
Zabuza
. When he sees that Naruto's mysterious chakra source also heals all the damage he has sustained,
Haku
 tries to flee. In one quick motion, Naruto avoids one of Haku's attacks and catches Haku. He then punches Haku in the face, sending him flying and shattering his ice prison. Naruto charges to deliver the finishing blow, and Haku turns to face his death, revealing that the mask he has been wearing in the entire battle has been broken.

Chapter 29

"
Important People…!!
" (
大切な人…!!
,
Taisetsuna Hito…!!
)

Seeing
Haku
's face for the first time and recognising him as the boy he met a few days earlier,
Naruto
 stops himself from killing Haku. Assuming that he is being shown mercy, Haku reminds Naruto that he killed
Sasuke
. He goes on to add that sparing his life is rude since his life no longer has meaning because he has lost to Naruto and, in turn, lost his usefulness to
Zabuza
. Because Zabuza is the only person to have enter found value in Haku's existence, Haku swore to live his life as Zabuza's tool. Meanwhile,
Kakashi
 takes advantage of the damages he has received so far. Knowing that Zabuza is covered in his blood, Kakashi
summons
 a pack of
ninken
 to follow his own scent and restrain Zabuza.

Chapter 30

"
Your Future is…!!
" (
お前の未来は…!!
,
Omae no Mirai wa…!!
)

With
Zabuza
 immobilised,
Kakashi
 prepares his
Lightning Cutter
 so that he can finally put an end to Zabuza's schemes. Elsewhere,
Haku
 asks
Naruto
 to kill him. Believing that death is the only way Haku will find happiness, Naruto charges at him just as Kakashi charges at Zabuza. Sensing his master's danger, Haku blocks Naruto's attack and disappears. Using himself as a human shield, Haku takes the full force of the Lightning Cutter, at the same time releasing Zabuza from the
ninken
. With the last of his strength, Haku grabs Kakashi to prevent him from escaping.

Chapter 31

"
Everyone's Respective Battles…!!
" (
それぞれの戦い…!!
,
Sorezore no Tatakai…!!
)

Haku
, dead, is holding
Kakashi
 in place.
Naruto
, having gone looking for Haku after his sudden disappearance, finds him in this position just as
Zabuza
 is about to slice through his body to get to Kakashi. Kakashi avoids the attack and protects Haku's body before staging a counter assault.
Sakura
, seeing that Naruto is okay, asks about
Sasuke
. When Naruto doesn't respond, she suspects the worst. Because she cannot leave
Tazuna
's side, she asks that he accompany her to Sasuke's body.

"
The Tool Named Shinobi
" (
忍という名の道具

Kakashi
 destroys
Zabuza
's arms, preventing him from attacking further. Seeing that Zabuza will no longer be able to assassinate
Tazuna
,
Gatō
 appears with a group of thugs to finish the job himself. Noticing Haku's body and remembering when Haku broke his arm, Gatō defiles his corpse. Although this makes
Naruto
 mad, he is even angrier about the fact that Zabuza does not seem to care. Zabuza reminds him that both he and Haku were ninja: tools of battle. They have no emotions or attachments. Naruto explains that this was not true of Haku as he cared deeply for Zabuza. Knowing that Naruto is right, Zabuza cries for never appreciating Haku. Hoping to repent, Zabuza takes a
kunai
 with his mouth and charges through the thugs to reach Gatō. He decapitates Gatō and that collapses from the combined attacks of Gatō's forces.

 wakes up, having only been put into a deathlike state by

.
Sakura
 tells
Naruto
 the good news, who is glad that Haku was able to stay true to his desire to not kill anybody. With
Gatō
 dead, his thugs consider pillaging the Land of Waves to replace the paycheck they will not be getting. Just then,
Inari
, along with the villagers appears to finally protect their country. After Naruto and
Kakashi
 contribute some of their own
shadow clones
, the thugs are scared off and went running way. As
Zabuza
's life fades, he asks Kakashi to take him to Haku's body as a request. As he dies, Zabuza regrets that he will not be able to join his most loyal follower. The two are then buried beside each other on a high land overlooking the country, and when
Tazuna
 completes the bridge two weeks later, Team 7 goes home to
Konoha
.

Konohamaru
 to reveal himself, and Konohamaru congratulates Naruto's detection skills, unaware that he was doing a terrible job of staying hidden. Seeing Sakura, who is moping from being turned down by Sasuke, Konohamaru assumes that she is Naruto's girlfriend. She tries to attack him for this mistake and, while fleeing, Konohamaru runs into

Kakashi
 informs
Team 7
 that they have the opportunity to enter the
Chūnin Exams

Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 are enthusiastic,
Sakura
 is worried that she will not be able to keep up with the other competitors. Nevertheless, Team 7 heads to the sign-up location together the next day and finds the members of
Team Guy
 being bullied by two
genin
. Recognising that things are not as they seem, Sasuke begins to fight one of the genin but they are stopped by
Rock Lee

chūnin
 in disguise, remark that this exam's competitors seem promising. Lee follows Team 7 to challenge Sasuke.
