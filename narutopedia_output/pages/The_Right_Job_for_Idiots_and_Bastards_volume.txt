The Right Job for Idiots and Bastards
 (

Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 manga.

Chapter 56

"
Code
" (
コード
,
Kōdo
)

Boruto
 is interviewed for his role in saving
Konoha
 from
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
, uncomfortable and wishing for the interview to be over soon.
Amado
 performs maintenance on
Kawaki
 after restoring his arm, aided by
Katasuke
 and
Sumire
. He explains why and how he was able to restore Kawaki's arm. Katasuke explains Sumire volunteered for the job. Sumire is embarrassed when Kawaki asks if she likes Boruto. Before Kawaki leaves, Amado considers asking him something, but postpones it for his next maintenance.
Sarada
,
Mitsuki
, and
Team 10
 discuss the protocols and restrictions placed on Boruto and
Team 7
, as they can no longer go on missions. Kawaki visits Boruto at the
Hokage Rock
. They revise their status and what they know. Kawaki hypothesises that Boruto could make a vessel of his own by branding someone else with a
Kāma
, so he would also be resurrected in another body if
Momoshiki
 resurrects in his.
 Boruto objects to sacrificing someone else, but Kawaki suggests
Code
. Amado tells
Naruto
 about Code, the last
Kara
 Inner left active. He explains that Code was left in charge of the
Ten-Tails
, another pressing issue.
Shikamaru
 points out they no longer have reliable means of reaching its dimension and returning. Amado confirms Code can freely reach it through abilities other than
space-time ninjutsu
. They want to prioritise dealing with Code so they have time to deal with the Ten-Tails, but Amado warns them Code is special. Code arrives at a facility of
Boro
's cult, the guards unwilling to let him in. Kawaki tells Boruto that after he survived receiving his Kāma, Code was also given one, and despite now becoming a vessel, his compatibility with Kāma allowed him to survive. Boro's guards attack Code, who evades their attacks and counterattacks
creating and emerging from black bands
, killing them and entering the facility. Amado remains wary of Code over their lack of knowledge on Kāma, and reveals that unlike other Kara members, Code allowed his body to be modified to be made weaker as not to undermine Jigen's authority. Code worshipped the
Ōtsutsuki
 as gods, which extended to Jigen, and envies Kawaki's status as a legitimate vessel. Amado reveals he created several cyborgs stronger than Jigen, but disposed of them per Jigen's orders and created
Koji Kashin
 instead. He surmises that Code will seek retribution if he learns Isshiki was defeated, and is concerned that Code will come for him to release the limiters in his body. Naruto wants Shikamaru to prepare for a
Five Kage Summit
 to reveal what they know. Boruto considers Kawaki's suggestion that becoming Ōtsutsuki means they'd have access to their jutsu. He questions if it's even possible to give Code another Kāma. Kawaki stresses that Jigen wouldn't have gone to such trouble if Kāma were easy to stick, so it's logical to try on someone who already survived and isn't someone else's vessel. He also counters Boruto's hesitation of forcing it on someone else by pointing out Code is stronger than Delta and Boro. Aware his father no longer has
Kurama
, Boruto decides to step up and train. Code greets Outer
Bug
, and informs him of Jigen and Boro's deaths. He asks about
Ada
, to Bug's surprise. Code is aware that Boro stored several cyborgs that Jigen ordered to be disposed. Unable to refuse him, Bug takes Code to a containment unit with Ada, who he identifies as one who knows everything in the world.

Chapter 57

"
Ada
" (
エイダ
,
Eida
)

Code
 wonders why
Boro
 didn't dispose of
Ada
, and explains to
Bug
 why he didn't report Boro to
Jigen
. Bug asks Code if he knows about her abilities, believing whatever plan he has to be naïve. Code only knows Ada's supposed to know everything in the world. Bug explains he can't force Ada to obey him with brute force. Code forcefully opens Ada's unit with his transformed arm, confident he can just kill her if she defies him.
Naruto
 and
Shikamaru
 conference with the other
Kage
, telling them about Code, and their recent attempts to reach their base through the portals
Amado
 told them about. Because they won't activate or are damaged, they're to assume Code is aware of Amado's betrayal. Shikamaru explains Code's goal of avenging
Isshiki
 and cultivating a
God Tree
 from a
Ten-Tails
.
Darui
 trusts
Konoha
, but expresses concerns with trusting Amado. Naruto confesses not fully trusting him, but enough based on what he has offered so far.

Gaara
 asks about the possibility of
Boruto
 or
Momoshiki
 becoming a threat like Isshiki. Naruto claims to be ready to do what he needs as
Hokage
. He talks to Amado about Boruto's situation, wishing to keep the worst case scenario out of mind until it happens. Amado understands Naruto, revealing he used to have a daughter, though she's been dead for 12 years. Amado offers Naruto a drug he developed to weaken the
Byakugan
, a byproduct of his efforts to take Jigen down. He believes that since the Byakugan's origins lie with the
Ōtsutsuki
, weakening the Byakugan might halt Boruto's transformation into one. Amado stresses the potential dangers of using it, though the decision to use it ultimately belongs to Boruto, and warns him not to let his wife and daughter take it. Naruto thanks him. Ada wakes up and ignores Code when he greets her. He threatens to cut her throat, but she remains unconcerned and tells him to try. He's incapable of doing it, and she explains that because she's been asleep for so long, she's worried about bad breath. She asks for them to wait for her at the bar. While she brushes her teeth, Bug explains to Code that she has stolen his heart, that being another of her abilities. Code is impressed, but Ada says it's overblown. She explains that being able to see everything everywhere is boring, even if there's something occasionally interesting, like Isshiki dying. Code asks how her clairvoyance works. She explains her consciousness jumps places, and the limits of it. Ada can see into the past only up to the moment of her birth, and she's not precognitive, so she can't see the future. She did infer he would come to her to learn how to release the limiters on his body. She reveals he needs an iris scan and a voice-print command from Amado, though she doesn't know what the command word is. Code wants to have someone use the
Transformation Technique
 to go around the biometric authentication, but Ada reminds him that Amado has remodelled his eyes with
scientific ninja tools
, which the Transformation Technique can't replicate. She surmises that's why he went to a shinobi village, but she intends to kill him just the same. Code assumes she hates him because he remodelled her body, but that's only half the reason. She asks Code if he likes her, and he confesses he does, and asks if the authentic-feeling emotions he has are a result of her ability. She reveals everyone becomes captivated by her through her ability, even those who could come to like her naturally. She hates Amado because he has robbed her of ordinary love. Code realises that Boro didn't dispose of her because he was captivated by her, and asks how Jigen was able to order her disposal. Ada explains there are two types of hearts she can't steal: blood relatives, and Ōtsutsuki. She asks about
Kawaki
, and Code explains he's incomplete. Ada explains Isshiki died because of Kawaki's ploy. Code realises Kawaki would be able to have a normal romance with Ada, who would be unaffected by her ability, as would Boruto. She asks about his plan to cultivate a God Tree, and one of them would be enough for her. Bug thinks to himself they're both crazy. Ada tells Code that Kage are conferencing about him. Code and Ada toast to each other's goals.

Baka to Hasami to Kuso Yarō
)

Naruto
 shows
Boruto
 the medicine
Amado
 developed and explains what they do and don't know about it, like what it can't do and what it might do to halt Boruto's transformation. He stresses that because they don't know if there are side-effects and that he might die from it, it's Boruto's decision whether or not to take them, so he should consider it carefully. Boruto examines the pills, noting their lack of smell, and nonchalantly takes one. He comments on their lack of taste and being able to take them dry, and asks Naruto how many he should take a day. Naruto is startled by how quickly Boruto made his decision. Boruto reasons that they won't know if there side-effects unless he takes them, and adds that he has been prepared for a worst case scenario for a while, which is why he was able to decide so quickly. Later at training, Boruto tells his team-mates about the meds, and
Kawaki
 criticises him for jeopardising the plan to brand
Code
 with his own
Kāma
. Boruto points out that's a hypothetical scenario, and that they have a chance of winning against him the normal way.

Sarada
 tells them to stop arguing and focus on training. Naruto and
Konohamaru
 watch them, the latter commenting on Kawaki's lack of team spirit. Kawaki continues arguing, this time with Sarada as well, and Boruto reminds him he's the one who asked to be taught
ninjutsu
. Kawaki clarifies he finds the traditional training to be inefficient, so
Mitsuki
 asks him what he suggests. Kawaki proposes something simpler, and attacks Mitsuki, who
blocks
 him, noting that the suggestion is training through actual combat, which he doesn't mind. Konohamaru prepares to intervene, but is stopped by Naruto, who asks him keep watching. Sarada complains that no is listening to her, who is their team captain. Kawaki reveals that most of
Jigen
's lessons were combat drills, and when he finally decided he wanted to strength to kill him, that's when he started improving. Mitsuki dodges his attack, so he turns to Sarada, who attacks him with
Fire Release
. He blocks it, and feints her with a
shadow clone
. Boruto blocks his attack, and tells Sarada he wants to deal with it. Mitsuki understands that Boruto wants to bet the way they train on this fight, which Kawaki agrees to. The two begin, with Boruto using shadow clones, one of them putting Kawaki in position for Boruto's
Rasengan
. Kawaki launches parts of his
transformed arm
, but that Boruto is also a clone. He sends a blast at Boruto, who absorbs it with Kāma. Boruto uses
Lightning Release: Thunderclap Arrow
, which Kawaki instinctively tries to absorb, but realises he no longer can, and is defeated. Kawaki chastises himself for being weak. Boruto approaches, and tells him not to carry it all on himself, and to lean on his team. He adds that Kawaki isn't responsible for
Kara
 targeting Naruto or the
village
, and they can't let the bad guys do whatever they want. Naruto and Konohamaru comment on Boruto's maturity. Kawaki wishes Boruto's words came from someone more reliable and agrees to doing things their way. Sarada and Mitsuki comment on his bad attitude. Naruto thinks of how strong they can get. Boruto corrects Kawaki, saying they're the ones putting up with him, and wants to resume training. Kawaki is determined to get stronger.

Chapter 59

"
Knight
" (
騎士
,
Naito
)

Kawaki
 wakes up from a nightmare of
Code
 antagonising him over being
Isshiki
's chosen vessel when they were younger. He comments on Code's attitude towards him even though he's not a vessel any more.
Amado
 corrects him, pointing out that while Isshiki's soul being gone means he can't possess Kawaki, he will always be Isshiki's vessel, because his body remains
Ōtsutsuki
, a reality he should accept. Kawaki threatens Amado, who remains unfazed. Amado comments on Kawaki's plan to implant Code with
Boruto
's
Kāma
, agreeing to its theoretical soundness, but questioning its applicability, as it's unknown if Code can be branded with another Kāma, and it would take time for Code to become a vessel, during which Code will strike first to avenge Isshiki's death. He concludes Kawaki's plan is no good, and that what he needs is more power to take Code down. Kawaki asks if
Naruto
 can defeat Code as he did
Delta
.
 He doesn't know how much weaker Naruto is without
Kurama
, but believes he would die one-on-one against Code.

Amado surmises Kawaki has been wanting for power since losing his Kāma, and suggests taking power in the form of a Kāma that is only a weapon, claiming he can make it happen. Kawaki is incredulous that Amado would make such a suggestion, knowing how much Kawaki hates Kāma, and Amado counters that Kawaki is rational to use any means necessary to achieve his goals just like him. Kawaki leaves, and Amado reiterates the choice is his. At Boro's cult,
Ada
 comments on Kawaki's distress at being unable to protect Naruto from Code. She asks if he's willing to let him off the hook, but Code refuses, insisting that those who killed Isshiki must be punished. She brings up Kawaki, and Code explains he's the exception he's making for her, which is why he can't relent on the
Hokage
.

Ada agrees, and asks him to not let Kawaki know of her involvement, so he won't hate her.
Bug
 tries to make them leave, but continues obeying Ada. Code comments on the guards he killed on his way to Bug, but Ada remains unconcerned. Bug suggests they leave to take action, but Ada wants to take their time, as Naruto and Kawaki are both heavily guarded, and the
shinobi villages
 are actively looking for Code. She is confident that when an opportunity presents itself, her
Senrigan
 will spot it. Code comments how much simpler things would be if he could remove his limiters, and thinks he could win against Naruto and
Sasuke
 one-on-one.

Ada warns him of her limited ability, restricted to basic
taijutsu
, as she dislikes fighting and pain. Code says he understands why, feels ashamed and calls her delicate. Bug thinks Ada is making him soft. She believes this makes them a good pair, calling him her knight. He questions what she could do against Kawaki and Boruto, who as Ōtsutsuki she can't beguile and could oppose them. Ada invites him to meet her other knight. Kawaki walks through
Konohagakure
, thinking of Amado's words.
Shikadai
 calls him and Kawaki snaps at him, drawing the attention of civilians. Shikadai tells him to keep walking, and informs him that while information on him is secret, since Isshiki's attack, rumours false and true have spread. He adds that since Naruto has made it Kawaki's home, Kawaki should just keep his head high.

Sumire
 questions Amado's intent with his suggestion to Kawaki. Amado believes she became his assistant to spy on him, and explains the situation with Kāma now that Isshiki is dead. She questions if there are no other reasons to restore Kawaki's Kāma. Ada orders Bug to activate another cyborg, who she considers the only non-Ōtsutsuki capable of killing her. The cyborg is Ada's younger brother
Daemon
, who she advises Code not to attack when he hops on Code's back. Other guards find them, and Bug warns they'll be killed if they don't leave. Their orders are to dispose of cyborgs who emerge without reason. Ada tells Code to watch. Each guards that attempts to attack Daemon is killed by their own attack. She explains Daemon's ability to Code. Sumire explains that after Isshiki's attack, Amado seemed motivated by something more than concern for Kawaki's welfare. He wonders if she's really smart or really stupid, and decides she's stupid when she asks if he's plotting something.

Author's Note

“

When I renovated my home, I got to install a "catwalk", as I'd long yearned to. The surface is transparent tempered glass, so the view from below is outstanding.

I can behold paw pads clearly too, and have made many discoveries, like "Oh, that's how your back legs are in that pose?!"
I feel overwhelming joy simply from being able to look up at Lord Kitty from below. Cats really are loftier than people, eh.
I'm just stupidly in love with cats...
Or rather, I'm just stupid.
