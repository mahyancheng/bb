Summary

Jirōbō
 activates level two of his
cursed seal
 to repel
Chōji
. Chōji cannot move after taking two of his
Three Coloured Pills
 and thus cannot stop Jirōbō from eating the last of his potato chips. Jirōbō assures him that he shouldn't feel bad since Chōji is fat and will soon be joined by
Shikamaru
, his "worthless" team leader, in death. Chōji thinks back to his childhood and how all of the kids his age looked down on him for his weight. Only Shikamaru stuck up for him and, in fact, didn't care, knowing Chōji had more important qualities. They have been best friends ever since. Although using the last pill will surely cause his death, Chōji does not hesitate to take the red Chilli Pill (
トンガラシ丸
,
Tongarashigan
). Easily restraining Jirōbō, he informs him that he's one-hundred times as powerful as he was before. Chōji tells him that he could ignore being called fat or having food taken from him. What he cannot forgive is Shikamaru being insulted. He punches Jirōbō, decimating the area.
