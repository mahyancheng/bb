 anime.

Synopsis

In
Amegakure
,
Pain
 acknowledges that the
sannin

Jiraiya
 was a worthy opponent and pays his respects to his fallen master.
Zetsu
, who had observed the fight, emerges from the water while Pain reminds him that
Madara Uchiha
 had tasked him with the duty of capturing the
Nine-Tails
'
jinchūriki
.
White Zetsu
 offers to come, but
Black Zetsu
 claims that there is another interesting fight that he would like to see. At the
Valley of the End
,
Tobi
 contemplates how
Sasuke
 is shedding the skin of a
snake
 and will soon soar like a
hawk
.

Elsewhere, the members of
Hebi
 wait outside of an
Akatsuki
 hideout while Sasuke ventures inside. He finds
Itachi
 in the middle of the hideout, who asks Sasuke whether he would
attack prematurely
 once more. Sasuke uses his speed to come behind Itachi and impales his brother with his
Chidori Sharp Spear
. However, that Itachi is not the real one; as Itachi splits into various crows, he tells Sasuke to meet him alone at the
Uchiha Hideout
 where they can settle things once and for all.

Sasuke and Hebi head to the hideout when
Karin
 notifies Sasuke that she is
sensing
 various
chakra
 traces belonging to the same individual. They are suddenly ambushed by a
Naruto

shadow clone
, who Sasuke easily defeats with his
Chidori
. As the clone is dispelled, its memories are absorbed by the original Naruto, who tells
the team
 that he has found Sasuke's location. However, as they rush to find Sasuke, they find themselves blocked by Tobi. Kakashi muses that Tobi was not in the Akatsuki roster
Kabuto
 had provided and Tobi explains that he is a new member. Under
Yamato
's formation, Naruto,
Sakura
,
Kiba
 and
Akamaru
 try to attack Tobi, who easily dodges their moves, and even manages to elude Naruto's
Rasengan
. Using his
Whac-A-Mole Technique
, Tobi manages to strike every single member of the team whilst simultaneously avoiding being struck himself.

Meanwhile, Sasuke's team reaches the Uchiha hideout, where they are greeted by
Kisame Hoshigaki
. Kisame tells them as per Itachi's orders, only Sasuke may be permitted to enter. Sasuke tells the group to stay put as he ventures into the hideout, ready to finish Itachi off once and for all. Outside the hideout,
Suigetsu
 decides to challenge Kisame as the latter is one of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
 who possesses the
Samehada
 blade. In order to make use of their waiting time, Suigetsu and Kisame engage in combat.
