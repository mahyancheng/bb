A timed trapping technique created by Orochimaru to destroy any evidence of the location it is placed on. Once activated, the entirety of the area is completely erased, by what appears to be a mud water vortex, destroying everything within the predefined vicinity. The technique activates regardless of who or what caught up within it.
