In the manga, she wore a bandeau under her jacket instead of a full-body suit, revealing her collarbone and upper stomach. Her manga attire also included a choker around her neck and her jacket reaches past her hips. Her hood and jacket were worn to protect her from dust clouds and the heat.

 and
Kankurō
 spoke to her and her teammates about the upcoming examinations.

 and Kankurō to aid their allies. Upon arrival, Sasuke was warped to a different dimension by Urashiki, but Gaara was able to temporally seal away the foe with the timely aid and arrival of
Shukaku

Along the way, Yodo heard the approach of two people. They turned out to be Temari and Shikadai, as the former was growing concerned for her brothers. The two genin explained the situation, directing the Konoha-nin to Shinki and Boruto's last location. Soon afterwards, the winded Kazekage muttered that the seal would soon break.

Ultimately, the two genin were able to successfully return the Kazekage to the village, relieved when he recovered.

 and

Three years later, Suna was invaded by the sentient
God Tree

sealed
 his father to protect him, but as a result, Shinki was consumed by a Claw Grime. Yodo attempted to save Shinki but was held back by Araya. Shinki told his team-mates not to worry about him and warn
Kankurō

Later, at the request of the
Eighth Hokage
, Yodo and Araya joined
Team 7
 to intercept the sudden appearance of two
Human God Trees
 in the Land of Wind. Upon meeting the team, Yodo noticed how flustered Sarada was, asking if she had a crush on
someone
, which she denied. Following Shikamaru's plan to feign befriending the God Trees, having
learned
 that
Matsuri
 had feelings for Konohamaru, the team approached the God Trees. They pretended not to know who and what they were, telling the two that they were also hunting down Boruto. It was agreed to join with the God Trees to find Boruto. Soon, Konohamaru convinced the God Trees to separate under the pretense of better searching the area, Yodo and the other kids pairing up with Ryū.

As the shinobi claimed they have leads on Boruto's whereabouts, Ryū followed them. They met up with Yodo and Araya, introducing themselves to the God Tree. Despite her best efforts, Yodo struggled to hide her hatred towards Ryū. Mitsuki asked Ryū why the God Trees wanted Boruto dead so badly. Ryū admitted that Jura finds it too troublesome that Boruto knew about the Thornsoul Bulbs. As Sarada suggests that they use a Thornsoul Bulb to lure out Boruto, Ryū agreed and produced his own. Unable to restrain herself in the hopes of freeing Shinki, Yodo rushed to steal the bulb, only for it to be a fake made of Iron Sand. Having seen through the shinobi's deception, Ryū decided they must be punished. He used his Iron Sand, which he secretly coated them with, to manipulate their bodies into attacking each other. To Ryū's surprise, Araya freed everyone with his
Magnetic Iron Sand Sealing Blade
, having developed it with Shinki previously.

With Araya's technique to protect them from Ryū's Iron Sand, the team goes on the offense. As they seemingly pin the God Tree down, he reveals his ability to transform himself into Iron Sand to escape. Yodo keeps the team a step ahead of Ryū's sand attacks with her acute hearing. The God Tree then summons several Claw Grimes to aid him, overwhelming the shinobi with their relentless attacks. As a Claw Grime is prime to devour Yodo, Araya slashes the creature, only for it to quickly secures the blade in its wound. Ryū then teleports the Claw Grime away, with Araya's sword and leaving him defenseless.

As Ryū quickly overpowered his foes and captured them, he offered to spare them if they revealed any useful information on Boruto or his accomplice. Yodo told Sarada to reveal what she knew, but the Konoha-nin refused to sell Boruto out. Yodo realised that Sarada cared deeply for Boruto, similar to her own loyalty to Shinki. Yodo instead offered to give Ryū her services in finding Boruto with her sensory powers. Ultimately, Ryū declined the offer and struck her down. As Yodo was still clinging to life, Ryū used his sand to force Sarada to finish the job with a kunai. Yodo revealed she also knew Sarada was hiding a power that can help, telling her it's okay to use something dangerous when it is to protect what you care for. Accepting Yodo's words, Sarada revealed her Mangekyō Sharingan, opening a rift to suck up all the iron sand, freeing everyone.

Ultimately, Sarada's new powers were able to overwhelm and defeat Ryū, but as
foreseen
 by
Koji Kashin
, Yodo succumbed to the injuries she had received from Ryu and had passed away.
 With his mission complete, Araya took both Yodo and Ryū's Thornsoul Bulb back to Sunagakure.
