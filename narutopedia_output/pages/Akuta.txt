Akuta
 is an
Earth Release
 technique that's created from a
Land of Earth
's
kinjutsu
, which is seemingly inspired by a
jutsu
 that was unearthed by
Ōnoki
. It was a technique designed by Ōnoki to protect the
village
 from attackers while lowering the number of casualties.

Overview

The Akuta creates living organisms made of clay
 that are weaponised. They are able to phase through the earthen ground for travel and drag their enemies with them, as well as extend their limbs.
 While they have no fear, they have a limited lifespan and intelligence, being capable of obeying instructions and communicating with
fabrications
.
 Their masks are their weakness, the destruction of which would lead to their deaths.

While deemed to have no will, this was proven false in
Akkun
's existence, a small Akuta who gained affection to
Inojin Yamanaka
, and even defied its comrades to protect him.
Kirara
 deemed Akkun as a defect for such traits. When the fabrications decided to take matters into their own hands, the Akuta produced even went against Ōnoki's orders.

Development

Ōnoki created this technique in response to a
missing-nin
's attack claiming the lives of many young
shinobi
. When he first demonstrated it, they suddenly disobeyed him and attempted to attack the audience, which led
Kurotsuchi
 to reject the technique's further development. Despite this, Ōnoki continued to hone this technique in secrecy, eventually managing to create more obedient creatures.

Iwagakure housed an underground facility where more Akuta are being mass produced. It was later destroyed by
Konohamaru Sarutobi
.
