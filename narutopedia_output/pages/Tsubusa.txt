Tsubusa
 (
ツブサ
) was a
chūnin
 from
Sunagakure
.

Appearance

Tsubusa had short, black hair and most of his face was concealed by a mask. He wore the standard attire of the Suna-nin inclusive of
forehead protector
 and
flak jacket
 and turban along with a metal face guard.

Abilities

He was said to have excellent eyes and could discover enemy forces several miles away.
 It was due to this ability that he was tasked to patrol at Sunagakure's gate and was indeed the first one to discover the approaching Akatsuki members, even when there were many other
jōnin
 and
Anbu
 present.

Part II

Kazekage Rescue Mission

While protecting Sunagakure's main entrance, he spotted
Sasori
 and
Deidara
 of
Akatsuki
 approaching the village. He informs
Yūra
 of this who told them that it'd be over before they knew it. Tsubusa and the rest of the guards were subsequently betrayed and killed by Yūra before they could raise an alert.

Trivia

He is the first character to die in Part II.
