"
Rescuing Naruto!
" (
ナルト、奪還!!
,
Naruto, Dakkan!!
) is episode 64 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Mitsuki
 wakes up in the hospital, remembering he wanted to protect
Boruto
, but is still too weak from
Urashiki
's attack.
Sarada
 informs Mitsuki of how things turned out after he was attacked. In a wasteland where a
God Tree
 resides,
Momoshiki
 drains
Kurama
's chakra from
Naruto
.
Kinshiki
 explains that this God Tree was created from a man who also harboured a Tailed Beast, who Naruto understands to be
Killer B
. Momoshiki complains about how long the process is taking, having only absorbed half of the chakra in Naruto. Naruto says he won't make it easy for them, that as shinobi, they've had to persevere to develop their abilities. Momoshiki explains how they're able to effortlessly acquire power, which Naruto links to the
Shinobi Gauntlet
, blaming himself for ignoring Boruto to the point it drove him to rely on the Scientific Ninja Tool.
 Momoshiki resumes extracting his chakra. The other four
Kage
 arrive, interrupting Momoshiki, and cutting Naruto free from his restraints. The Kage fight Momoshiki and Kinshiki while
Sasuke
 and Boruto check on Naruto. Naruto notices Boruto is wearing his old clothes. Naruto apologises for ignoring Boruto, sharing a bit of his own mischievous past. Boruto asks Naruto to tell him his story after they go back home. In Konoha,
Shikamaru
 instructs other shinobi to make sure no one else is missing, and to be on the lookout for Urashiki.
Shikadai
 asks him if they shouldn't send reinforcements. Shikamaru sees his concern for Boruto is like his for Naruto. He explains their current situation using shogi analogies. Sasuke fights Kinshiki, who has to dodge an attack from
Chōjūrō
 instead of landing a hit on Sasuke. Chōjūrō allows himself to be hit, so a concealed
Kurotsuchi
 can land a hit on him, sending him flying for Sasuke's strike. Chōjūrō and Kurotsuchi pin Kinshiki down. The others focus on Momoshiki,
Gaara
 using his
sand
 to offer others footing while pursuing him. Boruto warns Naruto of Momoshiki's ability to absorb and amplify any ninjutsu used against him. Momoshiki notices Kinshiki has been incapacitated, and upon checking Boruto with his
Byakugan
, notices how Naruto is unable to pass on his power to him, and offers to show how his clan does it. He converts Kinshiki into a chakra edible and consumes it, Sasuke attempts to strike him but fails. Momoshiki's appearance changes, including manifesting a third
Rinnegan
 on his forehead, and tells Naruto he's next.

Trivia

The episode has a number of differences from
Boruto: Naruto the Movie
 including:

As Momoshiki is draining Kurama's chakra within Naruto like in the movie, the anime allows Naruto to realise that he didn't acknowledge everything Boruto had tried to authenticate, such as
how Boruto believed he awakened the Byakugan
 and later broke his son's promise to personally come to
Himawari's Birthday
. All this made Naruto feel guilty for treating his son like a kid, and having pushed him to use the
Gauntlet
 during the
Chūnin Exams
, giving Momoshiki an advantage in absorbing the Gauntlet's power.

While Naruto didn't get the chance to apologise to Boruto in the movie, the anime allows him to apologise this time for ignoring his family and unable to understand him just to focus in protecting everyone in the village, and reveals his mischievous past to Boruto.

In the movie, Kinshiki requests Momoshiki to kill him so that
he can get stronger
. In the manga however, Momoshiki does so on his own accord. The episode follows the manga depiction, but also adds an extra line of Kinshiki who voices his willingness to be absorbed like in the movie.
