"
The Hunt
" (
探索
,
Tansaku
) is episode 122 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Kakashi
 splits the
Eight Man Squad
 into smaller sub-teams, each of them paired with two
ninja hounds
 with the exception of
Kiba
 and Kakashi, who have
Akamaru
 and
Pakkun
 as their respective partners. Their task is to find the location of
Sasuke
 or
Itachi
 and report back. In the meantime, Sasuke assigns individual tasks to each member of
Hebi
 in hopes of finding a way to Itachi.

Due to the fact that he is a
jinchūriki
 and thus a target of the
Akatsuki
,
Naruto
 is given additional protection in the form of
Yamato
 and
Hinata
 as well as being assigned
Bull
, the biggest hound in Kakashi's pack. Elsewhere,
Deidara
 and
Tobi
 begin their search for either Naruto, Kakashi or Sasuke. While riding on one of his
clay birds
, Deidara claims to have spotted one of them, although he keeps the identity of whom a secret from Tobi.

While
Suigetsu
 locates
Kyōya
 and
Ginji
, the accountant and banker of Akatsuki member
Kakuzu
,
Karin
 is sent to a village to find a clue to the Akatsuki's whereabouts. Unbeknownst to her,
Sakura
 is in the same village, with
Bisuke
 and
Shiba
 managing to locate Sasuke's scent, which is coming from Karin. However, Karin and Sakura pass each other and the scent is lost. Naruto, Yamato and Hinata are ambushed by
Kabuto
, who gives them
Orochimaru
's gathered intelligence on the Akatsuki. When asked why he would give up such a thing, Kabuto tells Naruto that he is grateful towards him; ever since Kabuto was a child, he was used as a spy and thus moved from village to village until he became Orochimaru's subordinate. After Orochimaru had died, he felt as though he had lost his purpose and identity until he realised that Naruto had forged his own identity when the villagers thought he was no more than a human variant of the
Nine-Tailed Fox
. Kabuto reveals the left side of his body to the trio, which resembles Orochimaru, and explains that he had grafted portions of Orochimaru's corpse onto himself as a way of clinging to his dead master and that he plans to avenge Orochimaru by eliminating Sasuke. With that said, Kabuto flees, evading capture.

In a clearing, Sasuke senses Tobi's presence and notices Deidara flying above him, the latter dropping two
C1
 bombs on him. Believing they have killed him, they realise that Sasuke
summoned
 a
snake
 to shield him from the damage. With his
Sharingan
 activated, Sasuke glares at Deidara, who stares back.
