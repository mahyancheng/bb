With both

 protected him from harm, thus making him the victor, he finds that he has been hurt; Sasuke used a
genjutsu
 to make it look like Izanagi was still active.
Karin
 heals Sasuke's wounds. Badly injured, Danzō loses control of the
First Hokage

stabs
 through Karin, fatally wounding both her and Danzō.
