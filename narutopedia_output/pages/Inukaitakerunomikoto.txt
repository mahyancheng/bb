A technique where the user creates ferocious canine chakra avatars from the land itself. They will pursue their targets relentlessly in order to clamp down on them with their jaws, restraining and crushing them, and their tracking speed is so great that they were even able to catch
Sasuke Uchiha
.

The user can also
transmit
 other ninjutsu through the body of one of the canines so that, after it grabs hold of a target, it will result in a direct hit.

Trivia

The name of this technique comes from the Japanese legend of
Kibitsu Hiko no Mikoto
, a prince who, with the help of his three retainers, defeated a demon. One of his retainers was named "Takeru Inukai" (
犬飼健
,
Inukai Takeru
). The tale of
Momotarō
, which is the source of Momoshiki's name, is based on this legend. Here, Momotarō befriends a dog, a
monkey
 and a
pheasant
 instead, and it is said that the dog is based on Takeru Inukai.
