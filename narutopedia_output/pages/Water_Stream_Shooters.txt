Sasori can shoot pressurised streams of water from the pipes in his palms, similar to a
water cannon
. By twisting his wrists like knobs, Sasori can condense the streams into
water jet cutters
 that can slice through rocks. It
uses
 the fourth
scroll
 on his back as ammunition. They have a great range, being able to reach clouds in the sky. By utilising the water onto areas that have been previously heated by his
flamethrowers
, Sasori can cause even rocks to crack via
thermal shock
, enough to send debris flying with great impact.
