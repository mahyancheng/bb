Monga
 (
モンガ
) was a
shinobi
 of
Iwagakure
.

Personality

Monga had a tough guy attitude. He was rather calm in stressful situations. He cared deeply for his comrades and was also very courageous and confident in his abilities, as shown when he opted to face
Gari
 alone, and when he earlier bragged that no one would lay a finger on his comrades as long as he was present. He did not expect Gari would be satisfied with being an undead puppet for the enemy, and was rather disappointed in him for speaking so easily about death.

Appearance

Monga was very large in stature: both tall and extremely muscular. He had brown hair and small black eyes, a wide nose and grey blue fang-shaped markings beneath the centre of his eyes. He wore the standard Iwagakure outfit, consisting of red clothing with a left sleeve and lapel. He wore his red
forehead protector
 in a bandanna style which was tied in the back.

Abilities






Monga using his raw strength with his nature transformation.



Monga demonstrated great capability as a shinobi. He proved skilled enough to take down Gari in a matter of seconds, showing great strategic abilities, innovatively using
Earth Release
 in conjunction with a number of
explosive tags
. In the same encounter, he also showed impressive strength, being capable of shattering rock with a single punch.

Nature Transformation

Monga was skilled in the field of Earth Release techniques. He was capable of using earth walls of
varying

sizes
 for defence as well as trapping an opponent. For offence, he could use
Earth Release: Earth and Stone Bamboo Shoot
, creating spikes to assault his opponent.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Monga attacking Gari.



As the
reincarnated
 shinobi reappear on the battlefield, most of the Third Division is scattered into small squads. Monga leads a squad consisting of
Maki
 and
Ruka
 that is assigned to protect the Medical, Sealing and Intel squad members. Gari confronts the squad who Monga thought he would never face in battle. Disappointed in Gari's attitude of being okay with being controlled, Monga battles his former comrade and blows him to bits with rocks by pushing a
mud wall
 placed with
explosive tags
. Monga instructed Maki to
seal
 Gari, but he is caught in a sneak attack by
Pakura
, and ultimately
mummified
.
