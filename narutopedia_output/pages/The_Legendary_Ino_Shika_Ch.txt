"
The Legendary Ino–Shika–Chō
" (
伝説の猪鹿蝶
,
Densetsu no Ino–Shika–Chō
) is episode 239 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Ino
 is irritated at her
father
 for walking in on her while she wasn't finished changing and then having the gall to suggest that she may be dating
Shikamaru
 or
Chōji
. As Shikamaru and Chōji try to calm her down, the three notice three kids fighting. Shikamaru uses his
Shadow Imitation Technique
 to prevent them from fighting as Chōji and Ino convince them to stop, the latter managing to infatuate the three boys.

The ordeal is witnessed by
Kosuke Maruboshi
, who praises
Team Asuma
's teamwork. Shikamaru reminds his teammates that they met him before during a mission they were given when they were
genin
, when they used their
Ino–Shika–Chō
 formation to save him from being killed by bandits. Shikamaru remembers that after that mission, Kosuke told him that it was the second time he was saved by the Ino–Shika–Chō, and Kosuke reveals that he was once saved by their fathers.

During the
Konoha Crush
, Ino–Shika–Chō
battled
 the invading
Oto
-nin by combining
Chōza
's
Multi-Size Technique
 with
Shikaku
's
Shadow Sewing Technique
 and Inoichi's
Mind Body Disturbance Technique
. Shikaku then used his
Black Spider Lily
 to pull the opponents into range of Inoichi's
Mind Disturbance Dance Performance Technique
, causing the enemies to fight amongst themselves. Kosuke had been amazed by their teamwork then, while Shikaku mused that their children would surpass them in a few years.

As Kosuke finishes sharing the story, he departs, leaving the three bummed out that they haven't managed to surpass their fathers after all. However, Shikamaru cheers them up by stating that they are smart and known for strategising and that they would be fine during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 since they would not be fighting alone.

Trivia

Both the
Yamanaka
 and
Akimichi clans
' symbols shown in this episode are erroneously depicted compared to the symbol shown in the manga. The Yamanaka symbol has no lines touching the circle and the Akimichi's is noticeably missing the vertical line that is supposed to run through it.

In this episode,
Shikaku
 is briefly shown without his goatee.
