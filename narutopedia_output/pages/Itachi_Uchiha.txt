Summary

Asuma
 and
Kurenai
 confront the two
cloaked individuals
. Discovered, the two reveal themselves as
Itachi Uchiha
 and
Kisame Hoshigaki
. Recognising how dangerous they are, Asuma and Kurenai prepare for battle. Asuma blocks Kisame's sword attack with his knuckle blades while Kurenai prepares to use a
genjutsu
 on Itachi and Kisame. Kisame's manages to overpower Asuma and his sword slices his shoulder. Kurenai's genjutsu takes effect, but Itachi easily
reverses
 it onto Kurenai. Itachi then takes the initiative of attacking her while she's in the genjutsu, but she breaks it just in time to evade his lethal attack. Meanwhile, Asuma is able to avoid Kisame's sword swings, and then delivers a cut to Kisame's face with his
chakra-enhanced knuckle blade
. As the battle begins to get more intense,
Kakashi
 arrives to aid Kurenai and Asuma, apologising for intervening in their battle, but that he felt a bit uneasy about who they may be up against.
