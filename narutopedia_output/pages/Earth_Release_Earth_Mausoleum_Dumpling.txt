Using
chakra
 and great physical strength, the user lifts a huge volume of the nearby
earth
. The mass of dirt is so large as to cast a shadow over the user's opponents and potentially frighten them away. When the user throws the earthen lump, it causes serious destruction at the place of impact.

Trivia

The name of this technique may be taken from the Japanese art of
Dorodango
 (
泥だんご
,
literally meaning:
 Mud Dumplings), in which hard, polished spheres are made using nothing but earth, water, and one's hands.
