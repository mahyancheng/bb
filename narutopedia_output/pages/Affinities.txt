Summary

Shikamaru
 catches
Hidan
 with his shadow and forces him to attack an immobilised
Kakuzu
. Kakuzu is able to free himself at the last moment, but Shikamaru uses Hidan to drive him into a corner. In
Konoha
,
Naruto
 nears completion of his
new technique
. While taking a break,
Yamato
 tells him that all elemental affinities are naturally strong and weak to other elements. He points out that Naruto's
Wind Release
 is weak against
Sasuke
's
Fire Release
, but Naruto reinterprets that as his Wind Release making Sasuke's Fire Release stronger. Meanwhile, Kakuzu uses an
earth
-based defence to protect himself. Kakashi uses his
Lightning Cutter
, which is naturally strong against earth, to pierce through the defence.
