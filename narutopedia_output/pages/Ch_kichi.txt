Chūkichi
 (
中吉
) was a famed
Kirigakure

shinobi
 during his lifetime.

Personality

Although not demonstrated in much depth, Chūkichi possesses a strong moral sense of honour and duty to his village.
 As such, he showed a strong aversion to anything affiliated with the organisation
Akatsuki
. This strong moral sense proved enough provocation to warrant the eradication of the remainder of his personality.
 This resulted in Chūkichi speaking in broken sentences from that point onwards.
 He was also described as being extremely cautious but ironically also being hasty, rash, and impatient.

Appearance

Chūkichi was a relatively large man with three distinct, broad, blue striped markings on his face, two of which extended to the back of his head. His attire consisted of the standard pinstriped underclothing of Kirigakure ninja and a dark-blue robe with light-blue trimmings, over it. He also wore a pair of small glasses, a
forehead protector
 which he wore like a bandanna, and a purple necklace resembling
prayer beads
.

Abilities






Chūkichi using the Hiding in Frost Technique.



During his lifetime, Chūkichi was renown as a master
sensor
 able to detect even the most subtle of chakra signatures and the most minute of details. He was also recognised in his village as easily being its most prodigious sensor.
 He was a well noted shinobi during his lifetime, enough to justify his inclusion as a
sensor
 and a backup within Akatsuki's
Surprise Attack and Diversion Platoon
, alongside
Deidara
,
Sasori
 and
Shin
.

In the anime, he was shown to be capable of
turning an area into frost
, concealing himself from opponents.
 He could take advantage of this and use
Silent Killing
 to sneak up and assassinate his opponents.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Chūkichi refusing to follow Akatsuki's orders.



In preparation for the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Chūkichi was
reincarnated
 by Kabuto to fight against the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, before being assigned to the Surprise Attack and Diversion Platoon as the group's sensor. Realising that those commanding him were affiliated with Akatsuki, an infuriated Chūkichi refused to follow their demands, leading to the complete eradication of his personality by Kabuto.

After mobilising atop
Deidara
's
clay bird
, he located the three remaining members of the
Infiltration and Reconnaissance Party
, and alerted his group to their presence. Despite Chūkichi's
sensing ability
 being later
neutralised
 by
Muta Aburame
's
insects
, they soon captured the remnants of
Anko Mitarashi
's team. He remained vigilant some distance away while
Sasori

manipulated
 a
booby-trapped
 Muta to attack the opposing
Surprise Attack Division
, but after detecting that the enemy had
evaded
 the blast, Chūkichi separated from his group in order to find reinforcements. On route to find back up he heard the explosion from
Shin
 as he was detonated by Deidara, but pressed on with his mission.






Chūkichi arrives with reinforcements.



Meeting with
Chiyo
,
Hanzō
, and
Kimimaro
, Chūkichi requested their assistance, before returning to the location where Deidara was
imprisoned
. Confronted once again by
Kankurō
's division, he pursued them alongside the others, when the opposition retreated. However, when the
Fifth Division
 arrived swelling the ranks of the opposition, he sought refuge within the nearby forest, instead of facing the enemy directly.

In the anime, he was sent to give aid to
Deidara
 whom had managed to escape. When he attempts to kill Kankurō while
camouflaged
, he is stopped by
Mifune
.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

With the Impure World Reincarnation released, Chūkichi is enveloped in a light of sorts before beginning to de-construct and his soul was released and returned to the
afterlife
.

Trivia






An unnamed shinobi who bears a strong resemblance to Chūkichi.



"Chūkichi" (
中吉
) means
"middle blessing"
.

Chūkichi shares his character design with an unnamed Kirigakure shinobi who was abducted by
Hiruko
 for use with his
Chimera Technique
 during the events of
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
.

In three chapters, Chūkichi's glasses were shaded black.
 However, in his début and all other instances following these chapters, they weren't. Oddly, this was never corrected in the tankōbon.
