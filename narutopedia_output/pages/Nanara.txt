Nanara
 (
ナナラ
) is the son of the
Land of Redaku
's previous king.

Background

After his father's death, Nanara was the first choice to replace him as King of Redaku. Nanara did not want the job and pressured his sister
Manari
 to become Queen in his place. She did so without complaint. Afterwards, the
Prime Minister
 and his allies convinced Manari to send Nanara to
Nagare Village
, arguing that he was too young to grow up in the palace; Manari agreed. To Nanara, it was obvious that Manari was being manipulated by her advisors into doing this, but he had no personal objections and so said nothing; he, in fact, made no contact with Manari after leaving the palace, as he feared that she would come to resent the job and hate Nanara for forcing it upon her.

Before Nanara left for Nagare Village, the Prime Minister kept him marginalised, advising Nanara that it was better he have others read to him rather than learn to read on his own. Once Nanara went to Nagare, the Prime Minister would send tutors to teach him, but they would all quickly be driven off by Nanara's pranks. When that happened, the Prime Minister would send another tutor.

Appearance

In the anime, Nanara has emerald green eyes and grey brown short hair with jaw-length bangs framing either side of his face.
