Wandering Ninja Clan
 were
mercenaries
 who appeared in

.

Overview

While being
missing-nin
, the
forehead protectors
 they wore bear no markings, thus not signifying which village they originated from (if at all). As a further sign of their lack of allegiance, Ishidate showed no remorse when he accidentally killed his contractor in reckless fury.

All three had low-cut hair but wore what seemed to be wigs and specialised in
close-combat
, combined with a
performance-dulling drug
 that confounds their opponents.

, the king of the
Land of the Moon
