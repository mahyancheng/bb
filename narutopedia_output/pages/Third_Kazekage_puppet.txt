This article is about the Human Puppet used by Sasori. For the former leader of Sunagakure, see
Third Kazekage
. For other uses, see
Third Kazekage (disambiguation)
.

This is the
human puppet
 created by
Sasori
 from the body of
Sunagakure
's
Third Kazekage
. The efforts that Sasori went through to acquire the puppet made it his favourite.
 In the end,
Sakura Haruno
 destroyed the puppet and in the anime, when
Chiyo
 tried to use the head to attack Sasori, he simply incinerated it.





Third Kazekage puppet using Iron Sand.



After converting him into a puppet, Sasori gained access to the abilities the Kazekage had while he was alive, such as his
Magnet Release

kekkei genkai
. He also installed several weapons into his body, all of which were soaked in his special brand of
poison
 — which kills the victim after three days of painful paralysis. This was also applied to the Kazekage's
Iron Sand
. It was noted in the anime, however, that his use paled in comparison to how strong it was while used by the Third when he was alive.
