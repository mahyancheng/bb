"
Where I Belong
" (
居場所
,
Ibasho
) is episode 243 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

The
Kirigakure
 and
Funato
 fleets battle at sea.
Isari
 and
Jibiki
 discuss how they're luring Kirigakure into a trap.
Boruto
 and
Iwabee
 join
Kagura
,
Sarada
, and
Denki
, who are going over the coded message they discovered. Iwabee's comment on origami gives Kagura an idea on how to fold the paper, allowing him to decode the message. Everyone gathers, and Kagura explains the sea battle is a distraction, while an elite Funato force makes a sneak attack on Kirigakure, even making their way there by land instead of sea to avoid drawing attention. Even if
Chōjūrō
 turns back now, he won't make it back in time to protect the skeleton crew on Kirigakure. Boruto wants them to go to Kirigakure, but Kagura is unwilling to allow it, as this is a war, and they no longer have the pretext of getting
Team 5
 and the
Konoha
 researchers to safety. Sarada agrees with Boruto. Kagura asks for the
swordsmen
's help, but unsatisfied with just a three year sentence reduction for what they've done so far, they ask for a complete acquittal, which Kagura agrees to, intending to negotiate it with Chōjūrō personally.
 As the elite Funato force is making their way through mountainous terrain, Kagura knows a village they'll have to pass through, and plans to intercept them there. They arrange for the refugees to be evacuated, and coordinate messages warning Chōjūrō about the sneak attack, and
Naruto
 about the developments from their mission. Boruto goes to the dock to check on
Ikada
, but
Kajiki
 tells him he hasn't seen Ikada since the night before. He doesn't believe that Ikada was kidnapped, and knows he wouldn't abandon his shipbuilding training. Boruto checks Ikada's home, and finds out he even left his idea journal behind. Kagura's group arrives at the village, where two villagers recognise him, as that's where he grew up. He explains the situation to the village, and asks them help in fortifying it to protect themselves from the Funato when they pass through. Sarada and
Buntan
 make note of a ravine and bridges they saw on the way to the village, and want to force the Funato into the ravine by taking down the bridges. Kagura has
Team 7
, Buntan, and
Kyohō
 fortify the village's defences, while Team 5 and
Hebiichigo
 destroy the bridges. The small children in the village take a liking to
Kawaki
.
Metal Lee
 gets embarrassed when his suit rips while destroying a bridge, exposing his underwear. Hebiichigo sews it, and shares her concerns about facing the Funato. Metal's positive attitude puzzles her. Boruto updates Kagura on the fortification's progress, and asks him about his past. Kagura explains that because of the stigma of being
Yagura
's grandson, they couldn't guarantee his safety in Kirigakure, so they moved him to this village. Boruto is appalled by it. Kagura has good memories of making friends beneath the tree where he practised
kenjutsu
, despite them knowing who he was. Kagura's
old

friends
 also befriend Kyohō as he chops down trees for fortifications. Kagura confides his hopes for the village to Boruto. The Funato make their way through the mountains.
Funamushi
 is concerned about
Seiren
. Hebiichigo is confused by Kagura's continued trust in her despite her attempt to kill him. At night, Boruto feels ready to face the Funato.
