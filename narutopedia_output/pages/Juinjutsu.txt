Orochimaru's juinjutsu: the Cursed Seal of Heaven.



Juinjutsu
 (
呪印術
,
Viz:
 Curse Mark Jutsu,
literally meaning:
 Cursed Seal Techniques) are a type of techniques used to bring someone under the control of the user. By applying a seal to the victim's body, the user brings the victim's abilities and actions under their control.
 With a simple secret
hand seal
, the user can inflict great mental and physical torment on the victim. The exact workings of juinjutsu are kept secret.

Juinjutsu requires a great deal of skill to use, and suppressing one is equally difficult.
 Removal of the seal is nigh-impossible, as many opt to seal them away instead. The only known certain ways to remove a cursed seal is if either the applier or receiver dies, as with the
Cursed Tongue Eradication Seal
 and
Hyūga Main Family's Juinjutsu
, respectively.

Trivia

Shukaku
's body are naturally a cursed seal, allowing it to
seal its opponents

The marking of the
Flying Thunder God Technique
 is likened to a cursed seal, as any victim marked by it is essentially sentenced to death.

Tosaka
 created a
Scientific Ninja Tool
 that is embedded with a
cursed seal
, enabling a wearer with transformation that enhances their capabilities.

In the anime,
Victor
 applied a cursed seal onto himself to extend his own life. However, the seal was also eroding his health, which was compounded by his prolonged usage of his
regenerative ability
.
