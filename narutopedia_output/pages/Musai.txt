Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Musai and Nonota attacked by a reincarnated Toroi.



During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, he and Nonota were ambushed by a reincarnated Toroi. Recognising his fellow Kumo shinobi, Musai tried to alert Nonota about Toroi's
techniques
, but they were attacked before he could finish. After Nonota was
magnetised
, he further explained Toroi's abilities. Both are saved by the arrival of
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Killer B
, Naruto slamming a
Rasengan
 against Toroi.

Musai explained how they were headed to
Headquarters
 when they were separated from
F
 and the others, only to be shocked by B, who revealed that F was actually a
transformed

White Zetsu
. In the anime, after they left, Musai and Nonota were briefly suspicious of the other being a transformed White Zetsu as well, before realising the enemy tried to kill them both, meaning they were both on the same side. They laughed it off, and then Musai joked, pretending to be a transformed White Zetsu, only for Nonota to slash his nose with a kunai in defence.

He and Nonota later met up with their regiment while carrying Toroi, after explaining how Naruto and B had saved them,
Torune
 arrived and summoned a group of
Kabuto
's "failures" to retrieve Toroi and the
Third Raikage
, among them was Musai's father
Osoi
, who he noted to a comrade had never made it past
chūnin
 much to his father's annoyance. After promising his father to tell the Raikage he and Toroi had died fighting for the sake of the village, they said goodbye as his father was sealed.

Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes

In the anime, Musai is seen on the battlefield after being freed from the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 by Naruto and
Sasuke
.
