Yin–Yang Release
 (
陰陽遁
,
Onmyōton, In'yōton
,
English TV:
 Shadow and Light Style) is a
nature transformation
 that combines
Yin Release
 and
Yang Release
, two natures that exist outside the five basic elemental natures. Yin Release uses
spiritual energy
 and Yang Release uses
physical energy
,
 which are the two components of
chakra
. This in turn means that all
jutsu
 that utilise chakra are at least distantly rooted in Yin–Yang Release.

Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
, famed as the "Sage of Six Paths", utilised Yin–Yang Release with the
Creation of All Things Technique
: by creating form out of nothingness (Yin Release) and then giving the form life (Yang Release), he was able to create the nine
tailed beasts
 from the
Ten-Tails
' chakra.
 Centuries later, Hagoromo's spirit gives some of his power to
Naruto Uzumaki
, allowing Naruto to use Yin–Yang Release as well: he stabilises
Might Guy
's life force, whose body nearly expired due to using
Eight Gates Released Formation
;
 he restores
Kakashi Hatake
's left eye, which Kakashi lost decades earlier;
 he resuscitates
Obito Uchiha
, whose body was badly fatigued from having the Ten-Tails removed from his body.
 But Yin–Yang Release's healing ability remains limited, as Naruto cannot save Obito from the effects of the
All-Killing Ash Bones
.

Yin–Yang Release can be used to nullify the effects of all
ninjutsu
.
Jinchūriki
 of the Ten-Tails take advantage of this by adding Yin–Yang Release to their
Truth-Seeking Balls
: when the balls are made into weapons, the weapons can break through any ninjutsu, even nullifying the regenerative bodies of those revived with the
Impure World Reincarnation
,
 which also makes conventional ninjutsu have no effect on hosts as well,
 though both remain vulnerable to attacks infused with
natural energy
, such as
senjutsu
.
 According to
Sasuke Uchiha
, only through combination of his
Yin Power
 with Naruto's
Yang Power
 could they
seal

Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
, the progenitor of chakra itself on
Earth
.

Trivia

The section about Yin–Yang Release in
Jin no Sho
 has the subheading of "
Six Paths
", suggesting the two terms are connected.

In the manga, the kanji for "Yin–Yang" (陰陽) are usually read as
onmyō
 but occasionally read as
in'yō
. In the real world,
in'yō
 is the common reading of the kanji. Historically, the
onmyō
 reading appeared in Japan earlier and was used in reference to "the way of yin-yang" (
陰陽道
,
onmyōdō
).
Onmyō
 conceptually evolved to refer to divination and various esoteric practices, an association not applied to the
in'yō
 reading. Accordingly, some scholars translate
onmyō
 as "divination" or "yin-yang", rather than "yin and yang".

In
chapter 606
,
Madara
 tells
Obito
 he will teach him to use Yin–Yang Release techniques and subsequently implies he used Yin–Yang Release to create the
White Zetsu
. In these instances, the kanji for Yin–Yang are read as
in'yō
.

In the anime, Obito uses the
in'yō
 reading when explaining
Izanagi
 to
Konan
,
 despite using the
onmyō
 reading in the manga.

In
chapter 684
,
Black Zetsu
 uses the
in'yō
 reading to refer to Naruto's and Sasuke's "Yin–Yang Powers" (
陰陽の力
,
In'yō no Chikara
).
