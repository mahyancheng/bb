Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Worried,
Tsunade
 tries to leave
Tanzaku Quarters
, but
Shizune
 convinces her to visit some tourist attractions first. Meanwhile, the mark on his palm is still not helping
Naruto
 to concentrate his
chakra
. He remembers back to his days in the
Academy
 when
Iruka
 had him concentrate on his studies by placing a leaf on his forehead. Deciding to make use of a lesson he dismissed at the time, Naruto modifies the mark into the appearance of a leaf, finally helping him concentrate enough chakra into his
Rasengan
 to burst the rubber ball, completing the second step. As Tsunade and Shizune elsewhere look at Tanzaku Castle, the castle collapses and
Orochimaru
 emerges from the rubble.
