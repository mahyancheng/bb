Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Ittan was assigned to the
Surprise Attack Division
 of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. In the anime, he was one of the shinobi who got into fights with people from other villages, Ittan himself getting into an argument with
Kiri
, who said that Iwa-nin couldn't be trusted. They are however able to set their differences aside and work together after hearing
Gaara
's speech.

Shortly after he and his teammates had set up camp where Ittan was designated to create several trenches around the location, his team is approached by a fellow comrade,
Muta Aburame
, who is hurt. But after Muta attacks them,
Hoheto Hyūga

examines
 him, pointing out that he is being
controlled
 and that a bomb is inside his gourd, setting to detonate. Ittan quickly uses an Earth Release technique to  sink the entire area where they had set up camp to avoid the explosion. During the battle between the two ambush squads, on Kankurō's orders, Ittan raised the part of the earth he had previously sunk, sending Sasori crashing into the rising surface. He also used his ability to create a dome to protect the injured, allowing Kiri to heal them.

Later, he and part of his division encountered a back up for the
Surprise Attack and Diversion Platoon
. When they tried to flee from them, they are hit with
Ibuse
's
Poison Mist
 and soon succumb to its paralysing effects. However, they are rescued by
Mifune
 and the samurai of the
Fifth Division
 who carry them to the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
 for treatment.
