After generating
black lightning
 from their body, Darui releases it in the form of a panther to shock anyone that comes into contact with it. Its quick movement allows it to be used to take out multiple opponents. By using this in a battle on water, it can be spread out to cover a wide range.

Trivia

As with many of the techniques of
Kumogakure
 ninja, this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation. Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as 'Kurohansa' or 'Kokuhansa'.
