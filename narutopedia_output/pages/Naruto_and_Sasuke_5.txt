Naruto to Sasuke 5

Naruto
 manga.

Summary

As
Sasuke
 is about to finish off
Naruto
 with his
Chidori
, Naruto is able to counter with an uppercut, sending Sasuke crashing into the mountain side. While
Kurama
 speaks with Naruto, assessing the situation and their next move, Sasuke creates a Chidori
enhanced
 with
black flames
, and Naruto responds by forming a
Rasengan
. Both their attacks collide with each other, resulting in the
valley
 almost entirely being destroyed. Entirely out of
chakra
 and pained all over, they both fall to the ground next to each other and converse about their past.
 The duo pass out at some point, and after regaining consciousness the next morning, Sasuke questions Naruto as to why he never severed bonds with him and remembering his time with Naruto while on
Team 7
. He also reveals that he was always the one envious of Naruto and says he is much like his
older brother
. Naruto responds by telling Sasuke that he always thought of him as a friend and asks him to help with his plan to bring peace to the ninja world. The decisive battle concludes with the
Uchiha
 accepting defeat. As the two friends seemingly finally reconcile, it is revealed that both their dominant arms were destroyed in their last clash and the blood-loss formed what look like hands holding one another.

Trivia

During Sasuke and Naruto's final clash, the
Uchiha
 emblem on Sasuke's back is absent.
