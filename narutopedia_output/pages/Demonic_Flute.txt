Using the
Demonic Flute
 (
魔笛
,
Mateki
),
Tayuya
 could
cast

genjutsu
 and
control
 her
Doki
 by playing specific melodies. This is the only item she kept with her prior to her
reincarnation
.
 She claimed that no one who has ever heard the sound of her flute has lived. If the opponent recognises her melody, she can change it to confuse them. The flute was durable enough to clash with a
kunai
 unharmed, but was nevertheless cut in half by
Temari
's
wind technique
 during her fight with Tayuya.

In the anime,
Shiin
 deployed a very similar flute and, like Tayuya, used it for the purpose of
genjutsu
.

Trivia

Upon being reincarnated in the anime, Tayuya acquired a new flute, which eventually fell into the possession of
Naruto Uzumaki
.

Kabuto Yakushi
 could use a replica of
Kimimaro
 to create a flute using
Shikotsumyaku
, for his construct of Tayuya to use.
