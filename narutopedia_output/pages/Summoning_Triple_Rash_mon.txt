The
Summoning: Triple Rashōmon
 is an upgrade to the standard
Summoning: Rashōmon
, which — as its name suggests — summons not one, but three menacing Rashōmon. The technique requires two summoning seals to be completed, and these gates serve the same function as the single Rashōmon, but with triple the defence. The first gate takes the attack head-on, the second reduces the attack's power and the third disperses the pressure, causing all attacks that come in contact with it to lose their power before they can be effective. The defensive capabilities of this technique are further boosted by the lack of
hand seals
 required to perform this technique.

The defensive capabilities of this technique was able to protect Orochimaru from dying from a
Tailed Beast Ball
, which he stated would have killed him had he taken that attack head on.

In the anime, the gates can be summoned in a widespread formation instead of a back to back, to surround wall in the enemy. The rooftiles of the doors also contain built-in launchers that can fire barrages of blades via a chain mechanism.
 However, these projectiles can damage the ground, which can weaken the foundation of the gates if fired too close to the base, causing them to collapse.
