The
Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar
 is a genjutsu that utilises lightning-natured chakra.

Usage

The user discharges electricity through their entire body in the form of an extremely bright light to disorientate their target's vision. Once this is done, the user can implant images in their head, as seen when C made
Jūgo
 see
Sasuke
 getting smashed into the ground by the
Fourth Raikage
. This gives the user's allies the perfect opportunity to attack the unsuspecting victim.

This genjutsu can also be used collaboratively with other shinobi to completely overwhelm a target(s) sense of sight in the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 against the
Ten-Tails
.

Trivia

In the manga, this attack generates an electric light emanating directly from C's body, however, in the anime, though light emanates from C's body, the electricity being discharged is not seen.
