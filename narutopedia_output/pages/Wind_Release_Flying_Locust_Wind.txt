The user conjures a powerful gust of wind in the surrounding area. They could use the powerful wind to boost themselves to a higher location. The wind is strong enough to damage unsound structures.

Trivia

"Hikō" in this ninjutsu, and the user's name "Batta" are two different pronunciations of the word "飛蝗", meaning "locust".
