Kusune
 (
クスネ
) was a ninja who possessed
Iō
's ninja tool,
Tsurukame
.

Personality

Kusune is one to underestimate his opponents based on their appearance, but at the same time recognised
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Neji Hyūga
 as excellent fighters at close range, realising that it was necessary to keep a distance with them. He is also very self-confident and eager to acquire powerful new weapons. Kusune is dismissive of
Konohagakure
, claiming that after
Orochimaru
's
attack
, the country had become weak due to which he and Gameru did not even encounter obstacles at the border.

Appearance

Kusune has small black eyes and black hair which is presumed because his eyebrows are black. He wears a purple-coloured cloth wrapped around his face and head only showing his eyes. He wears a black-coloured ninja uniform that appears to have had its sleeves torn off up to the shoulder. He wears a black mesh short-sleeved shirt underneath this with black lining around the arm holes. He also wears a small black wrist band around each of his lower arms just below his wrists. He is seen holding the Tsurukame in his right hand.

Abilities

With his weapon Tsurukame, Kusune could fight several enemies at once using his shield based fighting style. He could use his ninja tool to
shoot
 several senbon as well as other ninja tools. He seemed to have at least basic knowledge about
Fūinjutsu
,
sealing
 his weapon when not using it.

Part II

Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha

Along with his partner
Gameru
, they asked for ninja tools from Iō, but he refused to give his ninja tools to outsiders. Naruto Uzumaki and Neji Hyūga fought Kusune and Gameru, but were stalemated by Iō's prototype ninja tools. Kusune and Gameru were defeated by
Tenten
 when she used Iō's latest ninja tool,
Jidanda
.
