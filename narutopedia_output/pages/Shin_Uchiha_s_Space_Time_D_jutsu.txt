Shin Uchiha
 is able to perform a
space–time ninjutsu
 using his
Sharingan
.

Usage

This technique creates a spiralling void centred on the user's eye, drawing everything within its confines inwards and transporting them to another location — even affecting
chakra
-based substances. By focusing on nearby targets, the technique can also be used from a distance.
 The technique activates quickly enough that it can capture a target before they have time to react, and the size and shape of the spatial barrier can be manipulated to some extent to fit the situation.

Shin is able to activate this technique using his right eye in order to transport himself to the locations of his
spying creatures
, emerging from a void created by their own Sharingan.
 He can also channel this technique through the creatures themselves, allowing him and his
clones
 to strategically retreat to their
hideout
 at a moment's notice.
