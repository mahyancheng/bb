"
Who Are You?
" (
てめーは誰だ!!
,
Temē wa Dare da!!
) is episode 343 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

With Kurama encouraging him,
Naruto
 enters
Tailed Beast Mode
 and attacks
Tobi
. Meanwhile, a hesitant
Kakashi
 is in disbelief of the masked man's identity but
Guy
 ultimately snaps him out of it. As the battle rages on, a defiant Naruto informs Tobi that he isn't alone, not when he has Kurama, Killer B and Gyūki as well as Kakashi and Guy by his side. This prompts Kakashi to fight and now, Kakashi joins in with Guy helping him. Tobi unleashes a shower of gigantic
chakra receivers
, paralysing both
B
 and
Gyūki
. Naruto creates a
shadow clone
 and it charges forward with
Rasengan
 while the original prepares a
Tailed Beast Ball
 with Gyūki providing cover. As Naruto launches his technique, Tobi simply phases through and with that, fully enters the
other dimension
. There, he notices the clone from earlier and realises that Kakashi did not just
teleport
 the Rasengan but the clone itself.
 With little time to react, Tobi is hit by Naruto's Rasengan; his mask shattered into pieces. Watching on, Kakashi and Guy are shocked to see that the masked man is their former comrade,
Obito Uchiha
. Naruto questions who the individual is, to which Guy responds that he is their former comrade who was supposedly killed in action during the
previous war
. In response to Kakashi's question, Obito explains that what he did up until now is because he let their former team-mate,
Rin Nohara
 die. Naruto motivates a devastated Kakashi as Obito's
plan
 to conquer the world needs to be stopped. Obito attacks the group with his
Fire Release: Blast Wave Wild Dance
 technique but Naruto intercepts with
Kurama
's tails. Just then,
Madara
 appears alongside Obito, much to the others' surprise.

Trivia

When Obito is panting during his training for his second
Chūnin Exam
, his nose disappears.

When the main examiner for the fight gestures for the fight between Team Kakashi and Team Guy to begin, the thumb on his left hand is missing.
