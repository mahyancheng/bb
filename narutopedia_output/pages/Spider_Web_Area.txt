Kidōmaru
 spreads a network of "touch threads" throughout an area. Kidōmaru constantly sends his
chakra
 along the threads, allowing him to
sense
 anything that comes into contact with them; the threads are sensitive enough to even detect slight disturbances in the air. Because the threads appear no different than normal spiderwebs, they aren't likely to be noticed and thus are effective as an alert of approaching enemies.
 Kidōmaru uses this technique while he and the rest of the
Sound Four
 are resting, ensuring they won't be ambushed.
 The touch threads, being stronger than wire, can also be used to reel in those who've contacted them.
