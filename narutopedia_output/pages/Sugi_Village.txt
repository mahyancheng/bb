Sugi Village
 (
杉の里
,
Sugi no Sato
,
literally meaning:
 Cedar Village) is an anime-only ninja village, in an unspecified country.

Kumogakure
 once stole a scroll containing
secret

ninjutsu
 belonging to this village. While nothing is known about what the technique concerns, it was apparently powerful enough for the
Fourth Raikage
 himself to be involved in the mission to obtain it. The village immediately tried to retrieve the scroll by hiring the
Nokizaru Group
 to go after the thieves.

Trivia

It's possible that the village would be in the
Land of Fire
 due to its proximity with
Tanzaku Quarters
.
