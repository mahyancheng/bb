When
Kimimaro
 is about to be attacked with
taijutsu
, he sprouts sharp bones from all or parts of his body, ideally causing the attacker to skewer themselves. The stronger and faster the attack, the greater the damage that will be done to the attacker.
 If the attacker is able to avoid taking any significant damage, Kimimaro can keep the bones protruding from his body, thereby discouraging any additional attacks. If the opponent attacks anyway, the bones can be used to absorb the blow and then capture the attacking arm or leg, leaving them at Kimimaro's mercy.

Trivia

The
larch
 is a
conifer
, which are characterised by their sharp, needle-like leaves.
