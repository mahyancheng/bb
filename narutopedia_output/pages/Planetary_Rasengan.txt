Naruto Uzumaki
 — while in
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 — creates a
Big Ball Rasengan
 in one of his hands, which is then surrounded by three regular-sized
Rasengan
, in a similar manner to
moons
 around a planet. When coming into contact with a target, the disordered rotations of the individual Rasengan, created by the central and smaller ones spinning in different directions, interact with each other to form a massive and turbulent wave-like vortex.

The strength of this technique is so great that it even took a shinobi reincarnated by the
Impure World Reincarnation
 technique a significant amount of time to regenerate, which they normally do instantly.
