Background






Dokan quickly defeated by Itachi.



One day, Dokan accidentally bumped into

raised his hand

challenge
 him to a duel. However, the furious Dokan ignored his official challenge and attacked him unceremoniously, just to be quickly defeated by the child genius.

Everybody present was shocked to see Itachi dissolving afterwards, revealing that it was a
