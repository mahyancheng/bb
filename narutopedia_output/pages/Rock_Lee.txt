Rock Lee
 (
ロック・リー
,
Rokku Rī
) is a
shinobi
 of
Konohagakure
's
Lee clan
 and a member of
Team Guy
. Unlike most shinobi, he lacked the skills necessary to use
ninjutsu
 or
genjutsu
. However, he overcomes those shortcomings by undergoing special training from
Might Guy
 that would make him a
taijutsu
 master while still a
genin
.

Background

During his time in the
Academy
, Lee proved to have no talent for ninjutsu and genjutsu. When he was mocked by his peers because of this, Lee persevered, focusing on taijutsu.
 After he succeeded in graduating he was added to Team Guy along with
Neji Hyūga
 and
Tenten
. During the team's first meeting, Lee vowed to become a powerful ninja without using ninjutsu or genjutsu. Neji laughed at him, but their sensei,
Might Guy
, took a special interest in Lee.
 He encouraged Lee to keep at it and, in time, began teaching him powerful forms of taijutsu.

Personality






Lee's "nice guy" pose.



Under Guy's leadership, Lee has acquired a number of his sensei's personality traits: he is energetic, optimistic, and hot-blooded, and shows the epitome of a "nice guy". He believes that one cannot dislike food and shows strong dedication to his promises; when this promise is broken, just barely, he assigns himself arduous training to prevent it from happening again. Lee speaks respectfully to others, never using contractions or swear words and always addressing people with appropriate honourifics (except his teammates, since Lee feels they are close enough to be spoken to informally). He also carries a small book and pencil to recall advice that Guy gives him over time.

Despite his passionate nature, Lee has also shown strong instincts, staying focused at the task at hand and rarely losing his composure. He has a keen sense of honour and respects his opponents, refusing to hold grudges against those who have defeated him, and returning favours to those that have helped him. This was shown by his befriending of
Gaara
, forgiving him for crushing his arm and leg — injuries that nearly ended his career as a shinobi. Lee feels others should show the same respect towards their opponents, and is disgusted whenever someone is unnecessarily cruel to their enemies.

One of Lee's recurring themes throughout the series is his drive to succeed, believing with enough hard work and perseverance, he can surpass a natural genius. He can be prone to depression when faced with setbacks. Neji, Lee's more talented teammate and rival, found Lee's efforts to be in vain, believing a "failure" could never defeat a "genius". As such, Lee became determined to defeat Neji in order to prove him wrong, though was met with defeat every time. When Neji himself was defeated by
Naruto Uzumaki
, another so-called "failure", he rejects his belief in fate and now holds great respect for Lee, believing that he will surpass the gifted with enough work.






Lee dreams of victory in combat and love.



During Part I, Lee revealed he had feelings for
Sakura Haruno
. Although she did not reciprocate his feelings and even considered him weird, she later become more appreciative and friendly towards him after he helped saved her from the
Otogakure
 genin during the Chūnin Exams. After the exams, Lee's interest in Sakura went largely unaddressed in the manga, though it is sometimes referenced in the anime; while having a match with Lee, Naruto transformed into Sakura, distracting Lee long enough for Naruto to attack him.
 However, Lee's
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 dream was of winning Sakura's affections, implying he still had romantic feelings for her. These feelings apparently have changed by adulthood, as Lee ended up marrying someone else and had a son named
Metal Lee
.

Appearance

Lee while in the Academy, when first joining Team Guy, and as a genin.
Rock Lee in Part II.
Lee in the Blank Period.
1/3

Lee has shiny black hair, perfectly round eyes with prominent lower eyelashes, and very thick eyebrows; as a result, Naruto calls him "
Centipede Brows
" (
ゲジマユ
,
Gejimayu
,
English TV:
 Bushy Brows). As a child, his hair was quite long and fastened in a braid, though he cuts it short by the time he joins Team Guy, letting it curve out and upward. Lee originally wore a white, short-sleeved kimono-shirt with a martial arts belt and dark pants, giving him a more traditional Chinese appearance. He also sported a forehead protector and shinobi sandals.

Lee later changes his appearance considerably to emulate his idol and sensei, Guy: his hair is now in a bowl-cut style; he wears a green jumpsuit, orange leg warmers, and a red forehead protector worn as a belt. He has bandages around his forearms up to his fingers, covering a set of stitches on his hands that were caused by his rigorous training.
 Like Guy, Lee's appearance remains largely the same over the years, though he adds a standard Konoha
flak jacket
 as a
chūnin
 in Part II, and its redesigned version in
The Last: Naruto the Movie
. As an adult, Lee grew noticeably muscular with more-defined cheekbones, and now wears a sleeveless jumpsuit with an orange neckwarmer.

Abilities






Lee destroying half of a meteorite with the Suicide Corps.



While in the Academy, Lee was looked down upon for his inability to use either ninjutsu or genjutsu. However, with the guidance and support of Might Guy, Lee conditioned himself into a superb ninja who relies exclusively on taijutsu.
 While originally very limited in even that skill, Lee proved to be a late bloomer by Part I: His greatly improved skill was evident when he defeated
Sasuke Uchiha
 (a natural prodigy), posed a challenge against Gaara in the Chūnin Exams, and held his own against
Kimimaro
. As a
chūnin
, he was capable of defeating the legendary taijutsu master
Chen
,
 as well as destroy a meteorite by himself.
 By adulthood, he had advanced to the rank of
jōnin
.

Physical Prowess






Lee easily defeating Naruto.



By age 13, Lee's arduous training conditioned him into essentially a taijutsu master, showing great proficiency in the
Strong Fist
 fighting style. His strength could unearth a massive tree root from the ground,
 and even though Sasuke could predict his moves with the
Sharingan
 in their first fight, his body wasn't fast enough to react to them. As per his training Lee has worn heavy ankle weights even in fights and became much faster when they're removed, enabling him to become the first person ever to bypass Gaara's
Shield of Sand
 and strike him.
 As a chūnin, Lee learned to perform the Leaf Great Gale (
木ノ葉大烈風
,
Konoha Daireppū
).
 In the anime, due to Lee's extensive training, he has shown to be able to run and fight even while unconscious or asleep, using nothing but pure
muscle memory
.
 As an adult, Lee is considered to be one of Konoha's best taijutsu users.

Drunken Fist






Lee using the Drunken Fist.



Lee's very low tolerance for alcohol gives him a natural predisposition for the
Drunken Fist
 style.
 When he consumes as little as one drop of alcohol, Lee becomes an unpredictable and nearly unstoppable force of destruction and chaos, attacking anyone whether they are friend or foe. This gives him considerably greater speed and dexterity, allowing him to strike and effectively dodge from various positions. Kimimaro, one of
Orochimaru
's strongest subordinates, was ultimately overwhelmed by Lee's attack patterns with Drunken Fist, noting that they were too unpredictable to follow.

Eight Gates






Lee opening the first gate.



Through Guy's teachings, Lee learned to open five of the
Eight Gates
 at age 12,
 the sixth gate at age 17,
 and (in the anime) the seventh gate some time after the Fourth Shinobi World War.
 By adulthood, Lee mastered the final gate.
 Using the 6th gate Lee is able to move so fast he can save Guy from Madara's Truth Seeking Ball, which moved fast enough that Obito couldn't use Kamui to escape from them. He is recognised as a genius for this feat by
Kakashi Hatake
, who notes it is highly difficult for even the most talented ninja to open even one gate.
 With each gate he opens, Lee's strength, speed, chakra levels, and bodily functions increase tremendously. However, the longer he maintains any of these gates, the more strain and potential physical damage his puts on himself from pushing his performance so far past his natural limits. For this reason, Lee is only permitted to open any of the gates during the most dire situation or to protect something very dear to him.
 Through his continued training, Lee has become able to open some of the Eight Gates instantly and shows a faster recovery rate from using them, but he nevertheless succumbs to the pain or exhaustion they cause.

Lee has learned to use a number of taijutsu techniques that he can perform once certain gates have been opened; with the first gate, he can use the pile-driving
Front Lotus
; with the third gate, he can use the more destructive
Reverse Lotus
; with the sixth gate, he can perform the
Crane Wing Formation
 in collaboration with members of the
Suicide Corps
, which proved to be powerful enough to destroy half of a giant meteorite.

Other Skills

Although Lee possess very little skill in ninjutsu, he can still perform basic chakra control skills, like using
chakra
 to walk on vertical surfaces, as well as water. In the anime, he also developed enough skill to dispel genjutsu.

Chūnin Exams

Chūnin Exams






Lee attempting to use the Front Lotus on Sasuke.



Having opted not to participate the year before, Team Guy took part in the
Chūnin Exams
 along with the
Rookie Nine
. They initially tried to avoid attention by acting weak, but Lee accidentally let slip his true strength by interfering with a fight between Sasuke and
Kotetsu Hagane
. He also fell in love with Sakura. Soon afterwards, he confronted Sasuke, challenging him to a fight to see how he fared against the Sharingan, but not before knocking out Naruto, who tried to fight with Lee himself. After battling Sasuke, Lee easily gained the upperhand but Guy interrupted Lee and Sasuke's fight as Lee tried to use the
Front Lotus
, and Lee was forced to do laps around the practice range before he could proceed onto the first phase of the exams. With Tenten's help, he gained the answers for the written portion, and proceeded to the second round.

After spending their first few days in the
Forest of Death
 gathering supplies, Team Guy split up in search of other teams. Lee came across Sakura being attacked by
Team Dosu
, and went to her aid. He used his Front Lotus on
Dosu Kinuta
, but he survived the attack because of
Zaku Abumi
 using his
Decapitating Airwaves
 in the ground, and Lee was left unable to defend himself from a counterattack from Dosu. Neji and Tenten soon arrived to help, but didn't have to because
Sasuke
 woke up and took care of Team Dosu. Once Lee recovered and they collected the specific scroll, they moved onto the preliminaries.






Lee using Front Lotus on Gaara.



In the preliminaries, Lee was matched against Gaara. When his standard attacks proved unable to bypass Gaara's defences, he removed his ankle weights to increase his speed and managed to land a couple of hits on Gaara. Then, he attempted the Forward Lotus, but Gaara was able to escape at the last minute revealing a sand clone instead. His options running out if he was to win and prove himself, Guy allowed him to use the
Reverse Lotus
. Gaara barely survived by turning his gourd to sand to cushion him, and the techniques took a massive toll on Lee's body. Gaara added to Lee's injury by crushing his left arm and leg. Though Guy intervened to stop Gaara from killing him, Lee got to his feet to continue the battle, despite being completely unconscious.

Because of his injuries,
medics
 predicted, that even if Lee recovered, his injuries would prevent him from ever being able to be a shinobi again. He nevertheless tried to train while he was in the hospital, something that only worsened his condition. When he was asleep, Gaara came to his room and tried to kill him, but he was stopped by Naruto and
Shikamaru Nara
 and later by Guy. To try and cheer Lee up, Guy took him to watch the final round matches, but they were surprised when they arrived to find out that Neji had been defeated by Naruto. Lee silently congratulated Naruto and then watched Gaara's fight with Sasuke, and marvelled at how quickly he had learned to emulate Lee's speed. Before the fight could finish, however, the
Konoha Crush
 began, and Lee was knocked unconscious.

Sasuke Recovery Mission

Sasuke Recovery Mission






Lee attacks Kimimaro.



Over the coming weeks, Guy tried a number of his own remedies to heal Lee, though none of his efforts worked. It was not until news of
Tsunade
 becoming
Hokage
 reached them that they found hope. But, when she examined Lee, she informed him of the dire situation: his broken bones and torn muscles have healed, but fragments of bone had lodged in his spinal column, and removing them would involve an extensive operation that only she was capable of. When Tsunade offered him an operation that carried a fifty percent chance of returning him to his former state, or dying in the process, Lee was hesitant to accept the operation. Though Lee was worried he would die in the operation, thanks to Guy's influence, he accepted the surgery. Upon overhearing Naruto,
Chōji Akimichi
,
Kiba Inuzuka
, and Shikamaru talking about the mission to bring Sasuke back to Konoha, Lee suggested that Neji go with them. Lee was disappointed that he couldn't go with them, still needing to go through his surgery that was scheduled for later that day
 (In the anime, Lee was recovering after having his surgery done the day before
). In the end, Lee successfully survived the operation.

Once Lee was well enough to move, he left the hospital to follow them and provide assistance. He caught up with Naruto, who was in the middle of a battle with Kimimaro, and told him to go after Sasuke while he dealt with Kimimaro. At first, it seemed Kimimaro overmatched him, but after Lee drank some sake that he had mistaken for his medicine, he began to outclass Kimimaro. Though Lee's anticipated moves were unpredictable to Kimimaro, he revealed his
Kekkei Genkai
,
Shikotsumyaku
, which, combined with Lee sobering up, easily took over the battle. Before his attack landed on Lee, Gaara arrived just in time to save him. Even though Lee insisted to fight side-by-side with him, he knew he was only getting in Gaara's way.






The final moments of the fight with Kimimaro.



For the rest of the battle, Lee watches and is amazed by Gaara's new abilities. Even though Gaara's new techniques completely buried Kimimaro, Kimimaro counters by turning the battlefield into a forest of bones, which Lee and Gaara escaped by hanging onto
a pair of small clouds made out of sand
. Kimimaro then emerged from one of the bones, preparing to kill the two at point blank range. They were saved, however, as Kimimaro finally succumbed to his disease and died. After the battle, Lee and Gaara reflect upon Kimimaro's purpose, then the two return to Konoha.

Kurosuki Family Removal Mission

Kurosuki Family Removal Mission






Ranmaru is discovered.



In the anime, Lee revealed that he once ran a marathon with Guy near the village of Katabami Kinzan shortly after being assigned to his team, and when he collapsed from exhaustion near the
Curry of Life
 shop, the owner, Sanshō, and her son Karashi fed him curry and saved his life. Lee's dedication caused Karashi to become enthusiastic, and he later left. A year later, when he came to the village with his teammates and Naruto to defeat the Kurosuki family, he found that Karashi had joined, and was upset that Karashi had sought strength in this way. He allowed Karashi to seek redemption, but Karashi used this opportunity to lure Lee's group into a trap after their first battle with
Raiga
. The trap failed due to Naruto's use of
shadow clones
, and while the villagers were willing to seek vengeance on Karashi, Lee stepped in, promising to take responsibility for Karashi's actions. Karashi used the opportunity to take
Ranmaru
 to revive Raiga. Lee went to fight Raiga with Naruto and Neji, and was knocked out but brought back to consciousness with the Curry of Life. The curry, however, accidentally contained wine, and Lee was intoxicated and performed the
Drunken Fist
. He fought Raiga drunkenly, but was defeated, and Naruto finished Raiga off. Later, when the group went back to the Curry of Life shop, they found out that Karashi had made a new curry that looked so bad that even Naruto didn't want to eat it. Lee, however, couldn't wait to try it, so the rest of the group had to literally drag him back to Konoha while he cried for the curry.

Academy students
 on a survival exercise. After fending off some 'bandits', one of Lee's charges addressed Lee as "
Lee-sensei
" out of awe, and, overjoyed, Lee went off into one of his declarations into the sunset whilst his students tried to tell him that he was going the wrong way.

In the anime, Lee accompanied Neji, Naruto, and Tenten on the mission to
Hoshigakure
, playing a lesser role than in previous arcs. He attempted to follow two of
Akahoshi
's men while hiding under a barrel, as Tenten suggested, but was discovered almost instantly. While trying to infiltrate Akahoshi's mansion, he pretended to use a jutsu known as "Wall-Removing Technique", but, in actuality, it involved him moving at high speed to open a door from the other side. He was wounded during the final battle with Akahoshi, leaving Naruto to fight him alone.

Viva Dojo Challenge! Youth is All About Passion!






Rock Lee's Gutz Dōjō.



In the anime, Lee, seeing that he had little time to train with other people due to the many missions that must be done, sought a new means of training. After having seen a man challenging a dōjō, ready to take the sign if he won, and ready to join if he lost; Lee founds his own dōjō (which he names the "Gutz Dōjō"), believing that a dōjō would draw-in many strong opponents. When Naruto stumbled upon the dōjō, Lee asked that he fight, but Naruto had to leave hastily, late for reporting back to Tsunade.

Guy, after hearing about the dōjō from Naruto, decides to disguise himself in order to fight Lee. However, he was given a mission at the last second, and (unbeknown to Guy) an impostor replaced him. Lee fought the impostor and easily defeated him, but Naruto believed that the impostor was Guy, and that he was not fighting at full strength in order to avoid revealing himself, so Naruto challenges and fights against Lee. Meanwhile the impostor transformed into Lee, but met the real Guy while trying to leave, and was easily defeated by him.

Third Great Beast Arc

Third Great Beast Arc

In the anime, Lee's condition worsened, and Tsunade became concerned about him injuring himself again. She removed him from missions, but allowed him to keep training after he convinced her to do so. Around this time, Guy arrived with a new student, who easily defeated Lee and injured his ankle. While Lee was recovering, Guy took the new student with him on a mission, causing Lee to believe that he had abandoned him. It was then revealed that the new student was an impostor, and that he planned on seeking vengeance against Guy. Lee headed to Guy's location, but was trapped in a castle made out of sparring posts. He and Lee were tricked into fighting each other by seeing the other as a sparring dummy, but they saw through the technique, recognising each others fighting style, and opened their chakra gates to destroy the dummies without harming the actual person, freeing themselves and destroying the castle.

In the anime, Lee and rest of the
Konoha 11
 came down together to stop
Gennō
 from bombing Konoha. Despite having few special abilities, made some noteworthy contributions to the investigation. While he initially encouraged the Academy students to keep practising throwing kunai, once he realised that hitting the bull's eye would cause a chain reaction that would detonate explosives around Konoha, he caught a kunai in midair just before it hit the target, despite being far away from it. Lee defeated Gennō with his taijutsu during the final confrontation.

Sunagakure Support Mission

In the anime, Lee and Naruto helped Gaara fight and defeat
Seimei
 — an opponent who could absorb his enemies' chakra with his armour. After the mission, he sparred with Tenten, who was upset over being the only member of the Konoha 11 left out of the mission despite having a mission at the time, and noted that, in order to be able to face Naruto when he returned, they too must become stronger.

Interlude

In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths

Main article:
In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths

In the anime, after about two years, the Chūnin Exams are held, co-sponsored by Konoha and Suna. While waiting to register, Team Guy spots Naruto, much too their surprise. However, Neji reveals that it was only
Konohamaru
 in
disguise
, who explained that he didn't want Naruto to miss out on this opportunity since he was away. With some comforting words from Lee and Neji, Konohamaru and his friends take their leave.






Team Guy racing towards Sunagakure.



As part of the first stage, all teams were randomly split into different rooms to take the written test. Lee was placed in room 2 with
Ino Yamanaka
 and
Shino Aburame
. On a monitor, Shikamaru as proctor explained that everyone only needed to answer one question, but their team's combined score must equal exactly 100 points to pass. Thanks to Neji, all the teams that were struggling were able to figure out which question to answer based on the specific amount of vibrations sent through the wall. To everyone's surprise, Shikamaru revealed a bonus question which asked that if a situation required you to sacrifice a teammate to be a decoy, which one would you choose. This was however a trick question that required no answer, as it was a test of loyalty, something that Lee and his team understood, allowing them to pass the first stage. However, as a result of having too many participants, a race to Suna was held, where only the first 30 teams to arrive at the destination would qualify for the second stage.






Lee tries to talk to Shira.



Ultimately, his team were among the first 30 teams to make it. During dinner, the genin tried to keep
Burami
 from leaking sweat all over the food, and although they were successfully able to do that, the food was still ruined as result of Neji's
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
 accidentally knocking the food down. This caused an all-out brawl between the genin in the room. Lee tried not to fight, but when he tried to strike
Shira
, his attack proved futile. Eventually everyone lost their desire to fight when
Fū
 arrived with her optimistic ways. Later, Lee approached Shira, noting from their earlier encounter, that he also endured much adversity, to which Shira stated true determination will ultimately succeed.

The following day, the second exam began. Like the last exam in Konoha, the teams were each given either a Heaven or Earth scroll and were required to obtain the other scroll. They would then have to bring the set to the main building in the centre of
Demon Desert
, having three days to so. As they began wondering around aimlessly, Lee realised a pattern and began marking rocks with kunai, concluding that they were
wondering in circles
. After dispelling the genjutsu, they find
Team Goji
 and proceed to attack them, only for
Team Shira
 to interfere and help their fellow Suna-nin. Unbeknownst by Team Guy, they get caught in another genjutsu by
Sen
. After Sen undoes the genjutsu, Team Guy finds that they are caught in quicksand, which drags them down into a waterfall sand pit. Lee manages to save his teammates and himself from falling to their doom after opening the second of the Eight Gates. After escaping from the pit, they find Team Shira in trouble, as they were being attacked by treacherous Suna-nin. Feeling compelled to help, Team Guy decides comes to Team Shira's aid, after which Neji asked why they were attacked at all. It was explained that Team Goji simply had no respect for Shira as a ninja, with Lee deducing that like him, Shira had no skill for genjutsu and ninjutsu, causing him to be ridiculed by his peers.






Lee and Shira's newfound respect for one another.



Lee, in a pit of rage over Team Goji's disrespect, storms off to convince them to apologise to Shira. When this fails, the Suna-nin attack, trapping Lee in a
sandstorm
 that cast illusions of figures attacking to distract him from the real threat when they strike him with
water needles
. Just as he is about to be finished, Neji and Tenten arrive to save him. Before the battle continues, Shira begs the Konoha-nin not to leave them be, insisting that their distaste of him is his own fault for not training hard enough. Lee believed the very opposite however, but ultimately he and his team agreed. Shira offered his scroll to one of the Suna-nin teams as they technically defeated his team earlier. As Shira's words finally reached the spiteful Suna-nin, they declined and instead gave Shira's team and Lee's team their own respective scrolls as they lost this battle. After the Suna-nin left, determined like Shira to prove themselves by finding more scrolls, Shira agreed to Lee's request to have a one-on-one battle.






Lee and Shira clash.



While seemingly equal in raw speed and skill, Neji noted that Shira had a slight advantage with his more solid built, and by extension greater raw strength. As Lee attempted to use the Eight Gates, he was unable to do so due to Shira already anticipating this and striking his pressure points beforehand. As Lee began changing tactics from Might Guy's teachings, manipulating how Shira would move, he began to drive Shira back. After acknowledging each other's determination, Shira struck Lee's pressure points again to remove the block, wanting to face Lee at his best. As Lee entered the Eight Gates, Shira used the
Seven Heavens Breathing Method
, which proved to be on par with the Eight Gates. As the intensity grew between the two, Shira's previous wounds begin to reopen, prompting Lee to call off the fight. As Shira was being
healed
 by Yome, he explained that after the Chūnin Exams ends, he will be enlisting in a special force on the outskirts of Suna so that he could be closer to his parents. Lee wished Shira good luck and gave him one of his jumpsuits as a gift, acknowledging their new friendship.

On the third day of the exam, Team Guy cross paths with a team of
Ame kunoichi
 and battles them. After a short skirmish, the enemy team decided to retreat as Team Guy was not the target they sought for. Despite this, Lee's team pursued the Ame-nin into an old ruins. During their continued battle, the ground collapsed, swallowing Tenten and Ajisai, and separating them from their respective teams. Though Lee and Neji wanted to work together to save one another's teammate, the two Ame-nin turned them down and left. Lee suggested that they plough their way through the rubble, only for Neji to reject the idea in fear of causing more damage than desired. When Lee and Neji find the two Ame-nin, they aid them in their fight against
another Konoha team
 as they needed their help to find Tenten. This prompted the other Konoha team to retreat as they were outnumbered. After the two teams agree to work together, they battle a colony of large ants, but it is Tenten who defeats them. Having now been reunited, the two teams part ways peacefully.






Team Guy waiting for the passing of the sandstorm.



Later, Team Guy get caught in a massive sandstorm. Unable to push forward, Neji repelled the sand long enough for Tenten to summon a
protective dome
 for them to wait out the storm. After the storm cleared and they resumed their efforts to past the exam, they spotted
Matsuri
, who begged them to help save Gaara. Team Guy was soon approached by Fū's teammates, who agreed to unite their efforts in hopes of saving Fū and Gaara. While Lee and Matsuri joined Fū's teammates in distracting Hōichi, Neji and Tenten tried to save the jinchūriki. Ultimately, Neji was able to free Gaara and Fū with his Gentle Fist, which came at Hōichi's expense as the chains soon turned on him, still seeking tailed beast chakra and ultimately bound him.

Despite lacking a matching set of scrolls, Lee's team decided to complete the exams and head to the main building. There, it was learned that the Chūnin Exams were ended early due to controversy happening in the second exam. Instead, it was decided by Gaara that a report on each participant would be sent to their respective village leader for them to decide if they would be promoted. Upon returning to the village, Tsunade promoted Lee and Tenten to chūnin, while Neji was promoted to jonin.

Part II

Kazekage Rescue Mission

Kazekage Rescue Mission






Lee disarming Kisame.



After Team Kakashi was sent on a mission to rescue Gaara from
Akatsuki
, Tsunade began to worry that they might have problems so she sent Team Guy as back-up. On their way to a rendezvous point they encountered
Pakkun
, who redirected them to Team Kakashi's destination. Soon after they were attacked by
Kisame Hoshigaki
. As the battle waged on Lee was able to disarm Kisame shortly but soon was captured alongside Neji and Tenten in a
Water Prison
 by Kisame's water clones. After a while Neji was able to free Lee and himself allowing Lee to rescue Tenten before she suffocated. Afterwards they watched on as Guy finished off Kisame. Upon Kisame's defeat they discovered that it was not really him they were fighting against, only a
lookalike
. Realising they were being stalled, Pakkun led them off towards Team 7.






Lee overpowering his clone.



When they convened with Team Kakashi, Team Guy was tasked with bringing down the barrier blocking the entrance to the Akatsuki lair. Neji used his Byakugan to find the seals keeping the barrier in place and directed the locations of them to the rest of the team. Once they found the seals they simultaneously taking them off, succeeding in removing the barrier but in the process were immediately ambushed by copies of themselves. Soon after Lee and his clone started fighting, matching each other attack for attack. After being evenly matched with his clone, Lee communicated to the rest of the team who were in the same situation and proposed a solution: to become stronger than they had been when the copies had been created. With that, Lee used a
new technique
 and defeated his clone.






Team Guy confronts Deidara.



With their battles won, Team Guy reunited and went to meet up with Team 7 again. On their way Neji spotted
Deidara
 with his Byakugan and the team manage to sneak up behind him in time to block his escape. After fighting the team Guy, Deidara realised he was outmatched and he attempted to retreat. While on Deidara's tail Team Guy cornered him, leading him to make an
exploding clone
, resulting in almost killing both teams were it not for
Kakashi
's
intervention
. After Gaara was revived and their mission completed, both teams accompanied him back to Sunagakure and later paid their respects at Chiyo's grave. Afterwards both teams departed for Konoha. On their way, Guy started carrying Kakashi who had been incapacitated from using the Mangekyō Sharingan too much. Seeing this as a form of training, Lee told Neji to get on his back so that they might race back to Konoha, but was forcefully rejected.

Lee accompanies Sakura to track down Sasuke.



When news reaches Konoha of

 decide they should eliminate Sasuke themselves before he can involve Konoha in a war. So that Sakura can inform Naruto of their decision, Lee,
Kiba
, and
Sai
 escort her to the
Land of Iron
. When they locate him, Sakura tells Naruto that she loves him, surprising Lee. This does not convince him to give up his own search for Sasuke, so they leave without another word, despite Lee's protest. Sakura then asks her escorts to help her find Sasuke. When they near his location while Lee, along with Kiba, try to protest how telling Naruto the truth would have been better, Sakura tries to knock them out so she can face Sasuke alone. Sai stops her, so Sakura convinces Lee and Kiba that he is a traitor. While they try to detain him, she succeeds in knocking them out.

After Sakura and the rest of Team 7 meet with Sasuke, they retrieve Lee and the others and return to Konoha. Lee is later seen with the rest of the Konoha 11 hearing Naruto's decision to take responsibility for Sasuke.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Lee watches on as Sakura heals Guy who arrives injured.



During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Lee is assigned to the
Third Division
 alongside Sakura and Guy. He is seen fretting over his sensei's condition while Sakura tries to heal him. When members of the
Surprise Attack Division
 are attacked by the
reincarnated
 shinobi, the Third Division arrives in time to intercept the attack. He is then seen along with the
Third Division
 clashing against the reincarnated ninja. Upon Kakashi's orders, they group into a
Manji Formation
, Lee promises that no matter what he will protect Sakura; she however tells him to also be careful as last time Zabuza was able to penetrate the formation from its weak point; the centre. He and Guy later intercepted Haku's assault with the
Leaf Coiling Whirlwind
. In the anime, after the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist were summoned, Guy told Lee to chase after
Pakura
 while he went after
Gari
. After a long day battling, Lee and the recuperates with his remaining division members as night falls.






Lee and Guy battling Haku during the war.



With the resumption of battle the next day, Lee sticks close to
Sai
 who had been tasked with sealing the reincarnated
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
. Lee tells Sai not to worry and just concentrate on the sealing while he would protect him. When
Naruto
's
shadow clone
 arrives on the battlefield, Lee exclaims that with him here their numbers would increase. However, Naruto tells them that he wouldn't be able to perform the
Shadow Clone Technique
 in his current state, so they'd have to defeat the new wave of
White Zetsu Army
 clones with quality of techniques instead of quantity in numbers.






Lee clashes with Chen on the battlefield.



Later in the anime, the Third Division came across another reincarnated shinobi: Master
Chen
 — a renown hero of
Konohagakure
 who was thought to have died during the
Third Shinobi World War
. As Might Guy who is happy at the prospect on challenging such a famed
taijutsu
 master, Konoha's Sublime Green Beast of Prey soon finds himself being forced on the defensive by the old man. A shinobi is able to break away from the battle and in his search for reinforcements, finds Rock Lee who rushes to Guy's aid. Seeing the legend he met once before as a
genin
 before him, Lee reveals his history with Chen before engaging the legend in battle. Ultimately, Lee is able to counter Chen's
Leaf Dragon God
 technique, using the
One-Man Front Lotus
 which he had engineered to counter the rotation of the winds of the former. As Chen's immortal body disintegrates, he remembers the time when he had his own student who was incapable of using ninjutsu, and how he had died during the Third Shinobi World War. Finally letting go of his painful past and apologising to the young man for what he had said, the old master was able to break the summoning contract and his soul returns to the afterlife. Lee promises to Chen that he'll bring rice balls to his grave.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

Main article:
Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

After being informed by
Inoichi
 from HQ that Naruto and
B
 were fighting the "
masked Madara
", Lee and the rest of the
Konoha 11
 rush to his aid. As he runs, he spurred Sai — who was lamenting the fact that he could not use his
Super Beast Imitating Drawing
 technique to get to Naruto faster — onwards telling him that now was the time to respond to the heroic efforts of those fighting Tobi.






Lee resolved to keep Neji's memory in his heart.



Upon finally arriving at the battlefield, and seeing his mentor's state, Lee asked whether or not Guy had used the
Daytime Tiger
 technique again. He later stood with the other members of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 as they prepared to face their opposition. Opening the
Fifth Gate
, Lee and his mentor prepare to attack the two Uchiha, but are buffeted by the force exerted by the now fully-matured
Ten-Tails
 as it escaped the hole it had seemingly been trapped in. He is then seen with Guy and Tenten reacting to Neji's death. Tearfully holding his fallen teammate's corpse, he was stopped by Guy who told him to keep his tears and hold onto the feelings Neji left them. Lee was then seen listening on as Naruto imparted comforting words to the Allied Forces.






Lee bisects Madara and severs his connection to the beast.



Thinking back on his time with Neji growing up and the conversations they had, Lee mused about something Neji had said to him. Having received chakra from Naruto, the now empowered Lee, respectfully closed his fallen comrade's eyes before joining the ranks of the other Allied shinobi. Charging forward with the Alliance, Lee signalled to Naruto that he would deal with
Madara
 while he took care of
Obito
. With Guy giving him a boost, Lee propelled towards Madara and remorselessly bisected the Uchiha with a powerful kick, also destroying Madara's connection to the beast.

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki

Main article:
Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki

Lee would later stare in amazement at the red barrier that had been constructed around the Ten-Tails and listened on as Guy noted that only shinobi of Hokage-calibre were able to perform the
Four Red Yang Formation
 technique. With the situation later turning grim as the Alliance was
trapped
 in a barrier with a
Tailed Beast Ball
-firing tree, Lee and the other shinobi soon found themselves shrouded in the previous Version 1 mantles again. He and the other subsequently found themselves on the outside of the barrier, escaping the near-fatal attack thanks to Naruto and Minato's
action
.






Lee and the remainder of the Konoha 11 attacking Obito.



The Ten-Tails transformed into its tree form, and many shinobi were attacked but Lee was able to escape. Hashirama Senju had Ino Yamanaka everyone link-up telepathically, Lee being one of them. Hashirama's words fail to inspire anyone, but Naruto's senjutsu-enhanced Tailed Beast Mode combined with Ino's telepathy causes his emotions and personal memories to be transferred to everyone. Later he mobilised alongside his comrades when Naruto called out to them. Shocked when he was enveloped by Naruto's Tailed Beast Mode mantle, Lee was apprehensive about being involved in their strategy at first because this would have been his first time using ninjutsu but ultimately launched an attack on Obito and was able to overwhelm his defence giving Naruto and Sasuke the opportunity to attack Obito directly. He and his comrades later aided Naruto in extracting the tailed beasts' chakra from Obito in order to stop the holy tree from blooming.

After his sensei over-exerted himself, unable to stand up on his own, Lee resorted to supporting him. While doing so, Lee and his teammates noticed Gaara speeding past them, where Lee noticed Sakura was with him. As Guy begins to worry about situation, Madara, having just
revived
 himself and become the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki himself, flies past the Konoha-nin and regurgitated the
Benihisago
 and
Kohaku no Jōhei
, which landed on top of both Guy and Lee.






Lee saving Guy.



After recomposing themselves, Guy and Lee went on ahead while Tenten remained behind. Guy arrived on the battlefield in time to save Kakashi and then confront Madara. Lee arrived shortly after in time to save his teacher from Madara's attack. As Guy reassessed the situation, he decided to gamble his life and use the eighth gate against Madara. As Lee began to cry at the realisation of what Guy's actions would mean. Guy, however, told Lee not to be sad as this was his choice.

Watching Guy at full power taking on Madara, Lee watched on proudly. When the team decided to support Guy so that he could land his attack on the Uchiha, Lee immediately opened the sixth gate but was angered by his own inability to fight at the same level to help Guy. Minato told Lee to not feel that way, as Guy was making his sacrifice so Lee could live. After Minato explained the mechanics of Madara's
Truth-Seeking Balls
, Lee threw the Fourth Hokage's
Flying Thunder God Kunai
 in front of the chakra orbs which allowed Minato to teleport most of the orbs away. Ultimately, the team gave Guy the opening to land the five powerful blows from his
Evening Elephant
.






Lee caught in the Infinite Tsukuyomi.



Lee watched on in amazement as his mentor unleashed another powerful attack on Madara, noting that this time, the stance he took was not that of the Evening Elephant, but the
Night Guy
 technique. Lee was later shocked to see Naruto return with Guy who was still alive despite opening all of the Eight Gates. When Madara attempted to drop the massive earthen debris on the ground, Gaara asked him to leave there quickly, but later they fell victim to the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
. Inside the genjutsu, Lee dreamed of finally defeating both Naruto and Neji in battle followed quickly by Sakura professing her love for him.

When Lee is assigned to bring a present to Naruto and
Hinata
's wedding, he takes the mission as seriously as he takes all his missions: very. He runs laps around Konoha until he can think of what to buy for them. 864 laps later, Lee collapses from exhaustion; the best idea he came up with was a pair of dumbbells, which he doesn't think would be appropriate. While passed out from fatigue, Lee has a dream of Neji; Neji starts giving him advice for the wedding present, but only manages to make unclear references to
strength
 and
stamina
 before Lee wakes up.

As Lee lies in the middle of a street, he is greeted by Guy. Guy is about to do laps around Konoha until he can think of what to buy for Naruto and Hinata and invites Lee to join him. Lee reports that he's already done that without success. Guy suggests that Lee try coming up with a gift for Hinata instead, while he thinks of a gift for Naruto. Lee thinks about Hinata's post-wedding life of childcare and housework. Guy thinks of Naruto's post-wedding life of home maintenance and carrying groceries. Both simultaneously conclude they should buy dumbbells to prepare Naruto and Hinata for their lives ahead. Neji's words suddenly make sense to Lee and he embraces Guy in a long, tearful hug.

In order to test out their idea, Lee puts on a dress and makeup so that he can see what it's like to be a housewife. This only convinces him that dumbbells were a great idea and he seeks out Tenten to make sure she won't be getting Naruto and Hinata the same present. When he finds her, Tenten is mystified by Lee's appearance and the accompanying explanation. At the wedding a few days later, she gives Lee and Guy advice about how they should behave.

In the anime, as Lee began training his son in more advanced taijutsu, ready to teach the

, he learned that Metal began relying on useless good luck trinkets for confidence against his anxiety from too much attention. Disappointed by this, Lee postponed the training, telling Metal that he couldn't master the Eight Gates as he was then. Later, after Metal spent the day with Guy and learned about making the most of what you have, Lee decided to issue a challenge to Metal: To receive training in the Eight Gates, Metal was to face Lee in a match surrounded by a huge crowd and must land at least one blow. Accepting the challenge, Metal removed his trinkets and fought through all the stares and laughter of the crowd, which in reality boosted his performance. Ultimately, Metal unlocked the first gate, letting him solidly hit his father and win. Lee joined Metal and Guy in a group hug to celebrate Metal's success.

Creation and conception

According to an interview with Masashi Kishimoto in Shōnen Jump's 'Naruto Anime Profiles Episodes 1-37', Lee is his most fun character to draw. He also has stated that
Sakura Haruno
 and Lee were meant to symbolise human weakness, at least in the beginning.

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Rock Lee

Rock Lee's name is derived from the
rock
 musical genre and is a play on
Bruce Lee
, whose given name is pronounced the same as
blues
 in Japanese. The pun continues with his son,
Metal Lee
.

Rock Lee has his own spin-off series called
Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles
 by
Kenji Taira
, an assistant of
Masashi Kishimoto
.

Like his sensei, Rock Lee's character seems to be inspired by
Bruce Lee
, as shown from his name and having the same birthday and hair style. The outfit Rock Lee wears in part one may have been based of Bruce Lee's jumpsuit from the 1973 film
Game of Death
.

Rock Lee's injury is also similar to the one Bruce Lee once received; both were also expected to never walk again.

Rock Lee placed very high in the first four Naruto character popularity polls. He finished 5th in the first and second polls, 8th in the third poll and 7th in the fourth poll. However, his popularity slipped in the last two polls, finishing 13th in the fifth poll and 18th in the sixth and most recent. In the 3rd Databook, a combination of the previous six polls ranked him as the 9th most popular character overall.

Studio Pierrot has consistently given him the height of 158 cm at 13yrs, instead of 158.5 cm as his Databook profile gives him.

Kishimoto
's official sketches of Rock Lee show that he is 177cm in
The Last: Naruto the Movie
.

According to the databook(s):

Rock Lee's hobbies are his and
Might Guy
's intense
taijutsu
 training regimes.

Lee wishes for rematches with
Neji
,
Sasuke
, and
Gaara
, and for an all-out match with
Naruto
.

Lee's favourite foods are medium spicy curry rice and curry pilaf, though, like his sensei, he finds it impossible to dislike any sort of food.

Lee has completed 61 official missions in total: 25 D-rank, 21 C-rank, 4 B-rank, 10 A-rank, 1 S-rank.

Lee's favourite words are "Endeavour" (
努力
,
doryoku
), "Guts" (
根性
,
konjō
), and "Love" (
愛
,
ai
).

In
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes
, Lee calls himself "Leaf Village's Noble Savage".
