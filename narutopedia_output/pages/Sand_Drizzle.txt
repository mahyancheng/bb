Gaara
 forms small lumps of
sand
 high in the air, which he has fall on a target like rain. Gaara can control the sand lumps with his
chakra
, allowing him to ensure they strike their target and even guide them towards the target's blind-spots. Because this control allows Gaara to strike the target from multiple directions at once, the target's attention will be focused upwards as they attempt to avoid it. As such, the technique is an effective distraction, allowing Gaara to use another source of sand to attack the target from underfoot.
 This ground-level sand, in addition to being useful for
followup attacks
, can also be used to
immobilise
 the target, preventing them from escaping the Sand Drizzle.
