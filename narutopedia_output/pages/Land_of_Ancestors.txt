The Land of Ancestors.







The Land of Ancestors symbol from Kaguya's era.



The
Land of Ancestors
 (
祖の国
,
So no Kuni
) was a small country that existed over a millennium ago before the start of the series. The country itself was comprised of numerous farming villages, that were surrounded by small forests. The country also contained a huge lake, which acted as main resource for villagers. Its leader was the emperor
Tenji
. This country was also the location from which the
God Tree
 originated. When
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 first arrived on Earth, the country was on the verge of war with the
Land of That
. Upon consuming the God Tree's chakra fruit, Kaguya activated the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 and trapped all those caught within it. The mountains that surrounded the God Tree became known as the "Peaks of Demise" (
終焉の峠
,
Shūen no Tōge
).

Trivia

The architecture of the Land of Ancestors was based on the
Yayoi period
 of Japan's early history.
