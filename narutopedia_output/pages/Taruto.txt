Taruto
 (
タルト
) is a pastry chef in
Konohagakure
.

Background

A citizen of the new city in Konohagakure, Taruto had a longtime friendship with old town resident
Ohagi
, taking part in the old town's festival fireworks display, and going on trips with them. As they were also both chefs, they developed a dango shortcake, which drew from their areas of expertise. When the new city decided to put on their own fireworks display, they put Taruto in charge of it, creating a rift between Taruto and Ohagi.

New Era

When Taruto and other new city townspeople argued with Ohagi and other old town residents, it drew Boruto's attention, who tried to break them up. When Boruto and Kakashi later visited Taruto's pastry shop, Kakashi deduced Taruto's previous friendship with Ohagi from a torn photo and covered menu items. Taruto asked them to leave. Boruto later brought the two groups together, and attempted to reconcile them by having them share the dango shortcake they came up with, but it didn't work. Kakashi suggested they turn the fireworks display into a competition, with the winner becoming the one responsible for it. Taruto agreed to it, but on the day of the display, Kakashi switched the fireworks around, causing the new city residents to mock their own fireworks, taking their hearts out of the rivalry. His grandson
Sabure
 urged him to make up with Ohagi so he and
Yubeshi
 could get married. Taruto and Ohagi made up, and attended their grandchildren's wedding.
