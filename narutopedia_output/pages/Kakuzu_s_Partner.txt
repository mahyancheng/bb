This
shinobi
 was a
missing-nin
 from an unknown village and a member of
Akatsuki
, who was partnered with
Kakuzu
.

Background

Sometime after defecting from an unknown village, he joined the criminal organisation Akatsuki, becoming Kakuzu's fourth partner. In the anime, during a battle with several shinobi, he was
eliminated
 by Kakuzu, who later, upon being chastised by his teammates, claimed he was too slow and should have simply dodged his attack.
 Kakuzu later took his heart.

Appearance

In the anime, he was depicted as a tall man, even taller than Kakuzu himself, with short brown hair and a moustache, wearing a standard Akatsuki cloak. He had a broad nose, slightly wrinkled face and small black eyes.

Abilities






Kakuzu's partner using his sword.



Although most of his abilities remain unknown, the fact that he was accepted into the Akatsuki proves that he was a powerful shinobi. He was also strong enough to have Kakuzu consider his heart worthy enough to take. In the anime, he was shown using a sword in battle, implying he has some skills in
kenjutsu
.

Trivia

In the anime, as Kakuzu was in possession of a heart that had a fire affinity before his death, he either had a
lightning
,
water
, or
wind
 affinity.
