Team Konohamaru
 is a shinobi cell from
Konohagakure
, led by
Konohamaru Sarutobi
.

History

Originally called Team 3 upon formation, Sarada intended to formally request being removed from the team over issues with Boruto, but upon resolving them, they instead requested their designation to be changed to Team 7, as their parents' were. Having completed enough missions to qualify for the
Chūnin Exams
, the team participated in the exams held in Konoha. Though the three
genin
 made it to the finals, none of them were promoted as the venue was attacked by
Momoshiki
 and
Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki
. The team came close to being disbanded when all three members left the village without authorisation to interfere with
Iwagakure
's internal affair, having their genin ranks revoked, but due to the
Fourth Tsuchikage
's personal praise, they were accredited for their nobility and were reinstated.

Sometime later, after capturing members of the
Mujina Bandits
, Konohamaru made the decision that his team was capable of handling their first
B-Rank
 mission, which they accepted in attempting. However, when
Tentō Madoka
 was abducted by the Mujina Bandits, Boruto went to rescue him instead of partaking the B-Rank mission, which Sarada and Mitsuki followed suit. Although Konohamaru congratulated their bravery in saving the daimyō's son, he also noted they must suffer some punishment for not living up to their obligation for the mission.

After aiding Team 7 in rescuing the Seventh Hokage,
Kawaki
 was made an honorary member of Team 7. Also, upon discovering that Boruto's
Kāma
 is a catalyst to reviving
Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki
, and that it has already progressed 80%, Team 7 was suspended from missions for safety reasons.

 and

, from a death threat. Team 7 was designated to protecting Ashina, in which she constantly ordered them around to wait on her hand and foot. When Tomaru was abducted by the blackmailer and a ransom — to be delivered by Ashina — was demanded, Konohamaru managed to capture the kidnapper and disguised as him in order to expose Ashina as the mastermind of the fraudulent ploy to revitalise her fame. With Tomaru's safety and Ashina's arrest, the mission was a success.

Status:
 Failure

Team 7 was assigned to rescue

Mujō
, as Kokuri was willing to give information on the bandit group in exchange for protection. Boruto and Mitsuki were sent in disguise as prisoners while Sarada passed off as a reporter. Getting past the corrupt officer
Benga
, the team seemingly managed to rescue Kokuri from fellow prisoner and second-in-command of the Mujina Bandits
Tsukiyo
. However, it was later revealed that Tsukiyo was
Shojoji
 in disguise, and he killed Kokuri via his
Corpse Clone Technique
 to disguise as him to escape prison, updating their mission status from success to failure.

Apprehend the Mujina Bandits/regular bank robbers (Anime only)

Rank:
 C-rank (Anime only)

Status:
 Success (Manga only), Partial Success (Anime only)

Upon the Mujina Bandits robbing the

In the anime, the bank robbers were not affiliated with the Mujina Bandits. They were unable to apprehend all the thieves and it was only thanks to Konohamaru capturing one of them that the mission wasn't a complete failure.

Escort Katasuke to Kiri and investigate terrorist threat (Anime Only)

Rank:
 Unknown

Status:
 Success

After becoming a genin, Kawaki is permanently integrated into Team 7. Their first mission together is serving as bodyguards to Katasuke while he is in
Kirigakure
 to assist with progress of the village's new power plant,
Shinonome
 1. During their mission, they are also tasked in keeping a lookout for anything that would disrupt the unveiling ceremony, as there are rumours of a terrorist attack.

As rumoured, the ceremony is disrupted by the
Funato clan
, who wage a war with Kiri to prevent the Shinonome from controlling the sea, first by starting a distraction while the clan head
Araumi
 is freed from prison. Team 7, who accompanies
Kagura Karatachi
, former members of the
New Seven Ninja Swordsmen

Buntan Kurosuki
,
Kyohō Fuefuki
,
Hebiichigo
, and eventually
Team 5
, combat the forces of the Funato. During the journey back to the village, they would intercept an elite squad of Funato pirates in Kagura's home village after learning of a surprise attack on Kiri at the Isle of Shipbuilders while the Kiri-nin and the Funato war at sea. This resulted in the loss of the Kagura. With Sarada nominated to lead in his stead, Team 7 and their allies avenge Kagura by defeating the elite squad in their next battle, but at the cost of Hebiichigo.

Wanting to end the cycle of revenge, Boruto resolved to end the war by reasoning with both Kiri and the Funato. Buntan, Kyohō, Kawaki and a conflicted
Metal Lee
 rejected the idea.
Denki
 and
Iwabee
 held back the enraged Buntan and Kyohō as Team 7 made their way to the battlefield. While the
Mizukage
 gave the team a chance to reason with the Funato before the fight breaks out,
Ikada
, who Boruto befriended during their travels unaware that he was Araumi's son, would refuse to end the war unless Team 7 were to present him the Mizukage's head. Boruto offered his life instead, which Ikada complied to. Seeing Sarada and Mitsuki resist avenging him per his wishes, Ikada has a change of heart and saves Boruto's life after he jumped into the raging sea. With his own objective, Kawaki would subdue Araumi to end the war. After the Funato pulled back, the war is averted and the team's mission is a success.

Hibiki
, who had cared for Mikazuki while he was in Kiri. Because of this, he gives her the chance to turn herself in. However, Hibiki and her brother continued in their mission to find their father's killer and attacked

, whose facade was exposed to Team 7 and Kōtarō by Mikazuki. While the siblings were let off of their crimes, they were forbidden from ever returning to the village.

Surveilling Ada and Daemon

Rank:
 Unknown

Status:
 Ongoing

Team 7 was assigned to surveil
Ada
 and
Daemon
 upon their arrival at Konoha to gauge their commitment to their alliance. Due to their Ōtsutsuki nature, only Boruto and Kawaki are immune to her entrancing ability, her crush on Kawaki being her point of interest, so Konoha arranged for them to live together. Due to Kawaki's brash attitude, Boruto is to act as a mediator between him and the siblings. Sarada, Mitsuki, and Konohamaru are to observe them from afar, including Boruto, reporting if he's still acting as himself due to Momoshiki's influence, and are not to intervene unless necessary, though the unpredictable nature of the situation allows them to act without direct orders.

 to destroy Matsuri.
