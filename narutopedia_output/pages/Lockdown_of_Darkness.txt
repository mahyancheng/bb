"
Lockdown of Darkness
" (
暗黒の施錠
,
Ankoku no Sejō
) is episode 65 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Sakura
 wanders the streets looking for
Naruto
 when she manages to spot him pursuing
Sora
.
Konohagakure
 suffers a power outage and
Tsunade
, fearing that it is a sabotaged effort as she hears no reply from the power station, moves the village to a Stage Two security threat. Sakura reports to Tsunade's office by running down the dark hallway and yelling out Tsunade’s name. Due to Sakura not being able to see what’s in front of her because of the power outage, she ends up accidentally face-planting into Tsunade’s breasts and hurting her nose on them. Tsunade then removes Sakura from her chest and tells her that she can’t talk right now and has to go to an emergency meeting with the team captains. Sakura holds her nose with a pained expression but then notices Tsunade’s office being destroyed and asks what happened, where she discovers that Sora attacked Tsunade. Tsunade then tells Sakura to do her duty as a
Medical-nin
 and heal the wounded.

Furido
 and his
team
 begin their infiltration of the village, with
Fudō
 using his
Earth Release: Rock Lodging Destruction
 technique to trap and kill many Konoha-nin in caves.
Shizune
 reports to Tsunade that the village is indeed under attack; Tsunade summons the
Chūnin
 and
Jōnin
 of the village and alerts them that the village is now under a Stage One security threat. She sends the squads to different points around the village and notifies Asuma that Sora tried to kill her and that he is being tailed by Naruto. Asuma then sets off to find the two.

At the main gate,
Fuen
 uses her
Altering Terrain Diagram Scroll
 to perform her
Barrier Gate Five Seals Technique: Castle Closing Eight Gates
, which causes four giant gates to be formed at the north, south, east and west gate. The erected barrier allows herself, Furido, Fudō and
Fūka
 to enter or exit as they please while trapping the villagers within the confines of the barrier.
Ebisu
 notices the barrier and appoints
Team Ebisu
 with their first A-rank mission - evacuating the citizens from the village and into a safe haven. Furido tells the
shinobi
 of Konoha that there can only be one king in the
Land of Fire
, and that the true king is none other than the
Fire Daimyō
. To that extent, he is prepared to wipe out the
Hokage
, knowing fully well that the shinobi of Konoha would die in the process. Using Fudō's
Earth Release: Mutability
 to create a large amount of rock to hover over the main gate, Furido and Fudō use
Earth Release Resurrection Technique: Corpse Soil
 to reanimate the dead corpses of shinobi and pit them against those from Konoha.

Meanwhile, Naruto manages to catch up with Sora, wondering why he would attack Tsunade. Sora tells him that Tsunade tried to kill him, so he attempted to do the same before she could finish the job. Naruto is unable to believe that she would do such a thing, and their bout is interrupted by the arrival of Asuma. When Asuma asks the same question, Sora responds that he was just trying to take down Konoha's king; his usage of the word "king" reminds Asuma of
Kazuma
's exact words. He tells Sora and Naruto that whomever is attacking the village right now will not just kill Tsunade, but destroy the entire village. Asuma then leaves to join the fight at the border while Sora, not understanding his motives anymore, flees; Naruto follows Sora at Asuma's bequest.

At the power station, the electricity is siphoned to charge the coffins containing the four
Guardian Ninja
.
