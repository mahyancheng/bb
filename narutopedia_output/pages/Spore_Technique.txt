White Zetsu
 is able to plant spore-sized
parasite clones
 onto the bodies of others for the purpose of remotely monitoring them. As these clones
parasitise
 their victim's
chakra
 and have no chakra of their own, they cannot be detected by
standard sensory abilities
.
 Once activated via time-delay, the parasite clones suddenly expand, restricting their victim's movements and stealing greater amounts of chakra.

The absorbed chakra can be
transferred
 to another individual by establishing physical contact with them.
 The spores can also activate in order to shield their host from harm,
 or be forced into activation and expelled from their host's body if that individual takes in
senjutsu
 chakra.

Trivia

Although the spores are usually undetectable,
Orochimaru
 and
Kabuto Yakushi
 are able to notice their presence due to extensive research on
Hashirama Senju
's DNA.

In the anime and official digitally coloured manga, the clones grown through this technique at the
Kage Summit
 were depicted as being entirely white in colour.
