Kabuto slashes his opponent with a chakra scalpel, followed by three strikes with his navel tail. Then, two giant white snakes emerge from the ground, biting his opponent, a third one releases a venom cloud, poisoning the target, and Kabuto finishes by emerging from his stretched snake tail, delivering another chakra scalpel slash.
