A
gunbai
 (
軍配
,
literally meaning:
 army arrangement), or
Gunbai Uchiwa
 (
軍配団扇
,
Gunbai Uchiwa
,
literally meaning:
 army arrangement fan), is a non-folding fan, carved from a unique spirit tree from which only ritualistic instruments are made. This Gunbai has been passed down between Uchiha clansmen for generations.

Madara Uchiha
 during his lifetime was famed for the use of this fan in battle.
Obito Uchiha
 would later wield this fan while posing as the legendary Uchiha, before returning it to his
reincarnated
 ancestor during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.
 It is a wide fan with
tomoe
 on it and has a long handle with bandages wrapped around the base, as well as having a long chain attached to it. In the past, when Madara used it, it was brown with a black border, with red tomoe, and a chain was attached to the handle that appears to have been connected to his
kama
.
 When Obito started using it, it was depicted as having a purple tint with a black border, and tomoe design on it, with the chain appearing to enter his sleeve.
 During the
Third Shinobi World War
 it was seen hanging on a wall inside the caverns of the
Mountains' Graveyard
.

This gunbai had the ability to convert incoming chakra into
wind
 nature transformation, reflecting an opponent's attack back towards them.
 Madara wielded it both as a shield and as a mace in conjunction with his
kama
, and it also allowed him to perform various other techniques. Obito also wielded the gunbai predominantly like a flail, using the chain attached to guide the fan which he can use also as a shield because of its durability, as it was able to block Naruto's
Super Mini-Tailed Beast Ball
 without receiving any noticeable damage.
