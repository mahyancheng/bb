Summary

Kakashi
 informs
Team 7
 that they have the opportunity to enter the
Chūnin Exams
. He gives any and all of them the choice not to participate before leaving. Although
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 are enthusiastic,
Sakura
 is worried that she will not be able to keep up with the other competitors. Nevertheless, Team 7 heads to the sign-up location together the next day and finds the members of
Team Guy
 being bullied by two
genin
. Recognising that things are not as they seem, Sasuke begins to fight one of the genin but they are stopped by
Rock Lee
, a member of Team Guy who had only moments earlier appeared defenceless. Lee asks Sakura to be his girlfriend, but she turns him down before leaving. The two genin, actually
chūnin
 in disguise, remark that this exam's competitors seem promising. Lee follows Team 7 to challenge Sasuke.
