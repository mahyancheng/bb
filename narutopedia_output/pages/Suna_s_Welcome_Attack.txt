Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Deidara
, riding a clay bird, eliminates
Sunagakure
's scouts keeping and eye out for him or other
Akatsuki
 personnel. When he infiltrates the village he is immediately confronted by
Gaara
, who knew that the bird was not a native of the area. Gaara wastes no time in attacking Deidara, dedicating great volumes of sand to try and crush him. Deidara's attempts at counterattacks are ineffective since Gaara's
Shield of Sand
 protects him from all incoming attacks. Although he is initially successful at avoiding Gaara, Deidara's left arm is ultimately crushed by Gaaras' sand.
