This article is about the technique. For chapter 435, see
Banshō Ten'in
.

Banshō Ten'in
 is a technique that manipulates
attractive force
 (
引力
,
inryoku
) to pull matter towards the user at will. It has the same five second limit as the Shinra Tensei as stated by
Chōji Akimichi
.
 The area of effect can be localised, so it is possible to selectively attract a target or targets without affecting the object or the structure they're connected to.
 It is also possible to attract multiple targets at once, causing them to collide with each other.
 The ability to manipulate attractive forces with this technique is granted by the
Deva Path
 much like its counterpart
Shinra Tensei
.

Other Media

An enhanced, "Full Throttle" version of Banshō Ten'in appears in
Naruto Shippūden: Shinobi Rumble
, called "Banshō Ten'in: Dōmetsu" (
万象天引・導滅
,
literally meaning:
 Heavenly Attraction of All Creation: Guiding Destruction).

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Impact
, Nagato can also use it to lift the ground and throw it at the opponent, called "Banshō Ten'in: Jidō" (
万象天引・地動
,
literally meaning:
 Heavenly Attraction of All Creation: Ground Motion).

Influence

The names of Banshō Ten'in and its companion ability,
Shinra Tensei
, are derived from
Shinra Banshō
 (
神羅万象
,
literally meaning:
 Everything Covered by God), a Japanese
four-character idiom
 and homophone variant of
Shinra Banshō
 (
森羅万象
,
literally meaning:
 All-Covering Forests and Ten Thousand Things), a Buddhist idiom which has come to mean "All Nature" or "All Creation".

Trivia

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
, Nagato and Madara pull their opponent through a black sphere like
Chibaku Tensei
.

Sasuke Uchiha uses a technique to summon the sealed
Tailed Beasts
 near the
God Tree
's stump to where he was above the
Valley of the End
 near him, which may have been this technique or a variant of it.
