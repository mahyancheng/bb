"
Jiraiya and Kakashi
" (
JIRAIYA・KAKASHI
) is episode 483 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

A young
Jiraiya
 calls a young
Orochimaru
 to spy on bathing women. Uninterested, Orochimaru leaves. Jiraiya is caught by an elderly woman, who douses him in hot water. As teenagers, Jiraiya tries convincing Orochimaru into a plan for him to hit on
Tsunade
, having Orochimaru pretend to attack her, so Jiraiya can rescue her, which fails. During the
Second Shinobi World War
, the three discuss their dreams by a fire. Tsunade wants to travel the world and gamble everywhere, Jiraiya wants to travel beside her, to her annoyance, and Orochimaru initially claims to have no dream, but admits he wants to master ninjutsu and get stronger.
 The three are attacked by
Kirigakure
 shinobi, and retaliate.

A young
Kakashi
 prepares fish and performs house chores. At the
Academy
, Kakashi spars with
Hiruzen
, while
Rin
 and
Obito
 discuss him. When he is done, they ask if he practises frequently, but he denies it, saying he just reads a few books. After classes, Obito follows Kakashi, and watches him practising fishing. As he prepares fish at home, Kakashi tells Obito and Rin to come out and join him to eat. They enjoy the food, and Kakashi downplays himself again. The next day, Kakashi does chores again, and is thanked by Obito for the food when they meet on the street. At the Academy,
Guy
 tries fighting him, and is impressed by Kakashi. The next day, Kakashi visits his father's grave at the cemetery, and tells him about his friends. At the Academy, Guy challenges Kakashi again, and lasts longer. Obito and Rin cheer on Kakashi.

Trivia

Nine-Tails' Attack on Konoha
, which happened years later.

Rin
's face markings are mistakenly blue instead of purple throughout the entire episode.
