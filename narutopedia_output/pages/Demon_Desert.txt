The Demon Desert.



The
Demon Desert
 (
魔の砂漠
,
Ma no Sabaku
) is a desert located in the
Land of Wind
, off coast from
Sunagakure
. It serves as the stage for the second phase of the joint
Chūnin Exams
, and is roughly the equivalent to
Konohagakure
's
Forest of Death
, in size and in danger. In the centre of the desert lies the central tower, where the
Suna Exploration Group
 and
Kazekage
 monitor the exam from. It is also where all the
genin
 candidates are to rendezvous after having the Heaven and Earth Scroll set.

Environment

It is an enclosed area, blocked by a fortress wall. The terrain is vastly covered with sand, having very few places where fresh water can be found. Poisonous cacti, rock formations, quick sand, sand currents, and a sand waterfall pit can also be found here, along with old ruins filled with past civilisation.

Additionally, the desert is home to many hardy types of animals, such as gigantic three-tailed scorpions and colonies of giant ants which prey on anything they can get their mandibles on.
