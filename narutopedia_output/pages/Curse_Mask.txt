Orochimaru
 to Kasumi in order for her to get revenge on "
Konohagakure
" for destroying
Castle Dusk
. In order to use this mask, however, Kasumi had to sacrifice her physical form to be intertwined with the castle. It also fed on the user's hatred.

Abilities

This mask was able to create illusions, as well to let the user deactivate the enemy's
dōjutsu
