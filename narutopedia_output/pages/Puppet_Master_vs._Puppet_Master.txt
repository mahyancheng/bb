Summary

The
Mother and Father

puppets
 were created by
Sasori
 to look like and serve the function of his own parents, they having died when he was young. Since they were only puppets, they could not give him love and he lost interest in them, leaving them in
Chiyo
's possession. Chiyo fights the
Third Kazekage
 puppet with them and they are able to overpower it in a normal fight. The Third, having once been human, retains all of the abilities he had in life, including the
Iron Sand
. Sasori neutralises the puppets with the Iron Sand and attacks Chiyo and
Sakura
 with it.
