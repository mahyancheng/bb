Synopsis

The
Uzumaki
 arrive at a hot springs inn to enjoy a vacation.
Boruto
 wonders if
Kawaki
 might be scared of ghosts haunting the old inn. In
Konoha
,
Mirai
 arrives at the
Hokage
's office, and finds
Shikamaru
 dealing with
Naruto
's paper work. He explains that Naruto's family won a hot springs inn trip on a raffle, and Mirai recognises the inn as the one she previously stayed at with
Guy
 and
Kakashi
, which had a ghost story associated with it. Boruto and
Kawaki
 notice a slash in one of the statues in the inn. The hostess takes them to their room, and they eat. Boruto suggests they play ping-pong, but is frustrated when Kawaki struggles to learn the basics. Naruto and
Hinata
 win against Boruto and Kawaki with their superior team-work while
Himawari
 acts as referee.
 They have a luxurious dinner and go to the hot springs. Kawaki recalls not wanting to go on trip at the start. Boruto and Kawaki stay on the hot springs until late, trying to outlast each other. Naruto loses at matching games to Himawari. Boruto spots a stamp hunt and takes Kawaki to participate. The inn's ghost follows them around as they collect the stamps, Kawaki figuring out the tricks behind the spooky aspects and teasing Boruto about it. Their prize is a commemorative photo. Himawari is angry they didn't take her to the hunt, activating her
Byakugan
. Boruto apologises and urges Kawaki to do the same. They take the photo. Kawaki is glad to have come, and Naruto tells him they consider him family. They go to sleep, but the inn's ghost is still following Boruto and Kawaki, who have bad dreams. When they leave the next day, the developed photo shows the ghost behind Boruto and Kawaki, who recognise it from their dreams.
