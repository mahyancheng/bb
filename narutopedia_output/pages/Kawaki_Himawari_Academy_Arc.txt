Summary

A group of new students enrols in the
Academy
; among them are
Himawari
 and
Kawaki
. Unbeknown to everyone else, Kawaki is actually not in the academy to become a ninja. Instead he was assigned the mission to supervise
Kae Yukiwari
, the heir to the crown of the
Land of Bamboo
. Kae also has not come to the academy to become a ninja, but has been sent to
Konoha
 to be safe from a power struggle. She however has not been told the truth about this.

Hana is a new teacher at the school. She is actually a sleeper agent who came to the village a decade prior, who has received orders to kill Kae. She tries to kill Kae while undercover as a teacher. Kawaki becomes friends with Kae and works together with Himawari to catch the assassin.

First Hana tries to kill Kae undercover. She finds out Kawaki guards Kae. She tries to get him expelled by giving an anonymous letter to
Eiki
 telling Kawaki is a ninja. When that doesn't work she tries to kill Kae who's in the infirmary when Kawaki is not present, but he gets there in time. In her third attempt she plants paper bombs on the school to distract everyone. Himawari runs away with Kae and once again Kawaki gets in between in time.

In her last attempt Hana takes the kids to an island and takes away Kae as a teacher. But Kawaki finds out she's the assassin and stops her in time to be arrested by the military police with her allies.
