The
Concealed Sand Picture Cat
 is a contact-type (
接触タイプ
,
Sesshoku Taipu
) sensory technique.

Usage

By dispersing
chakra-infused sand
 into a specific area, the user is able to discern the presence of moving bodies that come into direct contact with it. This sensing sand can be spread across a wide terrain, or even float in the air allowing aerial foes to be detected.
 Once the sand comes in contact with a person, it will wrap itself around them, rendering even invisible targets, visible.

Trivia

This technique's name might come from "picturing a concealed sand cat", as shown in its first usage, when Gaara used it to sense
Mū
, who was under the effects of his
invisibility technique
.
Sand cats
 are capable of walking on sand without leaving noticeable footprints. When this technique was used on the Second Tsuchikage, the shot focused on his footprints, which were imprinted in the sand.

The
reading
 of 潜砂 (
sensa
) is the same as the Japanese word for sensor (
センサ
,
sensa
).
