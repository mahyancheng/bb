Ibiki summons a giant iron
maneki neko
, which appears beneath the opponent from underground, split down the middle. The statue clamps around the target and is then wrapped in chains, which drag it back down into the ground.

Trivia

The
maneki neko
 (招き猫, literally "beckoning cat"; also known as welcoming cat, lucky cat, money cat, or fortune cat) is a common Japanese sculpture, often made of ceramic, which is believed to bring good luck to the owner. The sculpture depicts a cat (traditionally a
Japanese Bobtail
) beckoning with an upright paw, and is usually displayed—many times at the entrance—in shops, restaurants, and other businesses.

The
iron maiden
 is a coffin-like torture device with sharp spikes lining the inside. A victim is forced to stand straight up inside until they can no longer support themselves, at which point they are forced to lean forward or backward onto the spines, resulting in a slow and painful death.
