The symbol of the Land of Snow.



The
Land of Snow
 (
雪の国
,
Yuki no Kuni
) is a nation introduced in
Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow
, that is also briefly mentioned in the
anime
 and in the
Hiden

novels
. The nation would eventually be introduced in the manga.

Overview

Land of Snow.
The Land of Snow becomes the Land of Spring.
1/2

Originally, the country was a small, but peaceful place. However, it was taken over by a tyrant,
Dotō Kazahana
, after he and his
mercenaries
 killed his older brother and predecessor,
Sōsetsu Kazahana
.
 As the name of the country suggests, the climate is rather cold with winter covering the land in snow and ice year round. The landscape is dominated by snowy mountains with tall glaciers making parts of the coastline inaccessible from the sea.

The Land of Snow possesses an unusually advanced level of technology when compared to other countries in the
Naruto
 world
 prior to the New Era. Things such as railroads, airships, snow mobiles, power generators and volley guns are commonplace here, though the latter fired salvos of
kunai
 instead of bullets. Additionally, their ninja wear special
Chakra Armour
 that makes them virtually immune to
ninjutsu
 and
genjutsu
. However, this technological superiority appears rather new, as a group of army soldiers were shown to be conventionally armed, similar to
Samurai
 and
Ashigaru
 of feudal Japan.

At the end of the movie, Koyuki explains that with further research and improvements to the heat generator, the Land of Snow can become the
Land of Spring
 (
春の国
,
Haru no Kuni
). The construction for said generator nearly bankrupted the nation. When the tyrant Dotō was defeated by
Naruto Uzumaki
, Dotō's niece and Sōsetsu's daughter,
Koyuki Kazahana
, the princess who escaped ten years ago from her uncle's grasp, assumed her birthright as the country's new
daimyō
.

Via the
Thunder Rail
, it takes about three to four days to get to
Konohagakure
.

 had ordered for their disposal due to the threat they posed to him, however, Boro kept their existences secret after the order was given. It served as the base of operations for
