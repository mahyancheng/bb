Part I

Kurosuki Family Removal Mission

When
Naruto
 and
Team Guy
 arrived in the village to investigate
Raiga
, they saved Sukeza from being attacked by Raiga's men, due to him not working hard enough. Fearful that this outside help would only anger Raiga further, Sukeza tried to beat himself up so that it looked like he was attacked by the
Konoha
 ninja as well.
Rock Lee
 stopped him and vowed to free the village from Raiga.
