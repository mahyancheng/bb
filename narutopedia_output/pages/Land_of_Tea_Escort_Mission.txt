Summary





Naruto and Idate.



With
Konoha
 having a shortage of jōnin due to
Orochimaru
’s failed
invasion
,
Tsunade
 was forced to use
genin
 for more dangerous missions than normally allowed. Team 7 (minus
Kakashi
 who was assigned to another mission) was given the assignment of escorting a member of the
Wasabi family
 through a dangerous annual race as it was rumoured the rival
Wagarashi family
 had hired ninja of their own to sabotage the Wasabi family. Along the way, they met an arrogant teenager named
Idate
 who openly showed his hatred towards ninja. He also showed off his impressive speed by running away from Team 7 after conning them into paying his bill at a restaurant. Upon arriving in the Land of Tea and meeting the Wasabi family’s leader,
Jirōchō
, Team 7 was shocked to see Idate again and learn he was the man they were assigned to escort.

During the race, Naruto and Idate continued to show their dislike of each other. It was also revealed that Idate was actually the younger brother of
Ibiki
 and formerly a Konoha genin. They also encountered the
three Ame genin
 from the
Chūnin Exams
. After defeating them, they encountered
Aoi Rokushō
, another former Konoha shinobi, who betrayed Konoha to join
Amegakure
. He was also originally Idate's teacher and the one responsible for Idate running away from Konoha. After barely surviving Aoi’s attack, Idate explained how after he was failed by Ibiki himself for the Chūnin Exams, Aoi tricked Idate into stealing a special scroll and the
Sword of the Thunder God
 from the village. Being able to relate with Idate in both being
taken advantage of
 and the need to
have others
 recognise them, Naruto helped Idate regain his self-worth and continue the race.





Idate wins the race.



While managing to catch up in the race, Aoi appeared again and used the Thunder Sword to initially overpower the Team 7. But thanks to Sasuke fighting Aoi and weakening the sword with his
Chidori
, Naruto was able to break it when they clashed and defeat Aoi with his
Rasengan
. With the danger overcome, Idate was free to continue and win the race for the Wasabi family. During the victory ceremony, Kyūroku  tried to cheat the victory by lying that Naruto carrying Idate was a violation, but the Daimyō caught Kyūroku and his minister for cheating. As a result, the minister had to become a monk and the Wagarashi family was disbanded. While returning to the village, Team 7 was escorted by Ibiki himself. While he did not openly state this fact, Ibiki was glad that Naruto had helped his brother grow as a man.
