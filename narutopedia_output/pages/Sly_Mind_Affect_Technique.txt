This technique causes a target or targets to, while walking in what they believe to be a straight direction, walk in circles. As is typical for genjutsu, the targets are unlikely to notice that they're doing this, causing them to waste time and energy as they wander about.

Team 7
 only realise that they've fallen prey to this technique when they notice the body of a centipede that Naruto killed hours earlier.
