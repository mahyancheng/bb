This is a prototype suit created with
Scientific Ninja Tools
. The suit provides the wielder incredible strength and is powered by
Lightning Release
 to provide swift movements for the user, specifically inspired by the
Lightning Release: Overdrive
 technique which Denki refers to as
Pseudo Lightning Release: Overdrive
. The suit features a motion sensor visor which functions like the
Sharingan
, analysing and predicting the opponent's movements. For ranged combat, the suit can launch fireballs, and can extend its hands like grappling hooks.
