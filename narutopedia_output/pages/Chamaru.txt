Chamaru
 (
茶丸
) is a
ninken
 from
Konohagakure
's
Inuzuka clan
 and
Akita Inuzuka
's partner.

Background

At some point in time, Chamaru lost his right hind leg during a mission which
Katasuke Tōno
 replaced with a prosthetic, leading his partner, Akita, to join the village's
Scientific Ninja Weapons Team
.

Personality

According to Akita, Chamaru is a very dutiful dog and became saddened when his lost leg robbed him of the ability to continue being a ninken. Chamaru is also well-acquainted with
Boruto Uzumaki
.

Appearance

Chamaru greatly resembles the
Shiba Inu
 breed of dogs. He is a medium-sized, light brown canine with a very bushy tail. His right hind leg has been replaced with a prosthetic one.

Abilities

His partner Akita has been credited with being well versed in her clan's techniques including the
Fang Passing Fang
, Fang Roar (
牙咆哮
,
Gahōkō
) and Fang Passing Whirlwind (
牙通旋風
,
Gatsūsenpū

 As her canine companion, Chamaru is undoubtedly also able to perform these collaborative techniques.

Ao Arc

When Boruto and his
team
 helped escort Katasuke to the lab, the Chamaru quickly recognised Boruto's scent and greeted him. While happy to see his old friend, Boruto was surprised to see Chamaru's prosthetic leg. It was from the explanation of what Katsuke did for Chamaru that Boruto was able to finally get over his anger at both Katasuke and advanced ninja tech. When word was received that
Konohamaru Sarutobi
 went missing on his mission, Boruto's team was assigned to search for him. Chamaru's tracking abilities were offered by Akita for the mission. Chamaru ultimately led the genin and Katasuke to a crashed blimp, where they narrowly defeated a group of self-moving puppets. Afterwards, Chamaru lead them to Konohamaru and his partner
Mugino
 inside a cave. They were soon confronted by
Ao
, who held a machine-gun at them, demanding to know what they learned about the black container in the blimp. After confronting
Koji Kashin
, Chamaru alerted Team Konohamaru and Katasuke upon finding an unconscious
boy
 by some destroyed puppets.
