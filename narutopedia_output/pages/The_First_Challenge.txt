"
The First Challenge
" (
第一の課題
,
Daiichi no Kadai
) is episode 155 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

At
Mount Myōboku
,
Naruto
 is told by
Fukasaku
 that if one absorbs too much
natural energy
, they would turn into stone frogs, revealing that the collection of frog statues around them are former students. Fukasaku reveals that toad oil has the ability to acquire natural energy, and if Naruto rubs some on his skin, he will begin to sense natural energy; however, a side affect is that Naruto begins to transform into a frog, gained webbed hands and amphibious pupils. Using his baton, Fukasaku knocks the natural energy out of Naruto, reverting the transformation.
Gamakichi
 explains that his jab about Naruto dying referred to the fact that he'd lose his humanity once he became a frog forever, and Fukasaku reveals to Naruto that even
Jiraiya
 retained frog features after using
Sage Mode
.

Naruto decides to expedite his rigorous training using his
shadow clones
, which Fukasaku allows. Despite being constantly beaten by the sage toad, Naruto begins to sense the natural energy around him. In order to test Naruto's progress, Fukasaku asks Naruto use
senjutsu
 to lift a toad statue, which the
genin
 is able to do, much to Gamakichi's surprise; Fukasaku muses how Naruto has picked up the basics much faster than Jiraiya ever did. Fukasaku tells Naruto to learn how to absorb natural energy without the use of toad oil, but decides to give the
shinobi
 a break from their training. He then proceeds to give Naruto the very first novel Jiraiya ever wrote —
The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi
.

As Naruto reads the book, he realises that the hero of the book is also named
Naruto
. He sees Jiraiya's photo on the back of the book and begins to shed a tear as he recalls a memory from their training days, in which Jiraiya had hoped to change the world with his books and expressed gratitude over having Naruto as a student. Naruto had mocked his books and how they never sold, and Jiraiya had retorted that he would not give an autographed copy to Naruto. As Naruto smiles, he thanks Jiraiya for giving him something much more priceless.

Meanwhile,
Madara
 notifies the other
Akatsuki
 members that
Sasuke
 has successfully captured the
Eight-Tails
. As they prepare to seal it, Pain reveals his new
body
 and proceeds to declare that the
Six Paths of Pain
 are heading to
Konoha
;
Zetsu
,
Konan
, Madara and
Kisame
 begin to
seal

Killer B
 into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, only for the
jinchūriki
 to be nothing more than an
severed octopus appendage
.
