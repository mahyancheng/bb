Summary

Naruto Uzumaki
, having finally passed his graduation exam, heads to the ninja academy to be put into three man squads. He ends up paired with
Sakura Haruno
, a girl Naruto has a crush on, and
Sasuke Uchiha
, the person Naruto considers to be his rival. After Sakura shows disappointment at being paired with Naruto, and only happy about being paired with Sasuke, Naruto devises a plan. During lunch Naruto ambushes Sasuke and ties him up, then uses the

 to turn into Sasuke. Approaching Sakura as Sasuke, Naruto goes about finding what she thinks of him. Interrupted by having to go to the bathroom (right before he can get a kiss from Sakura), Sasuke manages to get free. Sasuke passes Sakura and she pesters him about their time together a few moments earlier. She then goes about insulting Naruto, and makes fun of him having no parents. Sasuke retorts angrily, saying she makes him sick. Deciding she has been too mean to Naruto, she decides she should try and be nicer to him from now on.
