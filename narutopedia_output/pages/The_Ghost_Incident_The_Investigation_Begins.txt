 anime.

Synopsis

Boruto
 looks at the crowd, trying to trigger his eye, while accompanied by
Shikadai
 and
Mitsuki
. They discuss how the incidents are not happening beyond the Academy. Shikadai points out their fathers have began investigating as well, making Boruto more determined to solve the issue before
Naruto
. The day ends without any progress. Boruto and Shikadai are confident they'll be able to continue investigating, Mitsuki having turned in their leave of absence in the Academy. At home,
Hinata
 questions Boruto about skipping classes, having been called by the
Academy
.
 At the Academy, Boruto insists to Hinata and
Shino
 he has an important duty. Hinata thinks Boruto is trying to get Naruto's attention. Shino advises her to tell Naruto what is going on. Shino's next lesson involves workplace experience, allowing Boruto, Shikadai, and Mitsuki to go around the village while working with the postal service. The three are put under
Tayori
's service, who takes them all around the village, making and receiving deliveries. Boruto notices Naruto at an opening ceremony. Naruto notices Boruto as well, and approaches him. They talk briefly about what they're doing. After Naruto leaves, Boruto has the group split up to finish their duties faster. Upon regrouping, Mitsuki informs them he heard there was an incident at Senju Park. At the park,
Sai
 investigates the scene and collects witness statements. By the time the three arrive at the park, the scene has already been processed. Sai reports to Naruto and
Shikamaru
 that he has found evidence of someone using research on Hashirama's cells, based on trace evidence of
Wood Release
 use at the park, believing it to be former
Root
 members. He believes they're harvesting chakra for military purposes. Sai and Shikamaru decide to go through Root records for clues on who it might be. Naruto goes home for a change of clothes, and talks to Hinata about seeing Boruto at the village. Naruto confesses that growing up without a father, he is unsure how to interact with Boruto. At the post office, there have been complaints about deliveries, Tayori's superior
Komame
 assigning them inventory duty while Tayori fixes their mistakes from the previous day. They hear on tv about another incident, at the water purification plant where their class-mates were working, and rush there.
