Summary

Out of his shadow's current range,
Temari
 considers how to defeat
Shikamaru
. While thinking she realises that he has gained a new shadow source: a parachute made from his shirt that provides some much needed surface area. She avoids the attack and formulates a plan. As she is about to implement it she notices she has finally been captured. Now forced to mimic his movements, Shikamaru lets her see how she was caught: he had been navigating her to the tunnel that Naruto created during his match, where he was hiding his shadow. Having been manipulated for the entire battle, Temari prepares for defeat when Shikamaru forfeits, claiming to have exhausted himself from trying to catch her, fulfilling
Chōji
's prediction.
