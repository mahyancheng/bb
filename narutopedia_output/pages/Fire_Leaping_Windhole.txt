Tsunade punches the ground, creating a massive shockwave. Using it as a cover, Orochimaru summons three Rashōmon gates, creating them in the form of a triangle, trapping the opponent in between. Then, Orochimaru and Jiraiya use
Wind
 and
Fire Release
 respectively to create a huge fiery vortex. Tsunade jumps into the flames and, after activating her
Yin Seal
, delivers a punch strong enough to break the gates in an explosion.
