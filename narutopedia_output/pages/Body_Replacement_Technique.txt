This article is about the general skill. For
Zetsu
's personal technique, see
Substitute Technique
.

The instant before they are to be struck by an attack, the user replaces themselves with a block of wood or something similar. Because the attack does hit
something
, opponents may briefly believe that they've successfully struck the user. But this is merely an optical illusion and opponents will quickly notice what's happened. If users are fast enough, they can use this brief lapse in the opponent's attentions to stage a counterattack;
 in the anime, the replacement log itself has been shown used as an attack, being applied with
explosive tags
.
 Alternatively, this is a good opportunity for users to escape.

The Body Replacement Technique can evidently only be used in response to what would be harmful attacks:
Pain
 only escapes from
Jiraiya
's
Wild Lion's Mane Technique
 when Jiraiya tries to kill him with it; when Jiraiya uses the same technique to only keep Pain restrained, Pain remains captured.

Trivia

This technique is based on a real-life ninja art,
kawarimi
, where ninja substitute themselves with anything that can be mistaken for them (such as a dummy or a mannequin).

As it means "a quick shift in position, or adaptability to changing circumstances", it is also utilised in
Sumo
.

In other series, abilities similar to the Body Replacement Technique are sometimes referred to as the "Empty Cicada Technique" (
空蝉の術
,
Utsusemi no Jutsu
) (not to be confused with the
Empty Cicada Shell Technique
, which uses the exact same kanji). This name refers to the empty shell a
cicada
 leaves after moulting.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2
 and subsequent games in the series,
Killer B
 uses the
Eight-Tails
' severed tentacles to mask his escapes.

In
Naruto: Clash of Ninja 2
,
Akamaru
 substitutes himself with a bone rather than a block of wood.
