When
Mozu Shitakiri
 approached him about the location of the Senri Hawks, he refused to risk the endangered species even when he was offered a large sum of money. Soon after, various mishaps befell Maruta, who realised right away that Mozu was behind it. Later,
Sasuke Uchiha
 and
Boruto Uzumaki
 arrived. After initially believing them to be Mozu's hired men, Maruta explained the situation. Later that night, Maruta accepted Sasuke's request to acquire a Senri Hawk. After escaping their pursuit from Mozu's men to keep the location secret, Maruta brought Sasuke to the cave. There, Maruta explained that the key to mastering one of the hawks was actually to let them choose their master. To Maruta's surprise, one quickly accepted Sasuke. Maruta was impressed, having suspected true strength of character in the ninja.
