The user alters the atomic structure of an
earthen
 material, converting it to
glass
. Doing so negates the effects of
Lightning Release
, which earth is ordinarily weak to. Originally conceived as a theoretical possibility by a scientist, the technique was long considered to be impossible for actual use in the field: first there was the issue of being able convert earth to glass at all, which would require years of training just to achieve the necessary purity; there was the issue of anticipating where a lightning-based attack would strike and then accurately converting that location in time; and the glass would subsequently need to be changed back into earth, as glass is otherwise a weak material. Despite all this,
Kakashi Hatake
 is able to do so, converting sections of his
Earth-Style Wall
 that are about to be struck by lightning. He notes that the ability is ineffective against high concentrations of lightning, such as
Chidori
, because the heat that's generated would melt the glass.
Sasuke Uchiha
 used this technique to create a glass
Kunai
 from a piece of rock.
