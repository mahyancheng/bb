Deidara
 (
デイダラ
) was an
S-rank

missing-nin
 from
Iwagakure
. During his time in the village, he was a member of the
Explosion Corps
. After defecting from the village, he was forced into
Akatsuki
 and was its youngest member. There, Deidara was partnered with
Sasori
 until the latter's death, and later with
Tobi
 before his own death.

Background

During his time as an Iwagakure
shinobi
, Deidara came to know
Ōnoki
, and became familiarised with his fighting style.
 He possessed the
Explosion Release

kekkei genkai
 which he used as a member of the Explosion Corps.
 Though praised highly for his clay sculptures, Deidara's desire to reach even greater heights in his art resulted with him stealing one of his village's
kinjutsu
 that allows one to knead their chakra into substances.
 Using
explosive clay
 to take out his pursuers, Deidara found the art he had desired: the
Art of a Single Moment
 (
一瞬の芸術
,
Isshun no Geijutsu
).
 Remembering the first moment whenever he detonated his explosive clay, he recalls the process that allowed him to reach this art. Since then, Deidara became a missing-nin and offered his services as a bomber to insurgents in various countries.

Deidara's exploits eventually caught the attention of Akatsuki, and
Itachi Uchiha
,
Kisame Hoshigaki
, and Sasori were sent to recruit him. Deidara refused at first until he accepts a challenge from Itachi on the condition that Akatsuki let him be if he won. However, Deidara was easily defeated by Itachi's
Sharingan
 and begrudgingly joined the organisation where he was partnered with Sasori. In the anime, Sasori and Deidara were immediately tasked with eliminating
Orochimaru
 for betraying the organisation. Upon arriving in the
Land of Wind
 and witnessing the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 by Orochimaru, the Sannin retreated after his technique proved incomplete. After Deidara attempted to kill him by blowing up his base, Deidara and Sasori searched the ruins but were unable to confirm his death as they didn't find his corpse.
 At some point afterwards, Deidara returned to Iwagakure and left it in destruction after detonating a bomb within the village, as he flew away.

With his ego crushed from his defeat at the hands of Itachi's
dōjutsu
, Deidara carried a murderous loathing for Itachi and his Sharingan for the rest of his life.
 Acknowledging that Itachi was a more powerful opponent, Deidara took steps during his time with Akatsuki to ensure he could get revenge on Itachi, such as training his left eye to counter
genjutsu
,
 and devising the means to create
C4
.

Personality

During his partnership with Sasori, Deidara usually showed a cool, and relaxed attitude, never losing his smirk even while fighting an intense battle or when being blamed by his partner. However, his personality seemed to change to some extent after being partnered with Tobi, as he would easily get mad at his partner’s childish and sometimes disrespectful behaviour. He also had something of a sadistic arsonist nature, rather he was not above enjoying a good fight, and he often blew up his opponents in a very brutal fashion. Deidara's most distinctive trait, however, was his love of art. He would respect any form of it, even if it disagreed with his own. Deidara also had a habit of ending his sentences with nasal-like grunts (
…うん
,
…un
), roughly translated as "yeah" or "hm". The latter of which is used in the VIZ version. Deidara also seemed to respect the ideals of others as he allowed
Gaara
 to move the sand he used to protect his village into the desert before kidnapping him, even going so far as to admiringly call him noble.

Deidara referred to his explosive ninjutsu as art, usually quoting "Art is an Explosion!" (
芸術は爆発だ
,
Geijutsu wa Bakuhatsu da
) and seeing each bomb he made to be a significant accomplishment. He referred to his style as
superflat
 (referring to certain types of art), and claimed
pop
 (another art style) is dead.
 He would often boast about his works of art, even towards his opponents in battle. Deidara's pride as an artist makes him simply unwilling to accept that anything could defeat it, leading to his abandonment of strategy during his battle with Sasuke Uchiha, in favour of tactics that let him show off his art. He was able to recognise stronger opponents like Itachi, although he felt that the Sharingan was inartistic, and despised the fact that he had been enthralled by its genjutsu.

Deidara referred to his partner Sasori as Master Sasori (
サソリの旦那
,
Sasori no Danna
,
English TV:
 Sasori, my man), out of respect for him as a fellow artist. He also admitted, at least outwardly, that Sasori was more powerful than he was.
 In spite of this, Deidara wasn't above goading his partner, and they frequently argued over the nature of true art (Deidara holding that art is what lasts within a moment while Sasori believing fine art is something that lasts for all time).
 This reflected their individual fighting styles (Deidara made clay sculptures that exploded; Sasori made long-lasting puppets out of humans). Deidara outwardly seemed to respect Sasori's beliefs, but couldn't resist getting a final jab in after Sasori's death.

Deidara's partnership with his second partner, Tobi, however, was very different. Tobi apparently held great respect for Deidara, and frequently called him "
senpai
" (
先輩
,
senior
). The idiotic front Tobi put up greatly irritated Deidara, who believed that all Akatsuki members should be calm, talking less and acting serious.
 This in turn results in Tobi unintentionally angering Deidara to attack him in a comedic fashion (e.g. blasting him with his explosive clay or strangling him with his legs).
 But in battle, Deidara puts his issues with Tobi aside to work well with him, telling him to get away when he was about to do a more dangerous attack.
 Deidara also seemed to have a minor sense of appreciation for Tobi, as shown when he apologised to his partner in his thoughts before he initiated his self-destruction technique.

Appearance

Deidara's appearance underneath his Akatsuki attire.
1/3

Deidara had slanted blue eyes with thick black lines under them (reminiscing eyeliner) and long golden-blond hair which he wore drawn into a half ponytail with the rest hanging down freely. The bang hanging over his left eye is what concealed his eye
scope
 signifying that he was a long-range fighter, but as shown in his fight with Sasuke, it was not permanently attached to his face. After casting the
Iwagakure Kinjutsu
 on himself, he developed a mouth on both of his palms, and on the left side of his chest he had a large, stitched-up mouth. He used this kinjutsu to supplement his Explosive Release to his clay. Before joining Akatsuki, Deidara wore a blue and grey kimono jacket with a fishnet under-shirt inside and khaki pants with sandals and a belt-like pouch with a chain. His blond hair was also tied into a lower ponytail and an Iwa forehead protector. After joining Akatsuki, he wore their signature cloak, navy blue pants with matching shinobi sandals, and an Akatsuki ring on his right index finger, which bore the kanji for "blue or green" (
青
,
ao
) and was teal in colour. He also wore black nail polish on his fingers and toes. Under his cloak, he wore a V-neck, sleeveless, midriff shirt with mesh armour underneath it along with pants, stirrups, and sandals. He also wore a utility belt with two bags on either side, which he used to carry his clay. He also scratched a line across his forehead protector to signify his severed ties with Iwagakure, a common practice of Akatsuki members.

Because of a certain turn of events, Deidara suffered damage to his arms. Deidara had his left arm crushed by Gaara's sand,
 and the elbow of his right arm was blown into
another dimension
 by Kakashi's
Kamui
.
 Deidara had his arms restored by having Kakuzu sew what was left of his arms with what appears to be a transplanted arm.
 His transplant was dark brown and had several wrinkles on it.

After Kabuto
reincarnated
 him, Deidara displayed the black sclerae and darker irides seen in other reincarnated shinobi, due to the talisman placed into his head. Deidara no longer wore his
forehead protector
 resulting in his hair being looser, although it was still kept tied into a ponytail. In place of his previous clothing, Deidara, like the other reincarnated Akatsuki members, wore a red cloak with white lining. During the anime-exclusive
Power arc
, he originally wore a black robe with red lining before wearing the red cloak for the remaining of his servitude under Kabuto before and during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

Abilities






The mouth on Deidara's palm.



Deidara was a very powerful S-rank missing-nin whose abilities earned him recognition within Akatsuki. Even the organisation's leader,
Pain
, praised Deidara's abilities, openly admitting that he was something unique, and that his loss was a major blow to the group.
 Deidara was able to single-handedly defeat
Gaara
 (
Shukaku
's
jinchūriki
 and the Fifth
Kazekage
), and
Isobu
, despite fighting the both of them in their home territories. He also fought on equal grounds with
Sasuke Uchiha
, an
Uchiha clan
 prodigy, despite his techniques being at an elemental disadvantage against those of Sasuke.

Intelligence

One of Deidara's strong points was his intelligence, often using tricks, misdirection, and calculated gambles to get his explosives in range of an opponent. He demonstrated these skills in his fight with Gaara, putting clay into Gaara's sand as it destroyed his arm. During his battle against Sasuke, he managed to trick him on a few occasions, such as trapping him between his C2 dragon in the sky and the landmines buried underneath the ground by Tobi, and again when he lured him into his C4 attack at point-blank. In the anime, Deidara managed to deduce a workaround to his weakness to Lightning Release by using a
sword
 as a makeshift
ground rod
 to siphon off the lightning-based attacks his explosive clay was weak against.

Ninjutsu

Deidara had shown some skill with the
Shadow Clone Technique
, incorporating it into some of his techniques, such as the
Suicide Bombing Clone
.

Nature Transformation and Explosive Clay






Deidara's most powerful technique.



Deidara possessed the
Explosion Release

kekkei genkai
. This allowed him — by simultaneously using
earth
 and
lightning

chakra natures
 — to give his chakra explosive qualities. Deidara also possessed a special mouth on each palm and on the left side of his chest as a result of stealing and using a
powerful

kinjutsu
 from his village on himself. By commonly using these two special abilities in unison, he could create explosive clay: clay infused with his explosive chakra that detonated with the command
Katsu
 (
喝
) and the
seal of confrontation
. This clay could be moulded into a wide variety of shapes and forms, growing to large sizes when infused with chakra (with Deidara performing the necessary hand seals), and could be controlled at will. This allowed him to create living explosives to attack opponents at long-range.

Deidara could even create
clones from the clay
 and can
detonate
 them, which will make for a deadly surprise attack, and if need be, create
clay minions
 to control with a cord from a distance. Deidara's clay creations range from
microscopic
 to
gigantic
 in size, allowing him to adapt to any situation from creating
dragons
 to shoot smaller clay bombs, to working in conjunction with
Obito
 to lay explosive clay
landmines
 under ground to limit the opponent's movements. As an ultimate last resort, Deidara could turn himself into a bomb by devouring explosive clay that has a large blast radius in which he calls his "
Ultimate Art
". Deidara could also use the clay for other purposes, as he was frequently seen creating birds to be used for
transportation
, which also functioned as a way to easily infiltrate villages on missions.
 It seemed he also knew standard earth-based techniques, as shown from his
Earth Release: Hiding Like a Mole Technique
, which he used to avoid damage from one of his mass-scale bombs.
 Since all of his explosives were earth-based, they were vulnerable to lightning, and most could thereby be defused with lightning-based attacks.

Eye Enhancement






Deidara's scope.



Deidara wore a
scope
 on his left eye for long-range observation, and he had trained the eye itself to counter
genjutsu
, allowing him to see through and negate them. When he did this, his pupil would contract.
 This training was done in order to counter Itachi's powerful genjutsu skills, of which he had a considerable loathing for, and wished to defeat him when he got the chance.
 Deidara also seems to be able to see long distances without his scope as after being reincarnated, he found enemy shinobi lurking near Tobi's hideout; he still needed to close his right eye in order to use his left eye for long distance vision.

Physical Prowess

Deidara's stealth skills were rather proficient, able to sneak up on two of Konoha's
Anbu
 members as they were scouting.
 In addition, he possessed phenomenal stamina, endurance, and pain tolerance, able to swiftly dodge the members of
Team Guy
 and counteract them with a kunai held in his mouth, despite having lost both of his arms shortly beforehand.
 He was also considerably durable, and could withstand being helplessly pummeled by Naruto while he was empowered by his
Tailed Beast Form
.
 He possessed high reaction speed, able to avoid a high-speed blitz with by Sasuke with short notice during their battle.
 He also had enough strength to dislodge the
Fūma Shuriken
 that pierced and pinned his arms using his legs.

Sasuke Recovery Mission

At the end of Part I, Deidara made a cameo appearance as a
silhouette
 during an Akatsuki gathering where he mentioned that they should be patient as they'd kill
Orochimaru
 eventually as well, stating that they only have three years, questioning if Akatsuki could accomplish all of their tasks on time.

The Fallen Castle

Main article:
The Fallen Castle

In the anime, Deidara and Sasori met with
Hidan
 and
Kakuzu
 to discuss their new missions and decide which team would take which mission. Deidara and Sasori were chosen to take the war-mission.
 The duo then went to the
Land of This
, a small nation, with the intent of destroying it to spread Akatsuki's reputation. Deidara then handled the initial attack, setting off a series of explosions to scare the population. To his annoyance, Sasori then took over to finish the job, only agreeing because Sasori complemented his performance. By dusk, the nation was destroyed, making Sasori and Deidara's mission a success.

Part II

Kazekage Rescue Mission

Main article:
Kazekage Rescue Mission






Deidara and Sasori on route to Sunagakure to capture Gaara.



Deidara, with Sasori, travelled to Sunagakure to capture Gaara so Akatsuki can extract Shukaku, the One-Tail, from him. As they arrive, Deidara notes that the
one
 who was
in place

there
 would be the first, while the
one
 they sent under Orochimaru will have to wait. Getting passed gate security with the help of Sasori's sleeper agent
Yūra
, taking out any guards watching the sky, Deidara found that the village was artistically worthy of being blown up. Despite the stealthy infiltration, Deidara was quickly confronted by Gaara, who knew he was in the village due to the clay bird he was flying on not matching any species native in the
Land of Wind
. Deidara was then forced into taking up the defensive, seeing Gaara's abilities to make his opponent worthy of him using his artistic ninjutsu on. Nearly being trapped in a prison of sand pulled from the surrounding desert, Deidara ended up losing his left arm trapped in some of the
sand
 from Gaara's
gourd
, forcing Deidara to pull what remained of it off to prevent the sand from crushing the rest of him.






Deidara captures Gaara.



Seeing that he was nearly out of clay, Deidara hatched a plan that would end the fight: Using a
C3
 bomb on the village as a decoy with Gaara left defenceless in his act to
protect Sunagakure
 for Deidara to use a clay bird. Though Gaara's sand stops the scheme, Deidara reveals that some of the clay in the arm Gaara took had mixed with his sand. Detonating the clay as Gaara uses his
ultimate defence
, Deidara abducts his unconscious opponent with
Kankurō
 in pursuit before Sasori gives Deidara time to escape. After waiting for Sasori, Deidara headed out with him to one of their hideouts in the
Land of Rivers
 to extract Shukaku with the rest of Akatsuki. When Team Kakashi and Team Guy were announced to be on their way to save Gaara, Deidara couldn't help but feel embarrassed about his lack of stealth in capturing Gaara.






Deidara losing his remaining arm to Kakashi's Kamui.



When
Team Kakashi
 arrived at their location, Deidara was given a meagre clue from
Itachi
 as to what the
jinchūriki
 of the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 is like - the one who barges in and barks first. To test Itachi's clue, he sat on Gaara's corpse while waiting for the team, to see which of the shinobi gave a response first. This worked and Deidara, taking advantage of this, left with Gaara's body in order to lead away the jinchūriki, leaving Sasori to deal with
Sakura
 and
Chiyo
. He was set on capturing Naruto to help him in his quest for greater stimulation to his art sense as he found Naruto to be "
a canvas worthy of my artistry
". He tried separating Naruto from
Kakashi Hatake
 in order to have an easier time capturing Naruto and tried several different tactics, but ended up failing each time. Kakashi tried
decapitating
 Deidara, but only managed destroying his other arm, giving Naruto a chance to retrieve Gaara and knock Deidara into the forest. Handicapped, Deidara was taken by surprise when Naruto appeared behind him and pushed him to the ground, repeatedly pummelling him without rest. Right before Naruto could kill him with a
Rasengan
; Deidara managed to switch himself with a
clay clone
 and hid in a near-by bush.






"Deidara" committing suicide.



He watched in amazement as Naruto's anger caused him to enter a two-tailed form before Kakashi reversed it with a
Chakra-Suppressing Seal
. Chiyo and Sakura arrived immediately afterwards, cuing Deidara to make his escape as he had no backup to rely on now; however, he couldn't help but get in the last laugh about his partner as he prepared to leave. He was caught by
Team Guy
, thanks to Neji, and forced to flee as he was now heavily outnumbered. Upon remembering his clay bird was still around, Deidara bit off some of it and used another substitution, allowing a
Suicide Bombing Clone
 to take his place in an attempt to both kill his enemies and flee. The attempt at destroying his enemies was futile, as Kakashi teleported the explosion away with Kamui; though they did believe Deidara was dead.

By evening, a battered Deidara emerged from the ground, lamenting of his clone explosive failing before deciding to find his severed arm as it would soon begin to rot. A bit later, Deidara met Tobi and
Zetsu
 after they found his severed appendage, stating he fulfilled his position in capturing Gaara when Zetsu wondered why he did not capture Naruto as well. He then comically tried to choke Tobi to death after being accidentally insulted three times by him when the masked ninja refused to give Deidara back his arm. At some point in time later, Deidara had what was left of his right arm
sewn
 back on by Kakuzu along with a new left arm to replace the one Gaara had crushed.

Akatsuki Suppression Mission

Main article:
Akatsuki Suppression Mission

Deidara was present during the sealing of the
Two-Tails
, and upon hearing Kakuzu mention he and his partner were heading to
Konoha
, Deidara warned the two that a
very powerful jinchūriki
 lived there.

Three-Tails' Appearance

Main article:
Three-Tails' Appearance

In the anime, he and his new partner, Tobi, found their next mission was to capture the
Three-Tails
. Along the way, they took a break at a nearby dango shop. Deidara also showed an interest in what Tobi looked like behind his mask, only for him to be tricked by Tobi to look away for a moment. After a short fight between the two due to Tobi's antics, they split up to seek out the beast.






Tobi and Deidara confront the Three-Tails.



Later, Deidara snuck up on and killed two Konoha
Anbu
, who were sending a report on the Three-Tails back to the village. Tobi congratulated Deidara, and they headed towards the lake. Deidara commented that, since Tobi was now a part of Akatsuki, he should be able to capture the beast himself. Frightened by the huge beast and its devastating powers, Tobi ran away with the beast chasing after him. Deidara sent an explosive clay fish into the lake which detonated, taking down the beast and allowing Tobi to capture it. Surprised by the defeated beast, Tobi gloated that he did it with a special technique of his, not realising that it was Deidara's explosive clay that did it. Tobi later fell asleep while Deidara was speaking to him, which prompted an angry Deidara to exploding clay next to Tobi, frightening him.

Itachi Pursuit Mission

Main article:
Itachi Pursuit Mission

After sealing the
Four-Tails
, Deidara learned that
Naruto
 and the
Eight Man Squad
 were searching for Itachi and Sasuke. When Naruto was mentioned, he openly said that he held a grudge against Naruto when he punched him in the face, and for disrespecting his art. He also heard about the death of former Akatsuki member,
Orochimaru
. Having wanted to kill Orochimaru himself, Deidara and Tobi sought out Orochimaru's killer: Sasuke Uchiha, the younger brother of Itachi Uchiha. When they finally found Sasuke, Tobi assisted in Deidara's assault against him.






Deidara prepares his attack.



Deidara attempted to attack from above using a bomb, but Sasuke used
Hidden Shadow Snake Hands
 to wrap himself with a snake as a shield. Tobi also attempted an attack, but he was scared of Sasuke, and fled from him. Deidara told Tobi he was to handle Sasuke, and tested him with C1 grade fleas. Sasuke used the
Chidori Senbon
 to stop the bombs. He then jumped behind Deidara, who used a bomb to distance himself. But Sasuke managed to avoid the bomb. Realising Sasuke's abilities were great, Deidara used C2 next, and summoned a clay dragon as a battle partner. The dragon then regurgitated a cluster of land mines to which Tobi said they were going with "that". Sasuke attacked with
Chidori Sharp Spear
, but Deidara was out of range. While Sasuke was busy with Deidara, Tobi planted the latter's mines around the field






Sasuke stuck in Deidara's clay clone.



Deidara sent a new C2 bomb after Sasuke, and he activated his Cursed Seal level 2 to block the blast (at the cost of one of his wings). He shot two giant shuriken at Deidara. Deidara avoided them, but Sasuke attached wires to them. They impaled Deidara's arms against the dragon, and Sasuke flew up with his Chidori sword and severed one of the dragon's wings off. Deidara fell to the ground toward his land mines which subsequently destroyed the dragon. Tobi cried out for Deidara, but Deidara (who earlier had dislodged the shuriken and was now safely atop one of his clay birds) told him to be quiet. He looked into Sasuke's Sharingan and remembered when he had first seen them in Itachi.

Angered that Sasuke, like Itachi, refused to acknowledge his art, Deidara used C4 — his most powerful explosive — ingesting the clay with his own mouth and spewing out a giant replica of himself. Believing himself to be victorious as Sasuke disintegrated into nothing, Deidara is shocked to realise that he had been placed under a genjutsu. Attacking Deidara with the
Chidori
, Sasuke seemingly pierces Deidara through the chest but this is revealed to be a clay clone as the real Deidara emerges from below and explains that he had trained his left eye to counter genjutsu.






Deidara turns himself into a bomb.



Enveloping Sasuke in another clone, Deidara prepares a homing bomb to detonate his C4 creation while he falls through the air. Sasuke, however, is able to escape and protect himself with his Chidori Current. He then jumped right next to Deidara and punched him. Realising that Deidara was out of chakra and could not get up, Sasuke asked where Itachi was but Deidara refused to answer, and attacked Sasuke again, but it was nullified and Sasuke collapsed of exhaustion. Enraged and driven half-mad by Sasuke's indifference to his art, Deidara released the mouth located on his chest and turned himself into a suicide bomb in last effort to kill Sasuke. However, the Uchiha summoned the giant snake
Manda
, whom he used as a shield from the blast, and
teleported
 himself to safety (at the cost of Manda's life), leaving Deidara's sacrifice in vain.

Deidara and Sai clash.



In the anime, Kabuto acquired Deidara's genetic material and brought him back to life via
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 to aid him in the attack on the
Hachō Village
, fighting the Yamato-led Team Kakashi while protecting his summoner.
 When Kabuto was about to escape, Deidara prevented the enemies from following using an explosion to cast a smokescreen.

The next day, with his personality restored, Deidara, along with a
recreated
 Hidan, killed several guards from the
Hachō Village
 who were guarding The Hole, allowing Kabuto to sneak into the nearby village. The two began bickering about their respective defeats, which nearly escalated into a fight between the two, when Yamato and
Sai
 arrived with more Hachō guards.
 After a
Tailed Beast Ball
 fired by a
clone
 of Naruto detonated nearby, Deidara was recalled into his coffin by Kabuto.

After the
Ama no Hoko
 was activated by
Disonasu
, Kabuto summoned Deidara into battle once again. Deidara planted explosive clay on several of Kabuto's reincarnated shinobi, using them as suicide bombers to attack his enemies. Deidara then pursued Hidan's clone, intending to assist him in activating his
curse technique
 on the members of
Team Asuma
. However, as he flew towards Hidan, Kabuto remotely removed Deidara's personality and forced him to fly back towards the Ama no Hoko.
 Kabuto then used Deidara to assault Kakashi, although he emerged from Deidara's attack unscathed.
 As Kabuto later left the area, he presumably recalled Deidara to his coffin.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown

Main article:
Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown






Deidara and Kabuto head out to find the jinchūriki.



In an attempt to both impede Tobi and coerce him into joining forces during their initial encounter,
Kabuto Yakushi
 demonstrated his capabilities by revealing Deidara and the other deceased members of Akatsuki brought back by Impure World Reincarnation.
 Later, Kabuto transported himself atop of Deidara's clay bird, before placing a seal inside his head which, while granting Deidara a certain amount of free will, allowed Kabuto to maintain control over him. Deidara was pleased by the prospect of a further chance to create new art and seemed content with the idea of fighting Naruto again, because he had a score to settle.






Deidara fights Ōnoki.



On route to the island, they are ambushed by Ōnoki, with
Akatsuchi
 and
Kurotsuchi
. However, both Kabuto and Deidara are revealed to be clay clones and were then blown but Ōnoki is also revealed to have been one of Akatsuchi's
rock clones
. By Kabuto's orders, they continue towards the island, rather than engaging with Ōnoki in battle. He is ordered by Kabuto to mould a big bomb, which takes the form of a jellyfish and explodes beneath the giant tortoise. Deidara offered to let Kabuto go ahead to look for
Killer B
 and
Naruto
 while he fought Ōnoki and his bodyguards. During the battle his explosives were blocked by Akatsuchi's
rock golem
. After being drawn away from the giant island turtle, Deidara challenges Ōnoki's
Dust Release
 with his own explosive clay, but before he could attack he was placed back in the coffin, much to his dismay.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Main article:
Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Deidara's group heads out.



Assigned to the
Surprise Attack and Diversion Platoon
, Deidara is tasked with disrupting the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 using his explosives, as the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 commences. After arguing with Sasori about art and telling him that they were both dead, their group mobilises atop Deidara's clay birds, where he locates the three remaining members of the
Infiltration and Reconnaissance Party
.

Complaining about
Muta Aburame
's
insects
, he bombards their position, until the group is eventually taken captive. Deidara then
booby-traps
 Muta's jar, before Sasori
manipulates
 him so as to attack the opposing
Surprise Attack Division
. The enemy uncovers the trap and
evades
 the blast, forcing Deidara to engage them directly, where he tells them only one squad can emerge victorious, but that they can't lose as they're "
immortal
". Fooled into thinking
Omoi
 was about to
attack
 him, when he actually intended to free
Tokuma
 and
Ranka
, he becomes enraged. However, the earth beneath him is suddenly
raised
, making him collide with the falling Sasori. Deidara then resorts to detonating the clay placed inside of
Shin
, yet Kankurō manages to
smother
 it.






Deidara and Sasori attacked by a furious Sai.



Displeased that the blast was lessened, his remarks provoke Sai, by referring to Shin as "
the bomb
". Teasing him further as a weakling who couldn't even replace Sasuke, while reminding him that Shin could be made into a bomb again, Deidara then ridicules Sai's art when he starts to draw. However,
struck
 from behind, both he and Sasori are
contained
 by Kankurō's puppets. Threatening to activate
C0
, despite its repeated use cheapening his art, Deidara is instead pierced by Omoi's
lightning
-
infused
 sword, diffusing his clay. As Kankurō later lectures Sasori about how a puppet master could find true immortality in one's own work, Deidara becomes furious, telling Sasori not to listen to him as true art was found within a fleeting blast.

Still imprisoned when
Chūkichi
 arrives with reinforcements, after
Hanzō
's remark halts his complaining, Deidara demands that the others release him. However, when the retreating division are met by a portion of the
Fifth Division
, he is secured by the
samurai
. In the anime, while being interrogated by Kurotsuchi, Deidara manages to escape thanks to the
White Zetsu Army
 infiltrating the Fifth Division. With the entire Fifth Division in pursuit, Deidara is forced to use guerrilla tactics to evade them before being baited by Kurotsuchi, posing as Sasuke to play on his insistence that killed him, into a trap with the Fifth Division recapturing him. As a slight compensation, Deidara had thought up his Super Ultimate Art, as he found repeating his self-detonating tasteless.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax






Deidara's soul begins departing.



Still demanding that they release him before he exploded, he told Kankurō that in art there was no such things as duds before being taken by surprise by the release of the Impure World Reincarnation technique with his soul emerging from his deconstructing body as it returns to the
afterlife
.

Legacy

When news of Deidara's death reaches the rest of Akatsuki, Pain comments that his loss is a huge blow to the organisation, instructing the other members to mourn his death quietly amongst themselves.

Despite Iwagakure ridiculing his
artistic values
 and his subsequent defection from the village, Deidara has earned some respect from certain high-ranking villagers, as Kurotsuchi called him "Deidara-nii" (
デイダラ兄
), an honourific meaning "big brother", either as family or a sign of respect, and wished to fight the person who defeated him: Sasuke.
 The Third Tsuchikage, Ōnoki, still recognising Deidara's abilities, also seemed displeased that someone like Sasuke could defeat Deidara.

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Deidara

Deidara's catch phrase was originally coined by famous Japanese abstract artist
Tarō Okamoto
, whose works inspired many of Deidara's explosives.

Deidara ranked 3rd in one official character popularity poll shortly after his debut, just one rank above Naruto. He also ranked higher than any other member of Akatsuki (though at the point that poll was taken, only about half of Akatsuki's members were formally introduced).

Ironically, and unknown to him, his second partner, Tobi, had the kekkei genkai he despised: the
Sharingan
.

Deidara's characteristic "
katsu
" (
喝
), which he uses to detonate his explosive clay, is a type of shout that is used in
Zen
 Buddhism to stop the discursive thoughts of practitioners, potentially helping them achieve an
enlightenment experience
. It is also used as a means of focusing energy.

According to the databook(s):

Deidara had completed 82 official missions in total: 4 D-rank, 27 C-rank, 35 B-rank, 13 A-rank, 3 S-rank.

Deidara's hobby was experimenting with explosions.

Deidara wished to fight Itachi Uchiha.

Deidara's favourite food was bakudan, a pun on the actual food (boiled eggs in surimi) and the Japanese word meaning bombs, while his least favourite was mixed rice/pilaf.

Deidara's favourite phrase was "Art is an Explosion!" (
芸術は爆発だ
,
Geijutsu wa Bakuhatsu da
).

Tobi commented that Deidara would die from an explosion,
 while Sasori said that he was the type to die young.
 Both of them were right, as Deidara would later self-destruct with a
massive explosion
, as a last effort to kill Sasuke at the age of 19.

He referred to his previous partner Sasori as Master Sasori (
サソリの旦那
,
Sasori no Danna
,
English TV:
 Sasori, my man), but Sasori was not the only person that Deidara called with this title: in
Shippūden

episode 18
 and in an
omake
 for this episode, Deidara referred
Kisame
 as "Kisame no Danna" (
鬼鮫の旦那
,
English TV:
 Kisame, my man) as well.

After being reincarnated Deidara was not aware that Sasuke was still alive, having died believing that his final attack killed the both of them despite what Ōnoki had told him.
 In the anime, Kurotsuchi reiterates this point to Deidara once more.

Deidara's tendency to finish his sentences with nasal grunts is similar to
Zaku Abumi
's.

Quotes

(Catchphrase) "Art is an explosion!" (
芸術は爆発だ!
,
Geijutsu wa bakuhatsu da!
).

(Before killing the
Suna
 guards) "
Look at those fools. They have no appreciation for art. You have to feel art. And true art… is an EXPLOSION!
"

(To
Sasori
) "
Fine art is the beauty of that single fleeting moment of explosion.
"

(To
Tobi
, after he mocked how Deidara had lost his arms) "
Tobi, even a Buddha loses patience when insulted a third time… One more word and there'll be no doubt about the cause of your death.
"

(To
Sasuke
) "
You think you're so cool! And those eyes make me sick!! Always judging me… and my art!! You have no appreciation of the beauty of my work… and it makes me want to kill you!!
"

(Last words to Sasuke) "
This will be my ultimate piece of art. I'll explode! I shall die and become art itself! This will be like no explosion before it, and it will leave a scar upon the Earth unlike anything else! Then, my art will receive the admiration it's always deserved! Tremble! Be afraid! Recoil in despair! Cower in awe! And cry your heart out, because my art… is an EXPLOSION!
"

(To
Ōnoki
 after being reincarnated) "
Shut up! I killed Sasuke Uchiha! And you're next, you art-hating sack of wrinkles!
"

(To himself) "
Art will never die… even if I already have.
"
