Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes
 is an English-exclusive fighting game and is the first English
Naruto
 game on the PlayStation Portable.

Gameplay

Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes
 is essentially a scaled down version of
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2
 and an edited version of
Narutimate Hero Portable
. However,
Ultimate Ninja Heroes
 is more of an action game whereas
Narutimate Portable
 was more story oriented. The game also features 20 characters and several new features, such as a three-on-three fighting system, wireless two-player battles, and "hidden" team skills.
