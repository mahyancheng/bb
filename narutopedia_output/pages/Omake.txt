Trivia

One of the most notable omake appears in
Naruto: Shippūden
 episode 129
, featuring a festival with many deceased characters.

Naruto Shippūden
 episode 2
 and
6
 are the only episodes which have had two omake.

The omake use recurring themes, such as "
Naruto Uzumaki
's Swirl Radio", "
Yamato
's Guest House" and "
Tsunade
's Room".

The omake are the only time the "
fourth wall
" is broken in
Naruto
.

Naruto: Shippūden
 episodes
83
 and
188
 are the only two episodes to have omake that are canon. The omake of
Shippūden
 episode
166
 was not originally canon, but the most significant event to occur in it (
Naruto
 and
Hinata
's first meeting) was retold in a similar fashion in
The Last: Naruto the Movie
, albeit under somewhat different circumstances, rendering it arguably semi-canon.

The omake from episode
95
, where Hinata is shown to be the winner of the ramen eating contest is possibly referenced much, much later when the
Boruto
 anime aired. In episode
18
, Naruto and
Boruto
 go to
Ramen Ichiraku
 where Boruto discovers that Hinata, once again, holds the record for the most ramen eaten.

"Rock Lee's Silly Chronicles" omake from episodes
252
 to
256
 had a chibi animation style that was used for the spin-off non-canon anime,
Naruto SD: Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles
, released in the same year.
