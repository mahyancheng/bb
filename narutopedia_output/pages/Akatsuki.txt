Akatsuki
 (
暁
,
literally meaning:
 "Dawn" or "Daybreak") was a group of
shinobi
 that existed outside the usual system of the
hidden villages
. Over the course of several decades, Akatsuki took different forms and was led by different individuals. Though each iteration is viewed as either subversives or criminals, all sought to make the world a better place through their own means. Each Akatsuki tended to have multiple lairs across the world, inaccessible either due to their remoteness or the various security measures that protected them.

History

Yahiko's Akatsuki






Yahiko's Akatsuki.



The initial concept of Akatsuki was devised by
Black Zetsu
 as part of its plan to revive its
mother
, though it pretended the idea came from
Madara Uchiha
, whom Black Zetsu tricked into thinking that it was a manifestation of his will.
 Akatsuki was originally founded by
Yahiko
 during the
Third Shinobi World War
 alongside his childhood friends,
Nagato
 and
Konan
. As citizens of
Amegakure
 who had been orphaned by the
Second Shinobi World War
, the three created Akatsuki as a way to bring peace to their home country, which too often got caught in the crossfire of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
' many conflicts.
 In time, the three were approached by
Tobi
, who introduced himself as Madara Uchiha.
 Tobi claimed Nagato was the
reincarnation
 of the
Sage of Six Paths
 and offered to teach him to control the power of his
Rinnegan
, though Yahiko distrusted him and prompted Nagato to turn down his offer.
 Nevertheless, Tobi would later claim that it was he who encouraged Yahiko to form Akatsuki, unbeknownst to Konan.

Akatsuki's desire for an end to war attracted many fellow Ame ninja to their cause and, in time, word of their exploits began to travel beyond Amegakure's borders. Akatsuki's early fame was owed largely to Yahiko's leadership and his natural charisma, which kept the group united and motivated them to persevere despite the difficulties of their goal. Yahiko, however, viewed himself as merely a facilitator for Nagato, who would ultimately be the actual source of world peace because of his Rinnegan. Ame's leader,
Hanzō
, also became aware of Akatsuki and although he originally believed in them, he later perceived them as a threat to his rule, a belief encouraged by
Danzō Shimura
 in the anime who used the bodies of his Root personnel killed in an attack that had occurred as a result of Nagato summoning the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path when he saw Yahiko and Konan in danger to convince Hanzō Akatsuki were a threat to his power. Hanzō approached Akatsuki offering to help them broker peace between
Konohagakure
,
Iwagakure
, and
Sunagakure
 by using Danzō who had disguised himself as a ninja, "Kanzō". When Yahiko, Nagato, and Konan arrived to meet with him, however, they were ambushed by Hanzō's men and members of Danzō's
Root
, who took Konan hostage (in the anime, Konan had been taken prisoner after being knocked out by gas while patrolling the Seventh Ward) and forced Yahiko to commit suicide in order to save her. Enraged by Yahiko's death, Nagato
summoned
 the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 and used it to slaughter their attackers, though Hanzō himself escaped.

In the anime, the other members of Akatsuki were tipped off to Hanzō's plan via a message from one of their teams near the border to Konoha and left their headquarters, attempting to provide backup to Yahiko and the others. However, Tobi and Zetsu intercepted them and after a long battle, Tobi killed the remaining members of the group. With all the members including Yahiko dead, Nagato and Konan were the only two survivors of the original Akatsuki left.

Nagato's Akatsuki

With Yahiko's dying breath he entrusted the pursuit of peace to Nagato. Nagato, grieved by Yahiko's death, came to believe that the world would never willingly consent to peace and that Akatsuki's previously pacifist approaches to achieving that goal were therefore futile. He concluded that the only way the world would turn away from its constant warfare was to experience such catastrophic death and destruction that it could never again stomach the idea of conflict. Intending to be the one to show these horrors to the world, Nagato began using the alias "Pain" and formed the
Six Paths of Pain
, into which he integrated Yahiko's corpse so that he could symbolically continue leading Akatsuki. Nagato sought out Obito, under the guise of Madara Uchiha, and accepted his earlier offer of support, which he provided in secret.

After the Third Shinobi World War, Akatsuki began recruiting
S-rank

missing-nin
; mostly through strong-arming them and promising protection to carry out their respective goals. Orochimaru and Itachi joined for their own reasons, while Kisame and Zetsu joined to secretly ensure the Eye of the Moon Plan. Once Akatsuki recruited its target of ten members, Akatsuki began following a three-step process to achieve this stated objective:

Obtain enough money to support their organisation.

Provide mercenary services at well under the competitive rate, using the money gathered in the first step to offset costs. This will make countries increasingly dependent on Akatsuki's services, corner the entire market for shinobi
missions
, and eventually put all of the shinobi villages out of business because they can't compete with Akatsuki's prices. By capturing and strategically deploying the
tailed beasts
, Akatsuki could quickly start and then quell wars, thereby speeding up the process.

Once all other major shinobi forces have dissolved, Akatsuki will be able to quickly conquer all the countries of the world.






Nagato's initial Akatsuki.



The early years of Nagato's Akatsuki were very successful, as the hidden villages increasingly hired Akatsuki to fight in wars and perform assassinations that the villages themselves were unwilling to get involved in during times of peace. Akatsuki is willing to accept any mission, even mundane ones.
 The
Fourth Raikage
 claims that only
Kumogakure
 never hired Akatsuki, while the
Third Tsuchikage
 in particular became a frequent employer. Despite being such a popular and successful group, Akatsuki was largely a mystery to those outside the organisation, with many (incorrectly) coming to believe they operated out of
Kirigakure
. Akatsuki experienced some turmoil amongst its members over the years:
Kakuzu
 regularly killed his partners in fits of rage and stole their hearts for his
Earth Grudge Fear
;
 only being teamed with the immortal
Hidan
 prevented him from continuing to do this.
Orochimaru
 attempted to steal
Itachi Uchiha
's body after the latter joined the organisation, and when that failed he was forced to defect. Despite this, Akatsuki was able to begin working towards capturing the tailed beasts.

Nagato's actual objective behind acquiring the tailed beasts was to harness the tailed beasts'
chakra
 to create a powerful
kinjutsu
, using it to wipe out one side in a conflict and, from the display, frighten the other side and the world at large to stop the fighting. If and when the fears abated and conflicts renewed, the kinjutsu would be deployed again, creating small periods of peace in an endless chain of hatred.
 Because all but
one
 of the tailed beasts were in the possession of the hidden villages, their capture risked antagonising many of Akatsuki's former clients. Despite this, Deidara claims that the previous owners of the first two tailed beasts captured by Akatsuki (indicated in the anime to have been the
Five-Tails
 and the
Seven-Tails
) were glad to be rid of them.






The various members of Nagato's Akatsuki.



After a period of obscurity,
 the Akatsuki's return with the mission to capture the tailed beasts gradually elevates them from the shadows of the world and, in turn, prompts a growing resistance by the hidden villages. After
Deidara
 captures the
One-Tail
,
Sasori
 is killed in battle with the Suna and Konoha forces sent to rescue the One-Tail's
jinchūriki
. Obito takes this open position as an opportunity to officially join Akatsuki as "Tobi", helping capture the
Three-Tails
. Around the same time, Hidan and Kakuzu capture the
Two-Tails
, but both are subsequently defeated in unrelated confrontations with Konoha's
Nijū Shōtai
.
Kisame Hoshigaki
 later acquires the
Four-Tails
, after which both Deidara and Itachi separately die in battle against
Sasuke Uchiha
. After this, Sasuke, alongside his comrades in
Taka
 –
Suigetsu Hōzuki
,
Jūgo
, and
Karin
 – are employed as associate members of the Akatsuki by Tobi, an alliance he believes is worth the losses of all the other Akatsuki members. However, it is worth noting that the members of Taka never served as full Akatsuki members. Taka is sent out to retrieve the
Eight-Tails
; the mission initially appears successful, but they are soon discovered to have been
tricked
 by the Eight-Tails' jinchūriki,
Killer B
.

Because of their shrinking numbers, Tobi pressures Nagato into taking a more active role in capturing the remaining tailed beasts. In the anime, he and Konan are first sent to capture the
Six-Tails
, which was captured at some earlier point in the manga. They are afterwards sent to Konoha to capture the
Nine-Tails
, and in the course of the resultant
Pain's Assault
 the village is destroyed. When he finally locates and meets with the Nine-Tails' jinchūriki,
Naruto Uzumaki
, Nagato begins to doubt the direction he has taken Akatsuki in since Yahiko's death. After Nagato's Six Paths of Pain are defeated in battle and Konoha and its population saved, Naruto after hearing Nagato's story is swayed not to kill Nagato and instead convinces him that a bloodless peace is worth pursuing no matter how impossible it may seem. To make up for all the missteps he took, Nagato gives his life to
revive
 the Konoha villagers that died during his attack, using his last breath to encourage Naruto to achieve the peace that he was never able to. With Yahiko and Nagato gone, Konan opts to leave Akatsuki.

Tobi's Akatsuki






Tobi's Akatsuki.



Tobi approached Akatsuki in order to get close to Nagato, whose Rinnegan he needed to complete the
Eye of the Moon Plan
. Over the years, he remained in the shadows, allowing Nagato to stay as Akatsuki's leader while Obito manipulated him towards his desired ends, specifically capturing all nine tailed beasts so that he can restore the
Ten-Tails
 and use it to cast the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 on the world, ending all conflict by trapping everyone in a dream. Obito follows the Eye of the Moon Plan under instructions of the real Madara Uchiha, whose identity Obito assumed after Madara's death. Madara intended Obito to have Nagato revive him in the final stages of the plan, though Obito had no plans to uphold that end of the plan and intended to use Nagato to revive himself should anything happen to him. However, this subterfuge was rendered moot by Nagato betraying Obito and using the Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique to revive everyone he killed during his invasion of Konoha.

Even before Nagato's death, Obito takes a growing role in Akatsuki's activities, due in large part to Itachi Uchiha's death. He reveals himself to Kisame, who worked with him during their time in Kirigakure and is happy to collaborate with him yet again, and he employs
Taka
 to fight alongside the Akatsuki, although this alliance is ultimately unsuccessful. When
Zetsu
 reports Nagato's death, Obito is deeply agitated by the setbacks, particularity Nagato's betrayal, and increasingly irritated by Naruto's constant thwarting of his plans.

With their ranks so diminished and with the Five Great Shinobi Countries finally starting to mobilise against Akatsuki, both because of the attack on Konoha and the botched capture of Killer B, Obito is forced to start taking drastic actions. He first sends Kisame to capture B and then, despite Sasuke's initial resistance, sends Taka to attack the
Five Kage Summit
. Sasuke does not perform as well against the
Five Kage
 as Obito wished, as he had hoped they would be weakened enough to be forced to negotiate. Instead, he must approach them diplomatically, asking that they help him complete his Eye of the Moon Plan by surrendering the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails. They refuse, prompting Obito to initiate the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.






The reincarnated Akatsuki.



While preparing for war, Obito is approached by
Kabuto Yakushi
, a former subordinate of Sasori and Orochimaru. Kabuto offers to bolster Akatsuki's fighting strength with the
Impure World Reincarnation
, reviving Akatsuki's past members and several other once-notable shinobi. Obito is reluctant until Kabuto blackmails him by reviving the real Madara Uchiha, on whose name Obito has been banking the credibility of his threats against the hidden villages. Obito is forced to agree. He then goes to Amegakure to take Nagato's Rinnegan, killing Konan in the process. News eventually reaches them of Kisame's death, but Kisame is at least able to send them intel that enables Kabuto to strengthen Obito's
White Zetsu Army
.

In the two days of the war between Akatsuki and the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, both sides suffer heavy casualties, yet Naruto and Killer B elude capture. When most of the White Zetsu are defeated and Kabuto is made to end the Impure World Reincarnation, Obito, having no more options, prematurely revives the Ten-Tails. Madara, having escaped Kabuto's influence, lends a degree of support, eventually leading Obito to become the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki. He is defeated by Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke (who has since sided against Akatsuki) before he can perform the Infinite Tsukuyomi, and as a result Obito stops pursuing the Eye of the Moon Plan.

With Obito's surrender, Akatsuki's schemes officially end. Following his defeat, Obito undergoes a change of heart, thanks to both Naruto and Kakashi's influence, and Obito attempts to redeem himself by using the Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique to revive everyone he killed during the war. However, his attempts are foiled by
Black Zetsu
, who latched itself onto Obito and forces him to indeed utilise the technique, but instead of reviving those killed during the war, Black Zetsu successfully forces Obito to fully revive Madara. Madara's plans are momentarily set back, however, as his Rinnegan eyes start to crumble away (due to his original eyes being elsewhere; his left eye being in Obito's possession, and his right eye being hidden away by Obito himself) as his reincarnated eyes were merely part of his reincarnated body.

Nevertheless, Madara quickly regains possession of his right eye, and successfully perseveres, sealing the Ten-Tails into his body. Afterwards, Madara engages in battle against
Might Guy
, who received a boost in power from opening the
Eight Gates Released Formation
, whom Madara barely manages to survive against. Madara subsequently battles against both Naruto and Sasuke, who gained
Six Paths Senjutsu
 and Rinnegan, respectively, from
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
, during which Madara regains possession of his left eye from Obito. With both eyes returned, Madara subsequently awakens the
Rinne Sharingan
 and successfully launches the Infinite Tsukuyomi. However, he is afterwards betrayed by Black Zetsu, who has been scheming for centuries to revive the alien Princess
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
, with first Madara, then Obito, and then Akatsuki itself being mere pawns used in pursuit of that goal.
 Kaguya is restored using Madara as a medium and intends to defeat Team 7 while absorbing the chakra Naruto and Sasuke possess. Not wanting to have the world not damaged by any further fighting, she attempts to kill Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi but, with Obito's and Team 7's efforts, she and Black Zetsu are ultimately defeated by Naruto and Sasuke with assistance from Sakura, Kaguya being resealed while Naruto personally enseals Black Zetsu to ensure that it does not get another opportunity to begin planning to revive Kaguya once more. Madara succumbs to having the Tailed Beasts extracted from his body, and the Infinite Tsukuyomi is ended by the combined efforts of Naruto and Sasuke who have already had their last fight at the Valley of the End which ends with the valley being destroyed and the two recoiling, having also lost their dominant arms in the process.

Shin's Akatsuki






Shin's Akatsuki.



Despite the defeat of Akatsuki during the Fourth Shinobi World War and the death and destruction they caused throughout Konoha and the world in general, Akatsuki's methods of peace remain attractive to certain individuals. Some, such as the
Ryūha Armament Alliance
 and
Gengo
, carry on Akatsuki's goals in spirit. About fifteen years after the end of the war, a former test subject of Orochimaru's,
Shin
, develops a fascination with Itachi and adopts the Uchiha name while plotting to avenge Itachi by killing Sasuke. In addition, Shin goes so far as to adopt Akatsuki's name, believing its former goal of endless warfare is the perfect evolutionary tool, weeding out the weak and promoting strength for all of humanity. He composes Akatsuki with numerous
clones of himself
 and seeks to start moving forward with Akatsuki's revival. Shin's plans start facing complications as soon as the
Seventh Hokage
 becomes aware of him following an encounter between Sasuke and a clone. Shin uses drastic measures to counter Naruto and Sasuke, such as sending his clones to unsuccessfully kidnap Sasuke's daughter,
Sarada Uchiha
 and forcefully take his wife, Sakura as a prisoner. Shin is soon afterwards betrayed and killed by his clones who Shin had also treated as organ donors or shields, the clones surrendering after glimpsing Kurama inside Naruto's subconscious and are dropped off at the
Konoha Orphanage
, ending his new Akatsuki before it ever truly begins.

Wardrobe

Members of Nagato's Akatsuki wear long, black cloaks with red clouds, a red interior, and a chin-high collar; Tobi and the members of
Taka
 wear a similarly-marked hooded mantle. The red clouds represent the rain of blood that fell in
Amegakure
 during its wars, and were viewed as a symbol of justice by its original members.
 The robes are very distinctive, allowing members of Akatsuki to be identified even from a distance. Though the robes are a standard feature throughout Nagato's tenure (with Konan even continuing to wear it after leaving Akatsuki), the robe falls out of use under Obito's leadership: Kisame stops wearing it owing to circumstances of faking his death, Obito does not replace his when it is destroyed by Konan, and Zetsu ceases using a robe once its two halves begin operating separately. During Shin's attempt to revive the organisation, he is the only individual to wear the robe, as none of his clones wear it.

Another trend started with Nagato is for members to cross out the symbol on their
forehead protectors
 to symbolise the severed ties with their former villages, though some opt not to wear a forehead protector at all. All members also wear nail polish on their fingers and toenails (colours vary in the anime). When travelling, members sometimes wear conical straw hats with small ornamental torques and tassels hanging down over their faces, possibly to go unnoticed by the general population as most are S-class criminals.

Rings






The ring positions of the members.



Under Nagato, each member of Akatsuki is given one of ten rings, to be worn on a specific finger. Other than apparently signifying one's membership, the rings seem to have some role in
sealing
 the tailed beasts into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, indicating which of the statue's finger the members should stand on. The rings are apparently important and irreplaceable: when Orochimaru defects he takes his ring with him, and for that reason he is never officially replaced;
 when Deidara loses the arm that his ring is on, he has greater interest in recovering the ring than the arm itself; Zetsu and Tobi specifically seek out Sasori's ring after his death, needing it for Tobi to replace him. When Tobi takes over, the rings are no longer important, as he simply discards it along with his damaged robe after battling Konan. Despite all this, the rings' exact significance is never explained.

The various rings are:

Right thumb: "zero" (
零
,
rei
); worn by
Pain
. Its colour is purplish-grey.

Right index finger:
"blue", "green"
 (
青
,
ao, shō
); worn by
Deidara
. Its colour is teal.

Right middle finger: "white" (
白
,
byaku, haku
); worn by
Konan
. Its colour is white.

Right ring finger: "vermilion", "scarlet" (
朱
,
shu
); worn by
Itachi Uchiha
. Its colour is red.

Right little finger:
"sign of the boar"
 (
亥
,
gai
); worn by
Black Zetsu
. Its colour is green.

Left little finger: "sky",
"void"
 (
空
,
kū
); worn by
Orochimaru
. Its colour is slate blue.

Left ring finger: "south" (
南
,
nan
); worn by
Jūzō Biwa
(anime only)
 and later by
Kisame Hoshigaki
. Its colour is yellow.

Left middle finger: "north" (
北
,
hoku
); worn by
Kakuzu
. Its colour is dark green.

Left index finger: "three" (
三
,
san
); worn by Kakuzu's
fourth partner
 and later by
Hidan
. Its colour is orange.

Left thumb: "jewel", "ball", also the black king in shōgi (
玉
,
gyoku
); worn by
Sasori
 and later by
Tobi
. Its colour is purple.

Eight of the ten kanji of the rings are taken from a
kuji-in
, a collection of nine hand postures used in meditation. Pain's "rei" and Zetsu's "gai" are not from this kuji-in. However, the only unused kuji-in kanji, 玄 (
gen
,
"mysterious"
), bears a strong resemblance to Zetsu's "gai", suggesting an error. It would be a consistent error, however, since the "gai" kanji has been used in every instance the ring's kanji has been shown.

Teams

Under Nagato, Akatsuki members are organised into teams of two, usually paired based on perceived similarities (such as Itachi or Kisame) or advantageous combinations (such as Hidan and Kakuzu). Although some pairs get along better than others, few seem to actually like each other;
Sha no Sho
 notes that members always have separate rooms when staying at hotels. Hostilities tend to exist even between members who aren't partners, though they so rarely meet that this is rarely an actual problem.
 Teams travel the world pursuing Akatsuki's goals, only convening when summoned by Nagato, typically to seal a tailed beast.

Nagato
 &
Konan






Nagato and Konan.



Target(s):
Six-Tails
 (Pain, Sealed,
anime only
),
Nine-Tails
 (Pain, Failed)

As childhood friends and fellow members of the original Akatsuki, Nagato and Konan are the only members who consistently get along. Because Nagato is Akatsuki's leader, Konan tends to defer to him, doing as he instructs even when she personally disagrees. In Nagato's rule of
Amegakure
, Konan acts as the "angel" to his "god", communicating his will to Ame's villagers. Nagato's true identity is concealed from the rest of the organisation, and instead, the Deva Path is used as his representative.

Black Zetsu
 &
White Zetsu






Black Zetsu and White Zetsu.



Target(s): None

Black Zetsu and White Zetsu are allies of Obito who helped him approach Nagato and worked behind the scenes as a high ranking member under Obito and later Nagato. Although they exist as two separate identities, most of the time they are merged together and act as the singular Akatsuki member,
Zetsu
. The two sometimes argue, but it never interferes with their duties: spying, evidence disposal, and resource acquisition. Zetsu is often the only member of Akatsuki other than their partners that members meet in person. Zetsu typically helps transport a
jinchūriki
 to one of Akatsuki's hideouts for extracting the Tailed Beast.

Orochimaru
 &
Sasori






Sasori and Orochimaru.



Target(s): Unknown

Orochimaru and Sasori were one of the earlier Akatsuki teams to be formed. Little is known of their deeds, but they apparently were quite effective together. They also got along well enough that Orochimaru knew how Sasori's actual "body" looked beneath his typical
Hiruko
 carapace, although their relationship eventually deteriorated to the point of both of them wanting to change partners. Sasori held a grudge against Orochimaru after he defected from Akatsuki and took a personal interest in his activities afterwards.

Jūzō
 &
Itachi
 (Anime Only)






Jūzō and Itachi.



Jūzō and Itachi worked very well with each other, being involved in at least three missions together, which involved assassination and sabotage. The two partners had an unique system of formations in order to better synchronise with each other. Formation A was used when both shinobi attacked individually using whichever ability they preferred, Formation B had Itachi open up with an attack involving genjutsu or shurikenjutsu while Jūzō killed the incapacitated shinobi with his sword, Formation C was a personal request by Jūzō to be killed by Itachi if he would be captured by Kirigakure and Formation D was to be proposed by Itachi but he refused to do so. Eventually, Jūzō was killed by the
Fourth Mizukage
 during an assassination attempt of the two Akatsuki members against a
Land of Water
 citizen and, after severely injuring Yagura, Itachi put the remains of
Kubikiribōchō
 into his partner's hands, showing respect to his fallen comrade.

Itachi
 &
Kisame






Itachi and Kisame.



Target(s):
Nine-Tails
 (Itachi, Failed),
Four-Tails
 (Kisame, Sealed),
Eight-Tails
 (Kisame, Failed)

Kisame thought their partnership was appropriate as both were notorious for killing their fellow countrymen. Despite conflicting personalities, Itachi and Kisame get along well: Kisame has a greater predisposition towards violence, but always follows Itachi's instructions, even when it denies him an opportunity to kill someone. Kisame is sad after Itachi dies, and Itachi, once
reincarnated
, displays some regret on learning of Kisame's own death.

Sasori
 &
Deidara






Deidara and Sasori.



Target(s):
One-Tail
 (Deidara, Sealed)

Deidara is forcibly recruited (with help from Itachi) to replace Orochimaru as Sasori's partner. Each view themselves as an artist, though has little respect for the other's preferred art form: Sasori believes art is eternal, as in a
puppet
, while Deidara believes art is fleeting, as in an
explosion
. Deidara pays some deference to Sasori since he's more experienced, but is very disappointed by Sasori's death.

Kakuzu
 &
Hidan






Hidan and Kakuzu.



Target(s):
Seven-Tails
 (Kakuzu, Sealed,
anime only
),
Two-Tails
 (Hidan, Sealed)

After Kakuzu killed all of his previous partners in fits of rage, he was paired with Hidan, an immortal he couldn't kill. Whereas other teams at least have moments of cooperation, Hidan and Kakuzu actively hate each other: Hidan believes Kakuzu's obsession with money is sacrilegious and Kakuzu desperately wants to kill Hidan because his habits constantly waste Kakuzu's time. Despite this, the two are arguably the most effective of Akatsuki's teams, variously called the "Immortal Combo" (
不死コンビ
,
Fushi Konbi
)
 and the "Zombie Combo" (
ゾンビコンビ
,
Zonbi Konbi
).
 If Hidan is dismembered, Kakuzu can sew him back together. Kakuzu, meanwhile, can launch indiscriminate attacks without needing to worry about Hidan being killed in the crossfire.
Shikamaru Nara
 believes they are unstoppable so long as they are together.

Deidara
 &
Tobi






Deidara and Tobi.



Target(s):
Three-Tails
 (Tobi, Sealed)

When Tobi replaces Sasori in Akatsuki he also becomes Deidara's new partner. Per the persona he assumes, Tobi regularly annoys Deidara, either through open disrespect or out of apparent ignorance. Deidara attempts to kill Tobi several times out of irritation, but never manages to succeed, or at least follow through. Deidara, unaware of Tobi's true identity, takes him on as a sort of disciple, instructing him on the ways of the world and how to succeed in Akatsuki. Deidara even displays a certain fondness for Tobi at the end of his life, instructing him to get to a safe distance from his
C4
 and then apologising for what he assumes will be Tobi's death prior to using
C0
.

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Akatsuki

In
Sha no Sho
,
Masashi Kishimoto
 stated that he originally planned on making Akatsuki a group of monsters with almost no human characteristics, with Zetsu emphasising that specifically.

In
Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie
, the Akatsuki of the
Genjutsu World
 is a well-known mercenary group.

In the
Naruto Collectible Card Game
,
Suigetsu Hōzuki
,
Karin
, and
Jūgo
 are incorrectly listed as Akatsuki members while in their Akatsuki robes.

In the manga, the Three-Tails is sealed just before the Two-Tails.
 In the anime, the Three-Tails' capture receives
