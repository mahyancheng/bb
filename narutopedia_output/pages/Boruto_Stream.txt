By utilising
Wind Release
, the user can accelerate their movements, creating an effect similar to tunnel vision. To reach higher speeds, the user gains aid from others to perform the technique on them by propelling them from their feet. This technique can also be used on an ally to increase their speed.

Trivia

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
, Boruto's "Jet Stream" (
ジェットストリーム
,
Jetto Sutorīmu
) is reminiscent of this, with Boruto using Wind Release to blow at a shadow clone with his mouth instead of being propelled by one with the Gale Palm.
