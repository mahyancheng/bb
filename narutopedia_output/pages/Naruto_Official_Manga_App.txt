The
Naruto Official Manga App
 (
NARUTO-ナルト- 公式漫画アプリ
,
Naruto Kōshiki Manga Apuri
) is a
Naruto
 companion app published by Shueisha for Android and iOS in the Japanese region, designed to act as a one-stop shop for
Naruto
 news and digital media. In late 2017 the app was partially redesigned with its 2.0 update, with some features being removed. The new version of the app allows users to directly purchase or accumulate
Chakra
 through daily login bonuses and ad viewing, which can be used to rent or permanently purchase digital manga chapters, volumes, databooks, and light novels.

These free editions are notably published without the editorial copy present on the first and last pages of the serialised edition. Individual story arcs are also sometimes made available to read for free for a limited time as part of limited-time events.
