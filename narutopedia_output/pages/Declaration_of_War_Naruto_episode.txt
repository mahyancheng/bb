Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Teleporting

Sasuke
 and
Karin
 to a
safe location
,
Madara
 tells the five
kage
 about his
Eye of the Moon Plan
. A long time ago, the
Sage of Six Paths
, who possessed the
Rinnegan
, saved the world from a beast known as the
Ten-Tails
. After sealing it within himself and becoming its
jinchūriki
, he harnessed its power. However, upon his deathbed, he feared that the seal would come undone when he passed away and thus used his
Creation of All Things Technique
 to split the
chakra
 of the Ten-Tails into nine
tailed beasts
, which he scattered across the world. The body of the Ten-Tails, devoid of chakra, became the
moon
.

Despite most of the kage unwilling to believe in the Sage of Six Paths and the existence of the Ten-Tails, Madara tells them that it is very much true and that he plans to gather all nine beasts in order to recreate the Ten-Tails, at which point he would become its jinchūriki and use its massive chakra reserves to cast
genjutsu
 off the surface of the moon, creating an
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 that would result in him controlling everyone, thus ensuring peace and stability, promising a world without war. However, should the five kage interfere in his plan to amass the
Eight-Tails
 and the
Nine-Tails
, he would wage a war as a result.

The
Fourth Raikage
 exclaims that the
Akatsuki
 have already captured the Eight-Tails; but Madara reveals that they blundered and that
Killer B
 is still out there. He asks the
Raikage
 to give his brother up, although the latter refuses.
Gaara
 notifies Madara that he would not give up
Naruto Uzumaki
 either, and thus Madara declares that the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 has officially begun. Before teleporting away, he reminds them that he has the power of seven tailed beasts in his arsenal.

With a new world war on the horizon, the
Third Tsuchikage
 proposes that the two remaining jinchūriki be on the front lines, but the idea is shot down by everyone else, who believe that Killer B and Naruto should be in hiding and given protective custody. The hidden villages of
Suna
,
Kiri
,
Iwa
 and
Kumo
 all agree to join together in the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, with
Mifune
 offering the
Land of Iron
's involvement. However, since
Danzō
 has fled, the others remark on
Konoha
's stance in the war. Gaara alerts them that
Kakashi
 is a trusted
shinobi
 of Konoha and that he would alert Kakashi of the situation personally, which the Fourth Raikage agrees with.

Meanwhile, Naruto attempts to enter
Sage Mode
 in order to locate Sasuke, only to be interrupted by the arrival of
Lee
,
Kiba
,
Sai
, and
Sakura
, with the latter telling him that she needs to talk to him urgently.
