Oboro
 (
朧
) is a
genin
 from
Amegakure
.

Personality

He is described as vindictive, and impatient. This was shown when he showed joy at the opportunity to exact revenge against Sasuke for their previous fight. Oboro also had a peculiar liking to the word "lucky", frequently using it when things went his way and/or when he was pleased. He is similar to his teammates in the way that he seems to really enjoy an easily won battle. He is not particularly detail-oriented, as he missed some crucial points while transformed into Naruto, leading to his immediate discovery.

Appearance

Oboro has spiky brown hair and dark eyes. He wears the same yellow jumpsuit as his teammates which was stitched up the middle along with a pair of sandals. He also wears a
forehead protector
 that covers his whole head, a
rebreather
 and a sash around his face with eyeholes cut out.

In the anime, he was seen in a long-sleeved light-purple kimono shirt and pants with a pair of sandals.

Abilities






Oboro using the Earth Release: Underground Projection Fish Technique.



Oboro is a fairly competent shinobi with knowledge of techniques across a wide range. He is especially proficient in
genjutsu
 and
clone techniques
 being able to use the
Sly Mind Affect Technique
 which was used to confuse an opponent's sense of direction effectively wearing out their foes before attacking them.

Nature Transformation

He is also able to use
earth
-based techniques which allowed him to
travel
 and emerge from underground without disrupting the surrounding area. In the anime, it was also shown that he can use
Water Release
 as well, being capable of creating
clones
 from that element.

Part I

Chūnin Exams

Main article:
Chūnin Exams

Oboro and his teammates travelled to
Konohagakure
 to compete in the
Chūnin Exams
 being held. Having passed the first stage of the exam, Oboro proceeds onto the second phase. Soon after the exam begins, Oboro scouts out the Forest of Death without his teammates and eventually finds
Team Kakashi
. Waiting until
Naruto
 is separated from his teammates, Oboro restrains and
transforms
 into Naruto and approaches
Sasuke
 and
Sakura
. Sasuke sees through the transformation quickly as Oboro failed to copy Naruto exactly (he failed to copy the wound that
Anko Mitarashi
 had earlier given Naruto and had his shuriken holster on the wrong leg). Exposed, Sasuke and Oboro fight. Using his
Sharingan
, Sasuke manages to get the upper hand and injure Oboro, forcing him to retreat.






Team Oboro fighting Team 7.



Later, Oboro and his teammates used a number different
genjutsu
 to cause Team Kakashi and
Kabuto
 to waste time and tire themselves out. After having them fight illusions for a while, Oboro and his teammates engage them. They quickly find out that what appeared to be the Konoha ninja were really just
shadow clones
 in
disguise
, the real ninja having been resting. Oboro and his teammates were quickly defeated by Naruto, resulting in them losing their scroll and not passing.

Land of Tea Escort Mission

Later in the anime, Oboro and his teammates, under the leadership of
Aoi Rokushō
, were assigned by Amegakure to help the
Wagarashi family
 win the Todoroki shrine race held in the
Land of Tea
. While Oboro went to stall
Idate
,
Mubi
 and
Kagari
 prepped a ship for naval combat. The team begins to use water clones, in attempt to divert team Kakashi. After using an oil-based technique, the Ame genin were able to sink Idate's ship.
Team 7
 jumps out of their boat, and into the ocean for safety reasons. The Ame genin go to battle Team 7 underwater, where they held the advantage with more usage of water clones. However, Naruto turns the tables, and uses his
Rasengan
 training to hand them another humiliating defeat as the first part of the Rasengan training created a whirlpool that sucked Oboro's team into a trench. They were immobilised afterwards as they did not return, but they are assumed to have survived because of their masks.
