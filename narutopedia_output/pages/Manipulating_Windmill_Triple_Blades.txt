The user attaches one end of a
wire string
 to a
shuriken
 and the other end to a
kunai
. The user throws the shuriken at a target, expecting that the target will dodge it. The user then loops the kunai around a tree (or something similar) and throws the kunai, which the target will also dodge. When the kunai reaches the end of the string's length, it pulls the shuriken back towards the target, striking them from behind;
Rin no Sho
 compares the action to a
yo-yo
. Because the manoeuvre's effectiveness relies on anticipating the target's movements, having the
Sharingan
 is invaluable to its success.

When
Sasuke Uchiha
 uses this technique against
Orochimaru
, Orochimaru is able to capture the returning shuriken. Sasuke planned for this, allowing him to send
Fire Release: Dragon Fire Technique
 at Orochimaru along the shuriken's string.

Trivia

In the manga, Sasuke
flows

chakra
 into the kunai before throwing it.
