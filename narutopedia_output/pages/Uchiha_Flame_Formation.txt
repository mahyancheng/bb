After manifesting small chakra flames on each finger of one hand, the user then slams their palm on the ground, resulting in the creation of a cylindrical barrier of flames enveloping a location of their choosing. Should the enemy come into contact with the barrier's exterior, they will be quickly set ablaze.

This powerful barrier uses the ground as catalyst to keep burning while using only a small amount of chakra. The flames are powerful enough to deflect a punch from the
Eight-Tails
