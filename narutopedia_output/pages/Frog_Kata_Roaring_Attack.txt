Naruto lands a series of kicks and punches using a few shadow clones. The penultimate attack hits the opponent in the air, throwing them towards the ground, but the original Naruto intercepts the opponent half-way, extending the reach of his punch with natural energy, sending his opponent flying.

Trivia

In its début game, the attack was named "Frog Kata: Roaring Kick", despite kicks not being part of the finishing strike, which is usually what combos in video-games are named for. In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
, it was changed to "Frog Kata: Roaring Attack", more in line with how the technique actually ends.
