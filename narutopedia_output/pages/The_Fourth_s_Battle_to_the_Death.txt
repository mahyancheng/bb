Summary

As
Tobi
 moves towards
Konoha
, several people felt the
Nine-Tails
' presence, including
Kakashi
, the
Third Hokage
, and
Itachi
. Tobi then summons the fox causing chaos. The Third organises Konoha to battle the fox, while wondering how
Kushina
's seal broke, despite all the precautions.
Minato
 enters Konoha, on
Hokage Rock
, causing the Nine-Tails to sense him and fire a
Tailed Beast Ball
 at him. Minato counters the blast with
Flying Thunder God: Guiding Thunder
 sending the blast behind Konoha, alerting the village of his presence. Minato is ambushed by Tobi, who tries to
send Minato away
. Using the
Flying Thunder God Technique
 Minato quickly escapes, but Tobi follows after him. Realising that Tobi's strength and knowledge is too abnormal, Minato questions if Tobi is truly
Madara Uchiha
, but states it is impossible, as Madara Uchiha is dead. Tobi speculates on the matter. Minato concludes that with a technique superior to his own and his ability to
control
 the Nine-Tails, Tobi is too dangerous to be left alive. The battle comes down to speed. They charge towards each other, Minato throwing a
Flying Thunder God Kunai
 only to have Tobi phase through it. He then forms a
Rasengan
. Tobi grabs Minato's shirt, thinking he has won, only to have Minato disappear and reappear over Tobi
striking
 him with the Rasengan.
