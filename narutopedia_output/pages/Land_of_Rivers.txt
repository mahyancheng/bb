The
Land of Rivers
 (
川の国
,
Kawa no Kuni
) is a country that borders between the
Land of Wind
 and the
Land of Fire
. It does not play any particular role in the story until
Pakkun
 discovers the first known
Akatsuki
 hideout in one of the country's caverns, where Akatsuki extracted
Shukaku
 from
Gaara
's body.
 The hideout was decimated shortly thereafter during a battle between
Sasori
,
Sakura
 and
Chiyo
, and subsequently abandoned.

In the anime, this country also holds the
Katabami Gold Mine
, village, and processing centre. There is an exclusive shop renowned as the
Curry of Life Shop
 where
Naruto
,
Neji
,
Tenten
, and
Rock Lee
 came to eat. The
Takumi Village
 and
Tanigakure
 also reside here. Sometime after the
Ōtsutsuki attack
, a team of researchers from this country was sent to investigate
Jūgo
 under the guise of looking into a recent spike in violent bird attacks.

Sometime after
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
's defeat, the country caught wind of
Kara
's scientist
Amado
 defecting to
Konohagakure
 and sent a group of shinobi to retrieve him during the village's
Chūnin Exams
 to either convince him with the promise of wealth or by force him to manufacture
Scientific Ninja Tools
 for them. They failed in their attempts after Amado turned down their offer and was rescued by
Boruto
 and
Mitsuki
.
