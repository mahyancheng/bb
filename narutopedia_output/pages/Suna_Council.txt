The
Suna
 Council
 (
砂ご意見番
,
Suna Go-Ikenban
,
literally meaning:
 Sand Honoured Opinion Watch) exists to help the
Kazekage
 govern the village and to make sure all decisions are made with the best interest of the village and its inhabitants in mind. The council seems to consist of 12 members, more commonly known as "Seniors". Their discussions occur in the
Kazekage's Office
, in the room where the statues of all the Kazekage reside.

Ebizō
 was the head of the council, until his ailing health led him to step down.
Tōjūrō
, another member of the council, tried to take the vacated head position while also plotting to overthrow the
Kazekage clan
 altogether. After Tōjūrō's insurrection was exposed, a great deal of the elders who were sympathisers and co-conspirators against the Kazekage clan, were finally exposed, arrested, and subsequently removed from the Council.
