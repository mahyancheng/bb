How the capital castle looks now.



The
Land of Neck
 (
首の国
,
Kubi no Kuni
) is featured in
episode 194
 of the anime.
Kōza Kubisaki
 was the
daimyō
 of this land 50 years prior to the start of the series. In the anime,
Naruto
,
Hinata
, and
Kiba
 are travelling close to the capital of this land, which was destroyed by an enemy army.

Kubisaki Pass

Kubisaki Pass
 (
首崎峠
,
Kubisaki Tōge
) is where Kōza's castle once stood. During the ending stages of a war, he summoned the
Shiromari
 as a last resort against his enemies, but died before he could release the summon. As a result, Shiromari took on the form of the castle, replacing the fortress that has been destroyed, and devouring anyone who approaches. Princess
Kayo
, on her way to visit the
Land of Bean Jam
, took shelter here from rain, but Shiromari attacked her delegation, thus leading to Naruto's group attempting to find her. With the help of Kōza's spirit, the three managed to destroy the summoning contract and free Shiromari, thus saving Kayo and her escort.

Trivia

"Kubisaki" can be written as 首裂き, which means "neck slitting". Naruto was particularly afraid due to the morbidity of the name.
