Yugito Nii
 (
二位ユギト
,
Nii Yugito
) was a
jōnin
 from
Kumogakure
 and the
jinchūriki
 of the Two-Tails,
Matatabi
.

Background

Yugito was made the Two-Tails' jinchūriki at the age of two and, at the end of a detestable training programme that was imposed on her, she was able to control her transformation into her
tailed beast
 at will.
 At some point in the anime, Yugito agreed to give
Nekobaa
 a paw print of the Two-Tails for the
Paw Encyclopaedia
.

Personality

Yugito gained confidence in herself through hard work, making her a courageous, proud and wise
kunoichi
. This was seen when she was able to trap
two

members
 of Akatsuki, along with herself, in a building, vowing that they'd never leave alive, going as far as setting off explosions.
 Also, it was said that she was firm, decisive, and thoughtful of her team-mates.

Appearance






Yugito's full appearance.



Yugito had long, straight, blonde (sometimes coloured closer to green
, hair bound with taut bandages, dark eyes and she wore red lipstick. She wore a short-sleeved black and purple blouse and black pants, both of which had a design similar to clouds on them, purple fingerless gloves and a chain of blue beads wound around her left hand. She also wore the standard Kumogakure
forehead protector
, sandals and a kunai holster, which was strapped to her right thigh. Yugito also wore bandages around her arms and legs as well as a red belt around her waist.

Abilities






A reincarnated Yugito.



Yugito was a highly-skilled and powerful kunoichi that even
Killer B
 looked up to, despite her being younger than him.
 She was a decent strategist, as she managed to lead two Akatsuki members into a trap which sealed the room, effectively cutting off any escape routes. After her reincarnation and serving as one of Tobi's
Six Paths of Pain
, Yugito was seen with both the
Sharingan
 and
Rinnegan
. Combining the perceptual and predictive abilities of the former with the shared field of vision ability of the latter allowed Yugito to use her attacks in a more precise and coordinated fashion as well as react to enemy attacks more efficiently, both individually and in conjunction and with the other jinchūriki.

Ninjutsu

Nature Transformation






Yugito's Mouse Hairball technique.



Yugito could use
Fire Release
 to shoot a flaming ball of hair, surrounded by fire, that turns into the
shape
 of a
mouse
 and then breaks up into several single hairs on fire that can pursue the target before exploding, once they come in contact with an object. When using the
Two-Tails
' power, she could create a
massive fireball
 that was powerful enough to destroy an entire building in a single shot.

Taijutsu






Yugito extending her nails.



For close-ranged combat, Yugito could make her
finger and toe nails grow
 to become long claws, with which, coupled with her natural
taijutsu
 skills, allowed Yugito to clash even with
sword
 users and
lunge at airborne opponents
. She has been shown as being quite skilled in taijutsu, attacking first with her clawed hands to force her enemies to block with both arms, and then attacking them with her clawed feet.

Jinchūriki Transformations

Main article:
Jinchūriki Forms






Yugito transformed into Matatabi.



Yugito had the ability to transform fully into the Two-Tails, giving her an upgrade in her abilities, such as strength and the ability to breathe fire. The way she transformed was very similar to Naruto's, being slowly covered in a dense, blue, fiery
chakra
 that took the form of the Two-Tails. While Yugito didn't have full control over the Two-Tails, she had complete control over the transformation and how much of its chakra that she would use. This control was precise enough that she was able to provide Matatabi's paw print for the Paw Encyclopaedia.
 Hidan commented before the battle that it would be hard to defeat her with the aid of her tailed beast. Upon her reincarnation, Yugito was able to
partially transform
 into the Two-Tails, manifesting one of its tails. When she was immobilised by B's
clone
, she quickly changed into her 'Version 2' form and attacked Naruto. She was able to swipe at her opponents with her
claws
 in this mode and when in full transformation, she could deliver a
solid hit
 with one of her paws.

Akatsuki Suppression Mission

The Two-Tails being extracted from Yugito.



She made her debut running through the sewers from unknown pursuers, who were later revealed to be
Hidan
 and
Kakuzu
. When she entered a large area where all the sewers seemed to meet, she finally stopped. After some bickering between the two
Akatsuki
 members, she revealed that she had intentionally led them there, and activated
explosive tags
 which were placed over the tunnels behind them, sealing them in. Knowing that they were from Akatsuki, she fully transformed into the Two-Tails and noted that she could not let them live. However, after a fierce battle that devastated the area, she was taken down by Hidan and brought to the Akatsuki lair by
Zetsu
 who had arrived later. The Two-Tails was later
extracted
 from her body, resulting in her death.

Yugito reincarnated, alongside the other jinchūriki.



In preparation for the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Yugito was reincarnated by
Kabuto Yakushi
 to fight against the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, before being mobilised alongside the other deceased jinchūriki. As dawn broke on the second day of the war, it was revealed that
Tobi
 had turned the reincarnated jinchūriki into his own customised
Six Paths of Pain
, with each having a Rinnegan and Sharingan in place of their left and right eyes respectively. Each jinchūriki also had their respective tailed beast resealed within them, and a
chakra receiver
 embedded into their body.

Yugito and Han attack B and Naruto.



Yugito with the other reincarnated jinchūriki later travelled together with Tobi in pursuit of
Naruto
 and
Killer B
. Encountering their targets, the reincarnated jinchūriki were sent into battle. With the enemy
blinded
 by
Fū
's technique, Yugito attacked them directly alongside
Han
, where she clashed with B and his
swords
. With her first attack being blocked by B, she
extended her toenails
 and attempted to kick him, only for B to evade the blow, noting that his sunglasses were too dark for him to be blinded. With the initial failed assault, she, like the others, unleashed the power of their respective
tailed beasts
 by materialising the first of its tails. Giving her opponents no time to retaliate, Yugito unleashed her own
technique
 immediately after
Rōshi
's attack, which forced Naruto and B to flee. Extending her fingernails once again, she pursued the pair and momentarily clashed with B.






Yugito attacking Naruto.



Although the injury began to regenerate instantly, the chakra receiver embedded in her chest was exposed long enough for B to take notice. Incapacitated in the wake of the
Eight-Tails
'
devastating attack
, after B's recent
transformation
, Yugito was then restrained by the latter's
sealing technique
. However, before the technique's completion, she managed to escape by adopting her
Version 2
 form, where she then proceeded to
slash
 at Naruto. Regrouping with the other reincarnated jinchūriki, after
Kakashi Hatake
 and
Might Guy
's intervention, Yugito charged past the pair towards Naruto. Rallying once again, she along with the other jinchūriki prepared to confront the two
Konohagakure

jōnin
, after Han's previous
attack
 was
thwarted
 by Kakashi.






Yugito alongside the other transformed jinchūriki.



After
Son Gokū
 was resealed into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, Yugito was forced to transform fully into the Two-Tails as Tobi prepared to go all-out. Unleashing a
Tailed Beast Ball
 alongside the others, the jinchūriki instead resorted to a direct assault when these attacks are deflected by Naruto, only to be repelled as the latter adopted his
Tailed Beast Mode
. In the resulting chaos, Yugito attempted to strike the Nine-Tails from behind, but found herself sent reeling after a collision with the
Six-Tails
. With this, the opposing beasts regrouped and prepared a collaborative Tailed Beast Ball, and launched it towards their opponents only to have it diverted by an opposing one.






Yugito, alongside the other jinchūriki and tailed beasts, encounters Naruto.



During his attempt to remove the opposing tailed beasts' chakra receivers in the ensuing blast, Naruto entered the joint consciousness of the tailed beasts, where he met Yugito along with the other jinchūriki and their respective beasts. During this encounter, she told Naruto of how Son Goku had predicted this event before later introducing herself to Naruto alongside her beast,
Matatabi
. After Matatabi was resealed into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, Yugito and the other jinchūriki's corpses were collected by B and held in Gyūki's tentacles. With the release of the Impure World Reincarnation, Yugito and the others were enveloped in a light of sorts before their bodies started to deconstruct and her soul returned to the afterlife.

Legacy

When Yugito was captured,
Kumogakure
 tried desperately to save her. Rescue teams were sent to investigate Akatsuki lairs, but because there were so many places to look they wasted time, and were unable to get to her before her death. Because of these "mistakes", Kumogakure knew what not to do when Killer B was apparently captured.
 B's and Yugito's captures by Akatsuki eventually prompted the
Fourth Raikage
 to convene a
Kage Summit
.

Trivia

Yugito's family name "Nii" means "second place" (
二位
).

Yugito is one of the handful of Kumogakure characters not to have a name either as a pronunciation of a letter or a name that describes her.

According to the databook(s):

Yugito's hobby was playing the
shamisen
.

Yugito's favourite foods were
tekkadon
 and milk, while her least favourites were anything spicy.

Yugito wished to fight any enemies of
Kumogakure
.

Yugito has completed 1,025 official missions in total: 190 D-rank, 185 C-rank, 356 B-rank, 260 A-rank, 34 S-rank.

Yugito's favourite phrase was "Cats have nine lives" (
猫に九生あり
,
Neko ni kyūshō ari
).

Her birth date corresponds to Leo the lion in the western zodiac, further referencing her feline attributes. Leo is also a "fire sign" as well.

Japanese folklore has a creature called a "nekomusume" (
猫娘
), a specific incarnation of
bakeneko
 which takes the form of a young girl.

In order to prevent the jinchūriki from turning traitor, it is tradition for the host to be selected from the family of the village's own Kage. Due to this fact, Yugito might be somehow connected with one of the
Raikage
.
