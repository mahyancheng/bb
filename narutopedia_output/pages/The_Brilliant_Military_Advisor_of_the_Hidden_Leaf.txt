,

Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

After
Mū
 is detected,
Kabuto
 uses him as a medium to summon the
Third Raikage
,
Second Mizukage
 and
Fourth Kazekage
 to the battlefield where the
Fourth Division
 is located and declares that he would let the
Kage
 kill their progeny with their personalities still intact. While the reincarnated Kage have a brief conversation, Gaara
locates
 them and prepares his division for battle. Meanwhile, at the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 headquarters, the
Sensor Division
 turn their attention to the
Land of Lightning
's coast and
Ao
 focuses on detecting the reincarnated shinobi amongst the
White Zetsu Army
 clones.

Sensing that there were too many powerful reincarnated shinobi for
Darui
's
division
 to manage alone, things escalate even further when
A
 realises that amongst them were
Kumogakure
's
Gold and Silver Brothers
. Declaring that he would have to enter the battle directly to deal with those two, A is dissuaded from this by
Shikaku Nara
 — the head strategist — who reformulates the Alliance's battle formation in a way that allows ample support for all the divisions. Greatly impressed by this, A commends
Tsunade
 before telling Shikaku to implement his strategy. Ōnoki however, interrupts, telling Shikaku that he was the only one who could defeat Mū because of the
kekkei tōta
 which they possessed. With this, Ōnoki prepares to mobilise, intending to show the younger generation what battling really meant.
