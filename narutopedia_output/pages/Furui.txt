 (
フルイ
) was an elite
shinobi
 from
Kumogakure
 and a member of the
Eight-Tails Subduing Team
.

Background






Furui impaled by the Eight-Tails' horn.



Thirty years before the start of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Furui was killed by the Eight-Tails during one of its scuffles, being impaled by one of its horns. His death strained the friendly relationship between his son
Motoi
 and
Killer B
 when the latter became the new
jinchūriki
 of the Eight-Tails.

Personality

In the anime where his personality is expounded on, Furui was shown to be a very brave individual who loved his village greatly rallying the rest of his teammates to continue restraining the beast, since if they gave up, Kumogakure would be destroyed.

Appearance

Furui was a man with dark spiky hair. He wore round glasses, the standard
Kumogakure

flak jacket
, a
forehead protector
, and shin guards. In all, Furui and his son bear great resemblance.

Abilities






Furui using Lightning Release.



Furui was skilled enough to have been selected by the
Third Raikage
 as part of a
special team
 that subdued the
former jinchūriki
 whenever it lost control of the beast and went on a rampage. Furui was seen using a chain with a weight on the end as his weapon to hold down the beast. The anime expands on his abilities, revealing that he could use
Lightning Release
 techniques with such skill that he was able to halt the beast's movements, thus allowing his teammates to move in and help subdue the beast.

Trivia

Furui can mean "ancient" or "trembling".
