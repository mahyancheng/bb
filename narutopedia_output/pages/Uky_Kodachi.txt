Ukyō Kodachi
 (
小太刀右京
,
Kodachi Ukyō
) is the former author of the monthly
Boruto
 manga series, illustrated by
Mikio Ikemoto
, and former story supervisor for its anime adaptation. Kodachi previously wrote
Gaara Hiden
, the
light novel
 adaptation of
Boruto: Naruto the Movie
, and collaborated with
Masashi Kishimoto
 - the creator of
Naruto
 - in writing the screenplay of said movie.

The son of a physician, Kodachi developed a strong interest in science and science fiction at a young age. As a student he became a dedicated player of
tabletop role-playing games
 such was
Shadowrun
 and
Tokyo NOVA
, and early in his career he wrote articles and
replays
 for various RPGs before becoming a game designer. Eventually he became a novelist, writing adaptations of various sci-fi anime and video games, as well as screenplays, notably for the
Macross
,
Gundam
, and
Code Geass
 series.

For his work on
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
, Kodachi draws inspiration from the science fiction RPGs he grew up with, as well as modern scientific research, hoping to create a setting that fuses a traditional ninja story with cutting edge technology.

In November 2020, Kodachi announced that he had stepped down as writer of the series, with Kishimoto taking over from chapter 52 onwards. He remarked that he was contracted to provide the story for the first 13 volumes, expressed gratitude to fans, and said he looked forward to supporting Boruto's continued journey as a reader.
