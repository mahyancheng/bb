This technique allows Sasuke to
channel
 the
Chidori
 through his
chokutō
. This makes it nearly unblockable as the radiating and chirping blade can easily cut through steel. Furthermore, if an opponent is stabbed, their body goes numb due to an electrical current which causes the muscles to contract, making it impossible for the opponent to move. However, it can be countered by other weapons that also utilise Lightning Release chakra flow, such as
Killer B
's
flowed

swords
.
