Mecha-Kurama
 (
メカ九喇嘛
,
Meka-Kurama
) was a
mechanised
 replica of
Kurama
 that appears in the anime-exclusive episodes and
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
.

Background

In the anime, Mecha-Kurama was created by
Orochimaru
 for the purpose of demolishing
Konohagakure
.

Appearance

Mecha-Kurama's main body looks like a robot version of a fox-like creature. It was considerably large and has nine tails made out of pure flames.

Abilities

Being made from the same material as
Mecha-Naruto
, Mecha-Kurama was invulnerable to all but the most
extreme
 attacks. It was able to fire
lasers
 from its eyes.

Part II

Akatsuki Suppression Mission






Mecha-Kurama attacking Konoha.



After Mecha-Naruto turns on
Orochimaru
, the latter summons Mecha-Kurama to
Konohagakure
 in order to enact the destruction of the village. Though the mechanical tailed beast manages to do a great deal of damage to the village, it is destroyed when Mecha-Naruto sacrifices itself by using all of the
Nine-Tails
 chakra within it in order to
destroy
 Mecha-Kurama.

In Other Media

Video Games

Although Mecha-Kurama itself is not playable, Mecha-Naruto takes on its form as his awakening in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
. In the game, Mecha Kurama is the destructive evil personality of
Mecha-Naruto
. Mecha-Kurama later makes another appearance as Mecha-Naruto's awakening in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
.

Trivia

Its appearance is heavily reminiscent of Mecha anime from the 1970s and 80s, particularly the
Mazinger
 series.

Much like
Mecha-Naruto
, Mecha-Kurama is a parody of MechaGodzilla from the
Godzilla
 franchise.

In the English and Japanese version, unlike Mecha-Naruto, which speaks in a nasal, robot voice, Mecha-Kurama speaks with Naruto's voice.
