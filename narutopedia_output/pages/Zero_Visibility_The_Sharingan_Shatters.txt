) is episode 15 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Sasuke
 and
Naruto
 prepare to retaliate against
Haku
, while
Sakura
 yells words of encouragement at them.
Kakashi
 discourages this, telling her that even if they have the instinct to win, they don't have the instinct to kill, which is the most important. He notes that he has no option but to stay put, or else
Tazuna
 would be slain. Kakashi goes to reveal his
Sharingan
 to
Zabuza
 once again, but he claims that using the same trick too many times will result in the enemy finding a way to counter it. Kakashi responds that he should consider himself lucky, as he’s the only man to see his Sharingan twice. Zabuza brags about training Haku to become a unique killing machine, whose jutsu even surpasses his own.

Inside the
Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals
, Naruto and Sasuke struggle against Haku's superior speed. After watching Haku counter
shadow clones
 repeatedly, Sasuke begins to see his movements. He uses
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
 as Haku is preoccupied with Naruto's clones, burning the side of his skirt and shocking the ninja, who's slowing down. Meanwhile, Zabuza informs Kakashi their last battle was a fluke, including him losing. Haku was watching the entire time from a tree, devising a lethal plan. Using his
Hiding in Mist Technique
 to negate the Sharingan, Zabuza says the next time Kakashi sees him will be his last time seeing anything. Vanishing, Kakashi is left anticipating his opponent's next move. He finally realises that Zabuza will strike at Tazuna and Sakura, rushing to intercept the attack. Sakura screams in the dense fog.
