"
Drive Towards Darkness
" (
闇への疾走
,
Yami e no Shissō
) is episode 196 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

On the way to
Konoha
,
Taka
 briefly stop at a place which
Sasuke
 remembers from his past. Recalling how
Naruto

summoned

Gamabunta
 during his
fight
 with
Gaara
, Sasuke was frustrated at Naruto's spike in strength. After destroying a tree with his
Chidori
, he noticed a small girl named
Naho
 who was about to fall off a cliff towards her death and promptly saved her. Because Sasuke did not know that she was a relative of the
Fire Daimyō
, he did not treat her with the respect she was used to, causing her to become infatuated with him.

Naho was later sent to Konoha where she would be protected. Due to growing tensions in the rivalry between Naruto and Sasuke,
Tsunade
 appointed Naruto and
Sakura
 as her bodyguards while Sasuke and
Kakashi
 were on a mission of their own, to allow the rivals to cool off. Because Naho explicitly wanted Sasuke, Naruto used the
Transformation Technique
 to disguise himself as Sasuke. The trio were soon ambushed by a bandit named
Sadai
, who wanted to kidnap Naho for money. Using his
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
, Naruto attempted to dazzle Naho by using his "Sasuke Punch" and "Sasuke Kick" to take out the bandits and tried to defeat Sadai with his
Naruto Uzumaki Combo
, which he refined into the
Lion Combo
 since he was impersonating Sasuke. However, Sadai was unfazed by the attack, prompting Naruto to strike him with
Rasengan
, only to be shocked that it did not work as well.

Meanwhile, Sasuke and Kakashi, whose mission was to apprehend wanted criminals in the
Land of Fire
, discovered that the criminals were planning to kidnap a girl named Naho, whom Sasuke recognised. As Sadai defeated Naruto, the transformation technique dispelled and Naho was shocked to see that it was not Sasuke. As she cried for Sasuke, the latter arrived. Sadai noticed his
Sharingan
 and mused how he had met
Itachi
 and how he had thought that Itachi had
killed
 the entire
Uchiha clan
, and theorised that Sasuke must not have been worth killing. Incensed due to the fact that Itachi had said those same words, Sasuke destroyed Sadai's
armour
 with his
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
 and struck him in mid-air with his Chidori. As Naho watched in horror, Sasuke began to beat the man to inches of his life, with Sadai's blood splattered on Sasuke's face. Sadai was saved by the arrival of Kakashi, and Sasuke decided to return to Konoha. Naho became scared of Sasuke; however, she was comforted by Naruto, who told her that Sasuke was going through some problems and that he was usually a nice guy, and that he would take her to meet him once he calmed down.

Trivia

When
Sakura
 recalls when
Sasuke
 told her that
Naruto
 was the one who saved her from
Gaara
,
Naruto
 and
Kakashi
 are seen holding one another and marching happily through the street. However, in the
original episode
, Sasuke revealed the truth to Sakura at a training ground, where Naruto was trying in vain to convince Kakashi to teach him the
Chidori
.

During his fight with
Sadai
, Sasuke is seen with a three-tomoe
Sharingan
. However, he did not activate the third tomoe until his
fight
 with Naruto at the
Valley of the End
.
