By converting her
chakra
 into paper,
Konan
 transforms her body (and clothing) into numerous sheets of paper; the initial creation and dispersal of the paper can mesmerise opponents.
 Konan then controls and shapes the paper into various things, such as spears for attack,

origami
 butterflies for spying,
 and
clones
 for supplementary purposes.
 She can create paper wings on her back to fly (though she can hover without them) and use them to
shoot paper in rapid succession
.
 She can also wrap her target in paper, restricting their movements and asphyxiating them.

Konan's paper is affected in similar ways as normal paper:
fire
 will burn it
 and
oil
 will cause it to stick together, preventing her from manipulating it.

Pain
 is at one point shown ending the rains of
Amegakure
 so that she can use her paper more freely,
 but she is later seen using her paper despite the rain.

Trivia

Shikigami
, when written as 式神, refers to a kind of spirit summoned to serve an
onmyōji
, a kind of sorcerer. These spirits are often depicted as changing into small pieces of paper once harmed or finished with their task. In the name of this technique, the kanji for "god" (
神
,
kami
) has been replaced with the kanji for "paper" (
紙
,
kami
), which is pronounced the same. This is likely done to emphasise the paper nature of Konan's shikigami and to point out the subtle difference between them and traditional shikigami.

Her ability to make wings out of paper mirrors her title as "
God
's Angel" in
Amegakure
.
