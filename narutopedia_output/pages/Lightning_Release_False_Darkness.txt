The user emits lightning  in the shape of a spear from its mouth, which then pierces the enemy. Its destructive power is great enough to even pierce through rock, meaning it has a high killing potential. The user can increase the number of spears to attack multiple enemies. This, coupled with the sheer speed of the lightning, makes it a difficult technique to evade. This technique is capable of being focused into a straight beam, similar to a laser. Kakuzu is able to use this through his
lightning-element mask
.

Trivia

Like the rest of Kakuzu's techniques, the name of this technique comes from the legendary mecha anime
Mobile Suit Gundam
 (
機動戦士ガンダム
,
Kidō Senshi Gandamu
). The name Gian was taken from the
YMS-15

Gyan
 (
ギャン
,
Gyan
). The name was altered slightly and given kanji to create the name of this technique.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2
, Kakuzu uses what looks like the tiger seal to activate this technique, which can be seen in the Boss fight of
Naruto
 and Kakuzu.
