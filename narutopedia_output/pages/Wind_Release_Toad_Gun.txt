The
Wind Release: Toad Gun
 is a two-way
cooperation ninjutsu
 between Naruto and Gamatatsu. It is a
wind
-infused version of the
Water Release: Water Gun
 technique.

To set up for this technique, Naruto stands behind or atop Gamatatsu, moulding his wind chakra, while Gamatatsu moulds his own chakra and keeps water in his mouth. When ready, Naruto signals Gamatatsu to
exhale all of the water
 through his mouth, combined with the wind chakra that Naruto channelled into Gamatatsu.

This technique creates a powerful and fast stream of water, which eventually spreads to cover a much larger area, but maintaining a powerful striking force due to the wind chakra. The attack was strong enough to break through
Guren
's
Crystal Release: Jade Crystal Labyrinth Technique
, which was suggested to be powerful enough to withstand the
Rasengan
.
