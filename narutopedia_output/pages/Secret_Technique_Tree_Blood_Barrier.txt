The user manifests threads made of their own blood to encase the area around them. Anyone stained by the blood will instantly have their body and its actions controlled by the user. The threads are relatively easy to damage, but can regenerate. At the same time, there is only a certain amount of damage they can regenerate from. Their control is also not absolute, as it can be overpowered by other jutsu that control the target's actions. Alternatively, the threads can also be used to
control
 weapons from afar.
