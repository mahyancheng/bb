.

The
Hagoromo Clan
 (
羽衣一族
,
Hagoromo Ichizoku
) is one of the earlier clans which existed during the
war-torn era
 preceding the creation of the
hidden villages
. While not a great deal is known about them, they were one of the warring factions alongside the
Uchiha clan
 to oppose the
Senju clan
 in battle — an alliance that led to
Kawarama Senju
's death, amongst many of his clansmen.
 During their initial meeting with one another by a riverside,
Hashirama Senju
 and
Madara Uchiha
 discovered the body of a member of this clan, face-down in the river.

Trivia

The word "Hagoromo" (
羽衣
) literally means "angel's raiment" or with regards to birds, refers to their wings, or plumage.
