This article is about the technique that utilises wind and fire. For fire release technique, see
Toad Oil Flame Bullet
.

This is a three-way synchronised cooperation ninjutsu between Naruto, Gamatatsu, and Gamakichi. It is an expansion of the
Wind Release: Toad Oil Bullet
 technique. After Naruto enhances Gamatatsu's
Toad Oil Bullet
 with his wind-natured chakra, Gamakichi steps in and uses his
Fire Release: Flame Bullet
 technique to ignite the oil. The wind not only improves the oil's coverage and distance, but also adds power to the flame. Using this technique they were able to knock out the
Three-Tails
.
