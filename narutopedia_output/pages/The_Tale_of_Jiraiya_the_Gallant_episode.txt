"
The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant
" (
自来也豪傑物語
,
Jiraiya Gōketsu Monogatari
) is episode 133 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Jiraiya
 notices that
one of the Paths
 looks just like
Yahiko
, and wonders if
Pain
 is Yahiko or Nagato and why there are six
Rinnegan
 wielders; Pain, however, merely states that they are the
Six Paths of Pain
 and attempt to finish off Jiraiya. Using his
Barrier: Toad Gourd Prison
 technique, Jiraiya is able to trap the
Animal Path
 and strike it with his
Rasengan
, knocking it into gastric acid. Before the Path dies, it manages to stab Jiraiya through the arm and chest. As the Path's
forehead protector
 falls off, Jiraiya notices a scar and realises it is a man he fought once before. Wanting to discover more about Pain, Jiraiya attempts to dismiss the
Two Great Sage Toads
, telling them to take the Animal Path's corpse to
Tsunade
. Not wanting to leave him alone,
Shima
 agrees to do it alone while
Fukasaku
 stays with Jiraiya.

As Jiraiya reaches the surface, he takes a good look at all of the Paths' faces and recognises that he has met every single one of them before. He deduces Pain's identity, but before he can tell Fukasaku, one of the Paths crushes his throat and the six Paths proceed to impale him through the back. With his throat crushed and his heart beginning to fail, Jiraiya comes to the realisation that he is dying. He recalls his life, including being rejected by Tsunade, failing to redeem Orochimaru and how he won't die a glorious death like the
Third
 and
Fourth Hokages
. In his last moments, he reminisces fondly on memories of Minato and his wife
Kushina
 and how they had asked Jiraiya to be
Naruto
's godfather and if they could name Naruto after the protagonist of Jiraiya's
novel
 as Minato liked the character, who never gave up. Remembering that Naruto would never gave up as it was his
ninja way
, and would keep fighting for as long as possible Jiraiya states that as his master, he cannot give up either. Managing to stay alive with his sheer force of will, Jiraiya uses his
Finger Carving Seal
 to write a coded message about Pain's true identity on Fukasaku's back. The Six Paths of Pain attack the duo, but Fukasaku escapes as Jiraiya drowns. As he passes away, he remarks that Naruto is the true
Child of the Prophecy
 and how the sequel to his novel would be titled "The Tale of Naruto Uzumaki".

In
Konoha
, Tsunade sits on a ledge watching a river, noticing a frog. Naruto, who is running through the woods, suddenly stops when he feels Jiraiya's arm on his shoulder, unaware that a light is shining on him from up above.

Trivia

The episode's name is most likely based off on the Japanese folktale
Jiraiya Goketsu Monogatari
; Jiraiya references the story before his death.
