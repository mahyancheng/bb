Kakashi
,
Shino
 and
Yamato
 find themselves in combat against
Team Guren
;
Kihō
 uses his
Wrist Launcher
 to send a
Smoke Dragon
 towards Yamato, but the latter counters with his
Water Release: Water Bowl
 technique, which riddles the smoke with too much moisture, leaving Kihō unable to control it. Yamato then uses his
Wood Release: Great Forest Technique
 to finish Kihō off. Kakashi is faced by
Kigiri
, who uses his
Exploding Flame Shot
 to ignite Kakashi and then bind him with his
Binding Smoke Prison
. Believing Kakashi to be done for, he dispels all of his
smoke clones
, only for the Kakashi he trapped to be none other than a
shadow clone
 while the real Kakashi strikes him from behind with his
Lightning Cutter
. In the meantime, using advice given by
Hinata
, Shino is able to ascertain
Nurari
's weakness and seemingly kills him. With Team Guren dealt with, the three
shinobi
 are joined by
Lee
,
Tenten
.
Sai
 and
Kiba
; they decide to protect the sealing team. find
Naruto
, and save
Yūkimaru
, unaware that Nurari's body is beginning to take over the bodies of Kihō and Kigiri.

Meanwhile, Naruto and
Guren
 head towards Yūkimaru when Guren stops to ponder whether Yūkimaru would ever forgive her. Naruto tells her that even if Yūkimaru despises her, she must be there for him and protect him, which she agrees with. On the clifftop, Yūkimaru runs out of chakra and is unable to control the Three-Tails, prompting
Rinji
 to attempt to inject him with
Orochimaru's Juinjutsu
 to grant him the chakra needed. His attempt is blocked by Guren and Naruto, who arrive in time to save Yūkimaru. Faced with no other choice, Rinji tells Yūkimaru that Guren was the one who killed his mother and took away his home and that he should have his revenge by using the Three-Tails to kill her and destroy
Konoha
. However, Yūkimaru tells Guren that he forgives her and that he loves her; Guren responds that she loves him too and that she will always be with him, thankful that he has chosen to forgive her. Naruto then proceeds to punch Rinji in the face, only for Rinji's face to tear. "Rinji" then
peels his face
 off, revealing himself to be none other than
Kabuto
, who warns Naruto that he would kill him if he does not stop interfering.
