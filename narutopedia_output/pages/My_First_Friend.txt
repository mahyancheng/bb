"
My First Friend
" (
最初の友
,
Saisho no Tomo
) is episode 388 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

As
Naruto
 executes his
finishing blow
,
Hashirama
 uses his
Wood Dragon
 to immobilise
Madara
, which also drains his
chakra
 at the same time. With Naruto throwing his attack, the
Shinobi Alliance
 march towards Madara's location.
Sai
 then arrives and
escorts
 Naruto. Meanwhile,
Gaara
 asks
Shukaku
 for its aid. Although initially refusing, Shukaku decides to join the battle, but only to prove its superiority over
Kurama
, and denies that it is agreeing to Gaara's request.
 As the
sand
-manipulating duo prepare to head out,
Son Gokū
 notes that the
tailed beasts
 will also join in before questioning the young
Kazekage
 if he is a friend of Naruto. Gaara then recalls his painful childhood as a
jinchūriki
, how the villagers shunned him, and how this all changed after his meeting with Naruto. Responding to the Four-Tails, Gaara says Naruto is his first friend. He then leads the way as all of the tailed beasts prepare to join the battle.
