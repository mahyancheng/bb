The Six Paths of Pain simultaneously punch the opponent, then
Asura Path
 throws them in the air and the other Paths impale them with their
black receivers
.

Trivia

In the anime and manga, a similar method to this was used, but instead of the Asura Path throwing the opponent into the air, it sends the opponent high into the air by grabbing onto their neck as it flies into the air using its jet boosters, before all the paths come down to impale the opponent.
