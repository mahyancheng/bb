Kankurō has
Karasu
 sprout many poison-covered blades on his arms and mouth and sends them spinning towards the opponent like a tornado, slashing them several times. After launching the opponent into the air, Karasu explodes near them. Karasu is unharmed by this explosion.

Trivia

In the English version, the blade in Karasu's mouth is removed, making it appear pointlessly opened.
