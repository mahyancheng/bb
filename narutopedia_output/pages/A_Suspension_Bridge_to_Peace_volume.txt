Author's Note

“

The other night, during a bad rain storm, I happened to peer out the window. "Look at all that rain...
What
...?!!" It wasn't just the rain! Rainwater had started accumulating on my veranda, forming a pool of water! The drain had gotten clogged, and it created a scene similar to the one in
Ponyo
! I was afraid for the first time in a while...
