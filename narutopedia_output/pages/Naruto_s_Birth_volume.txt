chakra
 when she restrains it with her

 met, to which she bashfully tells him. After telling her story, Kushina tells Naruto that she loves him, much to his surprise then happiness, and when she playfully asks Naruto what is the product of the "Yellow Flash" and the "Red Hot-Blooded Habanero", he proudly responds that he is "

control
 the Nine-Tails, Tobi is too dangerous to be left alive. The battle comes down to speed. They charge towards each other, Minato throwing a
