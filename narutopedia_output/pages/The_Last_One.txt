"
The Last One
" (
最後の一人
,
Saigo no Hitori
) is episode 488 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Chino
 confirms to
Sasuke
 she intended to use the exploding humans to attack him and
Konoha
 in vengeance against the
Uchiha
 for driving her clan to the Valley of Hell, but ended up meeting him in the
Bamboo Village
. Her plans changed after
Iō
 last words put Sasuke on
Fūshin
's track. Chino explains the
Chinoike clan
's jutsu uses blood, and that with the high iron content of the lake in the Valley of Hell, she'll be even more powerful. She uses her blood and the lake to create a multi-headed blood dragon, but Sasuke quickly decapitates all of its heads with his electrified sword.

Chino manages to wound Sasuke, and as his wound closes, she uses the
Ketsuryūgan
 to show him himself turning into an exploding human. Sasuke asks her if that's how she creates them, and Chino realises she's under the
Sharingan
's genjutsu, Sasuke standing on her blood dragon, which collapses. Chino envied Sasuke because he always had someone to love him, while she was alone from the start, which reminds Sasuke of
Naruto
 and
Sakura
. Chino asks Sasuke why he still fights for Konoha, and he tells her about Naruto. Chino isn't convinced the world they want to bring about can be a reality, and tells Sasuke to kill her. Fūshin arrives, in bad shape, and tells Sasuke he'll have to kill him to get to Chino. Sasuke tells Chino his words to her should make sense now. Chino asks Fūshin not to fight, as she couldn't bear losing him. Chino wishes she hadn't met him in the Bamboo Village, so she could still hate him, and wishes to see the world Sasuke spoke of.

In Konoha, guided by
Hinata
's
Byakugan
, Sakura finishes extracting the foreign chakra infecting the exploding humans. They talk about the apprehension of the perpetrators, and how Sasuke wasn't there when they thought he would be. In prison,
Kakashi
 meets Chino, Fūshin and
Karyū
, and Chino claims responsibility for the incident. Kakashi tells them the
Mizukage
 wants to take custody of them.
Mei
 arrives with
Chōjūrō
, and aware of their past connection with the village, wants them to help
Kirigakure
, as a form of atonement.

At the Coliseum, Sasuke challenges all the shinobi, to earn them all their freedom. Chino is concerned about him fighting so many shinobi with kekkei genkai, but Naruto assures her Sasuke will win. After defeating all the shinobi,
Futsu
 asks Sasuke what will happen to them. He says
Kumogakure
 will take them in. The
Raikage
 arrives with
C
,
Darui
, and several other shinobi. As the island of the Coliseum is nearest to Kumogakure, Kakashi argued with the Raikage they're his responsibility, as well as arresting all the Coliseum's patrons.
A
 tells Sasuke about the time Naruto begged him not to kill him, and how he's glad he didn't.

En Oyashiro
 meets up with
Orochimaru
, having escaped arrest. They discuss the Chinoike clan, En Oyashiro revealing himself to have the Ketsuryūgan, to be Chino's father, and to have killed the clan. Seeing how Chino's time in the Coliseum was harming her, he coordinated with Orochimaru to use Sasuke to stop her.

Naruto and Sakura discuss Sasuke. Sasuke receives a message from Naruto by hawk, where Naruto says Sasuke protecting the village is like he's from the Konoha Police Force, which sparks in Sasuke a memory from talking with
Itachi
 about wanting to join. Sasuke thinks maybe it's time to visit Konoha.
