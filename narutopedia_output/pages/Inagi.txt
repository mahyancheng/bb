Background






Babu and Inagi kills Iwato.



Inagi and
his comrades
 were on a mission to deliver a scroll of secret data while being guarded by
Team Minato
. While crossing the forest, they were attacked by their opponents, causing Team Minato to split up, leaving
Rin Nohara
 and
Kakashi Hatake
 with the Yugakure shinobi. They take them to the bridge, but
Shinbu
 was injured and fell off the cliff. Switching sides, Inagi and
Babu
 revealed that they were traitors and mortally wounded
Iwato
 by attacking him from behind. They then attacked Kakashi, who defended himself with an earthen wall, and then counterattacked, injuring Babu with
his blade
. Inagi picked up an injured comrade and they leave.

Iwato revealed that he knew about the traitors among their group, but he didn't know who they were. Therefore, they had two scrolls to deceive the traitor. The second scroll was held by the Shinbu, followed by Inagi, Babu and the rest of their allies. Iwato died, and
Obito Uchiha
 began the pursuit of the traitors, the rest of the team joining him. After some time, Obito and Rin found Shinbu, but at the same time, Babu and Inagi found him, attacking their former comrade. Obito saved him, and Kakashi joined the attackers in battle. They began to overwhelm Kakashi with numbers, despite the fact that he was able to hurt Inagi, but at that time
Minato Namikaze
 arrived and killed all the opponents.
