This technique was invented by
Hiruzen Sarutobi
, demonstrating his title as the "Professor" with its conceptualisation and efficiency. After throwing a single
shuriken
, the user duplicates it with their
chakra
, in the same way that the
Shadow Clone Technique
 makes copies of the user; creating shadow clones is already difficult on its own, but specifically duplicating inanimate objects is even more difficult. In an instant, the thousand copied shuriken spread throughout the area, surrounding the target. Because the shuriken are physically real, the target is attacked from every direction, which they have almost no chance of completely avoiding.

In the manga, the duplicated shuriken simply appear out of thin air. In some anime depictions, the shuriken's creation is marked by a puff of smoke, just as happens when normal shadow clones are created.

Trivia

Watari Ninja
 - masquerading as the

In the anime, a young
Jiraiya
 attempted to perform this technique. Calling it the "Shuriken Whatever Technique", he simply threw a bunch of shuriken after the first one.

Naruto Uzumaki
 uses the Shadow Clone Technique's
hand seal
 to perform the technique.

In
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower
,
Minato
 uses this technique to duplicate his
Flying Thunder God Kunai
.
