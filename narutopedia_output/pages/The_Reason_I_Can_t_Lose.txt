" (

Makerarenai Riyū
) is episode 57 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Boruto
 struggles with his
shurikenjutsu
 training, and complains to
Sasuke
 that it's
Sarada
's specialty, as an
Uchiha
. Sasuke counters by creating several shadow clones, stating that by his logic, that should be his specialty. Boruto creates his maximum number of clones, which is only four.
Gaara
 meets up with Sasuke and
Chōjūrō
 and recounts how he was attacked by
Urashiki
 on the train to Konoha. Sasuke posits it was an Ōtsutsuki clansman, and suggests postponing the exams. Chōjūrō and Gaara are against it, pointing out the consequences and political instability that would follow.
Tenten
 oversees the second part of the exam, a three on three battle over capturing another team's flag.

Team Moegi
 makes short work of their Kiri opponents.
Team Yurui
 gets
Team 15
's flag right under their noses.
Team Udon
 loses to
Team Shinki
. Sarada and
Mitsuki
 go grab the Senka brothers' flag, while all three go at Boruto. Boruto tries using clones to outnumber them, but they use their own clones to outnumber him. Mitsuki turns back to help Boruto. When the brothers are almost getting the flag, Boruto employs the
Kote
 to overpower them with high calibre
Water Release
 and
Lightning Release
 jutsu. Sarada dispels the
genjutsu
 around the triplets' flags and grabs the real one.
Kōsuke
 reports to
Katasuke
 they have recorded Boruto's use of the Kote.
Shikamaru
 informs
Naruto
 both their sons made it to the next round. The Konoha genin all join and wish Teams Konohamaru and Moegi good luck for the rest of the exam. Naruto and Sasuke meet about the scroll's decryption. While there, Naruto informs Sasuke that his daughter passed, a fact that doesn't surprise him. Naruto congratulates Boruto in person, who appreciates it despite not wanting to show it.
