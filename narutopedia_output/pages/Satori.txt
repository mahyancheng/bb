Satori
 (
サトリ
) is a demonic, bird-like creature that appears in
Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison
.

Background






Satori unleashed into the world in the past.



According to
Gamabunta
, the
Box of Ultimate Bliss
 "brings forth", "actuates", and "ends" with Satori. Beyond that, like the Box, Satori's history is overall a mystery. Little is known about Satori except that it has been around since the time of the
Sage of the Six Paths
 and that Satori is merely a puppet of the Box. A person who enters the box and comes back out will become the host of Satori, gaining the demon's powers while having their mind corrupted, and Satori will proceed to throw victims into the box.

Appearance

The beast is large, similar in size to Gamabunta and the
Eight-Tails
, with large wings. It is headless, with bones potruding from the mouth on its chest and is covered in black feathers. It also has a long thin tail, and its hands and feet are clawed and sickly thin to the point where it looks almost bone-like with skin attached.

Abilities






Satori launching a giant sphere.



It can
shoot its feathers
 and
giant spheres
 at high speeds which have powerful piercing and explosive power, respectively. Despite its large size, it is a deceptively fast and agile flyer. Due to the Box of Ultimate Bliss, its body can detect fear and
blood lust
, which causes it to instinctively dodge essentially all attacks from opponents who have any fear in them or who desire to kill him. This ability, combined with its surprisingly agile reflexes, allowed it to dodge all of the attacks from the entirety of the
Konoha 11
 and
Naruto Uzumaki
, even while he was in
Sage Mode
.

Plot Overview






Muku transformed into Satori.



After
Mui
 asked the box to release his son
Muku
, the boy walked out of the box and struck down his father. When
Ryūzetsu
, Muku's childhood friend, made herself known after Mui was struck down, Muku became conflicted and transformed into Satori. After transforming into the beast, he began attacking the prison, throwing inmates and the four
Hōzuki Castle
 council members into the box, which led to his confrontation and battle with Naruto and his allies.






Satori fatally injures Naruto and Ryūzetsu.



Eventually, Satori impaled Naruto and Ryūzetsu through their abdomen with his claw, to which they used to their advantage to prevent Satori from evading attacks and pin him down, allowing Mui to use the
Fire Release: Great Fire Heavenly Prison
 to further restrain Satori, leaving him open to Naruto's
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
. Seemingly returning to normal, Muku was once again taken over by Satori, killing Mui. Muku then used the
Fire Release: Demon Lantern
 to trigger the Heavenly Prison seal on his own body, killing himself and sending Satori back into the box. The box, with Satori contained, was then cast into the whirlpools outside the Hōzuki Castle, where it will never be opened again.

Trivia

Satori
 comes from a Japanese Buddhist term for enlightenment, meaning "understanding" and is based upon the
yōkai
 of Japanese folklore.

Satori bears a strong resemblance to the
H.P. Lovecraft
 creatures called "
Nightgaunts
".
