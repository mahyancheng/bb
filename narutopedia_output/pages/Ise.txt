Ise
 (
伊勢
) was a doctor and a citizen of
Amegakure
, where he lived in a small village with his
son
 and
wife
.

Background






Ise's death during the Second Shinobi World War.



During the
Second Shinobi World War
, Ise and his wife
Fusō
 were providing humanitarian aid. One night during the war, Ise and his family were hiding in their battle-damaged house when
Konoha
 ninja broke in looking for food. Ise and his family tried to sneak away but when they were detected. Ise fought the ninja to give Nagato a chance to escape, but the Konoha ninja, assuming the couple were enemy ninja, attacked and quickly killed first Fusō and then the devastated Ise.

Witnessing this, Nagato unknowingly awakened his
Rinnegan
, and he subsequently killed the two Konoha-nin. Nagato buried his parents before leaving to search for food. The death of his parents is the first great tragedy of his life, and in his eyes evidence that the peace Konoha preaches comes at the cost of others' lives.

Personality

As a doctor and a person willing to give aid in times of war, Ise was a very compassionate individual. Also, he loved his son very much, sacrificing his own life to allow Nagato to escape.

Appearance

Ise had short, black hair and wore a plain dark-beige shirt alongside black pants and sandals. Under his pants, he wore white bandages.

Trivia

"Ise" (
伊勢
) is the name of a Japanese
province
,
city
 and
bay
. Like Fusō, Ise also shares his name with a
Japanese battleship
.

Based on
Obito
's words, at least one of Nagato's parents is descended from the
Uzumaki clan
.
 A common trait of the clan is red hair. While it is unknown if either of Nagato's parents has red hair in the manga, in the anime, the hair of Ise's wife Fusō was red.

Based on
Black Zetsu
's words about Nagato being of the
Senju
 lineage, it's possible his father was a Senju descendent since his mother had red hair and was more likely to be of Uzumaki lineage.
