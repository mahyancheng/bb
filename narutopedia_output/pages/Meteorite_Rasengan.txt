While controlling the body of
Boruto Uzumaki
,
Momoshiki
 cloaks himself in an aura of deep blue chakra and flies high into the sky, momentarily vanishing from view. He then arcs back down and dives toward his opponent at high speed while forming a
Rasengan
 in his right palm, striking them with it at the moment of impact. His glittering blue chakra causes the attack to resemble a falling star.

Trivia

This jutsu originally appeared without a name in the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime in an extended piece of fight choreography created to heighten the final clash between Momoshiki and
Kawaki
; in the original manga, Momoshiki merely springs off the ground and flies straight at Kawaki while preparing his Rasengan.

The attack was later adapted into a distinct, named jutsu in
Naruto Mobile
, with Momoshiki diving straight down to strike his foe.
