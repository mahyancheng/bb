Ryūchi Cave
 (
龍地洞
,
Ryūchidō
,
literally meaning:
 Dragon Ground Cave) is one of the big three unexplored
sage
 regions, a legendary place that is equally famous as the other two,
Mount Myōboku
 and
Shikkotsu Forest
.
 It is the residence of the
snakes
 — including the sacred
White Snake Sage
 — and is also where
Orochimaru
 uncovered the source of
Jūgo
's
clan's
 abilities. Orochimaru and
Kabuto Yakushi
 trained here to achieve
Sage Mode
, though only the latter was successful in this endeavour.

Overview

In the anime, journey to Ryūchi Cave takes only a couple days from Konohagakure. While many travellers may venture close to it unknowingly, the snakes of Ryūchi Cave take precautions so that only those who are deliberately trying to visit it can arrive at it. In their experience, only those willing to sacrifice anything in their greed for power come to Ryūchi Cave. In order to be granted audience to learn
senjutsu
 with the White Snake Sage, one must pass three trials posed by the snakes. According to the rules, if a candidate fails at any of the trials, the snakes are allowed to devour them and consume their chakra.
 At least one section of the cave is made of limestone, and despite nominally being a cave, its territories also include wetlands.
