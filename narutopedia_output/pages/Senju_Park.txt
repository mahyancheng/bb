The Senju Park.



Senju Park
 (
千手公園
,
Senju Kōen
) is a large forest area in
Konohagakure
, that is associated with the
Senju clan
. It contains a giant tree which is surrounded by a pond and a playground which was damaged when a man
went on a rampage
, leading to the area becoming an investigation scene. A second attack occurred in the following days which damaged the park further. Later on, when
Nue
 was summoned, much of the park's landscape was decimated in its fight against Konoha shinobi. After the incident, the park was repaired.
