"
Sasuke's Rinnegan…!!
" (
サスケの輪廻眼…!!
,
Sasuke no Rinnegan…!!
) is chapter 674 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Never one to be outdone,
Madara
 launches his
counter-attack
 on
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
, which the former is able to
deflect
 while the latter
evades
 it entirely. Madara soon realises that they have worked out the mechanisms behind his
Limbo: Border Jail
 technique and quickly moves to reformulate his strategy. Taking the lead, Sasuke calls for Naruto to use
Hagoromo
's power in his next technique to bind Madara. Though reluctant to take orders from his rival and friend, Naruto readies himself to attack once more.
 As Madara contemplated how similar he and Sasuke are, wondering if there was
a connection beyond familial ties
, and lamenting the fact that he could have used the young man had he been born before
Obito
, his opponents prepare their attack. With Naruto forming the
Sage Art: Magnet Release Rasengan
 using
Shukaku
's chakra which also carried the added benefit of a
juinjutsu
, he and Sasuke — who had formed a
Chidori
 infused with the
Six Paths
 Power — land a simultaneous attack on Madara only to find out that it was the projection from his Limbo technique. Naruto urges Sasuke to stop Madara from reaching his destination, but the young man is too late as Madara rips
Kakashi
's
Sharingan
 from his eye socket and sticks it into his own. Meanwhile, in the
other dimension
, Obito asks
Sakura
 to destroy the
Rinnegan
 as he could no longer suppress
Black Zetsu
. Before she can, however, Madara uses
Kamui
 to warp into the dimension just as Sasuke
cuts
 him in half in the real world and throws a staff at Sakura declaring that he would not allow them to destroy his eye.

Trivia

Flying Thunder God Kunai
 disappear. However, this was corrected in the tankōbon version.

In two panels, the
tomoe
 in Sasuke's Rinnegan are missing. This was not corrected in the tankōbon version.

In one panel, Naruto is depicted with eleven
Truth-Seeking Balls
. This was not corrected in the tankōbon version.
