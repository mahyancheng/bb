After Utakata blows dozens of bubbles, they make their way towards opponents. Upon popping, they create bright yellow and white flashes along with variably strong
explosions
 that knock back the enemy and everything nearby. The explosions also produce a large amount of smoke, which can be used to obstruct the opponent's vision. It differs from the
Soap Bubble Ninjutsu
 technique in that this ability does not require Utakata's will to explode.
