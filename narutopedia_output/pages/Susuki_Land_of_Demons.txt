Susuki
 (

,
Susuki
) was one of
Shion
's bodyguards.

Personality

Susuki was highly devoted and loyal to Shion, as he forced himself to stay awake for three days for guard duty, and only went to rest when ordered to. As with the many guards, he was willing to give his life for the priestess' sake, despite being forewarned of his impending death, and even jumped in front of a barrage of projectiles to protect Shion.

Appearance

Susuki was a stocky man with a wide face, beady eyes, and neck-length brown hair that thickly covers his ears. He wore the typical Japanese attire of Shion's guards, which consists of a green vest over a white shirt, with purple hakama, sandals and a tall hat. Along with the attire is a quiver strapped to his back.

Abilities

Susuki wielded the typical weapons of Shion's guards: a
jian
, a bow, and a quiver of arrows. It can be presumed that he was very capable of using these in battle.

Plot Overview

Susuki first appeared when he dozed off while guarding, due to not sleeping for three days.
Taruho
 appeared and told him to take a rest, to which Susuki refused, but Taruho claimed it was an order since Susuki was deprived of sleep. Susuki understood and left Taruho on guard.

When the
Gang of Four
 showed up and were after Shion, Susuki and Taruho went to Shion's sleeping chamber to take her with them to flee away from them. Despite Taruho telling Susuki not to go, due to Shion having
predicted his death
, Susuki claimed he was willing to give his life for her. Susuki was killed when blocking a barrage of ninja tools that was intended for Shion. Before Susuki died, he told Taruho to protect Shion.
