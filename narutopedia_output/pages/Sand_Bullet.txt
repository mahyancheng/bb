Gaara forms a small sphere made of
sand
 and compresses it to increase its hardness. The sphere can strike opponents with such speed and force that it knocks them unconscious. He can also change its trajectory, to strike down multiple targets. By using this one small bullet, Gaara was able to defeat the
Suna Assassin Captain
 along with all his subordinates.
