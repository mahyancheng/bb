Honoka
 (
ホノカ
) was a
kunoichi
 working with the researchers on a
remote island
.

Background

While researchers worked on the
Ultimate Summoning Beast
, Honoka was assigned to restrain the beast using her
sealing techniques
. However, at some point in time the beast got too powerful for her technique to restrain and it got loose. The researchers called for her to do something as the beast began to kill them. Eventually, she was the only one left, and when her sealing technique failed to restrain the beast, she called out for help, though there was no one to hear her while she was killed.

Personality

Because she was only seen as a soul, and thus, unable to speak, above all, indicates she was a caring girl. She also demonstrated to be level-headed during her lifetime, as she showed no fright when the Ultimate Summoning Beast was attacking the Summoning Island. She was shown to have a cheerful demeanour, as seen in the picture in her room.

Appearance






Honoka's attire.



Honoka had dark eyes and long, straight red hair which she wore with a white band. She also wore a purple, sleeveless kimono blouse with yellow trimmings held close by a traditional obi with a long, streaming bow tied to it, mesh armour underneath it and a short white skirt. She seemed to prefer going barefoot.

Abilities






Honoka sealing the Ultimate Summoning Beast.



Honoka had some aptitude for
fūinjutsu
 as she was assigned to restrain the Ultimate Summoning Beast. She could use a
sealing technique
 that caused the sealing formula to form into chains to restrain her target.

Part II

Paradise Life on a Boat

With her soul unable to find rest, Honoka roamed the island as a spirit waiting for an opportunity to fulfil her duty. As the Konoha shinobi came to the island to save
Guy
,
Aoba
 saw her and chases her where she leads him to the recorded research information left behind by the scientists. After this, she guides him to the
Ultimate Summoning Beast
 before it was awakened. After the shinobi and some of the other animals engage in battle with the beast, Honoka manages to restrain the beast long enough for
Naruto Uzumaki
 to attack it with the
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
. With her duty fulfilled, her soul was able to move on.

Trivia

Given her red hair, skill in sealing techniques, the similarity between her fūinjutsu and the
Adamantine Sealing Chains
 technique, and the history of the
Uzumaki clan
, Honoka was suspected to be a member of the clan. A book in an old abandoned house on the island even mentions finding a survivor of a "
certain clan of ninja
".
