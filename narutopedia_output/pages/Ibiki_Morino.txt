Ibiki Morino
 (
森乃イビキ
,
Morino Ibiki
) is a
tokubetsu jōnin
 of
Konohagakure
, the leader of the
Konohagakure Intelligence Division
,
 and more specifically the commanding officer of the
Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force
.
 In the anime, he was also later made the new team leader of
Team 40
.

Background






Ibiki's team participating in the Chūnin Exams.



In his youth during the
Chūnin Exams
, Ibiki, and his teammates
Hayate Gekkō
 and
Tokara
 confronted
Orochimaru's team
 in the
Forest of Death
 during the second round of the examination.






Ibiki confronting Kisame.



Several years later, Ibiki led a squad that was trying to retrieve secret codes held by the
Cypher Division
 of
Kirigakure
. One of its members,
Kisame Hoshigaki
, identified him as Konoha's top
Anbu
 interrogator. However, before the team could restrain the Kirigakure ninja, Kisame killed them all stating that the mission (protecting information at all costs) called for such extreme actions, visibly disturbing Ibiki.

In the anime, Ibiki was the proctor for the first portion of his younger brother
Idate
's Chūnin Exams. He failed Idate, feeling that he wasn't fit to be a shinobi. Later, after his brother left the village, Ibiki discovered that Idate was helping his sensei,
Aoi Rokushō
, steal the
Sword of the Thunder God
. Ibiki and two fellow
Anbu
 members gave chase. However, Aoi quickly brought in
Amegakure
 allies to capture Ibiki and eliminate the two Anbu members with him. Aoi then tortured Ibiki to read the scroll, in the process accidentally setting the building on fire after Ibiki managed to free both himself and his little brother. However, despite Ibiki's efforts, the flames soon separated the two siblings. Believing his brother to be dead, Ibiki was forced to return to the village alone.

Personality






Ibiki displaying his scars.



Ibiki is a very strict person, and has even been described as being a
sadist
 by
Kakashi Hatake
.
 Compounded with this is his belief that pain is an effective form of communication, which he employed whenever he carries out his duties of torture and interrogation. His mental fortitude is formidable as, in the anime, even after being horribly tortured by Aoi Rokushō, Ibiki never revealed any information to the latter, who years later openly acknowledged Ibiki's fortitude. Nonetheless, he did confess to his subordinates during the
Konoha Crush
 that he was scared of
Orochimaru
 as a child, noting him to be somewhat "inhuman, but in human form".
 He was also visibly shocked when Kisame massacred his own comrades to protect information.

Nevertheless Ibiki has shown a more relaxed side, which shocked
Temari
 during the Chūnin Exams due to the drastic change in personality as well as the fact he hinted to
Kankurō
 he saw right through the latter's attempt to disguise
Karasu
 as a test proctor, but allowed him to get away with it.
 He also laughed after finding out that he had passed
someone
 who didn't answer a single question in the exam.
 Despite his harsh interrogation methods, Ibiki is shown to also be quite reasonable. One example was when Karin agreed to forfeit all information regarding Kabuto, Sasuke, and the Akatsuki in exchange if she was fed a fried pork cutlet bowl, which Ibiki agreed to, even though it would take two days for a delivery and did not press the interrogation any further. In addition, he was not one to be swayed by a sob story and kept a strict no-nonsense demeanour when interrogating someone.
 He was noted to be fond of Naruto due to the child's energy and ability to inspire confidence, as well as his signature antics and sense of humour. In the anime, despite his strict demeanour, he does show care towards his younger brother Idate, as he told him to run as he fought Aoi off. Upon briefly reuniting with him, Ibiki was pleased by how much Idate had changed and felt gratitude towards Naruto for changing his brother. In the anime, despite his harsh demeanour, he has a remarkable affinity towards animals as they tend to be jovial with him.

Appearance

Ibiki has a large, imposing figure, which he complements with a rugged head and face covered with old wounds and scars. Ibiki's head is always covered by his forehead protector to conceal a collection of burn marks, punctures from where screws were used, and long slash marks. The scars are indicative of the physical torture he has endured in the past, and illustrates his capacity to endure pain without giving up the desired information to the enemy. As a child it was revealed that he had a short crop of silver hair.

He wears a darker version of the standard uniform of the Intelligence Division, along with a black trench coat and gloves.

As a
genin
, Ibiki wore a simple black outfit with chain-mail armour underneath, over which he wore a beige utility
flak jacket
 of sorts with several pouches strapped to it and calf-length sandals. He wore his forehead protector in the same, bandanna style.

Fifteen years after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Ibiki wears a light coloured trench coat, with a striped shirt underneath.

Abilities

Intelligence

Ibiki is a master of interrogation both physically and psychologically, and plays an important part in the extracting of information, as he interrogates suspects and prisoners of war.
 He has the ability to subject people to great suffering without ever using physical torture.
 He has complete knowledge of human psychology; by attacking a person's mind, he can gain control over their spirit.
 His interrogation skills are so reputed that, once he discovered that Ibiki was the one going to interrogate them,
Kisame Hoshigaki
 immediately decided to kill all his comrades of the
Cypher Division
 to prevent them from revealing any information.
 He is also a sharp individual, able to easily tell if someone is lying, quickly seeing through Karin's elaborate story.

Ninjutsu






Ibiki using Summoning: Iron Maiden.



In the anime, during his fight against
Pain
's
Animal Path
, he is shown skilfully using the
Summoning Technique
, which he used to summon a variety of torture devices, including an
Iron Maiden
 and a
Torture Chamber
.
 Ironically, these summons are modelled after
engimono
 statues — lucky charms that are commonly used to bless shrines and businesses with good fortune. Also some of these summoning were a double edge sword, where the summoner will receive the same amount of pain as the opponent.
 He claims this has something to do with becoming equals through pain (ironically being Pain's philosophy).
 Ibiki's abilities in the manga remain largely the same, with him being able to use the Shrimp Tie Technique (
海老責の術
,
Ebizeme no Jutsu
) and Summoning: Execution Chamber (
口寄せ・仕置部屋
,
Kuchiyose: Shioki Heya
).
 He also carries a great deal of hidden weaponry and tools, such as a piece of flint hidden in his molars, which he can use to ignite flammable substances, as well as a small dagger hidden in the heel of his boot.

Physical Prowess

While normally staying off the battlefield or implementing indirect battle tactics, Ibiki is shown to have a great deal of stamina and endurance. To which, he also showed some skill in
taijutsu
, capable of tripping and then injuring Aoi Rokushō even though he was battered and still tied to a chair and afterwards escaping.
 He is also shown to have considerable raw strength. A simple squeeze from Ibiki's hand on
Boruto Uzumaki
's made the genin cringe in pain, which Ibiki claimed was only 1/10 of his real strength. To which, he was shown able to drag large boulders out of the ground and lift them to attack with.

Chūnin Exams






Ibiki and his invigilators arrive.



Ibiki is the first examiner of the
Chūnin Exams
, testing his students during the written exam with questions too hard for any
genin
 to answer. Before beginning the Exams, Ibiki gave a warning to
Team Dosu
 after their attack on
Kabuto Yakushi
. During the first part of the exams, Ibiki secretly put two
chūnin
 into the crowd to answer the questions and to make other genin try to cheat off of their exams. Although the point of the test was to test the participants' information-gathering skills,
Naruto Uzumaki
 did not realise this, but acted like he did. Nevertheless, Naruto was able to pass the exam without answering a single question, a fact Ibiki took great interest in.

Pain's Assault






Ibiki and his team interrogating Yūdachi.



Though Jiraiya died in battle against Akatsuki's leader,
Pain
, one of the clues he managed to send back to Konoha was a prisoner from
Amegakure
. When Ibiki's interrogation methods proved ineffective, he called on
Inoichi Yamanaka
 for assistance.

During Pain's assault on Konoha, the
Animal Path
 tracked
Shizune
 to the Intel Division, where Inoichi was probing the prisoner's mind. There, Ibiki and a team of three Anbu made a stand against Pain in order to give Inoichi, Shizune, and Ino a chance to escape to the Cypher Division and finish their investigation.






Ibiki tries to interrogate the Animal Path.



In the anime, the Anbu did battle against Pain's
Giant Multi-Headed Dog
 while Ibiki restrained the
Giant Rhino
 with his own
Iron Maiden
 summon and captured the Animal Path using his
Summoning: Torture Chamber
 technique. Ibiki attempted to torture and interrogate the Animal Path, but soon realised that it was unable to feel pain, and seemed to be cold like a corpse. The Animal Path broke free from its bindings, stating that Ibiki "would never understand true pain" before performing a Summoning Technique, placing the summoning seal directly on Ibiki's stomach. Ibiki's Torture Chamber disappeared and he fell to his knees in pain; moments later, Pain's
Giant Drill-Beaked Bird
 erupted from his back, severely injuring him.
Katsuyu
 quickly attached herself to him, healing him and saving him. He continues to fight until the Animal Path flees in order to escape the
village's destruction
.

Karin
 was taken by
Kakashi Hatake
 to the village, Ibiki and his colleagues interrogate her about everything she knew about
Sasuke Uchiha
 and
Kabuto Yakushi
. He maintained a straight face and stern personality when Karin was sobbing while telling her story, and was seemingly unperturbed when she demanded food before she would talk further. While his other two colleagues started to make an attempt to fulfil Karin's request, Ibiki remained stone-faced and told Karin to drop the act and start talking.

In the anime, when
Enko Onikuma
's secret clan technique injured her team's jōnin leader, Ibiki was assigned to take over as Team 40's leader. However, he immediately decided to disband Team 40, feeling that
Dōshu Goetsu
 and
Tsuru Itoi
's growing fear of Enko's power would only hinder performance for all. He instead decided to train her personally as an interrogator. Soon after, when Ibiki told Enko how her team-mates would be reassigned to a new team, her loneliness triggered her technique and made her go berserk again. As Ibiki struggled to detain her and even considered cutting off her arms, Dōshu and Tsuru happened upon the event. Knowing that her rampage came from her feelings of loneliness, the two were able to reach her, insisting they won't leave their friend. Their genuine friendship ultimately calmed her down. Ultimately, Ibiki conceded that the three genin together would be best for Enko and officially reinstated Team 40.

Ibiki brings Shojoji per Kakashi's request.



In the anime, Ibiki was approached by Kakashi, to which Ibiki quickly realised the retired Hokage had a favour to ask of him. Kakashi had Ibiki arrange a meeting between Boruto and the imprisoned Shojoji, so Boruto could test the progress he made on his Rasengan training. Ibiki was concerned by the idea, but Kakashi promised to take full responsibility.

As Shojoji reminded them of the terms of their agreement, Kakashi reminded him that the condition also was that Shojoji would have to actually defeat Boruto to have his sentence reduced. As Shojoji's
Wind Release: Shield of the Wind Count

Compression Rasengan
. Ibiki and Kakashi were both impressed by its power, which overcame Shojoji's defence, defeating him.

After a confrontation with Code outside Konoha, Ibiki participated on a discussion on how to deal with Kawaki, who was rebranded with a new Kāma and accessing Isshiki's powers. He questioned why Kawaki wasn't restrained, and Shikamaru pointed out how none of their available options would hold Kawaki, so their best bet was not to antagonise him, and hope he'd remain on their side due to his loyalty to Naruto.

Later, like the rest of the world, Ibiki's memories of Boruto and Kawaki were swapped by
Ada
's accidental activation of
Omnipotence
.

The missing-nin explained what the man-like God Trees are and proclaimed that the Seventh Hokage and his wife are still alive, but refused to reveal details on how he knew any of this. Eagerly, Ibiki began his aggressive methods to acquire answers. As Boruto remained defiant, Shikamaru sent in
Mitsuki
 to help interrogations with his venom.

Suddenly, the apparently enraged Mitsuki tackled Boruto. Secretly, Mitsuki was ordered by Shikamaru to help free Boruto, removing the cuffs and allowing Boruto to teleport away. Ibiki proclaimed Amado's work on the cuffs as subpar.

Quotes

(To the
Chūnin Exams
 candidates) "
Because… in times, information is more important than life… and on missions and on the battlefield, people risk their lives to get their hands on it.
"

(To the exam candidates) "
Important information in your hands… can be a powerful weapon for your comrades and the village.
"

(To the exam candidates) "
The ability to be courageous and survive any hardship… These are the abilities needed to become a chūnin captain. Those who can't put their destinies on the line… who cling to the uncertain future of "there's always next year"… and walk away from their chance… those pieces of trash who can only make such cowardly choices do not deserve to become chūnin!
"
