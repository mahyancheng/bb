Tenten
 unseals several weapons from her scrolls, which
Lee
 and
Neji
 send at their opponent with a kick and a vacuum palm. Lee and Neji leap into the air, where Lee accelerates the rotation of Neji's
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
 using the
Front Lotus
. Tenten then throws a
kunai
-filled string around them, adding to the combination's power. The impact results in an explosion.
