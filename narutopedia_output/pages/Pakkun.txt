Pakkun
 (
パックン
) is a miniature
pug
, and the smallest of
Kakashi Hatake
's
ninken
.

Background






Pakkun and the other ninken are summoned to search Orochimaru.



In the anime, some time after Pakkun and the other ninken made a contract with Kakashi, they aided him to search the abducted
Rin Nohara
 by
Kirigakure
 shinobi and acted as a diversion in order to allow them to flee.
 They also helped searching for the fleeing
Orochimaru
,
 allowing Kakashi and the
Root

Anbu

Kinoe
 pursue him into the residence of the
Iburi clan
 to save the only survivor,
Yukimi
.

Personality

Despite his cute appearance, his voice is deep and gruff. In the anime, he revealed that he used Floral Green shampoo (
English TV:
 Minty Rain Forest Mist Shampoo with extra bodywash), which is also used by Sakura, who was comically traumatised at the thought of using the same shampoo as a dog.
 In Japanese, Pakkun uses "washi" (
ワシ
) when referring to himself, which is generally used by older men. Despite his lazy demeanour, Pakkun is shown to be fiercely proud and determined ninken. When offered by Sai to deliver a message with one of his
ink creatures
, Pakkun insisted that he deliver it, not wanting to look inferior. He is very loyal to his allies and at times curses his inability to get more directly involved in battle.

Appearance






Pakkun's paw.



Pakkun is a small, pug-like dog with brown fur and a dark brown snout and ears. He has pink-coloured paws and wears the standard outfit of Kakashi's ninken which consists of a blue vest with the
heno-heno-moheji
 seal and a Konoha
forehead protector
, but his is worn on top of his head in a similar style to
Sakura Haruno
. He also wears a bandage on his right front leg.

Abilities






Pakkun using Ninken Ninja Art: Hound Clone.



Pakkun is revealed to not be a battle-type ninken, which Sakura claimed to know by looking at his small appearance.
 Despite this and his small size, Pakkun has shown to be a very useful summon. He has been repeatedly shown to have an incredibly sharp sense of smell, even by canine standards. He can regularly determine what type of scent he is picking up, how far away it is, and how dangerous the person is. In the anime, he was shown even able to detect a target's scent that has been
masked
.
 Also, he has been shown to have tremendous speed from how effectively he can keep up with full-grown human ninja, even challenging others to keep up with him. He also has a great amount of strength as he was able to drag Shikamaru with him when he refused to help find Sasuke. He has also displayed exceptional teamwork with the rest of his pack developing and effectively using several offensive and defensive formations in battle which make use of their manoeuvrability and powerful limbs. He has also displayed the ability to make
clones
 of himself from his hair.

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Pakkun

According to the anime, Pakkun was able to say Kakashi's name at four months of age.

During the Konoha Crush, Shikamaru refused to help in finding Sasuke. Pakkun told him that, if he completed this mission, he would let him touch the pads on his feet, which he claimed were really soft and supple.
 This is a reference to modern Japanese culture, in which a dog's paw is considered its cutest aspect; the idea of an animal's paw being "cute", however, applies mainly to puppies and kittens, because at birth their pads are pink, and, as dogs grow older, they turn into a dirty black. However, Pakkun's paw pads are still pink even though he's a full grown dog.

The heno-heno-moheji seal on the back of Pakkun's jacket is a face that is drawn on scarecrows in Japan by children. The scarecrows are also called "Kakashi", which is a name of Pakkun's summoner.

In 2005, a Pakkun-shaped controller case was given away as the bonus to those who pre-ordered
Naruto: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! 4
 in Japan.

Pakkun was shown in
episode 20
 on
Naruto
's key chain and appears again in
episode 176
. He also appears as a souvenir in
episode 110
.

Due to his short stature, whenever he is summoned with the other ninken, he appears on top of
Bull
's head, as opposed to the others, who always appear on the ground.

Pakkun is playable in
Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2
 as a summoning (optionally) if the player put a Ninja Tag on the characters such as the Anbu.

His only technique in
Path of the Ninja 2
 is Bite.

The face on the back of Pakkun's jacket is also the face of the narrator in the spin-off anime,
Naruto SD: Rock Lee no Seishun Full-Power Ninden
.
