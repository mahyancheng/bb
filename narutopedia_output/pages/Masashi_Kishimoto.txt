Masashi Kishimoto.



Masashi Kishimoto
 (
岸本 斉史
,
Kishimoto Masashi
, born November 8, 1974
) is a Japanese
manga artist
, well known for creating the manga series
Naruto
 which was in serialisation from 1999 to 2014.

Biography

Early Life

Masashi Kishimoto was born in the
Okayama Prefecture
, Japan on November 8, 1974 as the older identical twin of
Seishi Kishimoto
.
 During his childhood, Kishimoto showed interest in drawing characters from the anime shows he watched, such as
Dr. Slump
's
Arale
 and
Doraemon
's titular protagonist.
 In elementary school, Kishimoto started watching the
Kinnikuman
 and
Dragon Ball
 anime alongside his brother.
 During the following years, Kishimoto started idolising
Dragon Ball
's author
Akira Toriyama
, enjoying not only his series
Dragon Ball
 and
Dr. Slump
, but also
Dragon Quest
, a role-playing video game for which Toriyama was art designer. While he could not afford to buy
Weekly Shōnen Jump
 where the
Dragon Ball
 manga was published, he followed the series thanks to a friend from school who had subscribed to the magazine.
 By high school, Kishimoto started losing interest in manga as he started playing baseball and basketball, sports he practised at his school. However, upon seeing a poster for the animated film
Akira
, Kishimoto became fascinated with the way the illustration was made and wished to imitate the series' creator
Katsuhiro Otomo
's style.

During his last years of school, Kishimoto spent time drawing manga and went to an art college with hopes that he would become a manga artist.
 Upon entering college, Kishimoto decided he should try creating a
Chanbara
 manga since
Weekly Shōnen Jump
 had not published a title from that genre. However, during the same years, Kishimoto started reading
Hiroaki Samura
's
Blade of the Immortal
 and
Nobuhiro Watsuki
's
Rurouni Kenshin
 which used such genre. Kishimoto recalls having never been surprised by manga ever since reading
Akira
 and found that he still was not able to compete against them.
 In his second year of college, Kishimoto started drawing manga for magazine contests. However, he noted that his works were similar to
seinen manga
, aimed towards a young adult demographic, rather than the
shōnen manga
 read by children.
 Wishing to write a manga for
Shōnen Jump
 that targets a young demographic, Kishimoto found his style unsuitable for the magazine.
 When watching the anime series
Hashire Melos!
, Kishimoto was surprised by the character designs employed by the animators and he started researching works from animators. He later met Tetsuya Nishio, designer from the anime adaptation of the manga
Ninku
 who he deemed as a big influence.
 Now emulating the way of drawing from multiple character designers from anime series, Kishimoto noted that his style started resembling
shōnen
 series.

Works

Kishimoto's first successful manga pilot was
Karakuri
 (
カラクリ
,
literally meaning:
 Mechanism), which he submitted to
Shueisha
 in 1995. This earned him an honourable mention in Shueisha's monthly "Hop Step Award" in 1996, granted to promising rookie manga artists.
 At this point he was assigned an editor, Kosuke Yahagi, and worked on a number of rejected drafts including a slice-of-life manga,
Michikusa
 (
道くさ
,
literally meaning:
 Wandering Detour), and an action manga,
Asian Punk
 (
アジアンパンク
,
Ajian Panku
). In 1997 he wrote a
one-shot version of
Naruto
 which was published in
Akamaru Jump Summer
 and was well received, but proved difficult to rework into a continuing series.

In December 1997, while redeveloping
Karakuri
 for serialisation, Kishimoto was offered a one-shot in
Weekly Shōnen Jump
. Hampered by the sudden deadline, a reworked
Karakuri
 debuted two weeks later in
Weekly Shōnen Jump 1998 No. 4-5
, but performed poorly in reader surveys and was immediately cancelled. Following the failure of
Karakuri
, Kishimoto reduced his output and began moving in a
seinen
 direction with drafts for a baseball manga,
Yakyūō
 (
野球王
,
literally meaning:
 Baseball King), and a mafia manga,
Mario
 (
マリオ
), hoping to find better luck with a seinen magazine. Yahagi persuaded him to give the shōnen genre one last shot and Kishimoto began working on storyboards for a fantasy one-shot,
Magic Mushroom
 (
マジックマッシュルーム
,
Majikku Masshurūmu
), but stopped when Yahagi called and asked him to instead develop storyboards for serialisation. The two decided to submit a version of
Naruto
 with a reworked story and world and produced storyboards for the first three chapters, winning a spot in the magazine. With a six-month lead time, Kishimoto repeatedly revised and redrew the first several chapters of the series.

In September 1999, the serialised version of
Naruto
 premiered in
Weekly Shōnen Jump 1999 No. 43
 and quickly became a hit.
Naruto
 ended on November 10, 2014 after more than 15 years of serialisation, with a total of 700 chapters collected in
72 volumes
. Sales have exceeded 113 million copies in Japan and over 95 million copies in the US,
 followed by over 93 million copies worldwide (outside Japan and United States) as of volume 36. It was adapted into two successful anime series. The
Naruto
 manga series became one of
Viz Media
's top properties,
 accounting for nearly 10% of all manga sales in the US in 2006.
 The seventh volume of Viz's release became the first manga to ever win a
Quill Award
 when it claimed the award for "Best Graphic Novel" in 2006.
 Responding to
Naruto
's success, Kishimoto said in
Naruto Collector Winter 2007/2008
 that he was "very glad that the American audience has accepted and understood ninja. It shows that the American audience has good taste... because it means they can accept something previously unfamiliar to them."

Two of his former assistants, Osamu Kajisa (
Tattoo Hearts
) and Yuuichi Itakura (
Hand's
), have gone on to moderate success following their work on
Naruto
.
 In 2009, Kishimoto designed an extra costume for the video game character
Lars Alexandersson
 for
Tekken 6
; in 2010 this character appeared in
Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2
 as part of a special cross-promotion.
 In 2010, Kishimoto produced a one-shot baseball manga,
Bench
 (
ベンチ
,
Benchi
), as part of
Jump's
 "Top of the Super Legend" project, a series of six one-shot manga by famed
Weekly Shōnen Jump
 artists.

For the ninth
Naruto
 film,
Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie
, Kishimoto was responsible for both the story and characters' designs.
 To promote the film, Kishimoto worked in
Motion Comic Naruto
 a DVD that shows scenes from the manga in 3D that was given to the first 1.5 million people who went to the cinema.
 Regarding
Naruto
's publication Kishimoto told Tetsuya Nishio in July 2012 that the series would take over a year and a half to end. However, Kishimoto admitted that it now appears that the manga will continue beyond that timeframe.
 In April, 2012, it was announced that Kishimoto would publish a one-shot version of his long-postponed mafia manga,
Mario
, in
Jump Square
,
 based on the rough, 160-page manuscript he began working on before
Naruto
 became serialised.

Throughout 2013, several of Kishimoto's one-shots saw their English-language debut in issues of the
Weekly Shonen Jump
 digital magazine, including
Mario
,
Bench
, and the original
Naruto
 pilot.

Masashi was involved in the production of the 2014 game
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
 where he created new designs and additions for characters, such as
Mecha-Naruto
 and
Mecha-Kurama
, pre-Akatsuki designs for
Sasori
,
Kakuzu
 and
Hidan
,
Shisui Uchiha
's and
Itachi Uchiha
's Complete Body
Susanoo
, as well as editorial supervision for the three playable stories,
Ninja Escapades
.

Kishimoto was also the winner of "Rookie of the Year" for the series in the
Agency for Cultural Affairs
.

On 10 November 2014, Kishimoto ended the 15-year run of
Naruto
. By the end of the publication,
Naruto
 had spanned 72 volumes and (as of September 2014) generated global sales of 200 million copies.
 After a two year break, Kishimoto announced he was going to aid the new
Boruto
 anime premiering in 2017, as well as help the Live Action Naruto Movie that is being produced by Lionsgate.

On May 13, 2019, Masashi Kishimoto had begun publication of his newest manga series
Samurai 8: The Tale of Hachimaru
 which ended on March 23, 2020, spanning 43 chapters for a total of five volumes, which like Naruto was also serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump and licensed by VIZ for an English release in their new Shōnen Jump release format.

Influences

While as a child Kishimoto enjoyed reading manga, he was inspired to write one after seeing a promotional image for the film
Akira
. This made him analyse the artwork of
Akira
's original author,
Katsuhiro Otomo
, as well as
Akira Toriyama
, another artist he admired. Realising both had their own style regarding the designs, Kishimoto decided to draw manga while crafting his own images.
 While attending art school, Kishimoto was also an avid reader of
Hiroaki Samura
's
Blade of the Immortal
, and extensively studied Samura's page layouts, action sequences, and anatomical techniques.
 When Kishimoto was originally creating the
Naruto
 series, he looked to other
shōnen
 manga for influences while attempting to make his characters as unique as possible.
 Kishimoto cites Akira Toriyama's
Dragon Ball
 series as one of his influences, noting that
Goku
, the protagonist, was a key factor when creating
Naruto Uzumaki
 due to his energetic and mischievous personality.
 When redesigning three characters for the series, Kishimoto cites
The Matrix
, one of his favourite movies, as an inspiration for their outfits.
 He has also cited
Yoshihiro Togashi
 as one of his favourite manga authors,
 while the manga
Sasuke
 by
Sanpei Shirato
, a series which Kishimoto likes, inspired Kishimoto in the development of the character
Sasuke Uchiha
.

During the series' publication, Kishimoto got married and had children. The changes to his personal life affected the story as he made the protagonist Naruto Uzumaki meet his parents, something the author wanted the character to feel based on his own experience as a father.

When drawing the characters, Kishimoto consistently follows a five-step process: concept and rough sketch, draughting, inking, shading, and colouring. These steps are followed when he is drawing the manga and making the colour illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of
tankōbon
, the cover of
Weekly Shōnen Jump
, or other media. The toolkit he uses occasionally changes.
 For instance, he used an airbrush for one illustration for a
Weekly Shōnen Jump
 cover but decided not to use it for future drawings largely due to the cleanup required.

Masashi and his twin brother Seishi have been drawing manga together since early childhood, thus their styles are similar.
 As a result, each has frequently been accused of copying the other, not just artwork, but story elements as well. Seishi notes that the similarities are not intentional but are likely because they were influenced by many of the same things. Because of the accusations, the more famous Masashi even asked fans to stop calling Seishi a "copycat."
