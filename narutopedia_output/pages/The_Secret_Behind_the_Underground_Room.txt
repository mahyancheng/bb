Synopsis

The
Land of Valleys' daimyō
 arrives at Victor's company, and is greeted by
Victor
.
Boruto
 and
Sarada
 arrive at the
Land of Valleys
. They discuss
Konohamaru
's mission,
Mitsuki
's injury, and their failure to get
Anato
 back to
Mia
. They meet with Mia. At
Otogakure
, Mitsuki is concerned about his friends, but
Orochimaru
 warns him that his new organs are still one month away from being viable for a transplant, so his condition is still precarious. Orochimaru is proud that Mitsuki acted on his own will, but chastises him from overusing his
Sage Transformation
. Knowing that Mitsuki would be concerned for his friends, they sent
Suigetsu
 to check in on them. Suigetsu reports the rest of
Team 7
 is at the Land of Valleys, which concerns Mitsuki. Orochimaru takes Suigetsu aside to avoid his speculation from stirring Mitsuki into action. Mitsuki wants to join his team, so
Log
 sedates him. At Victor's company, he and the
daimyō
 discuss
Konoha
's attempts to interfere on their affairs over the
Hashirama
 Cell. Victor takes the daimyō's retinue into the company's restricted area. He has his secretary take him through decontamination areas, which has an effect on them. Mia tells Boruto and Sarada she was told that Anato was attacked by people who were after his researched and killed. Boruto tells her that the company was responsible for it over something they're researching. Victor shows the daimyō his research, claiming that with the Hashirama Cell, they're on the verge of curing previously incurable diseases, and making ageing a thing from the past.
 The daimyō commits to protect his research from interference, but one of his guards snaps him out of the
genjutsu
, allowing him to see the human subjects of Victor's experiments. His guards are actually Konohamaru and
Mugino
, who
disguised
 themselves as guards before they arrived at the company. They noticed the daimyō had been placed under genjutsu during decontamination. Mugino cuts off Victor's right arm. Konohamaru apologises for infiltrating the daimyō's group, and explains what they know about Victor's experiments. Victor's severed right arm moves on its own, and activates countermeasures before returning to Victor. Victor repels Mugino with
Wind Release
. Victor's employees attack the Konoha
jōnin
. A
God Tree
 sapling begins to grow in the lab. Konohamaru protects the daimyō from it. Victor abandons the
Iwa Doctor
 to serve as nourishment to the God Tree. Victor's secretary arranged for company employees to gather in a room to serve as nourishment as well. Mia wants to meet Victor in person to know what happened to Anato, but Boruto and Sarada tell her it's dangerous, and that Konohamaru and Mugino are already investigating. The ground begins to shake, so the
genin
 tell her to go somewhere safe, while they decide to help the jōnin. Victor and his secretary watch with interest as the God Tree bud begins to bloom.
