This is a type of trap ninjutsu (
トラップ忍術
,
Torappu ninjutsu
) where an area is defined using a number of special tags. When the area is entered by an opponent, a
barrier
 is created. The barrier's properties vary depending on the tags used:
 the
Sound Four
, for example, use
explosive tags
, which allows it to serve as a sort of booby-trap.
 To prevent the trap from being noticed, the individual tags are placed in hidden locations, such as the shade of trees. Even if the tags are discovered, actually disarming them is very difficult, for which reason it's generally safer to simply avoid the area.

Shikaku Nara
 once forced his son,
Shikamaru
, to read a book that discussed this technique, which described it as "a high-class ninjutsu".

Trivia

In
Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
,
String Light Formation
 is incorrectly named as this technique.
