The
Giant Folding Fan
 (
巨大扇子
,
Kyodai Sensu
) wielded by Temari is a giant
Japanese war fan
 that has three purple circles along its metal body that she calls "stars" (
星
,
hoshi
,
English TV:
 moons). The strength of the gusts of wind she creates is indicated by how many stars are shown (one being the weakest, three being the strongest). The fan itself can also be used as a club or to block attacks. It also seems to be able to deflect kunai and shuriken when opened and can be lodged in the ground.

Trivia

During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, several other
Sunagakure
 shinobi were seen wielding similar fans alongside Temari.
 This is an indication that the use of
tessenjutsu
 is a skill generally taught in the village.

Being a shinobi from another village,
Temari
 had to obtain a permit to carry her fan within the city limits of
Konoha
.
