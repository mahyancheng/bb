Synopsis

Shojoji
 confirms with
Kakashi
 that his sentence will be reduced if he defeats
Boruto
. They're both determined to defeat one another. Kakashi releases Shojoji's restraints and he and Boruto begin fighting. Boruto uses his
Wind Release: Rasengan
, but Shojoji repels it with his own
Wind Release: Shield of the Wind Count
. Shojoji taunts Boruto about it, and notices Boruto's
jutsu
 is stronger than last time they fought. He believes that if this is all Boruto has to offer he won't win, but Boruto remains confident. The fight switches to
taijutsu
, with Boruto being able repel Shojoji's attacks and Shojoji attempts to
consume
 him. Boruto attacks with his
new Rasengan
, which is able to break through Shojoji's wind shield. Kakashi believes that if Shojoji hadn't been using his shield, Boruto's attack would have killed him. He surmises that instead of trying to make his Rasengan bigger, Boruto went the other way, condensing it as much as he could. Boruto notices that the Rasengan damaged his bandages, exposing his
seal
, and passes out from exhaustion.
Sarada
 practices dodging kunai with her father, but always has to have one of them deflected to avoid getting hit.
Sasuke
 suggests a break, but Sarada wants to keep going.
Sakura
 arrives, and tells Sarada to fight her to test her resolve. Sasuke agrees that Sakura has insight that he lacks.
 Sarada attacks Sakura, but none of them hit, and she can't even follow her with the
Sharingan
. Sakura
demonstrates her strength
, and attacks, Sarada dodging it in the last moment with the Sharingan. Sakura fells a big tree, impressing Sarada. Sakura points out that her chakra control is lacking, which combined with Sharingan use causes her chakra to be quickly depleted. They resume fighting, but Sarada stumbles trying to dodge all of Sakura's attacks. Sasuke and Sakura feel they've pushed enough, but Sarada has one last thing she wants to try. Sarada copies her mother's moves, and their attacks collide. By copying her movements, she was able to improve her own chakra control, making her attack more powerful. Sasuke and Sakura want her to keep training.
