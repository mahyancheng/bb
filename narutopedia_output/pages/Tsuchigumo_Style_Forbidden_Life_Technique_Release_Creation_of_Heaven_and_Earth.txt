This technique releases the seal on the
Fury
 technique and then accumulates
natural energy
 from the earth and atmosphere to be used for the technique. The bearer of the seal acts as a passive vessel, continuously gathering natural energy, which makes it possible to use Fury without their cooperation.

Trivia

Creation of Heaven and Earth
 (
天地開闢
,
Tenchi Kaibyaku
) is the story that describes the legendary birth of the celestial and earthly world, the birth of the first gods and the birth of the Japanese archipelago.

This technique is similar to
senjutsu
 in that it also gathers natural energy. However, unlike
Sage Mode
, the chakra does not directly power the user's abilities.
