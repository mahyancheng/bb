Lyrics

Rōmaji

Mijika ni aru mono

Tsune ni ki wo tsuketenai to

Amari ni chika sugite

Miushinatte shimaisou

Anata ga saikin taiken shita

Shiawase wa ittai nandesu ka?

Megumaresugite ite

Omoidasenai kamo

Ima koko ni iru koto

Iki wo shite iru koto

Tada soredake no koto ga

Kiseki dato kidzuku

Mijika ni aru mono

Tsune ni ki wo tsuketeinai to

Amari ni chikasugite

Miushinatte shimaisou

You know the closer you get to something

The tougher it is to see it

And I'll never take it for granted

Oitsudzuketekita yume

Akiramezu ni susume yo nante

Kirei koto wo ieru hodo

Nani mo dekichainai kedo

Hitonigiri no yuuki wo mune ni

Ashita wo ikinuku tame ni

And I'll never take it for granted

Let's go

Ima koko ni iru koto

You know the closer you get to something

Kanji (Full Version)

身近にある物

常に気を付けていないと

余りに近すぎて

見失ってしまいそう

あなたが最近体験した

幸せは一体何ですか?

恵まれすぎていて

思い出せないかも!

今ここにいる事

息をしている事

ただそれだけの事が

奇跡だと気付く

身近にある物

常に気を付けていないと

余りに近すぎて

見失ってしまいそう

You know the closer you get to something

The tougher it is to see it

And I'll never take it for granted

Let's go

人助けを偽善と

呼ぶ奴等もいるけれど

信じるのも疑うのも

人それぞれだから

たとえ仮にそれが

偽善であったとしても

誰かを救えたなら

そりゃむしろ何よりもリアル

追い続けてきた夢

あきらめずに進めよなんて

キレイ事を言えるほど

何も出来ちゃいないけど

一握りの勇気を胸に

明日を生き抜くために

And I'll never take it for granted

Let's go

English (Full Version)

All that is near us we must know

Could disappear any day, be careful

The main key to finding happiness

Lies nowhere else but in my soul

You could reminisce, you could recall

The very last time you felt joy

Or maybe you are so blessed to a point

Where you can't remember anything

It's a harmony, a miracle

Being able to breathe and live at all

So here is your one and only chance

Life is an opportunity

All that is near us we must know

Could disappear any day, be careful

The main key to finding happiness

Lies nowhere else but in my soul

You know the closer you get to something

The tougher it is to see it

And I'll never take it for granted

Let's go

Some people may call a kind deed

An act of mere hypocrisy

But never mind those who have lost faith

You shouldn't give in to what they say.

As a matter of fact, let me tell you

Even if it was for a selfish cause

A salvageable hypocrisy

Is superior to murderous honesty

Everyone tells you from time to time

To never give up, like a phrase from a movie

They tell you to stand up for yourself

As if it was always that easy

Gather a handful of courage in my heart

To go on and survive another day

And I'll never take it for granted

Let's go

All that is near us we must know

Could disappear any day, be careful

The main key to finding happiness

Lies nowhere else but in my soul

You know the closer you get to something

The tougher it is to see it

And I'll never take it for granted

Everyone tells you from time to time

To never give up, like a phrase from a movie

They tell you to stand up for yourself

As if it was always that easy

Gather a handful of courage in my heart

To go on and survive another day

And I'll never take it for granted

Let's go
