The user creates hundreds of copies of themselves, each of which, like the standard
Clone Technique
, has no physical substance and thus cannot be attacked. While opponents attack the clones trying to locate the user, the user secretly
moves underground
 so that opponents will preoccupy themselves looking for someone who isn't there. Once the opponent is too distracted to defend themselves, the user will emerge from the ground in order to attack.

Trivia

In the anime,
Hōki
 claims his use of the Haze Clone Technique is actually the
Shadow Clone Technique
. It is only when his jutsu is dispelled that the lie is discovered.

In the anime,
Shisui Uchiha
's
Afterimage Clones
 produce an effect similar to the Haze Clone Technique, the difference being that his technique has mass behind it.
