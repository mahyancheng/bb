"
Blaze Away, Byakugan! This is My Ninja Way!
" (
燃えよ白眼!　これが私の忍道よ
,
Moe yo Byakugan! Kore ga Watashi no Nindō yo
) is episode 151 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Summary

Shino
,
Kiba
 and
Naruto
 are trapped in the hive of the
queen bee
 where Shino provokes her to use the
honey spit trap
 on them. Now rendered immobile, the three get captured by
Suzumebachi
's team who interrogates them for information on how to find the hidden
bikōchū
 beetle. Shino is reluctant, but eventually agrees to tell if they take them to
Hinata
 first. They take the three to the river where Hinata was tied, only to find the rope cut apart and Hinata missing. Suzumebachi's group believes Hinata fell into the sewer, which makes Naruto become aggressive with
Jibachi
 despite being stuck in the beeswax. Hinata is suddenly revealed to have escaped when she throws a paper bomb onto the ground where Suzumebachi's team was standing; Suzumebachi's group sends off flying insects to retaliate, but Hinata destroys them with her
new technique
, thereby forcing them away and saving her companions. Meanwhile, Shino tells Naruto that Hinata has trained really hard since the
Chūnin Exams
 and that she is not the same Hinata he once knew. Shino, Naruto and Kiba then escape the beeswax from the help of Shino's insects and Naruto praises Hinata for rescuing them. Suzumebachi comes at the group one last time with her giant bee, which Naruto easily defeats with his
Rasengan
; this launches
Sasuke
's forehead protector underneath a pile of logs. While trying to retrieve the forehead protector, Naruto accidentally farts on the bikōchū, causing it to memorise his scent instead of Sasuke's. Although the mission fails to find a way of locating Sasuke, Hinata appears more confident, and her
father
 seems to respect her more.
