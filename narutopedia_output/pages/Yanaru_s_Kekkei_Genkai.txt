Yanaru possesses a unique
Kekkei Genkai
, allowing him to mentally exchange information with his
shadow clones
, just as clones are able to transmit information to the main body. Yanara employs it to coordinate his clones for assassinations, while disguising himself as a member of his target's inner circle, where he acquires the necessary information to carry out the assassination, relaying it to his clones.
