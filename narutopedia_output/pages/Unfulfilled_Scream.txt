Unfulfilled Scream
" (
届かぬ絶叫
,
Todokanu Zekkyō
) is episode 79 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Despite being decapitated,
Hidan
 avoids death due to his immortality. He asks his partner
Kakuzu
 for help, who subdues
Asuma
 by landing on his back. Kakuzu uses his
Earth Grudge Fear
 ability to sew Hidan's head back to his body, restoring his partner.
Shikamaru
 is at the end of his limit, having had cancelled his
Shadow Sewing Technique
 shortly after Hidan's decapitation.
Izumo
 uses his
Water Release: Starch Syrup Capturing Field
 while
Kotetsu
 uses his
Conch Shell Mace
.

Although Kakuzu avoids being hit by the mace, he ends up being stuck by the Starch Syrup. Using his special ability, he unwinds his hands and uses them to keep Izumo and Kotetsu in a death grip. Hidan, now restored, draws his
Jashin
 circle and attempts to finish off Asuma. Asuma, however, attacks back with his
chakra blades
, but misses; Hidan, however, manages to slice Asuma with his
Retractable Spear
. Hidan then pulls his
Triple-Bladed Scythe
 and attempts to impale Asuma from behind, but misses when Shikamaru manages to warn Asuma in time. The scythe ends up embedding itself within Hidan, but as Hidan had ingested Asuma's blood and was in his Jashin circle, Asuma is wounded too. Wanting to finish Asuma off, Hidan takes his Retractable Spear and stabs himself in the heart, mortally wounding Asuma.

Back in
Konoha
,
Kurenai
 notices a flower drop and split in two, and immediately senses that it is related to Asuma.

Trivia

When Hidan's decapitated body was shown during a panoramic shot of the battlefield, he had his right side of his cloak, even though it was destroyed during the previous episode by Asuma's Fire Release: Ash Pile Burning.

When Kakuzu strangled Kotetsu and Izumo, his ring wasn't present on his left middle finger.
