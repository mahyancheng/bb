Synopsis

While moving to the battlefield through the night with
Naruto
's
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 lighting the way,
B
 and the
Eight-Tails
 discuss the fact that the more he uses that form, the more
Nine-Tails
 will consume his
chakra
 because the two were not on friendly terms. Not wanting to dampen Naruto's determination, the Eight-Tails resigns to have B keep a close eye on the young man. At the same time, the Nine-Tails speaks with Naruto about always being so careless with its chakra, but Naruto simply retorts that the beast had regained shape since it had been consuming his own chakra and that though he guessed that it was lonely and wanted some company, they would have to talk later. Disregarding this, the Nine-Tails asks him whether he is truly naive enough to believe that he alone could stop a war of this magnitude, with
Madara Uchiha
 at its helm.

The beast then told him that he was welcome to use its power, but Naruto states that he wouldn't fall for that one again and begins to leave. The Nine-Tails takes this opportunity to tell Naruto about the hatred that would spread because of this war and questions whether or not he was ready to bear such hatred. The beast then reminds him of
Sasuke
 and the hatred the young
Uchiha
 bore and how Naruto had never been able to help him since they were children and had refused to make the Seal of Reconciliation during their
Traditional Shinobi Sparring
 match. This causes Naruto to re-enter the Nine-Tails' cage and sends one of the torii flying down to pin the fox down. Climbing on the Nine-Tails' face to look it directly in the eye, Naruto states that once someone started to question their own convictions, it was all over and declared that he would save Sasuke somehow and put an end to the war. He then goes on to state as he left that, if possible, he would like to eventually do something about the Nine-Tails' hatred as well, which greatly angers the fox who tells him that it was hatred embodied. Lost in thought, B tells Naruto to lighten up as they continue on their path with renewed vigour.
