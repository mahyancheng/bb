Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Chōji
 demonstrates their clan's
Butterfly Mode
 to
Chōchō
, but she's uninterested in training it. He has to treat her sweet bean soup to get her to train. She tries it, but can't destroy a boulder like her father did. He stresses that as their clan's
hiden
 jutsu, she has to master it. He also notes that between her failing to go full power and her return to a fuller figure, she's not fully releasing her power. Chōji wonders about her motivation when she uses the jutsu. He and Chōchō go treat themselves, and are approached by
Anko
, who reminds Chōji that he's supposed to meet with
Shikamaru
. He leaves, and Anko joins Chōchō and they order more sweet bean foods. The shop owner says they've run out of sweet beans, and they haven't been able to resupply because of bandits stealing their deliveries. Bad harvests have increased the demands, so bandits are stealing beans to sell them at a higher price. Other shops are in similar situations. They're supposed to get a delivery the following day, so Anko and Chōchō decide to safeguard it. The delivery is attacked, and Anko stresses they must be careful not to damage the beans. Chōchō's
attack
 damages the road, causing the cart with the beans to fall, which triggers Chōchō's protection instinct, so she successfully uses the Butterfly Mode. Some of the bandits are amazed by Chōchō's jutsu. Anko gets trapped by debris from the road, and Chōchō is unable to get into Butterfly Mode to get through the debris.
 Anko tells her to use the beans and spare ingredients in the cart to make bean paste to
restore calories
 for her jutsu. The smell of the cooking beans leads the bandits to their location. Chōchō avoids them and eats the bean paste she cooked to recover calories. Thinking back to her father's words, Chōchō realises she wants to protect Anko and the beans, and uses the Butterfly Mode to defeat the bandits and free Anko. Back at
Konoha
, Chōchō's
team
-
mates
 and
Team 7
 learn of her capture of the bean thieves.
