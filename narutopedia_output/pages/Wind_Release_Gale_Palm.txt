A
Wind Release
 technique where the user either increases their velocity,
 or by the user clasping their hands together, wind is compressed and transformed into a powerful gale, which has enough force to knock over a person. When used in conjunction with
shuriken
 or
kunai
, the tools become more lethal as their speed is increased.
