Trivia

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of
Kochikame
, every series running in
Weekly Shonen Jump
 at the time hid
Kankichi Ryotsu
 somewhere in the chapter appearing in
Jump
 2006 #42. As such, Ryotsu appears on the fourth page of this chapter, peeking around the border of the panel in which Kakuzu attacks Shikamaru. He was removed in the volume release.

On one page, Hidan's
forehead protector
 was mistakenly depicted with a
Konohagakure
 symbol.
