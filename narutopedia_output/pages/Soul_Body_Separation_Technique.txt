With the aid of a tag, the user creates a seal which affects a certain area around it removing the
soul
 of the target from its body. The soul is sealed within the tag. If someone comes in contact with the tag or removes it from its place, the soul will be released. The soul is visible and audible to the person who touched the tag, but has no initial memory of their past life.
