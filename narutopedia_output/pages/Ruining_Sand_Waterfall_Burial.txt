Gaara
 creates a zigzag fissure of sand under the opponent. The zigzag fissure then erupts into the face of
Shukaku
 which devours and seals the opponent away in 200 metres of sand. Gaara will then place his hand on the ground and have the sand compacts itself with such a force that only a giant crater, 200 metres deep is left crushing the enemy into nothingness.
