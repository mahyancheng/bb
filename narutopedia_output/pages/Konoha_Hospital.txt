The
Konoha Hospital
 (
木ノ葉病院
,
Konoha Byōin
,
literally meaning:
 Tree Leaf Hospital) serves the medical needs of ninja and other villagers in
Konohagakure
. Though the
staff
 is skilled enough to treat most basic ailments,
Tsunade
 and other more advanced
medical-nin
 must step in to assist with severe injuries. Security for the hospital is apparently lax, as
Gaara
 is able to get into
Rock Lee
's room to try and kill him and Naruto managed to sneak out and get ramen. During
Pain's assault
 on the village, the hospital is overwhelmed by the number of casualties caused by
Pain
. It was also destroyed by Pain's
Shinra Tensei
. During reconstruction after the assault, a relatively rudimentary hospital was built. The kanji for "medicine" or "healing" (
医
,
ishi
) is printed on the front of the building.

Two years after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
,
Sakura Haruno
 formed a "Children's Mental Healthcare Clinic" within the rebuilt hospital, in order to treat children who were traumatised by the horrors of the war via low cost but highly effective therapy, in which
Ino Yamanaka
 also helped.
Kido Tsumiki
 considered this Clinic to be a poor choice due to low revenue.

Later, it was shown that the unit prospered and the children with mental and physical issues in Konoha decreased significantly.

After the modernisation of the village, the hospital was renovated to taller, and larger building.
