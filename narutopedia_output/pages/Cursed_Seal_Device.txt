juinjutsu
 created by Tosaka, which bestows the wielder heightened abilities, capable of making an individual with no ninja training strong enough to defeat those of a

Jūgo
’s
Sage Transformation
) to be the “ultimate Cursed Seal weapon”, prior to his utter defeat from Jūgo’s complete transformation.
