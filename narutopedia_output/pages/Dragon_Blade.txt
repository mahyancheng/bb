The
Dragon Blade
 (
龍刃
,
Ryūjin
) is a
sword
 wielded by Naruto in
Naruto Shippūden: Dragon Blade Chronicles
.

Abilities

This weapon has the ability to allow its wielder to perform any technique and allows them to use any of the basic
nature transformations
. The Dragon Blade also enables the user to cut and absorb their opponents' chakra, similar to
Samehada
. Finally, a very useful ability the sword has is to stay forcefully partial to its owner, so it is always trying to stay in connection to Naruto. However, it seems there is a limit to this ability, as it was gone for good after Naruto lost it in
Mount Koryū
. Using this blade is not without its drawbacks, though; in order to have complete control over the blade, the wielder must have exceptionally high levels of chakra. Naruto is able to wield the blade without drawbacks due to the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 inside of him.

Elemental Orbs

What gives the Dragon Blade the ability to use all of the basic elements are five orbs which are inserted into the centre. The orbs are coloured for their elements, similarly to
Kage
 hats; red for
fire
, green for
wind
, yellow for
lightning
, orange (instead of brown) for
earth
, and blue for
water
.
