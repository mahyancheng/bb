In the anime, Kaori tended to
Kakashi
 during his stay by hooking him to an IV. When she was asked by Kakashi about when he could eat solid food, Kaori answered he'd only get food intravenously, stating he couldn't move his body freely. She also stated that once Kakashi could move his arms and legs, he'd go on a liquid diet. Before she was about to leave, she told Kakashi that it'd still be quite a while for him to eat solid food, much to his dismay.
