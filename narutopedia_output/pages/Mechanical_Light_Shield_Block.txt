This technique is a
chakra
-based shield that is used to defend against attacks. This form of defence is usually installed into
puppets
, where the user opens their segmented arms and radiates chakra through to form a light blue, thin shield. While it is powerful enough to block
iron sand constructs
, the sand will still seep into the joints of the puppets, which will restrict their movements, and thereby, stop the technique from functioning.

Chiyo installed this shield into her own arm and into
the puppets
 designed like
Sasori
's parents.
Kankurō
 later installed one into
Sasori's puppet body
.
