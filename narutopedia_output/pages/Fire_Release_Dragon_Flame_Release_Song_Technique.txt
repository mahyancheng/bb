This is an advanced version of its
parent technique
. This technique allows the user to expel several dragon-headed fireballs from their mouth to cover the frontal, left, and right sides of the opponent. As the dragon-heads move in an erratic manner, it makes the technique much more difficult to avoid.

Trivia

The "hōka" (
放歌
) part of the technique's name is a pun on "hōka" (
放火
), which means "arson".

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
, during the boss fight against
Sasuke
, the latter expels numerous dragon fireballs.
