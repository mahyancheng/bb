Six Paths Senjutsu
 is a special form of
senjutsu
 used by
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 — the Sage of Six Paths — as well as his younger brother,
Hamura
.
 Hagoromo is able to grant Six Paths Senjutsu to others, as he did with his son,
Asura
, and later with his son's
reincarnate
,
Naruto Uzumaki
. It can also be obtained by
becoming
 the
jinchūriki
 of the
Ten-Tails
, as taking in the power of the nine
tailed beasts
 is the same as obtaining the power of the Sage of Six Paths himself.

Overview

Six Paths Senjutsu is suggested to have a connection with the pattern that appears on the user's back when it is used, consisting of a
Rinnegan
-like marking above nine
magatama
, which resembles the pattern on the back of Hagoromo's robe.
 The pattern that appeared on
Obito Uchiha
's back differed slightly from that of other known users, with the Rinnegan-like marking itself being shaped into a magatama.

As a form of senjutsu, this ability grants similar benefits to
Sage Mode
, though the user's
sensing
 capabilities are increased to a far greater extent, to the point where they can even sense shadows in the invisible world of
Limbo
.
 They also gain a complete comprehension of
chakra
, including the ability to use all five basic
nature transformations
 and make perfect use of
Yin–Yang Release
,
 as well as an almost unconscious mastery of the floating ability used by the Sage of Six Paths.
 When one awakens Six Paths Senjutsu, they also obtain a number of
Truth-Seeking Balls
.






Obito's unique pattern.



As the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki,
Obito
 and
Madara
 Uchiha displayed several other unique abilities, though it is unknown if these apply to Six Paths Senjutsu users in general. The two were entirely immune to the effects of
ninjutsu
, only being vulnerable to senjutsu and
taijutsu
,
 though techniques utilising
Six Paths Power
 could also damage them.
 They also possessed an extraordinary healing factor, capable of fully recovering from attacks that destroyed large portions of their bodies within seconds,
 with Madara even claiming to be immortal.
 Though taijutsu is viable, the sheer durability of Six Paths users means only
techniques
 of the
highest level
 have noticeable effect; Madara was merely pushed back by
Daytime Tiger
 without harm.
 Obito was capable of producing
chakra arms
 from the protrusions on his back, which were powerful enough to tear through the
Four Red Yang Formation
 with ease.
 Despite not previously possessing the
kekkei genkai
, Madara was able to use a
Storm Release

technique
,
 which he accomplished due to having Six Paths Power.

Naruto is able to make use of Six Paths Senjutsu while in his
Six Paths Sage Mode
, a form which he received from Hagoromo.
 When Naruto used this mode in conjunction with his
chakra cloak
 during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, he wore a unique shroud with the pattern associated with Six Paths Senjutsu on its back.
 According to
Sasuke Uchiha
, the Truth-Seeking Balls Naruto used in this form utilised what he called "
Six Paths Sage Chakra
" (
六道の仙人チャクラ
,
Rikudō no Sennin Chakura
), which allowed them to damage Madara's shadow.

Trivia

In a single panel in
chapter 656
, the back of Hagoromo's robe is depicted with the same pattern found on Obito's back, rather than the usual pattern.

In
Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu
, the cloaks worn by Hagoromo, Hamura, Madara (as the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki) and Naruto (in Six Paths Sage Mode) are known as
Six Paths Haori
 (
六道羽織
,
Rikudō Haori
).
