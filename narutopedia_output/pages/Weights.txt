A
weight
 (
重り
,
omori
) is a heavy object used for training by weighing down the user.
Rock Lee
 wears a pair of ankle weights with the kanji, meaning "guts" (
根性
,
konjō
), written on them. During the
Chūnin Exams
,
Might Guy
 told Lee to remove them while facing
Gaara
, which resulted in his speed being increased substantially. The weights are heavy enough to leave a small crater on the floor.

In Other Media

In the first three games from the
Ultimate Ninja
 series, Lee's weight appeared as an item that can be thrown on opponents to temporarily reduce their speed. It is named
Weight of Gut
 (
根性のおもり
,
Konjō no Omori
) in the
first
 and
second
 games and
Weight of Determination
 in later releases. In the fourth game onward it was replaced by a tag with the same effect, the weight having minor or no appearances afterwards.

In
Naruto the Movie: Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom
, Rock Lee wears heavy bars on his ankles. Besides their training purpose, those bars can also be combined into weapons like a pair of
nunchakus
, a
bō
 staff, and a long chain. Rock Lee used them in his fight against
Kongō
.
