This technique is the second part of
Gaara
's "
Absolute Defence
", his
Shield of Sand
 being the first part. As the name implies, Gaara covers his body in a layer of
sand
, wearing it like armour. Although it defends him from attacks that bypass his Shield of Sand, maintaining it consumes a great deal of
chakra
. Furthermore, it does not activate automatically like the Shield of Sand does (instead relying on Gaara to apply when needed), nor is it as resilient;
 wherever part of the Armour of Sand is struck, that section of it crumbles away. The sand itself also weighs Gaara down, slowing him and placing greater strain on his movements. Despite all this, the Armour of Sand's combination with the Shield of Sand is an effective one, enabling Gaara to go years without the slightest injury.
