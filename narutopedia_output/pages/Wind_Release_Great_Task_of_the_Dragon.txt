The user swings their
fan
 to the sky, causing a giant tornado to descend upon a target. This technique can be set up as a feint as it has a delayed activation. The technique alters weather conditions temporarily and attacks from the sky rather than from the person. The storm clouds that create the attack dissipate immediately after the tornado begins while the tornado continues in a highly concentrated state.

Trivia

The name of this technique and with its localised name in mind, is likely a play on the term "Tatsu no Otoshigo" (
竜の落し子
,
literally meaning:
 the dragon's bastard or fallen child), which is often used as a term for a seahorse or any similar species (as in Asian cultures, they were deemed to be a discarded dragon's offspring).
