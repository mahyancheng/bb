The
Sound Four
 summons each of their respective summons to barricade their opponents. While the
Triple Rashōmon
 makes escape difficult, the
Doki
 and
Earth Prison Golem
 attack from the front, while
Kyodaigumo
 attacks from above.

Trivia

Shijū (
四獣
) refers to the
four beasts
 of Chinese mythology. It may also be a reference to the four gods who rule over the four cardinal directions, similar to how each of the Sound Four members is associated with a cardinal direction.
