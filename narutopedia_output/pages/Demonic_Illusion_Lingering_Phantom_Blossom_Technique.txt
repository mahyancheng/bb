Kurenai creates an illusionary clone that charges towards the opponent, jumps and then explodes in a cloud of cherry blossom petals.

Trivia

In each of its appearances, the illusionary clone acts differently:

In
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3
, when the opponent gets within a certain distance, the clone charges at them with extreme speed.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3
 it automatically charges in which direction the user is facing.

In the
Ultimate Ninja Storm
 series, the clone slowly walks to the opponent until it bursts into a pink mist with scattered leaves. In
Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
 however, the clone instead explodes. Kurenai can also create three clones at a time.
