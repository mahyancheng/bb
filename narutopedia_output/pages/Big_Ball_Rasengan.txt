The
Big Ball Rasengan
 is a more powerful version of the
Rasengan
.

Overview

In the anime,
Naruto
 created the Big Ball Rasengan during his two-and-a-half years of training with
Jiraiya
; while training to break out of
genjutsu
, Naruto accidentally released his chakra and created a huge Rasengan.
 It uses the same concept of compressing spinning chakra in one's palm as in the original Rasengan, only increasing the amount of chakra involved. Because there is even more chakra being compressed to a higher density, the ball releases its energy immediately on contact, thus increasing its destructive power beyond the Rasengan's.
 In the anime, it is noted that one requires immense amounts of chakra to create a Big Ball Rasengan at all.

When Naruto first starts using the Big Ball Rasengan, he needs a
shadow clone
 to help him form and wield it.
 He is able to wield it with one hand when his skill with it improves, though he still needs a clone's help in its formation.

Usage and Improvement

Like the original Rasengan, Naruto improved the Big Ball Rasengan and created a
variant
 with his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
. The size and power of his Big Ball Rasengan also improved, with it growing to nearly half the size of the
Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan
.
 He can also add
Wind Release
 to it, to create the
Big Ball Rasenshuriken
.

Senjutsu Influence





Sage Art: Big Ball Rasengan.



When in
Sage Mode
, Naruto can use a
senjutsu
-enhanced version known as
Sage Art: Big Ball Rasengan
 (
仙法・大玉螺旋丸
,
Senpō: Ōdama Rasengan
,
English TV:
 Sage Art: Giant Rasengan). As with the original, Naruto uses a shadow clone to help him form the ball. With this senjutsu version, however, he can have a shadow clone form a Big Ball Rasengan in each of his hands, which he can then pass to the clones for them to wield. The Sage Art: Big Ball Rasengan is much larger than the original, almost being as big as
Pain
's
summons
.

Trivia

Minato Namikaze
's standard Rasengan occasionally matches the size of the initial Big Ball Rasengan. In fact, he could use this technique in
Jiraiya
's
novel
 within
Tsunade
's
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 dream.

By the end of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
,
Naruto
's regular Rasengan had increased to near Big Ball Rasengan size.

When Konohamaru used this technique in an
OVA
, he was able to use it with one hand.
