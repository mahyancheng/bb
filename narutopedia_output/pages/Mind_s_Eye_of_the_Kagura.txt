The
Mind's Eye of the Kagura
 is a technique that allows one to
sense
 chakra from exceptional distances in great detail. These sensory capabilities bless Karin with abilities that even surpass
dōjutsu
 with comparable powers.

Usage

By closing her eyes and opening her mind's eye, Karin is able to find and track chakra over a vast distance,
 as well as perceive any unusual chakra activity within a radius of several dozen kilometres. By focusing on a particular target, she can perceive its characteristics, location, and movements with great detail.
 She can even deduce its particular
nature
.
 These attributes afford her the ability to perceive fluctuations in a person's chakra made when they are moulding it, lying, or if someone, including herself, is under a
genjutsu
.

Trivia

The name comes from the word
Kagura
 (
神楽
,
divine entertainment
), which is a type of Japanese theatrical dance, considered by some to have been developed by the goddess
Ame-no-Uzume
. Its roots lie in certain kinds of divination and pacification of the spirits.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Kizuna Drive
, Karin's usage of this technique allows her to "automatically" dodge any weak attack for a limited period.
