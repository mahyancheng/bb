The
Parent and Child Rasengan
 is
cooperation ninjutsu
 where two shinobi — a parent and a child as the name suggests — combine their Rasengan to create a massive one.

Usage

Naruto and Minato's Version

Naruto and Minato, while both in
Tailed Beast Mode
, and Naruto in
Sage Mode
 as well, collaboratively create a
Rasengan
 of their
chakra avatar
's size, then ram it into the target. This attack was strong enough to push back
Obito Uchiha
 as the
Ten-Tails
'
jinchūriki
.

Naruto and Boruto's Version





Naruto and Boruto's combined Rasengan.



Boruto starts off by generating a tiny Rasengan. Clasping Boruto's hand, Naruto then adds his own chakra to the Rasengan, forming a gargantuan sphere, which dwarfs both of them in size. Boruto used this technique to kill
Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki
, on top of obliterating his
Rinnegan
-enhanced Rasengan and
Tailed Beast Ball
,
 as well as a
God Tree
.

Trivia

Though clearly not a normal Rasengan, it was simply called the Rasengan in the
Boruto
 manga and
Boruto: Naruto the Movie
.

In the novelisation of
Boruto: Naruto the Movie
 as well as the anime adaptation in
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
, the Rasengan that Naruto and Boruto created functioned the same as Boruto's
Vanishing Rasengan
 on a more powerful scale.

While transferring his chakra into Boruto's Rasengan, Naruto was also able to somehow
convey
 his memories of his past, detailing his suffering and struggles while fulfilling his dream to become Hokage.
