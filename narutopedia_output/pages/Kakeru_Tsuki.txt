 and the grandfather of

Background

Kakeru was the benevolent king of the
Land of the Moon
. His minister and friend,
Shabadaba
, showed greedy desire to take over as king, to which Kakeru saw but hoped that Shabadaba would one day understand the his noble vision of selflessness and generosity. As time went on, however, Shabadaba showed no improvement, and eventually, Kakeru accepted the advice of his soldiers and decided to deal with the corrupt minister. He sent his son and grandson overseas to protect them from the ensuing conflict.

At the time, Kakeru had also planned to using country's funds and reducing taxes to help the less fortunate, which did not stand well with Shabadaba. All of this led to the minister to betray the king, hiring the
Wandering Ninja Clan
 to assassinate him; the lower half of Kakeru's body was
petrified
 by
Ishidate
 as he and soldiers loyal to him were escaping from the overwhelming coup d'état; the majority of soldiers and the entire cabinet of ministers has sided with Shabadaba during the revolt.

Personality

He was also perceptive to know Shabadaba's ambitions, but was faithful to hope that he would one day see the error of his ways and change. However, Kakeru's faith was limited, as he would eventually accept his soldiers' advice to terminate Shabadaba's increasingly greediness.
