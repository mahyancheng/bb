"
Sasuke and Sakura
" (
SASUKE・SAKURA
) is episode 481 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

A young
Sasuke
 asks
Itachi
 to teach him
shurikenjutsu
. Itachi tells him he's busy, and suggests he asks their father. Sasuke takes Itachi's constant claims of business as proof he dislikes him. Itachi denies it, pokes him in the forehead, and tells Sasuke the next time their parents are off, he might have time to spend with Sasuke. At dinner, Sasuke asks them about it, and they confirm they'll be off visiting
Mikoto
's family.
 They offer to take Sasuke, and are surprised to learn Itachi said he'd teach Sasuke. The next day, Itachi trains Sasuke in throwing
kunai
. That night, Itachi makes them dinner. The two sleep outside.
Fugaku
 and Mikoto arrive the next day, and find Sasuke sleeping outside alone, Itachi having left to do something.

A young
Sakura
 runs through the forest. She reaches a hideout of sorts, where she keeps flowers and several hangings. She looks at herself in a mirror, and thinks about her hair. That night at dinner, her father suggests she have her bangs cut. Her mother says Sakura probably has reasons to keep her bangs. The next day, while picking flowers, she is approached by
Ino
. Ino gives her a ribbon to tie her hair with. Sakura is concerned about exposing her forehead, but Ino tells her people tease only because she tries hiding it. Sakura tells her parents she's made a friend. Sakura takes Ino to her hideout, where Ino rearranges her flowers. Sakura tells her about her crush on Sasuke, and the rumour he likes girls with long hair. Ino leaves abruptly. When speaking with other girls, Ino denies being Sakura's friend. Sakura tries talking to Sasuke, but is dismissed. Sakura begins training while Naruto watches her.

Trivia

A minor inconsistency in this episode is that Ino found out about Sakura's crush on Sasuke when they were alone. In the manga and an
earlier anime episode
, it was established they were with their other friends, and instead of Sakura openly confessing it, one of the other girls figured it out.
