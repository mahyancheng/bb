forehead protector
, part of it covering his left eye, and very thin eyebrows. He wears a black skin-tight suit underneath all of his clothing, which also covers his mouth and nose. He wears a light grey scarf around his neck, a light grey T-shirt over his suit, a blue-coloured strapped suit that acts as his pants and a shirt over his grey one. He wears his weapon holster on his right thigh and black
shinobi
 sandals.

Abilities

Kirisame could use
Water Release: Water Whip
 to make a rope out of water he could whip his opponents with, as well as restrain them. He was also skilled in taijutsu.

In the novelisation, Kirisame could make use of
water clones
, and could
create weapons out of water
 for both short and long-range combat. He could also use

, capable of channelling lightning chakra through his water whip to immobilise enemies.

Plot Overview

He was first seen with his team-mates (excluding Suien) and many other missing-nin. They attack Shizuku's mother in the forest. He then jumps out of the forest with his comrades. He knocks
Sakura
 unconscious and then takes
Shizuku
 and
Himatsu
 hostage. He along with
Hisame
 and
Murasame
 then attack
Naruto
 and Sasuke, but Sasuke launches a
fireball
 at them which Kirisame easily dodges while his comrades retrain Sasuke. The leader of their group now appears and tells him and the others to take Sasuke as a hostage as well. Kirisame later infiltrates Takigakure and takes all of its villagers hostage and will only release them for the Hero Water. He starts whipping the kids with his Water Whip so they will stop talking to
Shibuki
. After Suien takes down Naruto, Kirisame and the others proceed to beat Naruto so that he'll give up Shibuki's location. Shibuki then appears behind Kirisame and his two comrades and knocks them out with a powerful Water Release. He was revealed to be alive in the novel and captured by
Kakashi
 in the end.
