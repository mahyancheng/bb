Kinkaku
 (
金角
) was one of
Kumogakure
's infamous
Gold and Silver Brothers
 alongside
Ginkaku
, who were the most notorious criminals in the history of their village.

Background






Kinkaku and Ginkaku vs. Kurama.



During the
First Raikage
's reign, he and
Ginkaku
 were part of a team that was assigned to capture the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
, but the two were swallowed during the confrontation.
 However, they survived by eating the flesh of the beast, and thrashed inside the tailed beast's stomach for two weeks, eventually forcing the Nine-Tails to regurgitate them. Upon their escape, they both came out looking like
miniature versions
 of the beast, due to having acquired a portion of the fox's chakra.

During a peace treaty ceremony between
Konohagakure
's
Second Hokage
 and Kumo's
Second Raikage
, the two brothers staged a coup d'état that left the Hokage on the brink of death.
 During the
First Shinobi World War
, the Kinkaku force cornered the Second Hokage and his
Escort Unit
 — an altercation which ended in Kinkaku killing the Hokage. At some point, he met
Kakuzu
, and he was still alive after the appointment of the
Third Raikage
.
 For his crimes, he became one of the most notorious criminals in the history of Kumo.

Personality

Kinkaku and his brother are considered disgraces to Kumogakure due to their underhanded natures. They use deceit and betrayal indiscriminately in battle and will even attack their own comrades.
 He is also very prideful, and became angry when
Darui
 chastised them, proposing to his brother that they decimate their opponent; though he seemed to be more composed than Ginkaku. One of the few things that Kinkaku did seem to care about was his brother's well-being. During their fight with Darui, Ginkaku was sucked into the
Benihisago
, and in response Kinkaku went into his Version 2 state out of rage.

Appearance

Kinkaku was a burly shinobi with a muscular build and towering stature. He had light-coloured eyes with dark-coloured sclera,
 grey-toned skin (depicted as fair-coloured in the anime),
 as well as long, blond hair with prominent dark tips, arranged in a style reminiscent of a Native American
headdress
. These features are accentuated by the presence of two distinctive horns that emerge from the abundant hair on his head, as well as a rectangular marking on his nose. He also had whisker-like marks on his face.

His typical attire comprises of a standard Kumogakure
flak jacket
 that is black on the edges and worn over a purple, high-collared, sleeveless uniform. He wore a purple forehead protector and a pair of simple wrist-guards. The kanji for "gold" (
金
,
kin
) was tattooed upon the shoulder of his exposed left arm.

Abilities

The Gold and Silver Brothers were well-known for their prowess, causing a shinobi to tremble in fear when he saw them, and nearly led the
Fourth Raikage
 to disregard his duties as leader of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 in order to personally confront the pair. Alongside his brother, he appeared to be able to fully demonstrate the power of the
Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths
, which is said to surpass the
Five Kage
. By using that power in conjunction with the
Nine Tails
 chakra they brought
Tobirama Senju
 and the
Second Raikage
 to the brink of death in an ambush,
 and with the Kinkaku Force he later managed to kill Tobirama. Kinkaku's power alone nearly demolished the entire
First Division
 and inflicted massive casualties.
 Being a descendant of the
Sage of Six Paths
,
 it was believed this allowed him to survive eating
Tailed Beast
 flesh.

Treasured Tools

The brothers wielded the five
Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths
, all of which cost a large amount of chakra: enough to kill normal humans before they can utilise the tools properly. Despite this, they were capable of using these weapons regularly and for long periods of time to the point of being considered a
weapon specialist
. This showed them to have very immense reserves of chakra as their usage the Treasured Tools did not cause any fatal side effects, even before absorbing some of the Nine-Tails' chakra. By combining the Benihisago, Kōkinjō and Shichiseiken, they can capture their opponent's
word soul
 (
言霊
,
kotodama
) and body, sealing them away for good. The Bashōsen allows them to create any of the
five basic elements
.

Jinchūriki Transformations






Kinkaku's six-tailed form.



According to
Ao
, Kinkaku possesses
chakra
 traces of the Nine-Tails' mixed in due to them being swallowed and regurgitated by the Nine-Tails after surviving two weeks inside its stomach by eating some of its chakra-imbued flesh.
 Despite not being an actual
jinchūriki
, his chakra has similar strength and potency to the Nine-Tails', making him a
pseudo-jinchūriki
.
 Having eaten so much of Nine-Tails' flesh, Kinkaku is able to shroud himself in a demon cloak at any time and even enter a
Version 2 form
. In this form, can produce six tails with one tail vastly longer and thicker than the others. He also retains his consciousness, unlike most jinchūriki, who lost to their bestial instincts in this form.

Kinkaku can use his chakra tails to strike with great force and range, block a torrent of kunai with his tails, throw a
giant rolling tank
 aside and easily break out of the
Shadow Imitation Technique
 in seconds. In the anime, he emerged unharmed from a combined barrage of various
elemental ninjutsu
 and also displayed great speed and strength, being able to cut down several allied shinobi in an instant along with destroying the platform they were standing on. However, despite its similarity to Naruto's higher forms, it seems to lack the corrosive chakra cloak that Naruto gains in Version 2 and beyond.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Main article:
Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

In preparation for the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Kinkaku is
reincarnated
 by
Kabuto Yakushi
 to fight against the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. Emerging from the sea near the
Land of Lightning
's coast, alongside his
brother
 and among the
White Zetsu Army
, the two engage the opposing
First Division
. Confronted by
Darui
, he recognises that he had inherited the
Third Raikage
's
techniques
, indicating to Kinkaku that he must be rather strong.






Kinkaku attacks Darui, Samui and Atsui with Bashōsen.



In response to Darui's remark, he says that, since time had passed, even those from
Kumogakure
 had lost respect for them. After
Atsui
 and
Samui
 arrive, Kinkaku retrieves the
Bashōsen
 and
Shichiseiken
 from his mouth, giving the latter to his brother, whilst the
Kōkinjō
 wraps around his arm. Hitting both siblings with the rope, he draws out their word souls, so that Ginkaku can curse them. Reading the special word from the thrown
sword
, Kinkaku
burns
 Atsui's arm, which forces him to say his forbidden word, causing him to be sealed. While his brother takes Samui hostage, Kinkaku attempts to attack Darui, only to have his arm cut off. Darui then
attacks
 both brothers, freeing Samui, but coming into contact with the rope around Kinkaku's severed arm, which Kinkaku had kicked. He then cuts Darui's word soul and Ginkaku records it.

When Darui mistakenly utters his taboo word, he was inadvertently able to change his most said word whilst being sucked into the
Benihisago
, cancelling the sealing, unbeknown to the brothers. Disarming Ginkaku and knocking him into Kinkaku, Darui then commandeers the
other

tools
. Launching his
blade
 at the latter, he deflects the sword, only to be struck by another
bombardment
. Darui uses this opportunity to curse and seal Ginkaku, causing Kinkaku to go berserk and enter into his
six-tailed form
.






Kinkaku attacked by Chōji.



Although Darui apologises for Ginkaku, Kinkaku wreaks havoc on the battlefield, killing many despite
Chōza Akimichi
's efforts. Observing the
Kohaku no Jōhei
 in Darui's possession, he concludes that they were planning to seal him within it, before ambushing and almost killing Darui if not for
Kitsuchi
's
strike
. Deflecting a barrage of
kunai
, Kinkaku fails to see
Chōji Akimichi
's
attack
 coming, and as he is hit, he is able to grab ahold of Chōji and toss him away using strength alone. However, this was merely a distraction, so
Shikamaru Nara
 could
bind
 his shadow.






Kinkaku being sealed away.



Breaking free with ease, Kinkaku is instead
taken control
 of by
Ino Yamanaka
, when he tried to kill Shikamaru. Forcing him to respond to Darui's call, he begins to be drawn into the
pot
, just as Ino returns to her own body. As Kinkaku is being sealed, he laments how such fools could defeat him and his brother, but Darui retorts that even though gold and silver may shine brighter, a mass of copper coins can be worth more than one gold coin.

By nightfall,
Tobi
 arrived at the battlefield and took both the Benihisago and Kohaku no Jōhei, each containing one of the brothers inside, intending to use their
Nine-Tails
 chakra to help enact his
Eye of the Moon Plan
. During the fight between Tobi and Naruto, Tobi decided to move ahead with his plans and tossed the Kohaku no Jōhei with Kinkaku still inside the pot into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
.

Trivia

"Kinkaku" (
金角
) literally means "golden horn", and shares the same name as the
Kinkaku Force
, suggesting that Kinkaku was possibly its leader.

Both Kinkaku and his brother are likely based on two characters from the Chinese classic
Journey to the West
. In this story, Kinkaku and Ginkaku are two demon king brothers, known as the Great King Kinkaku (
金角大王
,
Kinkaku-daiō
) and the Great King Ginkaku (
銀角大王
,
Ginkaku-daiō
).

Kinkaku and Ginkaku are also temples in Kyōto, Japan. The Temple of the Gold Pavilion is called Kinkaku and the Temple of the Silver Pavilion is called Ginkaku.

When Kinkaku débuted in the anime, he was depicted without the plating on his nose seen in the manga.

In the anime, Kinkaku and Ginkaku were both seen with whisker-like marks on their faces before being consumed by Kurama.

(To Darui) "
How could the Two Lights be beaten by a bunch of no-name losers?
