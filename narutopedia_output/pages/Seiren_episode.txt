Kagura

Konoha
 shinobi back to
Kirigakure
, but is ordered to join the conflict.
Hebiichigo
 identifies a Funato on the approaching ship.
Team 7
 discusses their situation. They go back to their lodge, except for
Boruto
, who goes to see
Ikada
. He notices islanders commenting on
unusual black fog
.
Kajiki
 hears from shipbuilders that Ikada left early for the first time. In his room, Ikada goes over his designs, and is frustrated by
Seiren
 not understanding him. Seiren is generating the black fog, and orders
Funamushi
 to deal with Kagura, but take him alive as a bargaining chip, while she intends to dispose of Boruto herself. He
summons
 and deploys leeches, which infect Kirigakure shinobi, causing them to attack each other.
Buntan
 and
Kawaki
 are also infected. Seiren finds Boruto, but he anticipated trouble because of the black fog, and created
clones
 as precaution, asking who she is. She attacks with him a ray bow, firing chakra arrows, pursuing him as he flees.
Team 5
 is attacked by a controlled Kiri shinobi,
Metal Lee
 deals with him, the others going to check on Kajiki's dock upon hearing an explosion.
 Funamushi attacks Kagura while Hebiichigo watches, hoping that Kagura dies.
Iwabee

protects
 Kajiki and their ship on the dock, and attacks the
Funato clansmen
. Funamushi
battles
 Kagura. The controlled Kirigakure shinobi who Metal was fighting attacks Hebiichigo as she considers killing Kagura while he's focused on Funamushi. Metal protects her, and kills the leech controlling the shinobi. Funamushi tries to shake Kagura up by mentioning Seiren is targeting Boruto, but he defeats Funamushi and goes check on Boruto. One of Seiren's arrows hits Boruto, paralysing his arm. She tracks him by
sound
 with her bow, and fires another shot. Kagura blocks it with
Hiramekarei
. He explains to Boruto how Seiren fights. Kagura prepares to block her next shot, but she's able to change their path after firing them, and hits Kagura. He yells for Boruto not to help him, as she'll have a clear shot on him using Kagura as bait. Boruto rescues Kagura, the thunder outside throwing off her tracking, and explains this advantage they have to Kagura. Kagura wants to defeat her while there's still a thunderstorm, and volunteers to act as bait. Funamushi looks for Kagura, and hears him taunting Seiren. Seiren shoots at Kagura, who blocks it with Hiramekarei, allowing Boruto to confirm her location and distract her, so Kagura can get close to her and slash her. Funamushi is enraged, and blocks them with a
water wall
, carrying Seiren away. Everyone regroups. Buntan asks where Hebiichigo was. Kagura asks for the
swordsmen
 help. Someone notifies Ikada of something that causes him to rush out without his idea notebook. Kagura and
Denki
 find a paper where they fought with some sort of code in it. Funamushi takes Ikada to see Seiren, who is injured, but not in risk of dying. He says Kagura and Boruto were responsible, enraging him. Boruto wonders why Seiren thought of him as an enemy.
