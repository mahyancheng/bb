 (
コウ

 of

.

Background

Kō's younger sister died during the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
, which many believed to have been the doing of an
Uchiha
. For this reason, Kō was upset when
Itachi Uchiha
 was added to
Team Ro
, concerned that Itachi might try to undermine the team's task of monitoring the Uchiha clan's movements. Kō's team leader,
Kakashi Hatake
, disapproved of how he treated Itachi.
