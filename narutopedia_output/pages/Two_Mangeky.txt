Two Mangekyō

Naruto
 manga.

Summary

As
Kakashi
 and
Minato
 realise that
Obito
 has finally regained a sense of himself,
Madara
 tries to take
his left eye
 but his outstretched hand
phases
 through him. Locked in their subconsciousnesses, Obito tries to extract the
tailed beasts
 from their current
jinchūriki
's body and manages to acquire a fragment of
Shukaku
 and
Gyūki
's chakra. Ordering Kakashi to teleport
Naruto
 to the
other dimension
, Obito tries to go there himself but Madara manages to stop him by sending one of the
mysterious orbs
 flying towards him.
 As Kakashi rallies to Obito's side, the latter declares that the legend could now witness the power of a paired
Sharingan
. In a bid to stop them both simultaneously, Madara launches two of the orbs towards both of them, but the two
Mangekyō Sharingan
-wielders synchronise their Kamui, doubling the speed of Obito's dimensional transfer. Once in the other dimension a wary
Sakura
 allows Obito to start the
tailed beast transfer
. In the real world, Kakashi is saved from Madara's attack thanks to
Guy
. As Madara ponders the new appearance on the battlefield, Minato silently thanks Guy as well as asks Obito to take care of his son.

Trivia

In one panel, Madara is mistakenly depicted with Obito's
shakujō
, but it changes back to his version in the following pages. This was not corrected in the tankōbon version.

After Obito extracts fragments of the tailed beasts from Madara, the spike going through his left hand disappears, but later reappears when he enters Kamui's dimension. This was not corrected in the tankōbon version.
