Gaara can form a sand pillar using the
sand
 from the ground or by
warping
 the lower half of his body into sand. Gaara manipulates the sand to suspend and manoeuvres himself in mid-air at high speeds. The sand maintains contact with the ground, thus creating a pillar-like formation.

Trivia

In
Naruto Retsuden: Naruto Uzumaki and the Spiral Destiny
, it is revealed that Gaara is capable of building a sand pillar up to 200 kilometres high. But since he combined this pillar along with the stone pillar of
Kakashi Hatake
 and
Kurotsuchi
, as well as the wooden pillar of
Yamato
, it is unknown whether Gaara could reach this height on his own.
