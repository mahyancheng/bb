Tree Climbing Practice
 is a training method used to gain more skills with
chakra
 control. This training involves focusing a fixed amount of chakra to the bottom of one's feet, and using it to climb a tree without using one's hands. If the stream of chakra is too weak, the user will lose their footing on the tree and fall off. If it is too strong, the user will be pushed away from the tree, causing the tree to fracture around the point of contact and the user will fall. The concept of this exercise is similar to magnetics. This is evidenced when
Sasuke
 was able to attract a
kunai

Naruto
 threw his direction to his feet and then throw it at an enemy by kicking the kunai while releasing his chakra's hold on the kunai.

Trivia

According to
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm
,
Sunagakure
