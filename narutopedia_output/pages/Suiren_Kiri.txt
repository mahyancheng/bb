Suiren
 (
スイレン
,
Suiren
) was a
kunoichi
 of
Kirigakure
.

Background






Suiren sacrificing her life in order to protect Ganryū.



Ten years prior to the formation of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, Suiren was part of
Ganryū
's
team
 that was tasked with retrieving a scroll along with a team from
Iwagakure
 taken by
Kumogakure
 shinobi. After retrieving the document, Suiren was excited for the prospects of peace that a mission like this would bring. She was, however, wrong as Iwagakure betrayed them. After
Junsai
 was killed, Suiren sacrificed herself in order to protect Ganryū. This incident which came to be known as the
Tragedy of Yosuga Pass
 marked the beginning of hostilities between Kirigakure and Iwagakure.

Personality

Suiren was a kind and loving person, who dearly held onto the ideals of peace. After their mission was seemingly completed, she spoke openly of what an alliance like this between Kirigakure and Iwagakure would mean for the shinobi world. She deeply loved her teammates, as seen that she didn't mind protecting Ganryū from a barrage of kunai despite having been severely wounded earlier.

Appearance

Suiren had brown eyes and long blonde hair with two long strands framing her heart-shaped face and going down to her chest. She wore a pair of turquoise earrings along with the standard attire of the Kirigakure-nin complete with
forehead protector
 and
flak jacket
, along with the jade-green bangle that was worn by her team.

Abilities

Although almost nothing is known of her abilities, she has been seen to be very fast being able to intercept several thrown
kunai
 and shield her teammate.

Legacy

After her death,
Ganryū
 decided to avenge his two teammates, leading a group of shinobi who also held a hostility against Iwagakure. The
Third Tsuchikage
, knowing that Ganryū held a hostility against
Iwagakure
, ordered
Kurotsuchi
 and
Akatsuchi
 to retrieve her bangle, in order to apologise for what happened ten years ago. Because Akatsuchi was wounded in his fight with Ganryū,
Chōjūrō
 gave the bangle to him instead. Later, her plans for peace in the ninja world were passed on by Ganryū, to
Naruto Uzumaki
.

Trivia

Suiren (
スイレン, 睡蓮
) literally means "
water lily
".

Quotes

(To
Ganryū
 and
Junsai
) "
If this mission is a success, we will show the rest of the lands that there is solidarity between
Iwagakure
 and
Kirigakure
. That way we can get a little bit closer to peace.
"

(Last words to Ganryū) "
I wish I could have seen… peace…
