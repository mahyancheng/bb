"
Raging Tailed Beast
" (
荒れ狂う尾獣
,
Arekurū Bijū
) is episode 99 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Following
Sasori
's demise,
Tobi
 is partnered with
Deidara
 as the duo begin their hunt for the
Three-Tailed Turtle
. By the lake,
Yūkimaru

releases his chakra
 and summons the Three-Tails while
Kabuto
 exclaims that their plan has succeeded.

In the woods,
Rinji
's bats report to him that there are more
shinobi
 pursuing them. In order to thin the herd, he asks
Kihō
 to use his
Wrist Launcher
 to deploy a smokescreen. Before the
group
 can dive into the smokescreen,
Shino
,
Kiba
 and
Akamaru
 detect a strong
chakra
 coming from the lake. Kakashi notifies them that their goal is to head to the lake and thus sends
Naruto
 on his own, relying on Naruto's adept survival capabilities and his unpredictable manoeuvers, while the others deal with
Team Guren
 inside the smoke.

Yūkimaru passes out from overexertion while Kabuto orders
Guren
 to restrain the Three-Tails. With
Gozu
 providing reinforcement, Guren uses her
Crystal Release: The Gods' Crossings Technique
 to repress the
tailed beast
, although to no avail. Eventually, Guren manages to trap the beast with her
Crystal Release: Jade Crystal Wall Eighth Formation
. Meanwhile, Naruto traipses through the fog and ends up falling off a cliff and plummeting into the water, leaving him to
summon

Gamatatsu
 and
Gamakichi
 in order to save him. Riding on Gamatatsu, the trio wade through the water until they reach the encased beast, and Gamakichi fearfully notifies Naruto that it is none other than the Three-Tailed Turtle. Naruto also spots Yūkimaru and realises that Yūkimaru's "home" was Guren and Kabuto. As the Three-Tails makes contact with Naruto, it breaks out of its confines and begins its rampage.

Back on land, Guren's team prepares to ambush the search team from above when
Hinata
, using her
Byakugan
 to spot them, warns them of the attack. She, along with
Sakura
 and
Sai
, counter the ambush and force Team Guren to retreat. Kakashi senses something amiss as the Three-Tails begins its rampage and the smokescreen clears away, only to reveal a large body of water headed their way. In the lake, Guren attempts to strike the tailed beast but fails, and in an attempt to protect her, Yūkimaru unleashes his chakra once more in order to control and subdue the turtle. As both he and Guren fall into the water, Guren saves both of them. Yūkimaru then takes Guren's body to shore and promises her that this time it would be he who holds her hands.
