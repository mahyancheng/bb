"
Sasuke's Susanoo…!!
" (
サスケの"須佐能乎"…!!
,
Sasuke no "Susanoo"…!!
) is chapter 478 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Danzō
 recognises
Itachi
 as a product of
Sasuke
's
genjutsu
, though it's vastly inferior to the older brother's
Tsukuyomi
. He restrains Sasuke and tells him as much, which makes Sasuke angry enough to finally complete his
Susanoo
. Susanoo fires an arrow at Danzō, who is forced to use the
Wood Release
 abilities that he gained from the implanted DNA of
Hashirama
 to avoid the attack. Since this means he would have died, Sasuke assumes Danzō is now vulnerable and attacks again, only for him to once again survive the attack after seeming to die.
Tobi
 conduces that Danzō is using
Izanagi
.
