This is a team of shinobi from
Benisu Island
. They are first seen when they are encountered by
Naruto Uzumaki
,
Sakura Haruno
,
Ino Yamanaka
 and
Chōji Akimichi
 on
Nanakusa Island
. At this time, the four
Konohagakure
 ninja are attempting to collect ingredients (for medical purposes) for
Tsunade
. Team Bandō interferes with the latter's ingredient collecting (including medicinal herbs and red newts, although they first claim to only be after medicinal herbs and they don't mention the red newts) saying that they need them to protect themselves (a minor country) during the upcoming
war
. The three are all skilled with their
abacuses
, using them as skateboards, and are skilled enough with them to slide across a plain of geysers with randomly erupting toxic gas and reach the other side unharmed.
Bandō
, the supposed leader of the trio, was able to decipher a safe path after watching Naruto's
shadow clones
 run through the field in an attempt to reach the other side. The other two members also seemed to know the path that Bandō figured out since they followed him, but it is possible that they were simply just following him.
