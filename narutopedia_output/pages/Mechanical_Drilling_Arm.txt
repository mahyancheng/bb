This mechanical drilling arm device is, as its name implies, an arm-mounted weapon. Acting as a gauntlet, the hand of the device consists of a mildly conical-shaped palm with five long fingers. The hand section spins independently of the rest of the gauntlet and can be launched on a long cable before being retracted. It can be used to dig multiple holes, through which a person could dive underground and surprise the opponent. This drilling device was powerful enough to fatally injure any opponent with one single blow. It can also create trenches large enough for a large sail-boat to go through and create a cave in one shot.
