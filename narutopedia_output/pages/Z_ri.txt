 (

) is a
samurai
 from the
Land of Waves
. He and his partner,
Waraji
, were mercenaries hired by
Gatō
 to be his personal bodyguards.

Background

Zori was present during
Kaiza
's execution where he executes him with a slash.

Personality

Zōri, contrary to his partner, seems to be the calmer of the two though he seems to be just as cruel willing to kill Inari, but like his partner, he smiled when he broke into
Tazuna
's house. He has been described as a loyal individual that enjoys gambling.

Appearance

Zōri is a light-skinned man with bluish-white hair and black eyes. Lined markings are tattooed under his eyes. He commonly wears a dark purple hat on this head, the top of which extends far beyond the top of his head. Zōri also wears a blue jacket with multiple pockets and tied to his waist is his blue handled katana. He appears virtually unchanged in Part II.

Abilities

Zōri is capable of using his sword to perform
Iaidō
, a swift attack that's meant to kill the enemy with one move.
 In the anime, he was also able to knock Tsunami out with one punch and his swordsmanship was good enough to defeat several of Naruto's
shadow clones
.

Part I

Prologue — Land of Waves

Prologue — Land of Waves






Haku attacks Zōri and Waraji before they can react.



Zōri was first introduced, alogside his partner
Waraji
, as
Gatō
 came to lecture
Zabuza
 about his failed mission to kill
Tazuna
. As they were about to attack Zabuza, Gatō stopped them since he wanted to keep questioning him. When Haku almost crushed Gatō's arm and warned him not to touch Zabuza, Zōri and Waraji were going to attack him, but instantly found themselves almost killed by their own swords held by Haku. Haku then warned them that he was angry.

Gatō ordered Zōri and Waraji to kidnap
Tsunami
 to force Tazuna, Tsunami's father and the bridge builder, to stop building his bridge. When Waraji threatened to kill Tsunami's son
Inari
, Tsunami also threatened to kill herself unless they let him go. Since Zōri was told by Gatō that they only needed one hostage, they leave Inari alone and proceed to take Tsunami to the bridge. However, Inari (remembering what Kaiza told him) ran to save his mother. Ultimately,
Naruto
 came and got Tsunami away from Gatō's men. Both Zōri and Waraji were then defeated by Naruto's
shadow clones
 and were tied up and left there.

In the anime, after Team Kakashi had left the Land of Waves, Zōri and Waraji did not leave the Land of Waves, but instead bided their time in an attempt to get revenge. They kidnap Inari,
Akane
 and some of the other children but once again their efforts are foiled by Team Kakashi and the villagers who rise up against them.

Later on, Suigetsu and Zōri bump into each other again. He attempts to flee again, but is quickly captured by the two and taken to a back alley in an attempt to interrogate him.
