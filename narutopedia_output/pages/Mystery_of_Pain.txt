"
Mystery of Pain
" (
ペインの謎
,
Pein no Nazo
) is episode 160 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

At
Mount Myōboku
,
Naruto
 wonders whether the
Akatsuki
 would ever attack
Konoha
 just to find him, while
Fukasaku
 assures him that no such thing would happen; even if it did,
Kōsuke
, the messenger
toad
, would alert them. Fukasaku then decides to begin training on the third and final step to using
Sage Mode
 in battle — fusing Fukasaku on his shoulder.

In Konoha,
Danzō
 alerts his
Anbu

Root
 unit that they would be hiding underground until
Pain's assault
 comes to an end, adding that they would not be providing any support as the village's crisis would result in his promotion to
Hokage
, and thus any casualties would be considered as sacrifices for the greater good.

Meanwhile,
Inoichi
 continues his interrogation and probing of
Yūdachi
's mind, finding a memory in which Yūdachi and
Ryūsui
 delivered a corpse to
Konan
, who was to deliver it to
Pain
 himself. The
Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force
 is then attacked by Pain's
Animal Path
, who summons a
Giant Rhino
 to destroy the building. Inoichi recognises her as the corpse in Yūdachi's memories, and flees with
Ino
 and
Shizune
, who are protected by
Katsuyu
; Shizune, however, wonders how this Pain is able to
summon
 when
Jiraiya
 had already defeated the one that could.
Ibiki
 and the others decide to attempt defeating the Animal Path, who summons a
Giant Ox
, a
Giant Multi-Headed Dog
 and a
Giant Snake-Tailed Chameleon
. The Anbu unit
attempts

to

defeat
 the dog, only for it to survive and continue its rampage.

Ibiki traps the Giant Rhino using his
Summoning: Iron Maiden
 technique while binding the Animal Path and summoning a
torture chamber
. He attempts to use pain to extract information, only to realise that the Path's body is cold and responsive as a corpse. Easily breaking free of the shackles, Pain tells Ibiki that he shall know what true pain is, and proceeds to use his stomach as a conduit to summon a
Giant Drill-Beaked Bird
. The Anbu unit
attempts

to defeat
 the giant multi-headed dog
once more
, only for the dog to break free again; the giant rhino also breaks free of the Iron Maiden.

Back at Mount Myōboku, Fukasaku attempts to fuse with Naruto, only for the
Nine-Tailed Fox
 to reject him, forcing Naruto find an alternate method of acquiring
natural energy
 during battle.
