Naruto Shippūden: Ninja Destiny 2
 is a
Nintendo DS
 game. It is the second part of the
Naruto: Ninja Destiny
 series.

Gameplay

It has all the characters from the first
Ninja Destiny
 game, along with
Shippūden
 characters. A version with all of the Part II elements removed was released in Europe under the title "
Naruto: Ninja Destiny 2
" with an original story and alternate new characters that wouldn't appear elsewhere until
Naruto Shippūden: Ninja Destiny 3
.

New to the game are explorable maze-like levels that appear in the story mode, as well as a dungeon crawler style mode with RPG-style random enemy encounters. There is also an unlimited battle mode, where the player endlessly fights random CPU-controlled opponents until the fighter dies or decides to quit.

The story mode follows the
Kazekage Rescue Mission
 and the
Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission
.
