Gameru
 (
ガメル
) is a ninja who possesses one of
Iō
's prototype ninja tools,
Dakō
.

Personality

Gameru is a carefree individual. He is one to underestimate his opponents based on their appearance, but at the same time recognised
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Neji Hyūga
 as excellent fighters at
close range
, realising that it was necessary to keep a distance with them. He is also very self-confident and eager to acquire powerful new weapons. Gameru is dismissive of
Konohagakure
, claiming that after
Orochimaru
's
attack
, the
country
 had become weak due to which he and
Kusune
 did not even encounter obstacles at the border.

Appearance

Gameru has black, almond shaped eyes and long brown hair, which he keeps in a high ponytail. He wears a grey hood, which covers his lower face and a dark red, short sleeved kimono over mesh armour.

Abilities

Not much is known about Gameru's abilities other than that he showed some skill in close combat with the use of Dakō and was capable of fighting against Naruto Uzumaki and Neji Hyūga, who are known for being rather skilled in close combat themselves. He also appeared to be proficient with the
Enclosing Technique
, using it to store his weapon.

Part II

Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha

Along with his partner, Kusune, Gameru went to Iō to get ninja tools but he refused to give his tools to outsiders. Gameru and Kusune fought Naruto Uzumaki and Neji Hyūga, who were no match against Iō's ninja tools. When Iō lent
Tenten
 his latest invention,
Jidanda
, Tenten easily defeated them.

Trivia

Written as がめる, Gameru means "to greedily try to win big" or "to steal".
