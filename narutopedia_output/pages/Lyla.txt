While walking around in her village, Lyla spotted a
man
 asking citizens if the
Sage of Six Paths
 had ever visited the country during his time. Lyla followed Sasuke, wondering why he would be asking about the Sage. As she introduced herself, thieves passed by them, who had stolen from her
mother
. After the thieves had been stopped by Sasuke, Lyla and Kail brought Sasuke to their home. Before he could ask them his question, Kail asked Sasuke if he would be willing to marry Lyla, to which the latter responded stating he had his
own

family
.
