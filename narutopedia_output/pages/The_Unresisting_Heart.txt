 manga.

Summary

Tsunade
 checks on an unconscious
Naruto
. Because of his week of intense training, she concludes he will sleep for several days. Knowing that he hadn't mastered the
Rasengan
 and believing it now impossible for him to do so before the challenge deadline, Tsunade begins to leave.
Shizune
 tries to convince her not to help
Orochimaru
 and goes so far as to face off with Tsunade, but she is easily bested and knocked unconscious. As Orochimaru and
Kabuto
 head towards the meeting place, Orochimaru remembers Shizune's earlier actions and sends Kabuto to eliminate her. The next morning Naruto wakes up Shizune, the
Nine-Tails
 within him having healed his injuries faster than the two women expected. Shizune tries to pursue Tsunade but is stopped by
Jiraiya
, who has been drugged by Tsunade and is having difficulty moving. Noticing Kabuto, Jiraiya questions Shizune about Orochimaru's secret arrangement with Tsunade. At
Tanzaku Castle
, Tsunade offers to heal Orochimaru's arms if he will promise to leave
Konoha
 alone. He agrees.
