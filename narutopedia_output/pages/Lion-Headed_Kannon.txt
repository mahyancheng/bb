The
Lion-Headed Kannon
 is used by
Chiyo
 as a means for using the
Sealing Technique: Lion Closing Roar
. It is kept inside one of the puppets from the
Puppet Collection of Chikamatsu
. It starts out as a small ball that can be held in one's hand, but when thrown grows out into a man-sized lion's head with thirty-two large fangs and a mouth which is wide open. If aimed correctly, the tool will pin the target against a wall with its mouth, making them unable to move.
