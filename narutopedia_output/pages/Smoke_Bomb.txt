A
smoke bomb
 (
煙玉
,
kemuridama
) creates a cloud of smoke when it detonates. It may look like small spheres wrapped in paper or they can be more conventional canisters. Smoke bombs are typically used to blind opponents and make them easier to attack. Alternatively, ninja can use smoke bombs on themselves so that opponents cannot see what they are doing.

Smoke bombs are not limited to actual smoke, and in fact can contain any sort of gas, such as
poison
 or a sleeping agent.
 In
Kakashi Retsuden
,
Kakashi Hatake
 uses a special smoke bomb that alters the senses of those caught in it, making them believe they're under the effects of a
genjutsu
. In the anime,
Hiruga
 uses a smoke bomb made of perfume which makes targets easy to track and detect.
