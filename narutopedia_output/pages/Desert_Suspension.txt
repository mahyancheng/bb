Gaara
 uses
sand
 to create a platform capable of supporting his weight, which he keeps suspended in the air with his
chakra
. One of the simpler purposes for this technique is as a defence, lifting Gaara out of reach of attacks.
 While airborne, Gaara can still use his other techniques, such as forming his
Shield of Sand
 around the platform for additional protection.
 This technique can also be used for transportation, enabling Gaara to travel around quickly. Platforms can be made larger to support allies alongside him, or Gaara can give allies their own platforms.

Shinki
 performs this technique using
Iron Sand
.
