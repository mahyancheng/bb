Sasuke's Answer
" (
サスケの答え
,
Sasuke no Kotae
) is episode 370 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

As
Hashirama
 concludes the story of his battle with
Madara
 and his vision of the village, he tells those present on site that he did not know how Madara
survived
 after their battle.
Sasuke
 iterates how ironic it was that his brother
Itachi
, who was from the
Uchiha clan
, and had never heard Hashirama's story directly from the source, was the one who had inherited his
will
 so strongly.
 However,
Tobirama
 notes that there had been several Uchiha throughout history which had transcended the limitations of their clan and put the village first; one such shinobi included his former subordinate
Kagami Uchiha
. The Second Hokage notes he had to find a way to mediate between clans and the village's well-being. In turn, both the
Third
 and
Fourth
, note that they had fallen short of their predecessor, and the expectations people had of them respectively. Having heard all he needed from the Hokage, Sasuke comes to the conclusion that the village and people that Itachi sacrificed his life to protect should not be
wasted
, and decides to enter the battlefield in order to follow his brother's will, with
Orochimaru
 following out of interest. Motioning to Tobirama to prepare to
transport
 them, Tobirama informs his brother that they could not do so because they were bound. As they left the
Naka Shrine
, Suigetsu expresses his disinterest in the battle and tries to slip away, only to be met by a kick from
Karin
. She then yells at Sasuke for stabbing her but fails to contain herself when Sasuke apologises, and forgives him. As the Hokage prepare to make their way to the main battlefield, Hashirama directs his fellow Hokage to their respective faces on the
Hokage Rock
 before expressing his curiosity as to what his old friend had been up to. Tobirama declares that he will stop Madara for good, and Hiruzen vows to go all-out this time. Minato, delighted that he will meet his
son
, promises to make up for not being there with a gift.

Trivia

Sasuke's flashback to when Itachi told him he was weak because he lacked enough hatred aligned more with the manga, in which Itachi told Sasuke this after he cast Tsukuyomi on Sasuke and Jiraiya casting the
Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind
. In
Naruto
 episode 85, Itachi told Sasuke this before either technique was cast.

There was a meteorological inaccuracy at the conclusion of Hashirama and Madara's battle. The sky was shown to be clear with some clouds floating around but it was raining. When raining, clouds cover the entire sky. This inaccuracy was not present in the manga.
