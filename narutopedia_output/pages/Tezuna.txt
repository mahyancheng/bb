Tezuna
 (
手綱
) is a hostess at
Make-Out Club Battle
 in
Amegakure
 and
Ryūsui
's wife.

Personality

Tezuna seems to be fond of cows given her chosen attire. She appeared to be a kind individual, helping strangers and referring to Ryūsui as her "hubby". She thought of Ryūsui as a bit of a cheapskate, seen when he said he got her a gift and she thought it was another cheap thing from Shibuki Bridge. She, like many others in Amegakure, would attempt to never speak of
Hanzō
.

She has long blonde hair and grey-coloured eyes. She wears a white dress with cow patterns on it and a pair of white gloves. She wears a pair of blue-purple coloured pearl earrings. Her hair is tied into two buns in the back which are held in the bun by a orange-coloured elastic and she has a small strand of her hair hanging down each side of her face by her ears. She wears a cow necklace around her neck and it's string is yellow.
