Hibachi
 (
ヒバチ
) is a former
academy student
 of
Konohagakure
, assigned to
Iruka Umino
's class.

Background

Hibachi was one of the children that took part in Kiba's race for candy.

Hibachi picked on
Naruto Uzumaki
 when he failed to perform the
Clone Technique
 but was stopped by Iruka, saying not to bother with a kid like him. Later, he and his friends refused to let Naruto go with them to perform a test of courage in the
Konoha Cemetery
. As a payback, Naruto scared him, wearing a mask and cloak pretending to be a fox demon. Humiliated, Hibachi decided to get revenge on Naruto and tells him that he could join their group if he went to the hills where his father had just returned from a mission, find a corpse, and bring one of its belongings as a test of courage. Overjoyed with the possibility of finally making friends, Naruto agreed. However, the whole bet was a trick, as Hibachi's father had told him that there might still enemy ninja in the hills. When Iruka asked if anyone had seen Naruto, Hibachi lied and claimed that he didn't. Fortunately,
Shikamaru Nara
 heard the whole thing and informed Iruka, claiming that Hibachi's tricks were annoying.

Appearance

Hibachi has a short crop of light brown hair and stone-coloured eyes.
