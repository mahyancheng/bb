This article is about the summit. For the story arc, see
Five Kage Summit
.

A
Five Kage Summit
 (
五影会談
,
Gokage Kaidan
,
literally meaning:
 Five Shadow Summit) is a meeting of all the
Kage
 to discuss matters affecting their respective countries and the world at large. When a Kage wishes to meet with their fellow Kage, they notify the others of a time and place to convene as well as how many bodyguards they may bring. Travel and mission restrictions are placed on all shinobi who will not be attending the meeting in the days before, during, and after so that no village can work against another while their Kage are gone.

Known Meetings

Tailed Beasts





The first ever Kage Summit is convened.



The first ever Kage Summit was convened in an unknown location by the
First Hokage
. In an attempt to balance the power between the villages and as a sign of goodwill,
Konohagakure
 intended to distribute the
tailed beasts
 it had acquired to the other villages. The Kazekage, however, noted that
Sunagakure
 already had
a tailed beast
 within their possession and instead asked for an alternative payment of a portion of the fertile land of the
Land of Fire
, their closest neighbour, and 30% of the asking price from each of the tailed beasts that the other nations would pay for. Most present were outraged by this and threatened war against Sunagakure, but the Hokage was able to quell their rage by speaking of his hopes for the future of the shinobi.

The Kage Summit convened in the Land of Iron.



Many decades after the first Kage Summit, another is convened in the
Land of Iron
 by the
Fourth Raikage
. As a result of
Akatsuki
's growing activity in recent months to capture the tailed beasts and their
jinchūriki
, the Raikage wishes for the villages to unite against Akatsuki. Because many of the villages had employed Akatsuki in the past, the Raikage asks the Land of Iron's leader,
Mifune
, to mediate. Decades of conflict and competition between their villages make some of the Kage reluctant to cooperate or to admit Akatsuki is a real problem. It is only from the Hokage's revelation that Akatsuki is led by "
Madara Uchiha
" that the Kage see a threat.

Mifune suggests that the Kage form a coalition to oppose Akatsuki with the Hokage as its leader, citing the fact that only Konoha's tailed beast has yet to be captured. It is soon discovered that the Hokage is
manipulating
 Mifune, prompting him to flee with his bodyguards when the meeting is attacked by
Taka
, an Akatsuki-affiliate. "Madara" confronts the remaining Kage shortly afterwards and, after failing to convince them to surrender their jinchūriki, he declares the start of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. The four Kage and Mifune band together as the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 in order to confront Akatsuki, with the Raikage as its leader. They also decide to invite Konoha's help by approaching
Kakashi Hatake
, not trusting the Hokage in light of his actions.

Moon Collision






The Kage Summit convened.



Two years after the Fourth Shinobi World War ends, the
Sixth Hokage
 called an emergency Kage Summit to discuss how to handle the imminent crashing of the
Moon
 into the Earth. At the first and apparently only one of these meeting where the Kage meet in person, they are given
clocks
 to help them plan countermeasures and get their people to safety. In the final hours of the crisis the Kage have several telecommuted conferences to discuss efforts to stop the moon. Because Konoha's
Hanabi Rescue Team
 is on the moon, all but the
Fourth Raikage
 agree to delay Kumo's
Chakra Cannon
 from destroying it so that the team, specifically
Naruto Uzumaki
, can have a chance to complete their mission.

Kaguya Meeting






The Kage Summit convened.



Several years later, a Kage Summit is convened in Konohagakure by the
Seventh Hokage
. One of the matters brought up by
Sasuke Uchiha
 was
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
's reasoning for the creation of her
White Zetsu Army
, which he hypothesised that there is possibly a bigger threat than her which could appear promptly. It was decided that the information was to be kept secret between the Kage and
others
 present, in order to not cause a panic.

Chapter 700 Meeting






The Kage Summit convened.



Several years after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, another Kage Summit is convened in Konohagakure by the Seventh Hokage. It is unknown what matters were discussed at the summit. It seems that in this version of the meeting, the tensions between the villages have practically become nonexistent, even to a point where the Kage of the villages who once utterly despised each other would agree to meet within one of the Kage's hidden villages in a seemingly casual manner.
