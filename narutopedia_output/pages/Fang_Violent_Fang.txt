Like the original version of
Fang Passing Fang
, Akamaru becomes Kiba through
Beast Human Clone
 but instead of jumping off his back and then attacking, Akamaru jumps from Kiba's back towards the enemy and uses Passing Fang to launch the enemy into the air, then he and Kiba do the same several times on the airborne enemy, then attack several more times as they fall.
