With Shinki's chakra coating Araya's blade, he can manipulate the latter's
Iron Sand
 through the use of Wind Release. Because
Ryū
 is modeled from Shinki, Araya was able to use the jutsu to free others manipulated by the same material.

Trivia

This technique was developed by Shinki in his goal to protect his adoptive father,
Gaara
.
