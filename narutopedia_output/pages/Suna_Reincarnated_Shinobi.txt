This shinobi was reincarnated by
Kabuto Yakushi
 to steal the KIA scroll during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

Personality

He was a violent man who enjoyed fighting. Despite being controlled by Kabuto, he was glad to be brought back, even expressing a desire to keep fighting the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. He was overconfident due to his reincarnated body, feigning distress when being injured to mock his opponents, and disrespecting his own teammates over differences of opinion.

Appearance

He was a tall and muscular man with dark skin, whose face was painted white and red in the style of a
kabuki mask
. He wore the standard
Sunagakure
 flak jacket over his bare torso, brown pants and a pair of sandals, as well as gloves and a forehead protector.

Abilities

In life, he was remarkable enough that Kabuto decided to reincarnate him. He was significantly burly,  enough to push back three shinobi at once and wielded a long-handled axe. Unencumbered by injuries over his condition, he was able to fight recklessly, killing many opponents with his overwhelming strength. He could also create a
shadow clone
.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Kabuto reincarnated him and a Kumo shinobi to assist Hayate Gekkō in retrieving a KIA scroll containing intel sensitive casualties, such as kekkei genkai bearers. He and the Kumo shinobi engaged in combat with the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
 while Hayate retrieved the scroll. On their way back to Kabuto, they were intercepted by a team lead by
Sukui
. He used a shadow clone to fight
Sakura
 and
Yokaze
, injuring the latter with his axe. When he was injured by Sakura,
Iō
 placed a huge rock with a
Sealing Tag
 on top of him, sealing him.

Later, with the release of the Impure World Reincarnation technique, a light of sorts encased his sealed body as the technique was dispelled and his soul was returned to the
afterlife
