Bikōchū Search Mission

Bikōchū Search Mission

Years after the Kamizuru clan's fall, Jibachi and his siblings travelled to the breeding grounds of the Bikochu, hoping they could expose the bug to some of their grandfather's belongings and then have it track down his forbidden scrolls. When they learned
Shino Aburame
 had led a team to the area to search for the bug as well, they waited patiently for their opponents to reveal the bug, though they had no clue that the foes were already aware of their presence.
Hinata Hyūga
 helped her team find the insect and then the Kamizuru struck. Jibachi and the others captured Hinata and made a proposal to Shino's team that they could get Hinata back in return for the bikōchū. Jibachi and his elder brother
Kurobachi
 had Hinata encased in bee wax and placed her in a raging river. She was attached to the riverbank by a thin string; if any move was made to escape, waiting bees would cut the string and send Hinata into the water and over a raging waterfall a short way down the river.

The group then managed to capture the Konoha
genin
 as well. When they came to Hinata's location they saw she was no longer there. When Jibachi mocked that she had died,
Naruto Uzumaki
 became enraged and the
Nine-Tails
 within began to show. Jibachi was horrified by this change and moved to quickly kill Naruto. However, an explosive tagged kunai flew in to protect Naruto. Hinata had managed to escape and came to protect her team-mates. When
Suzumebachi
 sent her giant bee summon after Hinata, the young kunoichi deflected it back at the Kamizuru and knocked them out and prevented Jibachi from getting the bug. The fate of the Kamizuru siblings is unknown.
