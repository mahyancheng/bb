"
The Five Kage Assemble
" (
五影集結…!!
,
Gokage Shūketsu…!!
) is episode 323 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Kurama
 lends a portion of its chakra trying to help
Naruto
 fight
Madara
, Naruto
uses it
 to stop Madara's
onslaught
. With Naruto's clone exhausted,
Ōnoki
 decides to tackle both Madara and
Mū
 with the assistance of the remaining
Fourth Division
.
Tsunade
 and
A
 decide to head to Madara's location through
Mabui
's
Heavenly Transfer Technique
, a technique that only transports objects as transporting a living being will surely rip them apart. However, Tsunade decides to take the gamble using her
Yin Seal: Release
.
Shikaku

telepathically
 communicates to
Genma
 to have him,
Raidō
 and
Iwashi
 to perform the
Flying Thunder Formation Technique
 to transport
Mei
 to Madara's location as well after
Chōjūrō
 defeats
Black Zetsu
 with a single slash. The other three
Kage
 arrive at the battlefield and prepare to fight both Madara and Mū.
 As Tsunade heals Gaara and Ōnoki, A and Mei engage Madara,
Dodai
, along with the
Hokage Guard Platoon
 chase after the
Kabuto
-controlled Mū. Madara attacks them with
Yasaka Magatama
 but the attack fails because of Gaara's
Shield of Sand
 and Ōnoki's
rock golem
 protects them. While Gaara keeps Madara busy, Ōnoki joins the Kage and develops a new strategy. Employing Mei's
Hiding in Mist Technique
 to obscure Madara's field of vision, he first
lightens
 A, increasing his speed. Seeing this, Kabuto positions Mū in front of Madara but he is knocked away easily. Ōnoki then
increases
 A's weight and subsequent attack, breaking into Madara's Susanoo and sending him flying away. Naruto insists on helping fight Madara but Tsunade tells him to leave Madara to them while he fights the "
other Madara
". As the clone disperses, they leave him with one word: "
win
". Having received the message from the Kage, the real Naruto and
Killer B
 head to face the imposter Madara. Naruto then confronts Tobi by headbutting him, in an attempt to break his mask.

Trivia

In the scene where the Tsuchikage shouts to the Mizukage and Raikage after the rock golem and the sand shield were erected, the Raikage's mouth is seen moving instead.  However, it was corrected in the DVD version.

In the scene where Madara has his hands clapped together to activate his Wood Release technique his gloves are missing, this is likely an error in animation.

During this episode, Mū's nose is seen covered by bandages too. It is most likely an error in animation.
