"
Disappearance
" (
消失
,
Shōshitsu
) is episode 125 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Deidara
 blows himself up with his
suicide attack
, the explosion is seen across the neighbouring lands, prompting all members of the
Eight Man Squad
 and
Hebi
 to rush towards it.
Zetsu
, a member of the
Akatsuki
, witnesses Deidara's explosion, and judging by the blasts, believes that
Sasuke
 and
Tobi
 have died as well. Zetsu reports this to the other Akatsuki members and the Akatsuki
leader
 asks them to mourn.
Kisame
 expresses that while he misses Tobi, at least Deidara had taken Sasuke out with him. As the other members leave, Itachi walks outside in the rain, where Kisame states that it looks like Itachi is crying, and offers his condolences regarding Sasuke's demise. Itachi, however, tells Kisame that Sasuke is still alive.

Suigetsu
, noticing that the snake on a scroll Sasuke had given him has disappeared, uses a drop of Sasuke's blood he has on his person to summon
Manda
, one of
Orochimaru
's
snakes
. Sasuke exits from the snake, revealing that he had
summoned
 Manda and had jumped inside of it to escape Deidara's blast radius, although they both got hit before teleporting away. Manda curses Sasuke with his dying breath for using his
Sharingan
 to
control
 him and use him as a shield. Seeing as Sasuke is injured, Suigetsu, who had been joined by
Jūgo
 and
Karin
 at that time, retreats to a safehouse, where Jūgo tends to Sasuke's wounds. As Suigetsu and Karin get into a fight, Jūgo's murderous impulses begin to manifest, only for Sasuke to use his Sharingan to eradicate the urges. Sasuke instantly passes out from his fatigue, as the other three members decide to stay on Hebi under Sasuke's command.

Meanwhile, the Eight Man Squad head to the crater, where the
ninja hounds
 have located Sasuke's scent.
Kakashi
 notifies them that one of the scents is that of Deidara of the Akatsuki, whom he had
previously thought was dead
, and
Shino
 states that Sasuke must have fought him. While the team contemplates whether Sasuke had been eliminated from the blast or if he had escaped,
Kiba
 confirms that it is the latter, as he is still able to track a faint scent with his acute sense of smell; the team then heads off to find Sasuke.

Elsewhere
, the leader of the Akatsuki, revealed to be named Pain, along his partner
Konan
 begin discussing plans with a masked man, who is implied to be the real leader of the organisation. The masked man tells Pain and Konan that Sasuke is still alive, and that he would approach them soon; however, he warns them that they must also deal with the
Nine-Tails

jinchūriki
 as soon as possible, reminding them that
Naruto
 has learned techniques
formidable enough
 to
destroy two
 of
Kakuzu
's hearts and that he has
powerful
 allies as well. Konan tells the masked man not to worry as Pain has never lost a fight before. The masked man turns around, revealed to be none other than Tobi, who states that he will have the power of the Sharingan as he is the one and only
Madara Uchiha
.
