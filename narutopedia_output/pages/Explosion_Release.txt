Explosion Release
 (
爆遁
,
Bakuton
,
Viz:
 Explosion Style)  is a
nature transformation

kekkei genkai
, suggested to be a combination of
earth
 and
lightning
.
 Explosion Release users utilise explosive chakra in combat.
 It is seemingly common to members of
Iwagakure
's
Explosion Corps
.

Forms

Deidara
 uses Explosion Release in his
Explosive Clay
. He
infuses
 his clay with explosive chakra, creating bombs of varying size and forms.

Gari
 uses Explosion Release in conjunction with
taijutsu
, allowing him to deliver
punches
 that causes everything they hit to explode from the inside.
 In the anime, he can also use it on the ground to create a shockwave of upturned earth and debris to throw the enemy off balance.
 He also uses a less-destructive version of this technique, creating a puff of smoke instead of an explosion.

In
Sasuke Shinden
, Sasuke encounters a man using Explosion Release being controlled by a
genjutsu
; it isn't clear if the man originates from
Kumogakure
 or
Kirigakure
. Like Gari, the man uses Explosion Release to create an explosion wherever his punches connect. Like Deidara's clay, the man's attacks are easily nullified with
Lightning Release
.
