 anime.

Summary

Back at the front lines, the five
Kage
 struggle to hold their own against
Madara
's
Susanoo
-clad
wood clones
. Despite these great odds,
Ōnoki
 rallies them to fight, noting that they need to fulfil a task at which cannot be failed. Madara realises that Ōnoki is the problem and that he must break his
will
. With that, the Kage go on the offensive against Madara's clones once more. The situation soon takes a turn for the worst as Madara in turn responded with his full power by activating his final Susanoo and proceeds to using its
sword
 to attack them.
 Elsewhere at the cave,
Itachi

commands
 Kabuto to put an end to the
Impure World Reincarnation
, during which time
Sasuke
 states his resolve to destroy the
village
 that made his brother suffer for so long while bidding farewell to Itachi altogether. As the lights surrounding the reincarnated
shinobi
 begin to illuminate the battlefield as they faded into pillars of light, Itachi approaches Sasuke and uses his
Sharingan
 to show Sasuke everything about the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
. With the truth revealed to Sasuke at last, Itachi then imparts his final words to his brother, stating that no matter what happens or what he does from here on out, he will love him always.

Trivia

A
, his
Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan
