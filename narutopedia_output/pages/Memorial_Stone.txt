The
Memorial Stone
 is a monument in
Konohagakure
 listing all the ninja who died in service to the village. In the manga, it is shaped like a standard slab of stone, while in the anime it looks more like a
kunai
-shaped structure.

It is located near the
Third Training Ground
, where
Team Hiruzen
 and
Team 7
 undertook their first
bell test
. When
Naruto Uzumaki
 remarked that he wanted to have his name added to the monument,
Kakashi Hatake
 informed him of what it was for, prompting Naruto to change his mind.
 Kakashi spends much of his free time at the monument because his former comrade,
Obito Uchiha
, has his name engraved there.
