This technique allows the user to create a protective wall out of
earth
. One method of doing this is for the user to convert
chakra
 in their body into an earthen material that they spit from their mouth; the more skilled the user, the greater the volume of earth that can be created. The earth quickly piles up into a defensive wall, blocking incoming attacks. Although the muddy material is solid on its own, it is further fortified with a coat of chakra, making it more resistant to
fire
 and
water
 than it would otherwise be.

A second method of performing this technique is to instead manipulate pre-existing earth directly: by placing their hands on the ground, users can raise the ground as a barrier in front of them.
 Walls erected in this way are typically featureless, but users can alter the appearance if they choose;
Kakashi Hatake
 adorns his with
bulldog
 sculptures. Users are not limited to strictly defensive uses for this technique, as they can create walls behind targets to prevent them from escaping
 or even to entirely surround and encase said targets.
 The anime shows users creating these walls from afar.

In
Kakashi Retsuden
, the Earth-Style Wall is one of several techniques that Kakashi specifically improves his ability with after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, to make up for the loss of his
Sharingan
. His improved Earth-Style Wall is large enough to surround a small village, strong enough to withstand a barrage of cannons, and he can remotely repair any damage it receives. Kakashi is able to maintain such a wall for over a day by himself, something most onlookers believe would require the work of team.

Trivia

Before his canon usage, in
Naruto Shippūden: Dragon Blade Chronicles
, the
Dragon Blade
 enabled Naruto to perform the technique.
