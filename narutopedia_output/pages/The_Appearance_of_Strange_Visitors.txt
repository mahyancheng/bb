"
The Appearance of Strange Visitors
" (
珍客見参　碧の野獣?猛獣?…珍獣?
,
Chinkyaku Kenzan Ao no Yajū? Mōjū?… Chinjū?
) is episode 161 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Desperate to get as strong as he could before
Jiraiya
 returned,
Naruto
 sought out
Might Guy
 and
Rock Lee
 in hopes they would train him in taijutsu. Guy and Lee have left the village on a mission; meanwhile,
Mondai
 and
Potcha
 infiltrate the village to gather its secrets by disguising themselves as Guy and Lee. Despite their terrible disguises, Naruto fell for it and began following them all day. The rest of the village, however, easily saw through the impostors and decided to make them miserable by having "Guy" and "Lee" do all kinds of horrific chores. While the two were miserable from doing so, Naruto cheerfully viewed this as another training session. After the impostors finally gave up and left the village, Naruto found the real Guy and Lee to thank them for the assistance in training, to which Guy and Lee had no idea what he was talking about.
