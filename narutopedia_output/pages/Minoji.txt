Minoji calling his comrades' names.



In the anime, about two years later, Minoji and his teammates partake in the joint Chūnin Exams held by
Sunagakure
 and Konohagakure. For the first phase of the exams, he and his teammates are split into different rooms, with him being placed in room 2. After settling in,
Shikamaru Nara
 as the first exam proctor explained that every member of the respective teams only needs to answer one single question on the test. However, their combined score with their teammates will determine if they pass or fail the exam, since they need exactly 100 points to pass — every higher or lower score leads to disqualification. Unclear how to solve the problem, Minoji heard the genin from room 1 calling their comrades, leading him to desperately scream their names as well.

Following the conclusion of the three question choice test, a bonus question was given by the proctor, asking to which teammate you would leave as a decoy, and the team's answer had to be unanimous. His team managed to qualify for the second round since they left the answer blank, proving to be the right choice since a full team is needed for the second round. However, a preliminary round had to be issued to lessen the many participants there were. The preliminary round involved a race to Suna where only the first 30 teams to arrive at the destination would qualify for the second phase.
 Unfortunately, his team didn't make the cut and thus they were disqualified.

Trivia

Takigakure
 shinobi resembling Minoji shown.
