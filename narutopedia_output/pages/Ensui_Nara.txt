shinobi
 from
Konohagakure
's
Nara clan

Appearance

Ensui has black hair which he ties into a short, high-top ponytail. He also has a goatee and dark-green markings underneath his eyes
 — which gives him a somewhat lazy, or tired appearance. Attire-wise, he wears the standard outfit of the Konoha shinobi consisting of the standard
flak jacket
 and uniform. He, however, doesn't wear the Alliance's
forehead protector
.

Abilities

Ensui is very skilled with his clan's
secret
 techniques, able to use the
Shadow Imitation Shadow Bind Technique
 to attach their shadow to a target to extend its range and catch its actual target. Unlike the
original technique
, Ensui can freely manipulate the degree of control he has and choose to make his target imitate his movements. He is also capable of using the
Shadow Sewing Technique
.

Kakashi's strategy, initiated.



Ensui was assigned to the
Third Division
 of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. His team-mate along with
Santa Yamanaka
 were incorporated into
Kakashi
's battle strategy to take out a
reincarnated

Zabuza Momochi
 in order to lift the
mist
 that obscured the battlefield. He used his Shadow Imitation Technique to merge his own shadow with Kakashi's while Santa took possession of their captain's body. He was supposed to then use Kakashi's shadow as an extension of the technique to stop Zabuza's movements and then
hold him down
 once Kakashi's shadow had come into contact with Zabuza's in order for
Maki
 to completely
immobilise
 him. However, half way through the plan, Kakashi's
attack
 was intercepted by
Haku
. After Zabuza cuts through Haku, Ensui told Santa that Kakashi only caught one enemy and immobilised Haku as he regenerated. When Kakashi successfully connected his shadow to Zabuza's, he immediately immobilised him as well.






Ensui restraining Jinin.



In the anime, at the dawn of the second day of the war, Ensui assists Kakashi in restraining a bisected
Jinin Akebino
 until
Sai
 completed his sealing technique.
Gari
 arrives to prevent Jinin's sealing and
Rock Lee
 fights him off to defend the two. Debris from Gari's explosion injures Ensui and his hold on Jinin is released. After Sai successfully
seals
 Jinin, Gari retreats and as Lee attempts to pursue, Ensui convinces him not to.
