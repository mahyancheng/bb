This technique allows
Orochimaru
 to control the
Sword of Kusanagi
. As he moves his fingers, the Sword of Kusanagi makes the same movements, even to the point of moving in the air. This allows him to continue using the sword even if he's been disarmed of it, wielding it against opponents and, because of the sword's natural sharpness, easily cutting through them.
 The sword moves quickly while airborne, allowing Orochimaru to direct it at opponents from behind before it can be defended against.
 In the anime, the sword's blade emits a bright blue light when controlled in this way.
