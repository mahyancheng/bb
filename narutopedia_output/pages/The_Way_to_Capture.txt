Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Kidōmaru
's webbing sticks
Neji
 to the ground, leaving him unable to perform the
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
. Neji opts to block the incoming attacks by hand, but is unable to block all of them. Kidōmaru realises that this means Neji's
Byakugan
 has a blindspot, so he concentrates his efforts on pinpointing it. After determining that Neji cannot see things beyond fifty metres and cannot see anything directed at a particular point behind his neck, Kidōmaru believes he has "won the game". He activates level two of his
cursed seal
 and creates a bow and arrow to put an end to his "worthy opponent".

Trivia

When this chapter was originally published in
Weekly Shōnen Jump
, the two-page spread that ended the chapter depicted Kidōmaru in a fairly typical archery stance.
Masashi Kishimoto
's twin brother,
Seishi Kishimoto
, pestered him that it was boring. Because of this he drew a completely new spread for the volume release, wherein Kidōmaru aims his bow while hanging from a tree. The original page was included as an extra in the volume release.
