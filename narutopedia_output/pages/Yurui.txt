Yurui
 (
ユルイ
) is a
shinobi
 of
Kumogakure
.

Personality

Yurui has an arrogant personality as he looks down on
Konohagakure
 shinobi and boasts the superiority of Kumo. He openly taunts those who he believes are inferior to him. He jumps to conclusions, calling Boruto weak, even though he had not seen him fight and being the Hokage's son. He also appears to be rather controlling, trying to remove Boruto and Sarada from their booth even though they were already sitting there. He admires
Killer B
.

Appearance






Yurui's full appearance.



Yurui has fair skin, blond hair and grey eyes. Just like Killer B, he also has a tattoo of a bull's horn on his left cheek (which corresponds to
Gyūki
 not having a left horn). His outfit consists of a standard Kumogakure
flak jacket
, complete with a white Kumo
forehead protector
 and baggy white pants. Additionally, he has bandages around his arms, extending to the back of his hands. He also carries a pendant that has the head of Gyūki and two
swords
 on his back.

Abilities






Yurui using his bubblegums.



Yurui is described as an elite shinobi and a strategist who gives off a slovenly impression to throw his enemies off guard.
 Using the
bubblegum
 he's constantly chewing, he can shoot projectiles to entrap an opponent or create giant bubbles that are capable of trapping an enemy inside or causing explosions. Due to carrying two swords on his back, it can be assumed that he is skilled in
kenjutsu
.

Versus Momoshiki Arc






Yurui defeated by Boruto.



Yurui enters the Chūnin Exams with his teammates. In the first round, when the quiz question was revealed to be trick, Yurui used his bubbles to save himself and his team from falling in the ink pit, thus avoid elimination. In the second round, Yurui was faced against
Team 15
. He attacked
Wasabi Izuno
 and
Sumire Kakei
, which allowed his teammate
Toroi
 to retrieve their flag. In the third round, Yurui is matched against
Boruto Uzumaki
. He manages to gain the upper hand by creating multiple exploding bubbles with his bubblegum. However, he was defeated when Boruto (with the aid of his
Shinobi Gauntlet
) used a shuriken to burst a bubble right in Yurui's face, causing it to explode and knock him unconscious.
