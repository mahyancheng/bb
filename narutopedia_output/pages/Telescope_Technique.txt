By peering into a
crystal ball
, the user can see the current activities of anyone whose
chakra
 signature they know. Users can view subjects from any location, regardless of distance or potential obstructions, making it ideal for intelligence gathering. The
Third Hokage
 uses this technique to monitor the villagers of
Konohagakure
 and thus maintain public order.

Trivia

In "
Road to Naruto the Movie
" (and its
anime adaptation
),
Tobi
 used this technique to gather information for his
Limited Tsukuyomi
. He then used the crystal ball itself as a medium to cast and host the
Genjutsu World
 he created with that information.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Kizuna Drive
, Gensui used this technique to control his
false tailed beasts
 and to shoot spheres of energy.
