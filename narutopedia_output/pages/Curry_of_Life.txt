The
Curry of Life
 (
命のカレー
,
Inochi no Karē
) is a curry created by
Karashi
 prior to joining
Raiga
 and the
Kurosuki family
. Because of its intense spiciness, the curry of life has special properties that can revive an unconscious or dying person. It can also strengthen a person after it is eaten a few times. However, it seems to have opposite effects on people that have lower tolerance with spicy food, such as
Neji Hyūga
, and knocks them unconscious. It is  especially liked by
Rock Lee
, who claims that he had once been "saved" by the curry before. After accidentally spilling some alcohol in the curry and serving it to the team, Lee ate it and started to perform the
Drunken Fist
. At the end,
Sanshō
 made a curry so intense that the colour changed to red. Lee attempts to eat it, but was interrupted by Neji and
Naruto
 as they dragged him back to
Konoha
.
