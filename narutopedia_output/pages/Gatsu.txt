Part I

Gosunkugi Capture Mission






Kiba hits Gatsu.



Gatsu tried to get
Sazanami
 after he was injured by
Gosunkugi
, but failed because
Naruto
 and the others were protecting him. Upon leaving, he accidentally drops a wanted poster. Strangely, they note that the person on the poster's name is Tokichi and has the same bird shaped birthmark that Sazanami has.

Later, Gatsu catches up and catches Sazanami and Gosunkugi. In the end, Gatsu and the village elder revealed to the citizens that Gosunkugi confessed to his crimes and Sazanami was cleared of all charges.
