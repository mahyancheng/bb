C
 (
シー
,
Shī
,
Viz:
 Shee,
English TV:
 Cee) is a
jōnin
 from
Kumogakure
, and along with his partner
Darui
, he served as the
Fourth Raikage
's support.

Background

In the anime, when
Konohagakure
 and
Sunagakure
 sent an invitation for Kumogakure to join in an impromptu
Chūnin Exams
, the Fourth Raikage scoffed at the idea, believing it to be a joined attempt from the two villages to attack Kumogakure while its defences were lowered. A rejected the offer and sent C and
Darui
 to make sure
Killer B
 would not sneak off to this event.

Personality

In contrast to his
easy-going partner
, C is portrayed as a very serious and mature individual normally seen with a look of self-assured, confident look on his face.
 He often puts duty above all else, as shown when he told Darui there was no time for rest upon their return from the Kage Summit as they had to begin planning immediately. He also seems to have a slight dislike for Konoha ninja, calling Naruto's group "
Konoha dogs
".

Appearance

, black

, characteristic black, elbow-length arm-guards, and the red and white Kumogakure shin-guards along with a pair of sandals.

 He is also competent in
nature transformation
, able to use

 and

 to

.

Intelligence

C is also very analytical and knowledgeable on foreign shinobi abilities, recognising the
Mangekyō Sharingan
 and
Amaterasu
.
 He even knew of
Itachi Uchiha
's use of Amaterasu, stating that Sasuke was more skilled at manipulating the black flames than the former.
 He could also deduce how Sasuke's
Blaze Release: Kagutsuchi
 worked after only seeing it once.

Five Kage Summit






C and Darui protecting A.



C and Darui were chosen to escort the
Fourth Raikage
 to the
Kage Summit
 in the
Land of Iron
. During a brief rendezvous with
Team Samui
 while en route, C sensed that they have been followed by
Naruto Uzumaki
,
Kakashi Hatake
, and
Yamato
 and after the Raikage spoke with the Konoha-nin, they continued on their way. Once they arrived and the meeting began, C and Darui came to the Raikage's defence following his outburst, blocking the attacks of the other Kage's bodyguards. After being told to stand down, they returned to their posts after things settled down, only to again come to the Raikage's side when
White Zetsu
 appeared. White Zetsu revealed that
Sasuke Uchiha
,
Killer B
's captor, was nearby, so C and Darui accompanied the Raikage in tracking Sasuke down.






C healing A.



C located Sasuke and his team and reported a number of
samurai
 casualties as they got nearer. When they arrived, C launched an attack with his
Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar
 technique to blind Sasuke and his team, creating an opening for the Raikage and Darui to attack. The Raikage then instructed C to find and eliminate
Sasuke's sensor
. C was not able to defend himself properly during his search, and despite Darui's attempts to keep him safe, he is struck by one of Sasuke's genjutsu and passed out. Darui later revived him and helped him get on his feet, and together they observed the Raikage's fight with Sasuke. The Raikage was eventually struck by Sasuke's
Amaterasu
 and was forced to cut off his arm. When the fight was interrupted by the
Three Sand Siblings
, C used
medical ninjutsu
 to stop the bleeding and silently worried about how far the Raikage was willing to go.

When Sasuke activated his
Susanoo
, he launched an attack on the pillars, causing the ceiling to come crashing down on C and the others. In the midst of the chaos, Sasuke escaped to locate
Danzō
. Having survived the attack, C and the others followed behind only to find
Tobi
, who then explained his
Eye of the Moon Plan
 to them and revealed that B only pretended to be captured. Relieved, C believed this was a case of B trying to get some vacation time, which did not surprise Darui. After the formation of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, C joined the Raikage in searching for B, but before they left, C told the samurai that two members of Sasuke's team were still in the area.

From several miles away, C was able to detect B's chakra contained within a large
sphere of water
. When they arrived there, they found B fighting
Kisame Hoshigaki
. C thanked Kisame for producing the water dome and thus, inadvertently helping them find B. After Kisame was "eliminated" they all returned to Kumogakure.

C later attended a war council meeting where he advised the Raikage on how to form a reconnaissance team to find the
Akatsuki
 base.

When the war began, C was placed in the

C and other Kumo shinobi blind the Ten-Tails.



On the second day, mobilising with the remaining members of his division and the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, C arrived at the battlefield where the
jinchūriki
 were. With this, he and the other members of the Allied Shinobi Forces stood to face their opposition. Following the strategy relayed to them by
Shikaku
, C and
Darui
, along with several other Kumo-nin begin the assault. Launching their assault, C and several others blinded the enemy with the
Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar
 technique, allowing Darui and other Storm Release bearers to use the
Storm Release: Laser Circus
 technique to aim for the beast's eye.

Following
Obito Uchiha
's
attack
 of the shinobi on the battlefield, it was revealed that C, while sustaining injuries, was still alive. He later commented on the change that had occurred in
Naruto Uzumaki
's chakra from a
sensory
 perspective and when he recovered, he fought alongside the other members of the Alliance while shrouded in
Kurama
's chakra. Later, as the Alliance succeeded in freeing the
tailed beasts
 from Obito, C
sensed
 that the latter was still alive and immediately notified his comrades. As C notices the tailed beasts were about to face Madara, he orders the alliance to move away from the area.

 visits Kumo.

In the anime, instead of Sasuke delivering the shinobi to Kumo, C instead joined the Fourth Raikage and Darui travel to the
Coliseum
 personally, where they not only announced their intentions to safeguard all of the shinobi Sasuke had just freed, but also arrested all of the spectators and patrons for the illegal gambling they were conducting. Despite many attempting to escape, the Kumo-nin surrounded the arena's doors and successfully arrested all of the spectators and patrons except for
En Oyashiro
, who managed to quietly escape.

Creation and Conception

Masashi Kishimoto
 noted that he created C with a cool, good-looking male idol in mind, but also as a serious character. As such, C generally has a look of aplomb on his face and wears the standard attire of Kumogakure without any embellishments.

Trivia

"Shī" is the Japanese pronunciation of the letter "C". This parallels the name of several other shinobi of Kumogakure whose names are letters of the alphabet.
