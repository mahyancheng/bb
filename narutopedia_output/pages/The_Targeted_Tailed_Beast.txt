"
The Targeted Tailed Beast
" (
狙われた尾獣
,
Nerawareta Bijū
) is episode 411 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Asuma
,
Kurenai
 and
Guy
 are seen observing the
sandstorm
, noting that postponing the
Chūnin Exams
 was a wise decision. As the three approach the
desert
, they are stopped by
Sunagakure
 shinobi. The jōnin try to deceive their way through, only for Suna shinobi to respond that the second rounds of the Chūnin Exam is under their village's jurisdiction. Despite their efforts, a large cloud of
sand
 provides the jōnin easy coverage and they quickly run through into the desert. Meanwhile, as the
other

teams

are
 safely waiting for the sandstorm to subside,
Kankurō
 and
Temari
, alongside other
Exploration Group
 members, manage to rescue many
genin
 and lead them out to safety.
 At the same time, a shinobi enters
Gaara
's office in hopes of reporting the events that are happening in the desert, only for him to notice that the
Kazekage
 had left a
sand clone
 in his place. Meanwhile, the real Gaara encourages
Team Matsuri
 to continue their way through the Chūnin Exams. As the three head on, they hear a strange melody and realise that the terrain is not in their favour for an enemy attack.
Hōichi

animates their shadows
, strangling the three in order to call out Gaara. With the
jinchūriki
's arrival, Hōichi sets his plan in motion and uses his
sealing technique
 to latch on to
Shukaku
 in order to pull him from the inside its jinchūriki. As the Kazekage orders
Matsuri
,
Yukata
 and
Mikoshi
 to leave, the three decide to head out to the central tower to get help. Despite that, Yukata quickly collapses, leaving Matsuri to go on ahead alone, with Mikoshi staying with Yukata. Meanwhile, a carefree
Fū
 notices a
tailed beast
's
chakra
 calling for help and rushes to Gaara's aid. As the kunoichi touches the chain, she gets electrocuted. Realising that the kunoichi is also a jinchūriki, Hōichi decides to test the power of his
seal
 and tries to extract her
tailed beast
 at the same time. As the sandstorm subsides,
Neji
 informs
Lee
 and
Tenten
, who are encouraged to head out to the direction of the tower, that they hold two heaven scrolls, noting that he didn't have a chance to tell his team-mates due to the recent events. Neji then uses his
Byakugan
 to scout the surrounding area, catching the sight of a weary Matsuri. The three genin then run to the kunoichi's aid, with Lee mistaking Neji's intents and asking if he wants to steal the scroll from a shinobi in danger, only to be corrected by Tenten. As they approach Matsuri, she tells them that Gaara's in danger and asks them to go and help the Kazekage in battle.
