Smaller and More Useful
" (

,
Chīsakute, Benri
)

Kawaki
 stresses to
Shikamaru
 he doesn't know about
Amado
's objectives, pointing out Amado restored his
Kāma
 in secret. He believes Amado's motives no longer matter, confident that
Code
 has killed him, which
Naruto
 admonishes him for. He also antagonises Shikamaru, drawing more censure from Naruto. A shinobi arrives informing Shikamaru there's an urgent phone call to him, from Amado. Amado is calling from a station in the outskirts of the
Land of Snow
, where is with
Ada
 and
Daemon
, three to four days away from
Konoha
. Shikamaru asks about Code, and Amado updates him that he talked to Ada, who severed ties with him and accepted Shikamaru's proposition. Shikamaru is concerned about Code's other ally, but Amado explains who Daemon is, and that he's coming with her. Shikamaru accuses him of not having the authority to make such deals, and Amado says Ada is the final authority reminding Shikamaru that he was the one who made the proposition. Amado makes it clear that they don't want Ada and Daemon as enemies. He also reveals he had to rescind Code's power limiters, but argues that the loss of Ada's favour more than makes up for it, and that Shikamaru knows how to use game pieces. Shikamaru tells them there will be questions when they arrive, and they hang up. Ada is displeased with Amado calling them game pieces, but he defends himself, saying that figures of speech are effective with Shikamaru.
 She warns him to use that cleverness to help her with Kawaki, otherwise she'll kill out of spite, barely able to contain herself in her hatred of him for giving her her alluring ability. Daemon interjects saying he'll be the one doing the killing. Shikamaru asks for Naruto, and all of
Team 7
, including Kawaki.
Boruto
 dresses up to answer the summons, paying attention to the new marks on his chest.
Hinata
 confirms with Boruto that he has a new mission, and cries, worried that this time he might not come back.
Himawari
 watches them. Boruto apologises for making her worry, promising her he'll return, having done so even after he died once. Outside,
Momoshiki
 manifests for Boruto, chiding him for making a promise he can't keep. Boruto asks why he's still around if he can't reincarnate anymore, and Momoshiki asks in return why he clings to an existence of despair that is fast approaching, reminding Boruto of his previous warning. Momoshiki claims that Boruto will lose the will to live enough to want to escape the world, which will allow Momoshiki to take him over completely, and live in his stead, his possession functioning as a reincarnation. He jabs that Boruto was always meant to be his vessel in the end. Boruto shouts at Momoshiki, vowing to keep him shoved down and in despair. Momoshiki's manifestation dissipates.
Sarada
 and
Mitsuki
 arrive, thinking Boruto is pumped for a mission. Sarada finds Boruto's attitude strange, while Mitsuki thinks that no matter what happens, Boruto will always be Boruto. Himawari says that if she became a shinobi, she could help Boruto, and asks Hinata if it would make her worry more instead. Code brings
Bug
 to the
Ten-Tails
' pen, explaining what the place is to him. Code is concerned that while
Sasuke
 can no longer get there, Boruto and Kawaki as full
Ōtsutsuki
 might soon master the
Space–Time Ninjutsu
 necessary to reach the place. Bug asks his plan, as even at full strength, he wasn't able to defeat Daemon, and lost Ada as an ally. Code admits he was outclassed by Daemon, which is why Bug attempted to stop him from waking Daemon up. Code feels it's no use obsessing over the past, and actually thinks things are ok. He proceeds to adjust the Ten-Tails into a more manageable size, covering it with several
Claw Marks
, being able to create many more at once with his full power. Code claims he'll make it smaller and more useful, moulding it like clay. Smaller portions of its body become humanoid, tailed creatures bearing Code's Claw Marks, able to use them to travel as well. Through the marks, Code is also able to see and talk through them, showing off their usefulness.

Chapter 73

"
A Special Mission
" (
特別な任務
,
Tokubetsu na Ninmu
)

Team 7
 arrives at the
Hokage
's office, wondering what their
mission
 might be since they've been out of action for so long.
Mitsuki
 points out if would be the debut of the team since
Kawaki
 joined.
Shikamaru
, Kawaki,
Sumire
, and
Konohamaru
 are in the office.
Boruto
 notes it's his first time meeting Kawaki since resurrecting. The two try acting casual, Sumire recalls her talk with Kawaki, and tries to ease the mood. Shikamaru goes straight to the point, explaining their current biggest threats are Boruto, who's a full
Ōtsutsuki
, being at risk of being possessed by
Momoshiki
, and Kawaki, who despite not being at risk of possession, is too powerful for them to control.
Sarada
 stresses he's just stating out the status quo. Shikamaru reveals that
Amado
 survived his encounter with
Code
, but had to rescind his power limiters, placing his capabilities as above
Jigen
's, but below
Isshiki
's. Sarada wonders if their mission is to take him out with Boruto's and Kawaki's Ōtsutsuki abilities. Shikamaru denies it, and continues, explaining who
Ada
 is, her entrancing ability, and how as Ōtsutsuki, Boruto and Kawaki are immune to it. Sarada asks if their mission is to take her out, but again Shikamaru denies it. On a train, Amado watches Ada watching the meeting. Shikamaru explains that while originally an enemy, Amado's plan worked, Code lost her as an ally, and she's on her way to
Konoha
.
 Underlining how Ada answers to no one, they have to avoid making her an enemy. Their mission is to cohabitate with her. Konohamaru explains that Boruto and Kawaki will live with her. Ada is shocked. The boys aren't looking up to it, but Sarada realises it's a surveillance mission. Even if Ada herself doesn't try anything, other people put on the mission might act on her behalf due to her ability. They're to determine how willing she is to cooperate with Konoha, otherwise she won't be allowed to stay. Shikamaru believes she'll agree and reveals her crush on Kawaki, to everyone's surprise and Ada's embarrassment. Amado asks her what's going on, and
Daemon
 notices her heart racing. She feels this is exactly what she wanted. Shikamaru tells Kawaki to be very mindful of how he acts with Ada. Boruto asks why she'd crush on Kawaki, who's immune to her ability, if she can have anyone else fall for her. Sumire proposes that Ada wants a genuine experience. Kawaki finds it all illogical. Shikamaru proceeds to reveal Ada's
clairvoyance
, and that they should consider everything in their conversation leaked, addressing Ada herself on the beginning of their diplomatic manoeuvring. Kawaki would rather fight Code, and Shikamaru points out that his location is impossible to nail down, which is something Ada can help them with. Konohamaru adds that Boruto is to act as a mediator between Ada and Kawaki, which he finds annoying, while Konohamaru, Sarada, and Mitsuki report on them from afar, including if Boruto is acting normal. The
Sensor Team
 will aid them. Shikamaru asks them if they'll do it, not if they can do it. Boruto answers they don't really have the option to refuse.
Sasuke
 discusses the mission with
Naruto
, considering it glorified house arrest. Naruto explains Shikamaru logic in that Boruto and Kawaki wouldn't stand aside to avoid fighting someone they can't beat if ordered to do it, so giving them responsibility through a mission will covertly control them. Shikamaru says they might have to act without specific orders if something unexpected happens. Kawaki perceives Momoshiki's presence by Boruto for an instant. Sasuke also recognises the feeling. Ada finds Shikamaru's ideas intriguing.

Chapter 74

"
Baptism by Fire
" (
洗礼
,
Senrei
)

Ada
,
Daemon
, and
Amado
 arrive at
Konoha
. They're greeted by
Sai
 and
Shikamaru
, Sai and other civilians becoming attracted to Ada. She informs Shikamaru she's aware of and accepts his cohabitation plan. Shikamaru notices Daemon. Sai offers to take her to her lodgings, but she refuses, saying she doesn't need a guide, and takes off flying, already knowing the destination, Daemon ridding piggyback, saying she doesn't like standing out. Shikamaru finds that flying makes her stand out. Amado tells him that flying is common among the
Ōtsutsuki
, and they should expect
Boruto
 and
Kawaki
 to start flying soon. Shikamaru tells him it's time to say everything he knows. At the house they'll live in, Boruto admires it,
Konohamaru
 admitting they had to strong-arm the future owner because of the mission. Kawaki is bothered by Boruto's cheeriness, Boruto retorting their mission is to live there. Konohamaru stresses the importance of getting along with Ada. Kawaki recalls perceiving
Momoshiki
 by Boruto.
Sarada
 and
Mitsuki
 watch the house from theirs, her finding it odd to do so in plain sight. Mitsuki assures her they just have to apply a little pressure, but she remains worried.
Shikadai
,
Inojin
, and
Chōchō
 arrive, curious about their mission. Inojin is interested in the beautiful woman, who Chōchō considers her rival over Kawaki. Mitsuki alerts Sarada of Ada's arrival, surprising her with her flight. Inojin, Chōchō, and Mitsuki are attracted to her.
 Shikadai couldn't see her face clearly. Konohamaru informs the boys he'll return to his post, and reminds them of the support from the
Sensor Unit
 and their
communications link
. Sarada contacts Konohamaru, but he's surprised by Ada's arrival. Chōchō, Inojin, and Mitsuki want to get closer to Ada. Sarada wonders if she and Shikadai weren't affected by Ada's ability over not seeing her well or individual variation.
Moegi
 arrives, having told
Team 10
 not to go there, and plans their punishment. She asks Sarada about Konohamaru, concerned for him. Ada comments on Moegi's concern for him, causing Konohamaru to faint. Boruto checks on him, and asks Ada to come out so they can talk. Daemon attacks, introducing himself as Ada's little brother, surprising them as they didn't know about him. Daemon antagonises them, and goads Kawaki into attacking him, which Daemon reflects. Kawaki uses
Sukunahikona
, but Daemon reacts in time to grab the chakra rods, avoiding being stabbed. Daemon knocks both of them out. When Boruto wakes up, Ada is holding Kawaki unconscious on her lap, and she apologises for the harsh greeting. Daemon says they had to show from the start that defying them wouldn't end well. Kawaki wakes up, and Ada blushes when he looks at her. Daemon asks if he agrees that Ada's lap is nice and soft. Shikamaru contacts Boruto through the intercom, asking if they've met Ada and Daemon. Boruto says Daemon have them a baptism by fire, and Shikamaru apologises, having wished to make proper introductions, but Ada took off flying. Shikamaru and
Naruto
 are with Amado, and they want him to tell them everything. Boruto thinks it'll be quite a mission.

Chapter 75

"
The Domain of Gods
" (
神の領域
,
Kami no Ryōiki
)

Amado
 summarises
Ada
's and
Daemon
's abilities.
Boruto
 is sceptical of Daemon
reflecting
 even murderous intent, but
Kawaki
 tests it and confirms it, receiving a hit from just thinking it.
Naruto
 asks Amado how he developed such abilities, and he explains he is only human, and didn't create the abilities, having merely transplanted them. Amado elaborates that these abilities were developed by
Shibai Ōtsutsuki
, who ascended to godhood by repeatedly consuming several
Chakra Fruits
 and resurrecting through
Kāma
, of whom only his corpse remains. Transplanting DNA from Shibai's remains sometimes grants the recipient one or more of his abilities.
Shikamaru
 checks with
Katasuke
, who while not confident the transplanting of such abilities can be achieved through human technology, the advanced technology he has witnessed in the airship and in Kawaki's body makes him consider the possibility. Amado is offended by Shikamaru's distrust. Giving examples of Shibai's abilities, he explains those were not
ninjutsu
 or
senjutsu
, but rather divine miracles called
shinjutsu
, of which he deems ninjutsu merely an attempt to replicate, which offends
Sarada
.
 He clarifies which abilities from
Isshiki
 and
Code
 are also shinjutsu, including Kāma. Shikamaru asks how Shibai is dead when Kāma allows one to live forever, and if he was killed. Amado admits he doesn't know, and theorises that Shibai may have evolved so much he reached a form that foregoes the need for a physical body, and discarded it. Amado explains that
Ōtsutsuki
 shinjutsu gives him hope to resurrect his daughter.
Delta
 approaches Sarada and
Mitsuki
, asking permission to see Aida. Sarada refuses, seeing she's particularly affected by Ada's enchanting ability.
Sumire
 arrives and issues Delta's shutdown code. They note that Ada's ability is very strong, able to overcome Delta's programming, causing her to disobey Katasuke and Sumire. Mitsuki notes he needs to be careful, and Sarada realises Ada is more fearsome than she thought. Amado explains that his daughter
Akebi
, who died 12 years prior, suffered from a disease of unknown origin, for which there was no treatment or cure. He wasn't concerned about the illness, finding it better to give her a cloned body, which he already had more experience with instead of developing new medications, and having successfully preserved her brain, from which he was able to extract and digitise her memories. Nine months after Akebi's death at age 24, he completed Delta, who despite looking and sounding the same, and having all of her memories, had a completely different personality. He tried many times, but failed to bring Akebi back, which finally broke him. At that time Isshiki approached Amado as
Jigen
, promising him to reunite him with his daughter in exchange from helping him in his goal. He didn't know at the time that Isshiki's goal would doom the planet, making Akebi's resurrection moot. He still wants to resurrect his daughter, and having discovered Kāma resurrection, determined that what it does is precisely what he wanted for Akebi. Sumire now understands Amado's goal. Amado added Akebi's data to Kawaki's restored Kāma, wishing him to apply it to a cloned body he'll prepare, hoping to finally get his daughter back. Boruto confesses he thought Amado's goal was a lot more nefarious. Still suspicious, Shikamaru asks Ada to confirm Amado's claims.
Momoshiki
 contacts Boruto, their thoughts now able to crossover due to Boruto being restored with Momoshiki's data. He asks not to let Kawaki catch on, and voices his suspicion of Amado. He confirms the claims about Shibai, and has deep knowledge of all extant shinjutsu, confirming that the
Senrigan
 is a shinjutsu, but that her enchanting ability is not. Ada confirms that Akebi existed and died according to Amado's claim. Boruto asks Momoshiki about their situation, Momoshiki claiming their thoughts are available to each other against their wills. Boruto suddenly has a vision of his friends and other Konoha-nin chasing down Kawaki. Ada notices Boruto's expression.
