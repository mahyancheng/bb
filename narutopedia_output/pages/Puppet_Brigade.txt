The
Puppet Brigade
 (
傀儡部隊
,
Kugutsu Butai
,
English TV:
 Puppet Master Corps) was an organisation in
Sunagakure
 active during at least the
Second Shinobi World War
, presumably composed of Suna's elite
puppeteers
.
Sasori
 created many puppets that were used by the brigade.

At some point during wartime, the brigade sought to create a
technique
 that would bring puppets to life in order to increase their effectiveness in combat. Such a technique was eventually created by
Chiyo
, but the price (the life of the user in exchange) was deemed too high, thus the technique was labelled a
kinjutsu
 and the research was called off.
