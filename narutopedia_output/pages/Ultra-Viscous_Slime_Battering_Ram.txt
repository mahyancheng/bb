Hiruko used
strange viscous liquid
 in his surrounding during the eclipse immortality ritual. He's able to manipulate the viscosity of the liquid, so he can control it. The movement of the liquid is similar to a metal spring. These chunks of liquid can hit an enemy with enough force to temporarily knock them out.
