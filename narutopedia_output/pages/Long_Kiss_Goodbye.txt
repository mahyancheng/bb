Lyrics

Rōmaji

Kondo wa itsu aeru ka nante

Sonna kaoshite yoku ierutte

Omotteta yo nande darou

Anytime shiberisugi no KY

Chirari miseru tsuyogari na "I cry"

Namida no kouka wa dore kurai?

Watashi nari ni "ai saretai" afureru no ni kimi ga mienai

Nido to kimi ni aenai sonna ki ga suru n da…

Tsutaetai no ni umai kotoba mietara nai watashi tabun

Uso demo ii no ni "ikanai de" mo ienai yo

Nigitteta te ga hanaretara

Kimi wa itsuka wasurechau no?

Watashi no koto

Tsutaetai no ni umai kotoba mietara nai watashi tabun

Uso demo ii no ni "ikanai de" mo ienai yo

Rōmaji (Full Version)

Kondo wa itsu aeru ka nante

Sonna kaoshite yoku ierutte

Omotteta yo nande darou

Nani mo ki ni naranai FURIshite

Ii wake suru nara kikou sama de

Tsunagatte taikara

Mou kao mo mitakunai megurokawazoi

Arienai tenkai odoru KEETAI

GOODBYE MEERU naraba wasuretai

"Hold me tight" but "dokka kietai"

Anytime shiberisugi no KY

Chirari miseru tsuyogari na "I cry"

Namida no kouka wa dore kurai?

Watashi nari ni "ai saretai" afureru no ni kimi ga mienai

Nido to kimi ni aenai sonna ki ga surun da…

Tsutaetai no ni umai kotoba mietara nai watashi tabun

Uso demo ii no ni "ikanai de" mo ienai yo

Kushami suru to deru hen na koeto

Kusha kusha ni warau BUSAIKU na kao

Tomaranai ase me wo kosuru kuse

Dou setsu maranai AITSU no tokusei

Nitemo nitsukenai futari no SUTAIRU

Muda ni Shy SENSU wa yayanai

Uso tsuku toki no fukumi warai

UZAI tokku ni BAREBARE mendokusai

Tamatama kareshi gai nai TAIMINGU de

Hima tsubushi teido no koi tte

Tomodachi ni mo ii wakeshitete

Masaka watashi ga oikaketeru… nande?

Tsumaranai JOOKU wa ittsumo kudoku

Douko made mo tsuzuku aki aki na TOOKU

Sono tabi ROKKU kondo wa watashi kara KNOKKU

Watashi nari ni "ai saretai" afureru no ni kimi ga mienai

Nido to kimi ni aenai sonna ki ga suru n da…

Tsutaetai no ni umai kotoba mietara nai watashi tabun

Kanji

今度はいつ会えるかなんて

そんな顔してよく言えるって

思ってたよ　なんでだろう

何も気にならないフリして

言い訳するなら聞くわ　朝まで

つながってたいから

もう顔も見たくない　目黒川沿い

ありえない展開　踊るケータイ

グッバイメールならば忘れたい

「Hold me tight」but「どっか消えたい」

any time　喋りすぎのKY

チラリ　見せる　強がりな“I cry \"

涙の効果はどれくらい？

私なりに『愛されたい』　溢れるのに　君が見えない

二度と君に会えない　そんな気がするんだ...

伝えたいのにうまい言葉見当たらない

私　多分嘘でもイイのに「行かないで」も言えないよ

くしゃみすると出る変な声と

くしゃくしゃに笑う　ブサイクな顔

止まらない汗　目をこする癖

どうせつまらないアイツの特性

似ても似つけない2人のスタイル

無駄にShy　センスはややない

嘘つくときの含み笑い　ウザイ

とっくにバレバレめんどくさい

たまたま彼氏がいないタイミングで

ヒマ潰し程度の恋って

友達にも言い訳してて

まさか　私が追いかけてる…なんで？

つまらないジョークはいっつもくどく

どこまでも続く　飽き飽きなトーク

そのたびロック　今度は私からknock

私なりに『愛されたい』　溢れるのに　君が見えない

二度と君に会えない　そんな気がするんだ...

伝えたいのにうまい言葉見当たらない

私　多分嘘でもイイのに「行かないで」も言えないよ

握ってた手が離れたら

君はいつか忘れちゃうの？

私のこと

私なりに『愛されたい』　溢れるのに　君が見えない

二度と君に会えない　そんな気がするんだ...

伝えたいのにうまい言葉見当たらない

私　多分嘘でもイイのに「行かないで」も言えないよ

English

"I wonder when we'll meet up again?" you said,

I wonder what made me think,

'You sure can say that well with such a look on your face.'

Any time you talk too much, and can't read the atmosphere

I let you see that “I cry” a little while pretending to be strong

How well did those tears work on you?

Even though I'm overflowing with 'wanting to be loved' in my own way, you don't appear,

I have this nagging feeling that I'll never see you again….

I want to tell you that, but I can't find the right words,

Even though it’s probably okay if I lie, I can’t even say “Don’t leave”

When our hands come apart,

Will you forget someday?

About me?

I want to tell you that, but I can’t find the right words,

Even though it’s probably okay if I lie, I can’t even say “Don’t leave”

English (Full Version)

"I wonder when we'll meet up again?" you said,

I wonder what made me think,

'You sure can say that well with such a look on your face.'

Pretending that nothing is bothering me,

I’ll listen ’till morning as you make excuses,

Because I want us to be connected.

I don't want to see your face again, I think, as I pass the Meguro River

No development will come from this, my cell phone dances

If it’s goodbye mail, I want to forget about it

“Hold me tight” but “I want to disappear away somewhere”

Any time you talk too much, and can't read the atmosphere

I let you see that “I cry” a little while pretending to be strong

How well did those tears work on you?

Even though I'm overflowing with 'wanting to be loved' in my own way, you don't appear,

I have this nagging feeling that I'll never see you again….

I want to tell you that, but I can't find the right words

Even though it’s probably okay if I lie, I can’t even say “Don’t leave”

The strange voice he has when he sneezes

The screwed up face he has when he laughs

His habit of rubbing his eyes when he can’t stop sweating

No matter how you look at him, his personality is boring

Our styles aren’t similar at all

He’s uselessly shy, a bit of bad taste

The smirk he has when he lies is annoying

I figured those out ages ago, it sucks

I just didn’t have a boyfriend at that time

It was just a relationship for me to kill time with

Those are the excuses I told my friends

To think that I would pursue him… why would I?

He tries to win me over with boring jokes

And I’m sick of his nonstop talking

I’ve always locked him out, and now I’m knocking

Even though I'm overflowing with 'wanting to be loved' in my own way, you don't appear,

I have this nagging feeling that I'll never see you again….

I want to tell you that, but I can't find the right words

Even though it’s probably okay if I lie, I can’t even say “Don’t leave”

When our hands come apart,

Will you forget someday?

About me?

Even though I'm overflowing with 'wanting to be loved' in my own way, you don't appear,

I have this nagging feeling that I'll never see you again….

I want to tell you that, but I can't find the right words

Even though it’s probably okay if I lie, I can’t even say “Don’t leave”
