This clan is an unnamed family, which originated from an unknown area. The members of this clan possess the innate ability to absorb
natural energy
 from their surroundings due to their unique bodies. However, the adverse effects of this energy results in sudden and uncontrollable surges of madness, causing them to sporadically go berserk. Their unique bodies also secrete special fluids that allow them to undergo various drastic
physical alterations
.

The only known member is
Jūgo
, who voluntarily went to
Orochimaru
 in the hopes that he could be cured of his fits of rage. According to
Kabuto Yakushi
, Orochimaru's subsequent investigations and
experimentation
 allowed him to discover the origin of the clan's power at the
Ryūchi Cave
, where he obtained
senjutsu
 power and, years later, Kabuto would learn
Sage Mode
.
