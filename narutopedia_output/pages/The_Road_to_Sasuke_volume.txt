Sasuke
 after two-and-a-half years,
Team 7
 is currently not prepared to go on the mission,
Kakashi
 resting in the hospital and Sasuke's position otherwise being vacant. Determined to go,
Naruto
 goes looking for temporary members for Team 7. In doing so he sees the members of
Team 8
 for the first time since his return. While he does so, the

) and Shikamaru provides support as Naruto tries to apprehend him. Unimpressed by Naruto, Sai asks if he is perhaps a girl.

Chapter 284

The New Comrades…!!
" (
新しい仲間…!!
,
Atarashii Nakama…!!
)

Tsunade
 refuses the
Konoha Council
's instructions to keep
Naruto
 under constant surveillance. Since
Akatsuki
 will inevitably come after him, it is important that he go on missions in order to get strong enough to face them. They agree, but only if one of
Danzō
's men will be added to
Team 7
 as protection. She allows it, but selects
Yamato
, a capable ninja from the Anbu as
Kakashi
's replacement and asks him to keep an eye on Danzō's choice. Meanwhile,
Sai
 eludes Naruto and
Team 10
, promising to see them later. This proves to be when the new Team 7 first meets, and he wastes no time insulting his new teammates, Naruto and
Sakura
.

The Person from Root!!
" (

.

 gives them a chance to prepare for the mission. Sai is approached by a fellow
Root
 member and is given his orders for the upcoming mission. Sakura says goodbye to
Tsunade
 and, in doing so, runs into

, a former rival of the
Third Hokage
 who dislikes Tsunade, the Third's student. When everyone is ready,
Team 7
 departs.

Chapter 286

"
Naruto and Sasuke and Sakura
" (
ナルトとサスケとサクラ
,
Naruto to Sasuke to Sakura
)

Naruto
 has difficulty getting along with
Sai
, finding him unpleasant and otherwise inferior to
Sasuke
. Sai has no issues with not living up to Sasuke's precedent, thinking of him as nothing more than a traitor who went to
Orochimaru
 for the shallow reason of gaining power. Naruto tries to attack him for insulting Sasuke but
Sakura
 stops him, instead attacking Sai herself.
Yamato
 breaks up the fight and forces them to get along. To improve teamwork they spend the night at a spa, where Sai once again finds the opportunity to question Naruto's masculinity.

Chapter 287

"
Untitled
" (
無題
,
Mudai
)

Sakura
 finds
Sai
 drawing a picture. Impressed by his talent she asks what he is going to call it. He cannot come up with anything, his lack of emotion making it impossible for him to be so creative. She finds a picture book he drew amongst his belongings, which he says belongs to his brother. When
Naruto
 appears Sai insults him again while keeping a fake smile on his face, something he does for others' benefit so that he has the appearance of emotion. Later that night,
Yamato
 asks Sakura to tell him about
Sasori
 as they must be able to approach his spy without raising suspicion.

Chapter 288

"
Uncomprehending Feelings
" (
分からない感情
,
Wakaranai Omoi
)

Although
Yamato
 hopes he will be able to convince
Sasori
's spy that he is the real Sasori, it is likely his cover will be blown at some point and they will need to capture the spy. As such, they practice their teamwork in a combat scenario the next day.
Sai
 does not hesitate to sacrifice
Naruto
 in order to complete the exercise. Naruto once again compares him to
Sasuke
, saying that Sasuke would not betray a team-mate like that. Although Sai disagrees with this point, he only reminds Naruto that his absence of emotion makes it impossible for him to think of anything but the mission's success.

Chapter 289

"
The Spy from Akatsuki!!
" (
“暁”のスパイ!!
,
"Akatsuki" no Supai!!
)

Sakura
 tries to make
Sai
 appreciate
Naruto
's attachment to
Sasuke
 by comparing their relationship to the one Sai had with his
brother
. Sai informs her that his brother is dead, and that when he died he had no emotional response whatsoever. She gives up on trying to make him understand and settles for whatever support he can provide for finding Sasuke. The next day
Yamato
, disguised as
Sasori
, meets with Sasori's spy:
Kabuto
. Yamato asks him about
Orochimaru
, unaware that Orochimaru is watching.

Author's Note

“

It's 2006. I believe the serialisation began in 1999, so that means we've entered our seventh year of publication! Long enough for kids that were just entering elementary school to now be in junior high... I recently started noticing how it seems like the years pass quicker and quicker. Where in the world did the time go?! When in the world did I become middle-aged?! Yikes...
