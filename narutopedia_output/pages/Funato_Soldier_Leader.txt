Water Release
 user, creating tendrils to hold people in place and attack, as well as sending signals high in the air to his men.

Great Sea Battle of Kirigakure Arc

During a Funato Clan operation on Dotō Island, he lead soldiers responsible for stealing recently discovered gold, using hostages to mine it. When one the hostages revealed that Konoha citizens were among the hostages in addition to escaped shinobi, he prepared to capture them, anticipating they'd try rescuing the hostages, promising a gold nugget to whichever soldier captured them. He and his forces ambushed Sarada and Mitsuki, who had rescued the hostages, but Sarada deceived him with genjutsu and knocked him out. Upon regaining consciousness, he signalled the bulk of his forces to attack the hostages, who had fled to a Funato ship. Despite attempting to board the ship, they were unable to prevent them from escaping.
