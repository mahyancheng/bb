Hisen
 (
ヒゼン
) was the former leader of
Takigakure
, who sacrificed his life protecting the village.

Background

Hisen led Takigakure well for many years until his death after drinking the
hero water
, trying to protect his village when it came under attack by foreign powers; the water granted him temporary strength enhancements, but shortened his life that led to a rather premature demise. His position as
leader
 was passed onto his son,
Shibuki
.

Personality

From all indications, Hisen was a very loyal person and devoted leader of his village, willingly giving up his life in order to save it.

Appearance

Hisen had short smooth brown hair that was greying all on the outside with just the top of his head still having brown hair. He wore a black Takigakure forehead protector around his forehead and his hair hang over the left and right sides of it and he also had brown side burns. He also had small black-coloured eyes and a small brown-coloured goetee.

Abilities

Little is known about Hisen's skills, but he was skilled enough to protect his village when it came under attack by foreign powers. He drank the
Hero Water
 to amplify his strength several folds for short periods of time, though at the cost of his lifespan, which ended his life prematurely. Hisen was also a
Water Release
 user, capable of using the
Water Release: Lotus Light Rupture
 technique, allowing him to create lotus-shaped razor-sharp weapons out of water. He could use the
Summoning Technique
 to call forth
Ryūrimaru
 and
transform
 it into a golden dragon.

Trivia

Written as 飛泉, "Hisen" means "waterfall".
