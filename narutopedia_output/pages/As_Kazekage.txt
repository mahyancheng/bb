 manga.

Summary

While freeing himself from
Gaara
's sand,
Deidara
 notices that Gaara seems to have two sand sources: the sand of the desert surrounding them and a special kind used for defence and precision attacks. The
Sunagakure
 villagers watch the battle from the ground below,
Kankurō
 remembering Gaara's desire to protect the village and its inhabitants with his life. The villagers, no longer fearing Gaara as they once did, encourage him to defeat his opponent. Taking advantage of their presence, Deidara drops a
C3
 explosive on the village. Gaara shields the village from the explosion but, in his preoccupation, is almost hit by one of Deidara's clay explosives. His
Shield of Sand
 blocks it in time, but Gaara finds that Deidara has managed to hide explosives in this special sand. After they detonate, Gaara uses the last of his energy to make sure that the sand from their battle should not fall on the entire village before Deidara captures him.
