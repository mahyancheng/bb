The
Suicide Corps
 is a team of
Konohagakure

taijutsu
 users under the leadership of
Rock Lee
. All of the members of the group seem to be exceptionally skilled in taijutsu, demonstrating enough mastery of the
Eight Gates
 to access the Sixth Gate for a team attack. Two years after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, the team
defended
 Konoha from falling meteorites.
