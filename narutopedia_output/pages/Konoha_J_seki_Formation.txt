Izumo uses
Water Release: Starch Syrup Capturing Field
 to create a big pool of water, after which, he, alongside Asuma and Kotetsu, moulds with the water in order to get close to their opponent. The three then jump out of the water and strike the opponent behind their back, with Izumo and Kotetsu delivering an attack with a
long kunai
 and a
mace
 simultaneously, followed with Asuma striking the opponent with his
Flying Swallow
-enhanced
Chakra Blade
. After that, Shikamaru uses his
Shadow Gathering Technique
 to pull his teammates in, allowing Kotetsu and Izumo to attack the opponent once more, creating a pillar of water, which hardens after the blow, followed with Asuma slashing through the pillar and the opponent.
