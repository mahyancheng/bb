 Feelings Run Wild…!!) is chapter 252 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Team 7
 informs
Temari
 that
Gaara
 has been kidnapped by
Akatsuki
, so she joins them in rushing back to
Sunagakure
.
Naruto
 voices his disgust with Akatsuki for pursuing both Gaara and himself because they are
jinchūriki
, a horrible punishment for those who have been ostracised by others for their whole lives. Temari is glad that Naruto at least can relate to her little brother.
Sakura
 also notes that
Itachi
, who
Sasuke
 joined
Orochimaru
 in order to kill, is part of Akatsuki. She concludes that stopping Akatsuki is in the best interest of both Naruto and Sasuke. In Sunagakure,
Baki
 tries to get
Chiyo
 to cure the poisoned
Kankurō
. She has no interest until she discovers that the one who poisoned Kankurō was
Sasori
, her grandson.
