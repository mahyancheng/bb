The
Paw Encyclopaedia
 is a book filled with paw prints of cats collected by
Itachi Uchiha
 and
Sasuke Uchiha
 in their youth. The paws in the encyclopaedia range from nimble house cats all the way to the
Two-Tails
. It was originally a game Itachi conjured up to occupy Sasuke, who would often throw tantrums, while he bought weapons for the
Uchiha clan
. At first, Itachi didn't intend for the game to be serious, but
Nekobaa
 later turned it into an actual book. The last paw print collected was that of
Nekomata
, which was obtained by Sasuke Uchiha.
