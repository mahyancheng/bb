Using snakes as a catalyst, the user can create a clone of themselves or objects
 that function similarly to
shadow clones
. When dealt sufficient damage the clone will revert back into snakes. The snakes can also be used to enter areas that they might find difficult to access otherwise. The user can then manipulate its actions, when given the command.
