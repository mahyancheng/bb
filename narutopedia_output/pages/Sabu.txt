Personality






Sabu crying while he performs a song.



Sabu is a calm, collected, and often a dead serious person especially when he is practising enka. This was demonstrated when B joked around during an enka training session, Sabu told him to take the lessons seriously. He is also very passionate about enka singing often moved to tears when performing and noting to B, that his songs should have passion.

Appearance

Sabu is a short, middle-aged man with dark-brown hair which he wears in a
punch perm
 bun-style, thick eyebrows and round black eyes. He wears a cream-coloured kimono, held closed by a purple sash which has two fuzzy tassels hanging in the front. Underneath this, he wears mesh armour which stretch past the sleeves of his kimono.

Abilities

Despite his small stature, Sabu is shown to possess great strength, able to wield an enormous
axe
 many times his own size, with great ease and dexterity.
 He is also highly observant, able to determine that
Samehada
 was absorbing B's chakra, making his attacks less effective.

Part II

Five Kage Summit






Sabu attacks Kisame with Yosaku Cut.



Sabu was introduced while teaching B how to put more passion in his music and singing. Kisame Hoshigaki arrived during their practice to capture B, and
Ponta
 immediately charged at him. As soon as Ponta was defeated Sabu prepared to battle. Kisame ran towards him but was distracted by Killer B, giving Sabu a chance to strike. Killer B attacked as well, but Kisame blocked both attacks with his Samehada, but obtained a minor injury in his left shoulder from one of Killer B's katana. When Killer B began to
transform
, Sabu noticed that Samehada was absorbing all of B's chakra. After being freed from Kisame's water
dome

prison
 with Ponta, Sabu stood back while Killer B continued his fight with Kisame and upon seeing that B was having a hard time at it, Sabu rushed to his aid only to see Kisame's decapitated head fall in front of him and that B and
A
 had killed him; though it was later discovered to actually be a transformed
clone
 of
Zetsu
.
