The user of this technique firstly transfers their mind into a
puppet
 laid somewhere in advance, near the vicinity of an enemy's predicted path, before manipulating it to attack an intended opponent. When the opponent counters and inflicts damage upon the puppet or the puppet inflicts damage on the enemy, the cursed seal will take effect, causing the kanji "curse" (
呪
,
noroi
) to disappear from the puppet's forehead and the two consciousness (that of the user's inside the puppet and that of the victim who countered) to switch. Consequently, the user will gain full control of the opponent's body, while the victim's mind remains trapped within the immobile puppet.

Like the
original technique
, the user's body is left defenceless while the ability is active and any injury done to the victim's body is also reflected upon their true body, but this can be rectified if the user cancels the technique just before any damage is received.
 Unlike the original, the user does not have to worry about the target's will overpowering their own, as it is sealed in the puppet.
