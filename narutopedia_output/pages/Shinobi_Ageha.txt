The Shinobi Ageha.



Shinobi Ageha
 (
シノビアゲハ
) are a species of butterflies in
Jiraiya
's novel, read by
Tsunade
 in her
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 dream.

Overview

In a warm season, they usually appear near the village where
Kaya
 and her family lived. According to
Tsunade
, the butterflies' powdery scales stimulate the flow of
chakra
 and are therefore used as an ingredient in
Military Rations Pills
.

They also seem to be directly related to the usage of the
Masked Man
's
Eight Trigrams Grid Palm
 technique, as both
Hinata
 and
Neji Hyūga
 noticed a presence of chakra, and during every encounter with them, the
jōnin
 were affected by the technique.

Trivia

"Ageha" (
揚羽
) is the Japanese name of the
swallowtail butterfly
.

When
Konan
 used her
Dance of the Shikigami
 technique to guide the
genin
 to the whereabouts of their team leaders, her butterflies took on the form of Shinobi Ageha.
