Animal Path (disambiguation)
.

He was a
shinobi
 of the
Fūma Clan
.

Background

On the verge of the
Second Shinobi World War
, he destroyed a peaceful village due to a tip that a shinobi had infiltrated it. When
Jiraiya
 discovered the village, the Fūma member attacked him with his
shurikenjutsu
, leading to them fighting and him receiving a slash across his forehead. Years later, his corpse was converted into the
Animal Path
 by
Nagato
.

The ninja's hair was a light green colour when he was alive, tied back in a long ponytail with a fringe hanging down from the right side of his head. He received a scar on his forehead during an encounter with Jiraiya, which was usually obstructed by the Animal Path's
forehead protector
.

Like other corpses, the Animal Path's hair was dyed orange. It had a large bridge piercing through its upper nose which was attached on each cheek with a circular stud, one stud on its upper nose, six studs around the bottom of its face, and one stud on each ear. It does not have eyebrows. While being examined by Konoha, the body was shown to have multiple piercings on its chest and legs as well. As a mark of Nagato's control, the
Rinnegan
 appeared in its eyes.

Abilities

Though not much about his abilities are known, he was capable of singlehandedly wiping out a peaceful village. As a member of the Fūma clan, he was skilled in the usage of giant
shuriken
.

Legacy

As part of the Six Paths of Pain, the Animal Path is used for a number of different purposes over the years: all six Paths are used to overthrow and kill
Hanzō
; when Jiraiya infiltrates
Amegakure
 in order to find out more about
Akatsuki
, the Animal Path fights him but is ultimately captured and sent to
Konohagakure
 for study. During
Pain's Assault
, the
Preta Path
 locates the captured Path and destroys its
black receivers
.

Trivia

In the anime, this ninja is possibly the basis of the antagonist from Jiraiya's
Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi
, with his fight with Jiraiya almost completely identical with the fight depicted in the novel.
