In his
one-tailed form
, Naruto brushes his claws past each other, releasing a powerful horizontal crescent wave that rips though the opponent and causes them to crumple to the ground in pain.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! EX 3
, this attack could only be performed with a Senzai Ninriki (Latent Ninja Power) active; this is no longer the case in
Clash of Ninja Revolution 3
 and
Gekitō Ninja Taisen! Special
.

Trivia

In some Japanese sources, the naming of this type of attack also applies to Naruto's jumping strong attack in this state as well (which is a burst of energy shot as a projectile downward, but moreso is considered to be a
Great Roar
 instead).

This attack is based off of the invisible surge launched at Sasuke upon Naruto entering his Version 1 form for the first time in the original anime/manga.

When used in
EX 3
, the attack is instead performed with the motion/animation being one of Three-Tailed Naruto's basic attacks.

However, as of
Revolution 3
 and
Special
, the original animation from
Gekitō Ninja Taisen! 4
 is reused.

If the attack is somehow used up close enough in the Wii-subseries, it instead slightly jerks the target back instead of causing them to crumple.
