Jirōbō
 slams his hands to the ground. The strength of this slam is great enough to rip open a section of the
earth
 in front of him and leverage it up into a wall, similar to a "
tatami
 return" (
畳返し
). This wall of earth shields Jirōbō, usually from projectile attacks, but it can also be used against approaching physical strikes.

After acquiring Jirōbō's DNA,
Kabuto Yakushi
 is able use this technique through his
Strange Transmission Distant Shadow
 technique. In Kabuto's use, the ground is lifted up on both sides of him, thus shifting the approaching
Amaterasu
 away from him.

Trivia

When Kabuto uses this technique, he refers to it as "Jirōbō: Earth Release: Earth Shore Return" (
次郎坊・土遁・土陸返し
,
Jirōbō: Doton: Doroku Gaeshi
).
