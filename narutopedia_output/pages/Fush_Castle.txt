Fushū Castle.



Fushū
 Castle
 (
俘囚城
,
Fushū-jō
) is a structure in the centre of
Curtain Village
, which formerly served as the headquarters of
Gengo
 and the
Enlightened Ones
 until their disbandment. While under the rule of the noble
Sakuya
, she had a team dedicated to erecting and maintaining an impenetrable
barrier
 around the stronghold. After her death and the barrier's dispelling, the castle was immediately ransacked and pillaged by the impoverished citizens, who were all killed by
Deepa
 when he came to investigate.
