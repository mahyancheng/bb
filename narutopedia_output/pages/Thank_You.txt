Kushina
 protests the use of the

, asking
Minato
 why he is sacrificing himself so she can meet
Naruto
 for a few minutes when he's older. He convinces  her that it's the right thing to do because "he could never substitute for her". The
death god
 grabs the

 but seals only half of it. Minato summons
Gerotora
 and gives him the key to the seal he's about to put on Naruto. Kushina gives Naruto a long list of things to do then Minato performs the

Naruto thanks his parents for making him their son and tells them that his vessel is full of love from the both of them. As Kushina fades away, she thanks him for letting her and Minato be his parents and thanks him for being born to them.
