Naruto: Konoha Senki
 is a Japanese-only strategy game for
Game Boy Advance
.

Gameplay

The game covers the first 70 episodes of
Naruto
, primarily the
Prologue — Land of Waves
 and
Chūnin Exams
 arcs. During the game's first play-through, the player is restricted to using Naruto, Sakura, Sasuke and occasionally Kakashi. After the game is completed, other characters can be unlocked by first beating them in a side-story mission.

Characters also have a wide range of techniques available. Players can equip items to characters such as chakra pills, healing items and ranged weapons such as kunai and shuriken. Characters can create clones which can be used as decoys and some characters can create full-bodied clones which can be used in combination attacks and to perform offensive techniques. Characters can also use the transformation techniques to take on the appearance of another character, to trick the opponent.

This game includes many of the main cast along with a special appearance by
Masashi Kishimoto
 as a hidden character. It is also the only game that has the members of
Team Dosu
 as fully playable characters.

The game also has a quiz mode that tests the player's knowledge on the first 70 episodes of the show, along with some obscure facts about the characters, moves and events.
