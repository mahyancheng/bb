Pain's Assault

Main article:
Pain's Assault

When
Naruto Uzumaki
 goes to
Mount Myōboku
 to train, Kōsuke is left in
Konohagakure
 to become a sort of emissary between the toads and the village. He was placed under the direct command of
Tsunade
, so that she may contact Naruto if trouble ever arose. When Konohagakure is finally under attack by the
Akatsuki
 members
Pain
 and
Konan
, Kōsuke attempts to inform Mount Myōboku to call Naruto back. However, before he could do so, he is killed by
Danzō Shimura
, who wants to keep the toads and Naruto in the dark, so that any possibility of Naruto being captured by Akatsuki is hindered. Despite this, Naruto is eventually informed anyway after
Gamatama
, Mount Myōboku's name-registration clerk, noticed Kōsuke's name missing from the toad summoning contract.

Trivia

Following Nagato's attack on the village, he used the
Outer Path — Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 to revive all the fallen from the attack. It is unknown if Kōsuke was one of the individuals revived.
