Mujina Bandits Arc

During their visit to
Konoha
, Yamaoka was seen speaking with a shopkeeper after the daimyō and his son
Tentō
 left. He was later charged with looking after young Tentō when Ikkyū departed for his meeting with the
Seventh Hokage
.

After Ikkyū left, Tentō asked Yamaoka how many cases of collectable cards were left in the store. Yamaoka advised the young man that each customer was limited to three packs only. Tentō, however, informs Yamaoka that he will simply buy the entire store. Yamaoka would later find his young charge
training
 with his bodyguard
Boruto
. He immediately voiced his disapproval of this, stating that such activities were not befitting their heir of a daimyō. With some persuasion, however, Yamaoka permitted Tentō to continue his training, but only while he was in Konoha. Afterwards, when alone, the
Mujina Bandits
' leader
Shojoji
 assumed Yamaoka's identity via the
Corpse Clone Technique
, killing Yamaoka in the process.
