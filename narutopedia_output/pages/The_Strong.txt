Summary

With a newfound resolve to win,

Gaara
 with a group of
shadow clones
. He lands a lucky blow, damaging Gaara's defenceless underside, but this only gives Gaara a greater interest in killing him.
Sasuke
 steps in, telling Naruto to free
Sakura
 from Gaara's prison and flee. Having lost his entire family, Sasuke will not allow his teammates to die too, they being the only precious things he has left. Remembering
Haku
