The
Wind Release: Ultra-Big Ball Rasenshuriken
 is a more advanced version of
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
.

Usage

While in
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
, Naruto uses
chakra arms
 to greatly expand his Rasenshuriken to the point where its size exceeds that of a summon as large as
Gamakichi
. Naruto used four hands to form the technique instead of three.
 Much like the
smaller

variants
, Naruto is able to throw this technique a considerable distance. It is powerful enough to break through a
giant barrier
.

Trivia

On the Studio Pierrot website for episode 305, the "Wind Release" part of the name is dropped.

In the anime, the nucleus-blade ratio of the Rasenshuriken itself was proportioned differently, being similar to a greatly enlarged
Wind Release: Rasengan
.
