The
Third Raikage
's rule was noted to be riddled with the
jinchūriki
 of the
Eight-Tails
 losing control of the beast, and going on a rampage. To deal with these epidemics, the Third assembled a special team tasked with restraining the Eight-Tails whenever this happened. They would bind the Eight-Tails with
chains
 — which in the anime, were said to be imbued with a
fūinjutsu
 — and distract it, giving the Third enough time to use the
Kohaku no Jōhei
 to seal the beast. The inability of jinchūriki to control the Eight-Tails cost
Kumogakure
 many lives, including that of
Furui
 who was a member of the team. After the Eight-Tails was sealed into
Killer B
, he was able to control it, bringing an end to the rampages and the assumed disbanding of this team.
