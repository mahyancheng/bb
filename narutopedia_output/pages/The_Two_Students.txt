"
The Two Students
" (
ふたりの弟子
,
Futari no Deshi
) is episode 169 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Sakura
 begins to heal
Hinata
 from her wounds, musing how Hinata truly loves
Naruto
, as the latter destroys the
Deva Path
 with his
Rasengan
. Pulling the
black chakra receivers
 out of the Deva Path's
body
, Naruto decides to locate the real Pain and talk to him, asking
Katsuyu
 to notify the others not to follow him.

Katsuyu relays to Sakura, Hinata,
Kō
 and
Team Guy
 that Naruto has successfully defeated the
Six Paths of Pain
 and is now heading out to defeat the final
Pain
.
Neji
 and
Guy
 decide to give him backup, but Katsuyu relays Naruto's message that this is something he wants to do alone. On his way to the real Pain's location, he is sighted by
Inoichi
,
Shikaku
 and an unnamed member of the
Hyūga clan
. Inoichi wants the three of them to tag along with Naruto to defeat Pain, but is outraged when Naruto tells him that he is not going there to kill him but to merely talk to him face-to-face. Shikaku calms Inoichi down and allows Naruto to go on ahead, promising not to follow. As Inoichi asks why Shikaku would do that, Shikaku reveals that his son
Shikamaru
 had mentioned before how Naruto had a way of convincing others to follow in his path and that he would be an important
shinobi
 for
Konoha
 someday. He tells the others that Shikamaru rarely praises anybody, and for Shikamaru to have said those things about Naruto inspires him to have that same faith as well.

Naruto activates his
Sage Mode
 and is able to sense the real Pain's location. As he enters their hideout, located within a giant tree, he sees Nagato and
Konan
 in front of him. Nagato fires a black chakra receiver towards Naruto and impales him, remarking that he had purposely avoided vital spots since he needs the
jinchuriki
 alive. Naruto, nevertheless, is able to channel the
Nine-Tails
'
chakra
 through the receiver whilst also maintaining Sage Mode, incapacitating Nagato. Nagato asks Naruto if he hates him, and thinking back upon how Nagato killed
Jiraiya
 and
Kakashi
, Naruto lunges at Nagato with the
intent to kill
. As Konan moves in to shield Nagato, Naruto remembers Jiraiya's remarks on how he had hoped to break the cycle of hatred as well as how his father, the
Fourth Hokage
, had said the current system of hatred would only give birth to those like Pain. Naruto stops his attack and dispels both the Nine-Tails' influence as well as Sage Mode, asking for them to share their stories. He states that Nagato and Konan are unlike the other
Akatsuki
 members who seem to enjoy killing and that he would like to know how they became the way they are despite being taught by Jiraiya, and Nagato agrees to tell him his story.
