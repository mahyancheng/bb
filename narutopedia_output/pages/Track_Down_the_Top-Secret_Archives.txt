,
Gokuhi Shiryōshū o oe!
) is an
ani-manga
-style short published in the
Jump Heroes
 special magazine.

Summary

Izumo Kamizuki
 and
Kotetsu Hagane
 are tasked by
Tsunade
 to find a special, top-secret document with a red cover. While they search for it, they notice
Jiraiya
 handing a book that matches that description to
Naruto Uzumaki
 and ask the boy to give it to them, assuming that Jiraiya was trying to deliver it to Tsunade. However, Naruto runs from them, and the two shinobi pursue him to recover it, eventually getting
Team 10
's help in catching him. With the book damaged from their fighting, the two shinobi verify its contents, only to realise it's not the book they were looking for.

Some time later, Naruto hands the damaged book, now in an envelope to hide its condition, to
Kakashi
, and runs off before he opens it. Kakashi opens the envelope to find his copy of the
Icha Icha
 Databook stained and partly burned, to his annoyance. Meanwhile, in the
Hokage's Office
, the Izumo and Kotetsu find the book they were looking for in a pile of books.
