This shinobi was reincarnated by
Kabuto Yakushi
 to steal the KIA scroll during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

Personality

He disliked being used by Kabuto, quarrelling with his
teammate
 over it. Despite this, he showed zeal in battling the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
.

Appearance

He was a man of medium height with brown hair hanging down to his shoulders. He wore the standard
Kumogakure
 flak jacket, including a grey one-shoulder vest and a forehead protector. In addition, he wore a yellow
plague mask
 covering the top of his face, as well as a large brown weapon pouch.

Abilities

In life, he was remarkable enough that Kabuto decided to reincarnate him. He was a skilled taijutsu user, fighting nimbly and acrobatically. In battle, he could easily snap the necks of several enemies in sequence without even needing to get his feet on the ground. He had remarkable reflexes, deflecting Sukui's scalpels with his kunai. His weapon of choice were spiked bombs, which sent a hail of shrapnel at his opponents.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Kabuto reincarnated him and a Suna shinobi to assist Hayate Gekkō in retrieving a KIA scroll containing intel sensitive casualties, such as kekkei genkai bearers. He and the Suna shinobi engaged in combat with the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
 while Hayate retrieved the scroll. On their way back to Kabuto, they were intercepted by a team lead by
Sukui
. The Kumo shinobi was caught in an
explosive tag
 trap, and before his body could regenerate, he was sealed by
Iō
, who pinned him down with a huge rock containing a
Sealing Tag
.
