"
The Battle Over the Barrier
" (
結界攻防戦
,
Kekkai Kōbōsen
) is episode 105 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Guren
 and
Kabuto
 return to the lake where the latter attempts to feed
Yūkimaru
 many pills. Knowing that the pills would come at the cost of Yūkimaru's life, Guren offers to deal with the
tailed beast
 without Yūkimaru's involvement. Kabuto relents, but only if she follows his orders, and sends
Rinji
 to relay his orders when the time comes. As she waits by the clifftop for Rinji, Kabuto brings Yūkimaru to an adjacent clifftop, with a view of the
Konoha

shinobi
 attempting their
Four-Corner Sealing Barrier
. He reminds Yūkimaru that Guren is willing to tackle a tailed beast all on her own just to save him, and that she may die from the effort.

Rinji approaches Guren and notifies her that the two people guarding the
fūinjutsu
 team is a
weapons-user
 and a
taijutsu
 expert. Knowing her
chakra
 is limited, Guren offers herself as bait to draw the attention of the two guardians while Rinji is to take out the sealing barrier.
Lee
 and
Tenten
 are surprised to see the
Crystal Release
 user in front of them, as they had believed that
Kakashi
's team had dealt with her. Using her
jade crystal blades
 on her forearms along with her
Crystal Armour
, she proves to be a formidable opponent for the two. She manages to distract the two while Rinji heads towards the sealing team, who are defenseless, only to be repelled by
Naruto
 and
Gamatatsu
's
Wind Release: Toad Gun
. Lee is overjoyed to see Naruto, who had summoned Gamatatsu and
Gamakichi
.
Shino
 is present as well, who attempts to use his
bugs
 against Guren's crystal, only for it to fail against Guren's
Crystal Release: Tearing Crystal Falling Dragon
.

However, the tide of their bout turns when the
Three-Tails
 manages to break out of its barrier. Guren tells Rinji to retreat, as their job of breaking the barrier has been successful. As they attempt to flee, the Three-Tailed Turtle uses his
Water Release: Great Water Mass Bullet
 to destroy Guren's crystal dragon and sent her to shore on an island; Naruto and Shino are sent underwater while Gamakichi and Gamatatsu dispel themselves; Lee manages to save
Ino
 as he reaches land.
Yamato
 and
Kiba
 meet up with Kakashi and
Sai
, with the latter team revealing that they had failed to defeat Guren. However, all four of them hear the cries of the tailed beast and realise that trouble is in the air. Meanwhile, Yūkimaru spots the Three-Tails about to harm a winded-out Guren and taps into his
Three-Tails Chakra: Release
 to control the beast and prevent Guren's death. As Rinji spots Yūkimaru, it turns out that this was
Orochimaru
's plan all along - he knew that Yūkimaru would not unleash his true power while being forced to do so, and would only do it to protect a loved one, hence why he tasked Guren to his protection, knowing a bond would form between them. In the meantime,
Tobi
 of the
Akatsuki
 moves fleetingly around the perimeter as he observes the Three-Tails, gleeful that he has truly located it after all.

Trivia

In the English dub, the scene where
Tobi
 sees the
Three-Tails
,
Michael Yurchak
, the voice actor for Tobi, and Obito following his unmasking, uses the character's real voice rather than the fake voice he'd been using for the Tobi persona. Interestingly, in the original dub, Tobi speaks in his Madara voice instead of his real one. This likely implies that even though chapter 599 had not yet been released, the idea that Tobi was Obito was already finalized at the time the English dub of this episode was in production and the production staff was made aware of this.
