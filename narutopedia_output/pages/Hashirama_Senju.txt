This article is about the character. For the manga chapter, see
Hashirama Senju
.

Hashirama Senju
 (
千手柱間
,
Senju Hashirama
) was a member and leader of the famed
Senju clan
 and a
reincarnation
 of
Asura Ōtsutsuki
. He himself was hailed as the "God of Shinobi" for his unmatched ninja prowess. Hashirama sought peace for the shinobi world, and to that end founded
Konohagakure
 with his clan, his childhood friend and rival:
Madara Uchiha
, and the
Uchiha clan
. He would later become the
First
Hokage
 (
初代火影
,
Shodai Hokage
,
literally meaning:
 First or Founding Fire Shadow) of Konohagakure. Although he was not able to achieve peace during his lifetime, his legacy and vision for the world would continue to shape the village and the entire shinobi world even after his death.

Background






Hashirama meeting Madara.



Hashirama was born during the
Warring States Period
, the eldest of
Butsuma Senju
's four sons. Hashirama and his brothers grew up on the battlefield waging constant war with the Senju's rivals: the
Uchiha
. During his infrequent downtime, Hashirama met a boy his own age named
Madara
. The two quickly developed a friendly rivalry, be it skipping stones or urinating in rivers, with Hashirama typically winning their contests.
 Hashirama did not approve of this practice of sending children to fight and die, believing it would only increase the bitterness between the Senju and Uchiha, thus causing more deaths.






Hashirama and his family attend Kawarama's funeral.



After the deaths of their brothers,
Kawarama
 and later
Itama
, Hashirama and his remaining brother,
Tobirama
, decided a new shinobi system would need to be implemented to end the cycle of child deaths, a system that would require an alliance between the Senju and Uchiha. Like Hashirama, Madara was also a shinobi who had lost brothers on the battlefield. Together they imagined a world where children like themselves wouldn't need to fight and where their brothers would be safe from harm.
 As a precaution, Hashirama and Madara did not divulge their family names, but nevertheless discovered each other's identities: Hashirama was a Senju, Madara was an Uchiha; it was their duty to kill each other. Hashirama set this duty aside, unwilling to take his friend's life. Madara, however, decided their dreams of a peaceful world were impossible, and therefore ended their friendship so that they could kill each other without reservation.






Hashirama and Madara clash on the battlefield.



Over the following years Hashirama and Madara continued to meet in combat. Hashirama could never bring himself to kill someone he still considered a friend, and Madara could never defeat Hashirama's superior abilities. In time, both Madara and Hashirama became leaders of their respective clans. Under Hashirama's leadership and extraordinary ninja prowess, the Senju began to best the Uchiha Clan until at one point Hashirama had both Madara and Izuna at his mercy. However, unable to find the resolve to kill his childhood friend, Hashirama tried to convince Madara to unite their two clans to make their childhood dreams a reality. A mortally wounded Izuna convinced Madara otherwise and they retreated, prompting Hashirama to send a cease-fire request. Although some Uchiha found the offer increasingly tempting, Madara was unwilling to accept after Tobirama killed his last remaining brother,
Izuna
. This did not stop some Uchiha from defecting to the Senju out of self-preservation.
 Wracked with grief, Madara made one final stand against Hashirama and the Senju and was summarily defeated. Tobirama attempted to kill Madara to finally end the fighting, but Hashirama stopped him, knowing that would only renew hostilities between the Senju and Uchiha. At Madara's suggestion, Hashirama offered to kill himself in order to achieve a peaceful resolution. As he was about to end his own life, Madara stopped him, moved by the gesture, and assented to peace.






Konohagakure is formed.



The Senju, the Uchiha, and all their affiliated clans came together to found a village of peace, where children would never need to die in battle. Hashirama and Madara, rekindling their childhood friendship, called that village
Konohagakure
. The other countries would soon follow Konohagakure's example and build their own hidden villages. It was his wish that Madara become
Hokage
, the village's leader and protector.
 At Tobirama's insistence, the Hokage position was democratically elected, and in the end it was Hashirama that was chosen for the office.
 Hashirama wanted Madara to work with him as a brother and as his right hand so that he could improve his standing among the villagers and someday succeed him as Second Hokage. Madara felt that position would inevitably go to Tobirama, which would in turn end badly for the Uchiha. With his position in Konoha rapidly diminishing and after being manipulated by the stone tablet
Zetsu
 altered,
 Madara decided the village was a failed experiment and abandoned it, intent on someday returning to face Hashirama in battle yet again.






Hashirama fighting Madara and the Nine-Tails.



True to his promise, Madara eventually attacked Konohagakure on multiple occasions.
 After countless fights and with the
Nine-Tails
 under his control, Madara challenged Hashirama to one final contest.
 The Nine-Tails' power, as well as Hashirama's efforts to capture and contain it, devastated the landscape, carving out what would later be called the
Valley of the End
. Hashirama spent the duration of their battle trying to reason with Madara, but Madara continued fighting until he was too tired to keep even his
Sharingan
 active. This enabled Hashirama to distract him with a
wood clone
 while the real Hashirama stabbed him in the back. Madara collapsed and, before dying, noted how much Hashirama had changed from when they were children.






Hashirama attending the first Kage Summit.



In the aftermath of the battle, Tobirama hid away Madara's body and Hashirama's wife,
Mito
, sealed the Nine-Tails within herself in order to contain its great power to Konoha's benefit.
 For a time, things were peaceful: Hashirama helped train one of Tobirama's students,
Hiruzen Sarutobi
; he got to spoil his first grandchild,
Tsunade
;
 he locked away the
Scroll of Seals
, the
kinjutsu
 it contained no longer necessary in the world he'd made.
 But the peace Hashirama had worked so hard for was starting to unravel; at some point
Takigakure
 sent
Kakuzu
 to assassinate him.
 Although he defeated Kakuzu, other wars began to break out.

In an unknown time, Hashirama convened a
Kage Summit
 so that he could share the
tailed beasts
 Konoha had acquired with them, thus balancing power amongst them. But cooperation would not be so simple as Hashirama intended it to be, first by Tobirama's demand that the other villages pay for the tailed beasts they received, then by the
First Kazekage
's counter-request of money and territory in lieu of a tailed beast. As unrest began to grow, Hashirama shared his fear that any agreement they made would only be temporary, but also that future generations could forge a lasting unity.






Hashirama buried.



Ultimately, Hashirama's wish for peace would not come to fruition during his lifetime and he died while Konohagakure began to flourish,
 with it being regarded as Hashirama dying in vein while in the midst of pursing his dream.
 Before his death he passed the title of Hokage to Tobirama, and instructed him not to mistreat the Uchiha.
 Hashirama's body was buried, and stayed intact long enough for
Orochimaru
 to extract DNA from.

Personality






Hashirama brooding about memories of Tsunade.



Hashirama was an excitable man with a boisterous personality. He loved meeting new people, having friendly competitions, and gambling. Headstrong and often impulsive, it fell to others – such as his brother, Tobirama – to be more responsible or realistic about things that Hashirama had gotten carried away with.
 When taken down in this way, or even when simply presented with information that troubled him, Hashirama could do a near-immediate about-face, going from laughing to sulking. These moping periods were typically brief though, and he'd quickly go back to his usual high-spirited nature.
 Later generations upon meeting him, tended to remark that neither extremes of his personality were very fitting for a man called the "
God of Shinobi
".

Despite the first impression he may give, Hashirama was capable of being serious when it came to matters that were important to him. He spent years opposing the practice of sending children to war and dreamed of a shinobi system where a child could be around others their age, never needing to "grow up" prematurely on the battlefield.
 To that end he became very devoted to Konoha upon its foundation, as it was the realisation of his dream for peaceful childhoods. He wanted the rest of the village to cherish what Konoha represented just as much as he did, encouraging them to regard every villager as part of one large family that should always look out for each other. As Hokage, his job was to protect that family at all costs, even if that cost was his life. This philosophy, known as the "
Will of Fire
", would become a cornerstone of Konoha teachings for decades after his death.






Hashirama offering his life without hesitation for peace.



The Will of Fire is demonstrative of Hashirama's general optimism when it came to other people; he believed a village-first loyalty would naturally break down the mentality that shinobi had to look out for their clans.
 Hashirama lived by this philosophy long before Konoha's founding, having no qualms about killing himself if it meant peace between the Uchiha and Senju clans. In fact, his entire goal of gaining more power was to have enough just to stop violence. One example of this was he believed if the
two most

powerful clans
 during the Warring States Period were to join forces, there would be no other shinobi clan to stand against them and would stop selling their services, effectively ending the Warring States Period. He always saw the best in others, either trusting that they acted in good faith or that they could, through non-violent means, be reasoned with. He was humble, not above lowering his head to his fellow village heads
 or claiming inferiority to those he'd never met but whose actions he approved of.
 If nothing else, Hashirama was kind, placing the needs of others before his own: he was even willing to take his own life if it would help create a world where his friends and family wouldn't need to die unnecessarily.
 It was on these points that Tobirama disagreed with Hashirama most ardently, as Tobirama felt that Hashirama should have a greater value of himself and a greater suspicion of others. It was, similarly, on these points that Hashirama was at his most forceful, asserting his views over Tobirama's; though Tobirama did not often agree, he knew better than to oppose his brother.
 Hashirama is also well-balanced on this regard as he didn't exert his force over Tobirama over past actions that cannot be changed such as when finding out Tobirama seemingly mistreated the Uchiha, he expressed anger, but didn't exert his force as it didn't do any good.






Hashirama's intimidating demeanour.



Hashirama had a lifelong friendship and rivalry with Madara Uchiha, eventually considering him a brother.
 As children, they would spend much of their free time together, talking, playing, and planning for a future that they weren't sure would ever come. Both were willing to oppose their own fathers by refusing to kill each other, but only Hashirama kept up this refusal into adulthood;
 even as enemies, Hashirama would go out of his way for Madara, restraining himself (and Tobirama) so as not to hurt him and indulging Madara's desires at his own consequence.
 When they were able to rekindle their friendship by making Konoha, Hashirama placed a great deal of trust in Madara by desiring him to be Hokage, believing it was the best way for Madara to recover from the loss of his brothers. When this ultimately failed, Hashirama respected Madara's opinions and dissatisfaction with the village, but would not permit him to move against Konoha, killing him in the end with sadness and reluctance in order to protect what they'd made together.
 Despite everything, Hashirama considered Madara his friend to the very end while admitting that the two of them tried to do everything by themselves to fulfill their respective dreams instead of cultivating them across their generations.

Appearance

Hashirama as a child.

1/2

Hashirama was a tall man with tanned skin and dark eyes. He had waist-length black hair typically styled in a centre-parted fringe that framed his face. He often wore the standard shinobi dress of his era, consisting of dark red armour worn over a simple black suit with sandals. This armour was constructed from numerous metal plates, formed into multiple protective guards along his body; each collar of his shoulder guards bore the Senju symbol. Prior to Konoha's formation he wore a white-coloured cloth bearing his clan's symbol on his forehead,
 which he later replaced with the village's
forehead protector
.






Hashirama in Hokage garb.



Upon becoming Hokage, Hashirama tended to wear the traditional Kage attire consisting of the customary maroon and white hat and haori over a full-length maroon and white gown, along with a simple red headband.
 Otherwise, he wore a light-brown, short-sleeved, kimono shirt with mesh armour underneath, held closed by a red sash, and navy blue pants. In his Hokage portrait, he is seen wearing a kerchief.

As a child, Hashirama's hair was more bowl-cut in style, hanging around his face. His usual attire consisted of a dark kimono shirt, a short light green jacket with darker green linings, a white scarf around his neck, traditional pinstriped kimono pants of his clan, and a dark green sash around his waist.

Abilities






Hashirama clashing with his life-long rival, Madara.



Hashirama was famed as the strongest shinobi of his era and one of the strongest in history, reputed as a
God of Shinobi
.
 Madara, another legendary shinobi, openly admitted inferiority to Hashirama throughout their entire lifetime together, even with both the
Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan
 and the
Nine-Tails
 at his disposal.
 Through his
unique powers
, Hashirama had been able to subdue and capture eight of the nine free-roaming
tailed beasts
 on his own.
 During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kabuto proclaimed that the man's might as a ninja was so vast that it was held in a fantasy light similar to the
Sage of Six Paths
, stating that no one, aside from Madara, had come close to matching him ever since his passing.

Chakra and Physical Prowess

As a Senju, Hashirama possessed a powerful life-force and physical energy. This made his
chakra
 remarkably strong, shown by his ability to release powerful shockwaves that damage his surroundings simply by flaring up his chakra.
 During the Fourth Shinobi World War, after seeing
Naruto Uzumaki
 distribute his and the Nine-Tails' chakra to the entire
Allied Shinobi Forces
, Hashirama claimed that the distributed chakra amount almost rivalled his own reserves.
 His chakra control is advanced enough to perform various complex and large-scale jutsu with only a single
hand seals
 at all.
 Hashirama was also able to produce ten wood clones while maintaining a
Kage-level barrier
.

Hashirama's life-force also grants him enough stamina to fight nonstop for a 24 hour period while still left prime to battle,
 and a will able to resist the control of the perfected
Impure World Reincarnation
 with ease, even after his cells were used to strengthen the technique's binding.
 His body was brimming with vitality, granting him considerable
regenerative powers
 that could mend most injuries with no residual effects, an ability that only
Tsunade
's
technique
 or Naruto's own healing when he accesses
Kurama
's chakra have both came close to emulating.
 Various individuals onto whom grafts of Hashirama's cells were safely transplanted no longer required food and water to survive.

Ninjutsu

As a Senju, Hashirama is trained in a variety of shinobi skills. He could summon
multiple Rashōmon gates
 to protect himself from nearly any attack.
 He could use
barrier ninjutsu
 advanced enough to subdue the
Ten-Tails
.
 He had unprecedented skill in
medical ninjutsu
, able to heal wounds without forming hand seals. His skill in
fūinjutsu
 could store several different types of weapons for battle, with which he showed versatile skill in
bukijutsu
, able to fight on par with Madara. Likewise, Hashirama's fūinjutsu could reinforce sealing techniques that were not his own creation with his own techniques.
 In the anime, he could also
break
 Madara's control over the Nine-Tails.

Nature Transformation






Hashirama using Wood Release.



Hashirama was proficient in all five basic
nature transformations
, along with
Yin
 and
Yang Release
.
 He was most famous for his use of
Wood Release
, a combination of
earth
 and
water
-natured chakra, creating wood and plants from the ground or his very being of various sizes and shapes that he manipulated to his purposes. This ability was apparently exclusive to him as no one else has naturally acquired this power; any replications are noticeably pale in comparison to Hashirama's capabilities.






Hashirama's True Several Thousand Hands.



Hashirama could completely change the
landscape
 with his constructs. He also had more ingenious usages such as making
wood clones
 that are nearly indistinguishable from himself. He could make
flowering trees
 whose pollen rendered opponents unconscious,
protective structures
 able to withstand
Tailed Beast Balls
,

giant hands
 to apprehend large targets,
 as well as a
giant humanoid creature
 able to clash with Madara's Complete Body —
Susanoo
.
 In the anime, his precision and dexterity with his Wood Release could wield and launch his various weapons from afar, allowing him to attack from multiple angles.

Hashirama's Wood Release also granted him a method of
subduing
 and controlling the tailed beasts. By making direct hand contact or channelling it through his Wood Release, Hashirama could use the
Hokage-Style Sixty-Year-Old Technique — Kakuan Entering Society with Bliss-Bringing Hands
 to put the beast to sleep.
 He acquired several tailed beasts in this way and was able to maintain control over all of them at the same time. Likewise, he could create
wood dragons
 to wrap around any targets and
absorb
 their chakra. It was by this power that he earned fame as one of few people who could completely control a tailed beast.

Senjutsu






Hashirama in Sage Mode.



Because of his large chakra reserves, Hashirama could use
senjutsu
 and enter
Sage Mode
 — a feat he could perform instantaneously.
 In this mode, he gains red (black in the anime, and dark green in the video games) markings around and under his eyes as well in the middle of his forehead. While it is not known where he learned it, Hashirama proved formidable in its usage, riding about on his wood techniques as a means to be mobile in battle while maintaining the stillness of one's self needed to continue building up natural energy to keep this mode activated. Hashirama could perform powerful
seals
 to bind targets, even those as large as the Ten-Tails.
 The power of Sage Mode would also greatly augment his Wood Release, causing his constructs to become considerably larger and more dangerous, as seen with his largest creation, the
Sage Art Wood Release: True Several Thousand Hands
: by using it to deliver an
enormous barrage of punches
, it could strip Susanoo from the Nine-Tails plus was chiefly responsible for the formation of the
Valley of the End
.

Other Skills

Hashirama was skilled enough in
taijutsu
 to match experts like Madara and
Hiruzen
,
 and could cast
genjutsu
 to lock a target in
perpetual darkness
 for the technique's duration.
 Hashirama was shown to be fast enough to outrun the Nine-Tails during his battle with Madara, allowing him to lead the battle to the shoreline.

Orochimaru summons Hashirama and Tobirama.



Orochimaru

invades Konoha
 so that he can kill his master,
Hiruzen Sarutobi
, who is now the Third Hokage. Because Orochimaru wants Hiruzen to experience the same thrills of fighting a teacher as he is, he reincarnates Hashirama and
Tobirama
. Recognising Hiruzen and seeing how old he has gotten, Hashirama realises how long he's been dead. Tobirama, meanwhile, realises that they've been brought back with the
Impure World Reincarnation
, and therefore will have no choice but to fight Hiruzen. Orochimaru suppresses their personalities and forces them to attack.






Hiruzen's clone removing Hashirama's soul.



Hiruzen struggles to land an attack against Hashirama and Tobirama, their coordination and responsiveness offering him few openings. The few attacks he does land are merely regenerated by their reincarnated bodies. Because killing Orochimaru will not end the Impure World Reincarnation, Hiruzen uses the only option he has left: after creating two
shadow clones
, he has a clone capture each of the deceased Hokage and use the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
 on them. With their personalities restored, Hashirama and Tobirama apologise for being such troubles to him, just as Hiruzen apologises for the fate he has sentenced them to. He pulls the souls from their reincarnated bodies, feeding them to the
Shinigami
.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

Main article:
Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax






The four Hokage are reincarnated.



At the request of
Sasuke Uchiha
,
Orochimaru

releases
 the souls of the first four Hokage from the stomach of the Shinigami so that he can reincarnate them. After taking in their surroundings, Hashirama and Tobirama are excited to meet
Minato
, the Fourth, and take him as a sign of Konoha's continued prosperity. Hashirama asks who the Fifth is, and is informed that it is his granddaughter,
Tsunade
; Hashirama, accordingly, worries about the village's current fate. Sasuke asks the former Hokage about the history of the village, specifically with regards to the
Uchiha clan
. From Tobirama's comments, Hashirama realises that Tobirama did not follow his instructions to be understanding of the Uchiha, which greatly angered him. When Tobirama prepares to attack Sasuke in order to protect the village from one of the last Uchiha, Hashirama uses force to stay his hand.






Hashirama stops Tobirama from attacking.



The Hokage are told about recent events, namely the outbreak of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 and the reincarnation of
Madara Uchiha
. Tobirama wishes to go and help Konoha's forces in the war effort and asks for Hashirama's help. Although Orochimaru has perfected his control of the Impure World Reincarnation, Hashirama is still strong enough to break free if he chooses. Instead of doing that, however, he decides to tell Sasuke about his work to create Konoha and the dealings with the Uchiha, as that is why he has been reincarnated in the first place.






The Hokage arrive on the battlefield.



Hearing Hashirama's history and reflecting on his own experiences, Sasuke decides he doesn't want Konoha to be destroyed, as is Madara's current intention. Orochimaru releases the Hokage from his control so that they can help in this goal, and they set out for the site of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
' battle with the
Ten-Tails
. Although worried by Madara's current plans, Hashirama is at the same time curious how Madara managed to survive their last encounter and looks forward to seeing him. When they arrive on the battlefield, Madara, sensing Hashirama, excitedly asks for a chance to fight him, but Hashirama replies that he'll need to wait. Entering
Sage Mode
, Hashirama uses
Sage Art: Gate of the Great God
 to bind the Ten-Tails, then assists the other Hokage in erecting a
barrier
 to confine it.






Hashirama leads the Alliance.



Because he must stay with the barrier, Hashirama creates five
wood clones
 to act on his behalf. Four lead an Allied attack against the
Ten-Tails' minions
 while the fifth engages Madara; Madara is uninterested and offers to continue waiting until the real Hashirama is available. When
Obito Uchiha
 appears on the battlefield, Hashirama realises that Madara is forcing him to use the
Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 to revive him. He creates six additional wood clones to go after Madara and stop him. Obito is able to resist Madara's control and instead seals the Ten-Tails into himself, becoming its
jinchūriki
.

Hashirama battling Madara.



With his new power, Obito rips down the barrier, easily shrugs off another Gate of the Great God, and tears through one of the wood clones before it has a chance to respond. The clone is able to retain its form for long enough to create branches that restrain Obito, allowing one of Tobirama's
shadow clones
 to use
Mutually Multiplying Explosive Tags
. When this fails to have an effect, Hashirama decides to get personally involved. Madara, however, is done waiting, and forces Hashirama to fight him. Hashirama tries to convince him to postpone, but Madara won't hear of it. While he engages Madara, his remaining wood clones provide what support to the Allies they can and keep Hashirama apprised of how the battle against Obito is going.






Hashirama communicates through Ino's technique.



After Obito creates the Ten-Tails' giant tree form, Madara explains to Hashirama the tree's function in the eventual implementation of the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
. Needing to communicate this to the rest of the Alliance, Hashirama has
Ino Yamanaka
 telepathically link one of his wood clones to the rest of the Alliance, which now includes Tsunade and the other current
Kage
. After saying hello to his granddaughter, the clone relays his message and implores them not to give. When feelings of futility begin to grow amongst the Alliance's ranks, Hashirama shares his memories of the first
Kage Summit
 with them, helping to rally them all and, ultimately, defeat Obito.






Madara captures Hashirama.



The original Hashirama, meanwhile, manages to pin Madara with multiple Gate of the Great Gods and surrounds him with
wood dragons
 to prevent him from escaping.
Naruto Uzumaki
 arrives to help seal Madara, thus ending the war, but Madara implements a final trump card before they can do so: successfully forcing Obito to restore him to life with the Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique. The full return of his original power allows Madara to break free of his restraints and, in the confusion, quickly immobilise Hashirama with
chakra receivers
. Madara is able to fight off several other immediate attackers, but his revival has left him without his eyes, diminishing his senses. He approaches Hashirama and absorbs his
senjutsu
 chakra so that he can find targets based on their chakra signatures. Before he leaves, Madara notes that the plan for peace he mentioned to Hashirama so long ago is about to be achieved.

As Sasuke is about to go after Madara, Hashirama, still unable to move, offers to give him a jutsu that can be used to cancel out the senjutsu chakra Madara has taken. Sasuke asks why Hashirama would trust him, an Uchiha, to which Hashirama replies that he resembles Madara's brother,
Izuna
, and that maybe that likeness will remind Madara of the kind person he used to be before Izuna died. In the end, Sasuke fails and the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 is cast, with the whole world – the reincarnated Hokage excluded – getting wrapped into
God: Nativity of a World of Trees
.

Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes

Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes






Hashirama speaks to Madara for the last time.



Sometime later, the chakra receivers disappear, restoring Hashirama's mobility. He reunites with the other Hokage and they try to figure out what they can do to break the Infinite Tsukuyomi. They are met by the spirit of the
Sage of the Six Paths
, who recruits their help. Combining efforts with the spirits of the other dead Kage, they summon
Team 7
, Madara, and the
tailed beasts
 back from
Kaguya's dimension
. Hashirama approaches Madara, who is too weak to get up and is in fact dying from his ordeal. Madara uses his remaining moments of life to admit that Hashirama's method of peace was right all along, though Hashimara himself refutes that belief in stating that they were too hasty in trying to fulfill their own respective dreams while forgetting to earnestly cultivate and entrust their said dreams to the next generations. Hashirama forgives Madara and says that they are still friends despite everything, which Madara uses his last breath to say that it all wasn't so bad. Hashirama and the other Kage are returned to the
Pure Land
 by the Sage of Six Paths. As his soul ascends, Hashirama wishes Sasuke and Naruto luck, hoping they have a better experience together than he and Madara did.

Legacy






The living clone cultivated from Hashirama's cells.



The fact that only Hashirama possessed the ability to use
Wood Release
 – and related abilities of controlling
tailed beasts
 and
self-healing
 – made his
DNA
 highly coveted after his death:

In the anime,
Konoha
 sanctioned several attempts to research and reproduce Hashirama's power, but all met with disastrous failure and further study was forbidden.

Orochimaru
 exhumed Hashirama's body for his own experiments, where he infused sixty child test subjects with cells harvested from the remains in the hopes that one would prove able to use Wood Release. Only
Yamato
 survived the process.

Danzō Shimura
 had a work relationship with Orochimaru and had his right arm infused with Hashirama's cells. In addition to granting him increased chakra levels and limited Wood Release abilities, it extended the amount of time he could keep
Izanagi
 active with his different
Sharingan
 and increase how often he could use
Kotoamatsukami
.

Kabuto Yakushi
 continued Orochimaru's studies, eventually learning how to create an implant that would grant whoever received it access to Hashirama's power. The only recipient of this implant was Madara, enhancing him "beyond his prime".

Madara Uchiha
 took his own sample of Hashirama's DNA during their fight at the Valley of the End, which he applied to his injuries afterwards to accelerate his recovery and likewise extended his longevity. Decades later, towards the end of his natural lifespan, the combination of his Uchiha essence with Hashirama's DNA allowed his Sharingan evolve into a
Rinnegan
,
 though unknowingly to Madara, that was actually due to Indra's and Ashura's chakra combining, Madara and Hashirama being their respective reincarnations.

Using this DNA sample, Madara created a
mindless clone of Hashirama
, with which he was able to produce a substance that could enhance recipients and even replace lost anatomy, as it saved
Obito Uchiha
 from maiming damage of his body's destroyed right half and likewise repair it. This substance granted Madara and Obito Uchiha greatly enhanced chakra reserves and physical prowess, advanced healing, being unimpaired without food or water, and the Wood Release.
 This same substance would be used to enhance the
White Zetsu Army
.
 Later,
Tsunade
 used this substance to replace Naruto and Sasuke's respective lost arms (the latter however declining the offer).

In the anime,
Root
 saw this as a means to create an ultimate weapon, researching for years to create
Gozu Tennō
.

In the anime, Hashirama's DNA became so highly coveted as rumors spread that his powerful life-force and healing powers could also restore one's youth, which
Mugino
 claimed was false. Some samples were stolen and sold on the black market in the
Land of Silence
.

One particular sample was stolen from Orochimaru's laboratory, eventually making its way to
Victor
, who used it to induce a splinter of the
God Tree
 to blossom into an artificial tree.

A large part of Hashirama's legacy was his philosophy of the
Will of Fire
, which became increasingly common amongst Konoha's ninja in the years after his death. Future
Hokage
, in particular, were expected to fully adopt the philosophy. In time, even members of the
Uchiha clan
 began demonstrating signs of the Will of Fire, with Hashirama claiming
Itachi Uchiha
's dedication to the village was even greater than his own.

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Hashirama Senju

"Hashirama" (
柱間
) is a Japanese word referring to the space between two pillars. This might be a play on the word "pillar" (
柱
,
hashira
), as the Hokage is said to be the pillar that supports the village. His family name "Senju" literally means "thousand hands" (
千手
).

His face on the
Hokage Rock
 has a crack across the bridge of the nose.
 This crack is not present in flashback depictions of the Rock.

Hashirama's face appears within the fireworks in the
omake
 of
Shippūden
 episode 129
.

Studio Pierrot's Settei sheets show that Hashirama was 147cm when he met Madara.

According to the databook(s):

His hobbies were
bonsai
 and
wood sculpting
.

His desired opponent was Madara Uchiha.

His favourite food was mushroom
zōsui
, Japanese mushroom rice porridge made usually from leftovers.

His favourite phrases were "The vast lands fertile" (
大地豊饒
,
Daichi hōjō
) and "Heaven's garments are without seams" (
天衣無縫
,
Ten'i muhō
). They refer to perfect beauty without any artificial elements.

Despite having cast
genjutsu
 in the series, Yin Release is not listed as one of Hashirama's natures in the fourth databook.

It seems Hashirama's blood type (type B) has no issue in compatibility when his DNA is transplanted to others of a different blood type, as both Madara and Obito have type O.

Quotes

(To
Madara
) "
No matter what happens I will protect our… no my village. I still believe that protecting the village is the best way to protect people, shinobi, and children…! Anyone who tries to harm it, whether they are my friends, siblings or my own children… I won't forgive them.
"

(To the five
Kage
) "
But one day… In the future… I dream of a time when all shinobi will cooperate with each other… A time when everyone's hearts will be together regardless of their countries. That's my… dream of the future.
"

(To
Hiruzen
) "
The fellow countrymen of the Konoha make up each part of my body… those of the village believe in me, and I believe in them… That's what it means to be Hokage!
"

"
Whenever you live, there will always be war.
"

(To
Sasuke
) "
Shinobi are people who endure to achieve their goals… but depending on what they choose as their goal they change… like Madara and I…
"
