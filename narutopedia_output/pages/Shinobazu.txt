The
Shinobazu
 (
不忍
,
English TV:
 Ninja Dropouts) were a group of
missing-nin
 who left their ninja villages and serve themselves. The Shinobazu operated in the
Land of Forests
, with their hideout located in the
Forest of Bewilderment
. They attacked various families and households, killing everyone to prevent survivors from seeking revenge. This was prevented by
Gantetsu
's actions of rescuing the orphans and hiding them, taking care of them with his cut of the funds. Shura then became the acting leader of the group.

When Gantetsu had been caught,
Naruto Uzumaki
,
Sakura Haruno
, and
Rock Lee
 were assigned to guard the prison transport he was in. A guard named
Todoroki
 wanted revenge on Gantetsu for abducting his brother
Akio
 while the other members had killed his family. The Shinobazu attacked the prison transport in order to get back the money Gantetsu took with him. With help from Gantetsu and Todoroki, the other Shinobazu members were killed or incapacitated by Naruto and Rock Lee.
