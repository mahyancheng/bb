Synopsis

As both duos travel:
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Killer B
,
A
 and
Tsunade
, the
Kumo
-nin question their
Konoha
 counterparts about the faith that Tsunade had shown in Naruto. Recalling that she had believed in him long before
Pain's assault
 on Konoha because of a bet he had made to her. Remembering a time before she had met Naruto, Tsunade hurried to the next gambling den while
Shizune
 hurried behind her, upon seeing shinobi fly overhead, Tsunade tells Shizune to let it alone. Upon arrival at the den, where
Zaji
 and his cohorts could barely contain their excitement that the
Legendary Sucker
 had arrived with a lot of cash. Elsewhere, the
Raikage
 retrieves one of his wounded subordinates.
Amai
, while in the town spots Tsunade and reports back to the Raikage who despite
Karai
's protesting, decides to have the legendary
medical-nin
 heal him. Approaching the
Sannin
 Tsunade flatly refuses because of the
bad blood
 between the two villages, indignant that that they would even dare to approach her in the first place. This encounter ultimately leads up to Tsunade telling the Raikage that if he could defeat her in
arm wrestling
, she would go with him. As the titanic competition gets under-way, A, realising that he would not win in a match of strength uses speed to win the match. After seeing the state of the patient, she asks that they tell her what had happened so that her treatment was not compromised.
