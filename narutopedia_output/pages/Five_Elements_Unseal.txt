This technique removes
seals
 that are of similar power to itself. The user gathers
chakra
 to their fingertips and hits the fingers against the seal that is to be removed, causing it to unravel and disappear. If the seal was applied to a person, the thrust of the hand that accompanies this technique will likely be painful. When
Jiraiya
 uses this technique to remove a
Five Elements Seal
, it appears to be quite easy for him. In truth, this is a very advanced technique that even
jōnin
 would find difficult to perform.

In the anime,
Kazuma
 uses the Five Elements Unseal on
Sora
, thus increasing his access to the
Nine-Tails
' chakra sealed in his body.
 In another episode,
Orochimaru
 uses the Five Elements Unseal to break the
Iron Armour Seal
.

Trivia

In the anime, Orochimaru stated that only his fellow
Sannin
 and
Hiruzen Sarutobi
 could perform this technique.

When Jiraiya performs this technique, the "Five Elements" referred to in the name are the Chinese Five Elements, the
