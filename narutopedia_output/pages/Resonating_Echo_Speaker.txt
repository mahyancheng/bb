This is a porous metal gauntlet that is located on Dosu's right arm. It is used to amplify or absorb sound waves caused by his arm's movements. The sound waves caused by the melody arm can then be
manipulated
 and directed with chakra, causing more damage. They can also bring on blurred vision and dizziness, as well as paralysing the target of jutsu that are dealt by this weapon. It can also act as a defence by blocking kunai and shuriken, which in turn results in more vibrations that can be used for Dosu's technique. He could also use it to shatter a log that was part of a trap that Sakura laid.
