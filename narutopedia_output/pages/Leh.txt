Kakashi Retsuden: The Sixth Hokage and the Failure Boy

When Redaku starts making plans to invade the Land of Fire, Nanara decides he wants to meet with the Sixth Hokage to try and avoid an invasion.
Kakashi Hatake
 recommends using Leh to send a letter instead, reasoning it would much simpler and faster. Nanara does not believe Leh would be able to make such a long journey until Kakashi shows him the previous King's correspondence with the Sixth, proving he can indeed fly that far. Once a letter is written and given to Leh, Nanara instructs him to deliver it to the Sixth Hokage. Leh keeps trying to give the letter to Kakashi, confusing Nanara, who does not know that Kakashi is actually the Sixth. Kakashi recommends sending the letter to simply "the
Hokage
".

Leh returns a few days later with a letter from the
Seventh Hokage
, agreeing to terms that will prevent the invasion. This leads to a civil war in Redaku, during which Nanara is taken hostage. Leh attacks Nanara's captor, freeing him. Leh then guides Nanara to the
Prime Minister
's location, ultimately allowing Nanara and Kakashi to stop the war. A few months later, after Nanara has become King, Leh delivers a package from the Seventh Hokage. It contains a copy of
Icha Icha Paradise
, a book Kakashi had promised to give him.
