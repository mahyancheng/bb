Yomotsu Hirasaka
 is a
kekkei mōra
 technique used by members of the
Ōtsutsuki clan
, which is said to be the progenitor of all
space–time ninjutsu
.


Overview

The user is able to open rifts in the fabric of space that allow them to instantaneously transport themselves to another location. The openings can be used to connect two different spatial locations within the same dimension, or to create a pathway that links two dimensions together.
 By entering these spacial tears, the user is able to retreat, disorient enemies, or execute ambush attacks at a moment's notice.
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 used this technique to travel between her
six dimensions
.

These portals can be used to transport only sections of the user's body by partially entering them, allowing the user to grab their opponents and drag them into the portal, sending them to another location. Kaguya can also open rifts to transport her attacks through the portals, relocating projectiles and ultimately taking the enemy down by surprise.
 The portals are manifested at such speeds that even a shinobi as fast as
Sasuke Uchiha
 was caught off guard.
 However, evading the portals is still possible.

Trivia

Yomotsu Hirasaka
 is the name of the slope that leads to the
underworld
 in Japanese mythology.

In the anime, this was the first jutsu used on
Earth
.

Obito Uchiha
 was able to synchronise his
Kamui
 with Kaguya's Yomotsu Hirasaka to gain access to her six dimensions.

Black Zetsu
 was able to use this technique while residing inside the sleeve of Kaguya's severed arm.

At times,
Urashiki Ōtsutsuki
 activates his
Rinnegan
 before using this technique, though he can also use it without doing so.
