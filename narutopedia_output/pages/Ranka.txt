,
Viz:

chūnin
 from
Konohagakure
. He is a former member of the
Konohagakure Intelligence Division
's
Analysis Team
 where he was in charge of autopsies.

Personality

Ranka cares about his teammates and doesn't want them doing anything too dangerous. Ranka fell in love with
Anko Mitarashi
 and out of burgeoning feelings to be on the same team as her, got reassigned to the Infiltration and Reconnaissance Party.

Appearance

Ranka is depicted as having brown hair that is covered by his Konoha bandanna style
forehead protector
. He has a small pointed goatee and wears the standard outfit of the Konohagakure shinobi. He also has small, squinted eyes that rarely seem to be open.

Abilities

As the former personnel in charge of autopsies within the Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force,
 it stands to reason that Ranka was a highly analytical person with some medical knowledge.

Takigakure
 shinobi as Ranka checks the bodies, he confirms that it was in fact Kabuto that killed the shinobi. After hearing Tokuma's findings from scouting the area ahead of them, Ranka wonders if the masked man was

While following Kabuto's trail, they are led to the
Akatsuki headquarters
 where the team uncovered Tobi's
massive army
. Still shocked, Anko told him and the others to report the findings while she would investigate further. Though they initially refused to leave her behind, they soon departed. Ranka and the others are soon pursued by
Chūkichi
 and
Deidara
, but
Tokuma
 is able to warn the team and tells them to go on ahead while he attempted to hold them off.

Despite their best efforts, both Ranka and Tokuma barely survive their encounter with the reincarnated Akatsuki shinobi.
Sasori

control
 of his and Tokuma's body and used them as a puppets to fight the
