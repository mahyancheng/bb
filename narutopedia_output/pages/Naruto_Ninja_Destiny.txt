Trivia

In the US and European version, Sasuke's outfit is his black outfit from the
Chūnin Exams
 Finals, but in the Japanese version, he's in his casual blue shirt and white shorts.

Gaara and Temari also have their outfits from the Sasuke Retrieval Mission in the Japanese version, but in the US and European versions, they have their outfits from the
Chūnin Exams
.

Sasuke, Gaara and Temari would later have their outfits from the Japanese version in all versions of the sequel.

The location "Sasuke's training grounds" is misspelled "Sauke's training grounds".

Even though the game takes place during the
Chūnin Exams
, Shikamaru has his
flak jacket
 in all versions despite him not getting it until he became a
Chūnin
.

Naruto is the only character in the game with more than one jutsu.

In 2006, before the US version of the game came out, low-budget video game company Tommo, Inc. had exclusive distribution rights to sell this game (along with the Japanese versions of
Ninja Council 2 European Version
,
Ninja Council 3
,
Ultimate Ninja Heroes
,
Jump Super Stars
 and
Jump Ultimate Stars
) in North America through retailers such as Best Buy, GameStop and Fry's Electronics. Many small business also received minimal stock of these games. Tommo, Inc. took it upon themselves to sell the games to major retailers with a sticker stating that Japanese is the native language. It is possible that Tommo did this through gray marketing.
