Summary

The
Sunagakure

ninja
 celebrate
Gaara
's revival.
Temari
 and
Kankurō
 thank
Naruto
 for saving their brother, but he tells them they should thank
Chiyo
 instead; when she "wakes up". They then correct him explaining that Chiyo gave her life to
resurrect
 Gaara. Naruto reflects on her final words and realises that Chiyo, like the
Third Hokage
, sacrificed herself to protect the next generation. Everyone present has a moment of silence for her. Elsewhere,
Deidara
, having escaped
Kakashi
 and the others, goes looking for his severed arm with his
Akatsuki
 ring.
Zetsu
 and
Tobi
 also search for
Sasori
's ring, which the latter takes so that he can join the Akatsuki. Tobi then starts to play with the ring, before it accidentally slips through his hand.
