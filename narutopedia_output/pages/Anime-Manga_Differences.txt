This page lists the differences that occurred during the transition from manga to anime.

Censorship

These are changes made in the anime for the young audience where originally in the source material, the content is unsuitable. Note that many of these censored scenes are generally still included in the uncut DVD releases (with some exceptions) and that most are aimed at the original broadcast release.

Part I

In the manga, when
Mizuki
 throws multiple
kunai
 at
Iruka
, Iruka pulls a kunai out of his chest.
 In the anime, none of the kunai hit his chest and he pulls a kunai out of his right leg instead.

In the manga,
Ebisu
 fixes his glasses with his middle finger.
 In the anime, he also uses his index finger.

In the manga, during the bell test at the
Third Training Ground
,
Sasuke
 unleashes a barrage of shuriken and kunai that directly impale Kakashi in the face which causes blood to spray out from a front angle.
 In the anime, he is pushed aside quickly and only the scene of him viewed from behind is left.

During the bell test, Kakashi casts a genjutsu spell on Sakura, showing her a gravely injured Sasuke. In the manga, "Sasuke" has a missing left arm, a twisted left leg and numerous kunai impaling his body. In the anime, he has his arm and leg intact and has only a few kunai impaling his body.
 As a result of the genjutsu, Sakura is rendered unconscious on the ground. The manga played up the more intense and comical spaz attack by showing an unconscious Sakura with wide blank eyes and seizure-like foam at the mouth.

In the manga, after the
Demon Brothers
 capture and seemingly kill
Kakashi
, a silhouette of different body parts being shred apart is shown.
 In the anime, much of the blood and gore is removed.

In the manga, when Kakashi is describing the role of
hunter-nin
 a severed hand that is impaled with a knife is shown.
 In the anime, this is removed.

In the manga, in the flashback scene where
Kaiza
 is crucified and then executed, his arms have also been chopped off.
 In the anime, they are instead only badly broken and burned.

In the manga, when Kakashi unintentionally killed
Haku
 with his Lightning Cutter, his hand pierced his body, with his hand visibly coming out of Haku's back.
 However, in the anime, Kakashi's hand only pierced the front of Haku's chest.

In the manga, when
Gatō
 arrives and sees Haku's corpse, he is seen kicking him across the face as payback for when Haku nearly broke his arm.
 However in the anime, the kick to his face is not seen, and only Naruto's look of shock is seen instead.

In the manga,
Zabuza
 stabs Gatō in the chest and then decapitates Gatō to kill him,
 while in the anime, Zabuza stabs Gatō in the chest and then instead slashes him multiple times across the chest, which results in Gatō falling off the bridge to his death.

In the manga, when
Anko Mitarashi
 threw a kunai at Naruto and cut his cheek, she licks the blood directly from Naruto's cheek.
 In the anime, she only touches the blood from his cheek with her fingers.

In the manga, during the second phase of the Chūnin Exams,
Team 8
 gets their second scroll by luring a fellow Konoha team into a trap filled with Poisonous Leeches.
 In the anime, it was changed to a team from
Amegakure
.

In the manga, when Anko views the tape showing the arrival of the
Three Sand Siblings
 at the tower, there is blood splatter and two sets of feet on the ground, heavily implying that
Gaara
 killed another team of Genin to sate his bloodlust due to
Kankurō
 and
Temari
 convincing him to spare Team 8.
 The anime removed this.

In the manga, when Gaara is about to kill
Baiu
 and
Midare
, Temari says goodbye to them and also waves goodbye with a big smile on her face.
 The anime removed this.

In the manga, during the preliminary rounds of the Chūnin Exams,
Zaku Abumi
's right arm is blown off when
Shino Aburame
 uses his bugs to block Zaku's air tubes.
 In the anime, both of Zaku's arms remain attached to his body, only the skin on his arms break.

In the manga, when Gaara attacks and kills
Dosu
 using the power of
Shukaku
, the attack bifurcated Dosu, which is seen when the dust cloud Gaara created had cleared up.
 In the anime only Dosu's injured arm was shown after the fatal attack and unlike the manga Gaara is also seen using this attack directly.

In the manga, when the corpse of
Hayate Gekkō
 is shown, there is a great amount of blood and even carrion birds picking at his corpse.
 However, in the anime, much of the blood and the carrion birds are removed.

The design of the
Hyūga Main Family's Juinjutsu
 is different in the manga and anime. In the manga, it was a variation of a manji,
 a Buddhist symbol, but due to its similarity in appearance to the
swastika
, it was altered into an X in the anime to avoid confusion.

In the manga, when Gaara brutally murdered
Shiba
 and
Midori
 (which was not shown in detail), the hallway was completely splattered with their blood and body parts, to which Gaara even stepped on.
 The anime significantly reduced this by showing their murders in detail, but instead they were completely crushed within Gaara's sand, blood and bodies buried within it. Midori's attempt to escape before being dragged back in was exclusive to the anime as well.

In the manga, when Kakashi defends Sakura against two
Oto
-nin, he impales them in the head with kunai.
 In the anime, he slashes them across the chest with kunai instead.

In the manga, after Asuma rescues Shikamaru from a group of Oto-nin, he slashes them and punches using his
trench knives
, leaving their bloody corpses to the floor, he then flicks his cigarette into a pool of their blood.
 In the anime, the brutal assault was censored with Asuma only punching them with the trench knives and never slashing them or smoking a cigarette.

In the manga, when
Hiruzen Sarutobi
 raids
Orochimaru
's lair, there are several corpses strung along the walls.
 In the anime, these corpses are replaced with shelves containing jars filled with remains and various organs.

In the manga, when Gaara presses
Sakura
 up against a tree, blood trickles out of her mouth.
 In the anime, this is removed.

In the manga, when a young Gaara attempted to cut himself in a flashback, he aimed for his wrist, at the vein.
 In the anime, he aimed at the back of his hand instead.

As Naruto walks through the festival city, he stops by a mask shop and purchases a mask. Various masks in the background represent past Japanese manga, anime and tv series "in-jokes" included by Kishimoto. These include masks of
Kamen Rider
 and Chiaotzu from the
Dragon Ball
 series. The anime changed many of these to generic masks.

In the manga, when Kabuto goes for blood to summon snakes, he retrieves it from the wound on his wrist.
 In the anime, he retrieves the blood from a wound on his palm instead.

A minor edit concerning the location of the small shinobi animals, Gamatatsu, Gamakichi and Tonton are all in the thick of the action when the giant snakes begin to attack.

Related to the previous entry, Tonton was among the injured fallen in the manga. In the anime, the three shinobi animals moved away to safety early on.

In the manga, when Naruto prevents
Kabuto Yakushi
 from attacking
Tsunade
, Kabuto's kunai directly impales Naruto's hand.
 In the anime, it gets caught between Naruto's fingers instead.

In the manga, especially in
Part I
, Naruto and Kiba
"flip the bird"
 several times,
 in the English adaptation of the manga and in the anime they only close their fist and look angry.

Kidōmaru
 did his best to take down Neji, this was especially apparent in the original manga, where his first arrow ripped a massive hole through Neji's shoulder. The anime greatly reduced the size of the hole. While this may serve as a content edit, it also made it more feasible for Neji to live through such an attack.

In the manga, when
Shikamaru Nara
 gets caught in
Tayuya
's
genjutsu
, he sees his skin and flesh melt off of his bones.
 In the anime, he sees his entire arm melt away including the bones.

In the manga, after
Raidō Namiashi
 and
Genma Shiranui
 are defeated by the
Sound Four
, Raidō has three
shuriken
 in his back and Genma has two
kunai
 in his chest with his left palm facing up.
 In the anime, Raidō has two shuriken and a single kunai in his back and Genma has a single kunai in his chest with his left palm facing down.

In the manga, while
Kimimaro
 is fighting
Gaara
, Kimimaro's
bones came out of his fingertips
 by dividing his skin on his fingertips.
 In the anime, his bones just emerged from his fingertips through holes that close afterwards.

Kimimaro's encasement within Gaara's sand and his subsequent crushing are accompanied by a significant amount of more blood in the manga.

When Sasuke pierces through Naruto's shoulder with Chidori, we see his arm and hand with no obstruction. In the anime, they lessened the violent nature of the strike by whiting out the arm and hand with Chidori's electrical light.

Part II

When Team Kakashi decided to rest at a hot springs inn, the women bathing had towels and other objects added to block their nudity.

When Sai switches allegiances, he had subdued Kabuto in an alternate fashion in the anime. This was probably changed because Kabuto's hands were left free in the manga, making escape seem possible.

In the manga,
Konohamaru Sarutobi
 has a
sexy technique
 that depicts Sasuke and
Sai
 in a sexual position.
 In the English version of the manga only a silhouette of the two is visible, and in the anime this is taken out entirely.

In the manga, Shikamaru is briefly seen smoking after
Asuma
's death.
 However, in the English adaptation of the manga and in the anime, he doesn't smoke; he only carries Asuma's lighter around with him; although at a certain moment, after he's done visiting Asuma's grave, he leaves a lit cigarette.

In the manga when
Guren
 is making his escape from the northern hideout, he brutally kills a number of guards and there is a significant amount of blood.
 In the anime the blood is removed completely.

In the manga, when
Nagato
 gets exhausted from overusing the
Chibaku Tensei
 he coughed up a lot of blood.
 In the anime, however, this was changed to a trickle of saliva.

In the manga, when "
Kisame
" was decapitated, the head landed in front of Sabu.
 In the anime, this was omitted.

In the manga, after
Danzō
 had badmouthed Itachi in the clutches of Sasuke's
Susanoo
, the latter crushed him.
 The amount of blood was heavily reduced in the anime, and the blood spattering on Sasuke's face was removed.

Interestingly, when
Furui
 was impaled by the
Eight-Tails
, it was more censored than when it occurred in the anime as he was seen as a silhouette in the manga.

When Kisame slaughtered the
Cypher Division
 in the anime, the action is censored.

When
Armadiko
's gender is revealed due to the
Island Turtle
 being flipped upside down, its genitals are clearly shown in the manga.
 In the anime, the genitals are removed entirely.

In the manga, when
Kankurō
 uses his
Black Secret Technique — Machine Triple Shot
, blood is seen draining from the
Kuroari
 with
Karasu
 in it.
 In the anime episode, the blood is omitted.

In the manga, when Gari blows up Tajiki, his blood spatters on his comrade.
 In the anime, the blood is removed.

Shippūden
 episode
272
 was censored somewhat:

The gash
Mifune
 sustained to his head was not shown despite him bleeding. In the manga, the gash was clearly visible.

When Mifune used
Iai Beheading
 to cut open
Ibuse
's head, indications of the head being cleaved open are visible.
 In the anime, however, smoke covered this entirely.

When the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 rushes towards
Chōji
 and
Chōza
, several shinobi are crushed by its feet or blown away from the shock wave.
 In the anime, this was omitted.

In
Shippūden
 episode
278
 when
Sakura Haruno
 pulverised the transformed
White Zetsu Army
 clone, no blood was seen coming from its mouth, whereas in the manga, there was blood.

In the manga, when the
Second Mizukage
's
clone
 attacks the shinobi of the
Fourth Division
, he critically slashes one with his axe-like weapon.
 In the anime, he simply uses taijutsu.

In the manga
omake

tie-in
, prior to Lee crashing in the girls public bath side, they were getting dressed.
 In the adapted anime
episode
, this was removed.

In the manga, when the Fourth Raikage attacks, Minato dropped the kunai in his right hand.
 In the anime, this was depicted as flicking the kunai.

In the manga, when Madara reveals the status of the Kage, A had a large puddle of blood coming from his mouth.
 In the anime, this was removed, as well as a reduction of blood from the other Kage.

In the manga, when Obito states his dislike for
Tobi the Zetsu clone
, the latter "flips the bird" at him.
 In the anime, Tobi, nicknamed Guruguru by Obito, gives Obito a thumbs down.

Despite Obito's graphic massacre and massive amount of blood in the manga,
 there was very little censoring of it in the anime. In the original Japanese TV broadcast, the climactic battle was censored, with several seconds of gore cut and some sound effects muted. The footage was restored in the DVD release. However, in the following episode, the blood covering Obito is coloured black until he returns to
Mountains' Graveyard
.

In the manga, when the
Ten-Tails
 took on its second form, a shinobi was seen coughing up blood after being injured by the impact of the transformation.
 This was only heard in the anime. In the same episode,
Neji
 being impaled by the Ten-Tails
wood branches
 in front of Naruto and Hinata was not shown in a close-up view.

In the manga, within his subconscious, Obito was being torn apart from the Ten-Tails' influence.
 The moment where his head was tearing apart was censored in the anime, only a glimpse of it is shown.

In the manga, Naruto's
shadow clone
 hit by
Kaguya
's
All-Killing Ash Bones
 screamed while crumbling to ashes.
 In the anime, the clone remained silent.

In the manga, when Naruto calls to Kurama joyfully, its irritation to Naruto's attitude is further shown by "flipping-off" Naruto. In the anime, Kurama merely exerts a clenched fist.

New Era

In the manga,
Log
 is briefly seen smoking when having a conversation with Orochimaru.
 However, in the anime, he instead flicks his lighter.

In the manga, Boruto surprises
Tentō Madoka
 with the Sexy Technique, wearing a bikini.
 In the anime, the transformation has a bikini top and a skirt.

In the manga,
Shojoji
 is smoking a cigar when he introduces himself to
Tentō
.
 In the anime, the cigar was removed.

In the manga,
Amado
 is first introduced as a frequent smoker.
 In the anime, his smoking habit is removed and replaced with another habit of drinking coffee as shown in his early anime introduction.

Two bathroom related moments were censored to an extent in the anime. Originally in the manga, Boruto and Kawaki are both seen urinating in the backyard of the Uzumaki household when the bathroom is occupied by Naruto. A shadow clone of Naruto intervenes when the two boys have a short fight, showing the original with his pants down in the bathroom.
 In the anime, Boruto and Kawaki had finished urinating off-screen and only the top half of Naruto is visible after sending his shadow clone.

In the manga,
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
 breaks Boruto's wrist when the latter implicated that he can't harm him.
 This action, as well as his broken wrist, is obscured in the anime.

Plot and Content Changes

These are changes that differ from the source material, usually made to accommodate for filler arcs or expanding material.

Part I

In the anime, Sasuke, Sakura and their classmates from Team 8 and 10 are introduced at the beginning of the story.
 In the manga Sasuke and Sakura first appeared in the third chapter,
 the other six were introduced at the beginning of the Chūnin Exam Arc.

In the manga, Naruto sneaks into the
Hokage Residence
 to steal the
Scroll of Seals
 and is caught by
Hiruzen Sarutobi
, but escapes by using
Sexy Technique
.
 In the anime, Hiruzen simply sends out the ninja after Naruto,
 and is exposed to the Sexy Technique when he refuses to accept Naruto's ninja registration photo.

In the manga,
Iruka
 discards
Mizuki
's shuriken after he pulls it out of his back,
 but in the anime he throws it back at Mizuki.

In the manga, after Team 7 is formed, Sasuke is seen eating outside of a window with Naruto inside preparing an attack.
 In the anime, Sasuke is seen eating inside the window instead and Naruto attacks from outside.

In the manga, before battling Zabuza for the first time, Naruto throws two shuriken into the bushes, one of them nearly hitting a snow white rabbit.
 In anime, this was two kunai instead.

In the manga,
Zabuza Momochi
 kills
Kumade Toriichi
 with a
tantō
.
 In the anime, he uses a
kunai
.

In the manga, when Kakashi tells Zabuza that his future is death, he only has his Sharingan eye open.
 In the anime, both of his eyes are open.

In the manga after
Kakashi
's first encounter with
Zabuza
,
Team 7
 attempts to look at his face while he is sleeping.
 In the anime, this event is simply skipped.

In the manga,
Chidori
 surrounds the user's hand in lightning.
 In the anime, it creates lightning in the palm of the user's hand.

In the manga, when
Anko Mitarashi
 fights Orochimaru, she used
daggers
.
 However, in the anime, she used
senbon
.

When Shikamaru, Ino and Chōji appear after Neji has spotted them, Shikamaru is to the left and Chōji to the right of Ino but after Neji starts to walk off, they change places.

In the manga, the flashback showing Team 8 being terrified of Team Baki happens after Anko receives a report of Team Baki breaking the record time of clearing the second exam.
 In the anime, the flashback takes place after Team 8 had reached the tower while Akamaru was still recovering from the terror of the incident.
 Kiba also recognises the danger Gaara poses after Team Baki left,
 while in the anime it occurs in an original scene when Team Baki walks by them in the tower.

In the manga, Tenten and Temari's fight was never shown, due to Sakura and Ino's conversation occurring during their fight. However in the anime, Tenten and Temari's match was shown due to Sakura and Ino's conversation occurring before Tenten and Temari's match.

In the manga,
Kin Tsuchi
 uses no other techniques besides utilising senbon with bells in her match with Shikamaru. In the anime, she uses her bells to activate
genjutsu
.

In the manga
Ebisu
 explains to Naruto about his lack of chakra control while still at
Konoha Hospital
 before Kakashi had left.
 In the anime, he explains it while the two are having lunch at
Ramen Ichiraku
 after Naruto fails a challenge proposed by Ebisu.

In the manga,
Jiraiya
 starts
Naruto
's training at the
Konoha Hot Springs
.
 In the anime, he tries to escape from training by attempting to elude him through a series of antics, eventually he trains him nearby a river.

In the anime, Jiraiya's conversation with Ebisu takes place before Dosu is killed by Gaara instead of after.
 Additionally, the anime moved the scene of Baki and Kabuto's conversation to take place immediately after Dosu's death instead of having Jiraiya's conversation in between both of these scenes.

In the manga, when Jiraiya has Naruto drain his normal chakra during the
Summoning Technique
 training, he has Naruto continue to use the
Water Surface Walking Practice
.
 In the anime, Naruto instead uses the
Shadow Clone Technique
 to create a large amount of Shadow Clones to face in a battle royale.

In the manga, when Jiraiya secretly left the Summoning Scroll,
Gamabunta
 is able to confirm that Naruto did summon him on his own.
 In the anime, Gamabunta reveals he already knew that fact when during this scene.

In the manga,
Hiashi Hyūga
 tells Neji the details behind
his father
's death himself.
 In the anime, he hands him a scroll written by his father.

In the manga, after a disguised
Kabuto Yakushi
 finishes healing
Hinata
, he knocks Kiba Inuzuka and his dog Akamaru unconscious during Naruto and Neji's fight.
 In the anime, he knocks them out during Sasuke's fight with Gaara, just as Akamaru recognises Kabuto's scent.
 However, when this scene is shown again in flashback in
Naruto: Shippūden
, it's depicted like in the manga.

In the manga, Sasuke and Kakashi arrive to the finals shortly after Shikamaru's match had ended.
 In the anime, the Third Hokage instead allows for another extension for Sasuke to arrive and he and Kakashi arrive just as
Genma
 is about to cancel the match after the waiting time had expired.

In the manga, the Kusanagi looks more like a standard
katana
,
 while in the anime it is a double-edged
jian
.

During the
Third Hokage
's fight with
Orochimaru
 he rams
Monkey King: Enma
, who has transformed into an adamantine staff, into the
Sword of Kusanagi
, and his Enma is shown partially reversing the transformation.
 In the anime, this is removed.

In the manga, immediately after ramming his adamantine staff into the
Sword of Kusanagi
,
Hiruzen Sarutobi
 places
explosive tags
 on the left leg of
Hashirama Senju
 and the right leg of
Tobirama Senju
, they are later shown healing while standing.
 In the anime, the tags are placed on the left leg of Hashirama and the right arm of Tobirama, they are shown healing while lying face down.

In the manga, Hashirama Senju uses the
Bringer-of-Darkness Technique
.
 In the anime, Tobirama Senju performs it.

In the manga,
Shikaku Nara
,
Inoichi Yamanaka
, and
Chōza Akimichi
 first appeared during the Konoha Crush storyline as part of the counteroffensive alongside other family members of the Konoha 11.
 In the anime, they were originally introduced earlier during the Konoha Festival in the Chūnin Exams arc.

In the manga, when
Naruto
 and Gamabunta do the
Combination Transformation
 they transform into a giant fox with a single tail.
 In the anime, they transform into
Kurama
.

In the manga, when Jiraiya uses Rasengan on
Gantetsu
, he also steals
his wallet
,
 while in the anime, he is given it out of respect.

During Jiraiya and Naruto's search for Tsunade, Jiraiya enters a gambling parlour. While Naruto mills around he finds a coin on the ground. Wondering how the slot machine works, he decides to insert his coin. We then see Naruto has amazing luck, as he wins back a large amount of money. In the anime, this was changed to have Naruto win a lot of money in a lottery instead.

In the manga, after the group returns to the village with Tsunade and encounter Shikamaru and his father Shikaku, Jiraiya smacked Naruto on the head after hearing Naruto state to Shikamaru he'll show him his new move explaining that a shinobi shouldn't show off their techniques.
 This was skipped in the anime
 due to the fact that Jiraiya was left behind in the hot springs they visited in the previous episode.

In the manga, Shikamaru was promoted to a chūnin at some point before Naruto and Jiraiya returned from their journey of bringing Tsunade back to the village.
 In the anime, due to filler episodes taking place first, including the
Land of Tea Escort Mission
, this was pushed back to after Tsunade had become the Hokage and she was the one who personally informed Shikamaru of his promotion in an original scene which occurred in her office.
 As a result, Iruka explaining to Naruto why only Shikamaru was promoted is excluded from the anime.

In the manga, Lee and Guy's conversation regarding that Lee should go through the risky surgery so Lee could fulfil his dream takes place on the same night Sasuke fought against the Sound Four.
 In the anime, this took place after Tsunade returned to the village at the end of the Search for Tsunade arc.

In the manga, when Sasuke's flashback to the night of the
Uchiha Clan Massacre
 occurs, right before he opens the door to his parents' room, his dying father
Fugaku Uchiha
 warns Sasuke not to come into the room.
 In the anime, all Sasuke hears is the sound of his parents' bodies falling to the floor after Itachi slays them, and Fugaku does not say anything.

In the anime, Tsunade's talk with Lee about why he wants to go through with the surgery before mentioning that the surgery was to take place that afternoon occurred at the beginning of the Sasuke Recovery Mission arc on the same day that Naruto and Sasuke fought.
 In the manga, this scene along with the surgery takes place on the following day shortly after the Sasuke Retrieval Team left the village.

In the manga, Sakura takes Naruto with her to a park bench just after Sasuke left following their battle to tell him about Sasuke's
curse mark
.
 In the anime, she instead accepts a small dinner date with Naruto at Ramen Ichiraku in the evening to talk about it there which occurred during Sasuke's battle with the Sound Four.

In the manga, Neji was recruited into the Sasuke Retrieval Team after Lee heard their conversation and recommended him.
 In the anime, the team instead encountered both him and Lee on their way out of the village discussing the success of Lee's operation that took place the day before.

In the manga,
Kiba
 is forced to save
Akamaru
 from an
Explosive Tag
 when Akamaru accidentally tripped after setting it.
 In the anime, it is due to Sakon using wire to bind Akamaru to prevent him from escaping the blast.

In the manga, when Sakon and Ukon are torn apart and regenerate, the dark tissue leaks out of their body and forms new arms and legs. In the anime, the arms and legs are formed out of their organs.

After bringing Naruto back from the
Valley of the End
, Kakashi goes to the
Memorial Stone
 to talk with Obito. This brief scene was taken out to be used in a later episode. This chapter and the next were greatly rearranged and split up over the course of 80+ episodes of filler. This filler was used to allow the manga to get further ahead.

In the anime, when Neji suggests to Hinata that she go see Naruto off, he is in the middle of sparring with her. In the manga, it is in the middle of his sparring session with
Hiashi
, and the conversation is much longer, including an appearance from
Kiba
 and
Shino
.
 The scene of Neji's training session with Hiashi and Kiba and Shino's appearance was instead used earlier in the anime at the beginning of the
Mizuki Tracking Mission
.

Part II

In the manga, when Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya, the person he first re-encounters is Kakashi.
 In the anime, he first meets Sakura and Konohamaru.
 Also, Naruto meets
Shikamaru
 and
Temari
 on the streets in the manga,
 while in the anime he meets them while inside Tsunade's office.

In the manga,
Yurika
 told
Tsunade
 herself about Gaara's kidnapping,
 while in the anime, she handed her the message to read it.

In the manga, Neji examines with his Byakugan inside the cave of the Land of River before Team Kakashi and Chiyo arrive.
 In the anime, however, Neji examines inside the cave after Team Kakashi and Chiyo arrive.

In the manga,
Hiruko
 was a normal puppet,
 in the anime, he was a
Human Puppet
.

During the
Kazekage Rescue Mission
, an unknown Akatsuki member is present in various scenes during
Shukaku
's sealing. However, this member is replaced with
Hidan
 in the anime.

In the manga, none of the puppets in
Chiyo
's
Chikamatsu collection
 were destroyed,
 however in the anime, at least four were shown being heavily damaged.

In the manga, Kakashi explains Naruto's
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 training method before teaching him about
nature transformation
, with
Yamato
 being present for the latter.
 In the anime, he instead explains nature transformation first and Yamato arrives partway through the explanation.

In
Shippūden

episode 80
, Asuma is shown buying flowers from the Yamanaka Flower Shop after the time skip. In the manga, he bought the flowers before the time skip.

During Naruto's training to add his
wind
 nature to the Rasengan, Kakashi takes him to
Ramen Ichiraku
. In the manga, Ayame is away on a trip and
Nishi
 and
Matsu
 work as her replacements.
 In the anime, she has just returned from a trip and has converted the Ramen Bar into a
Tsukemen
 bar.

In the manga, after Konohamaru performed the Sexy Girl on Girl Technique, Sakura punched him for using it.
 But in the anime, Moegi punched him instead.

In the manga,
Shiba
 picked up Sasuke's scent
 while in the anime, it was
Bisuke
.

In the manga, Sasuke's first encounter with Itachi takes place while Jiraiya is infiltrating
Amegakure
,
 along with the later events of Hebi heading to Itachi's location.
 In the anime, this instead takes place after Jiraiya's death.

In the manga, Naruto finds out about Jiraiya's death just before Sasuke is assigned to capture
Killer B
.
 In the anime, due to the
Six-Tails Unleashed
 filler arc, this was pushed back to afterwards, where instead it is shown at the beginning of the
Pain's Assault arc
.

In the manga,
Utakata
, the
jinchūriki
 of the
Six-Tails
, had already been captured by the time of Akatsuki and Taka's alliance, while in the anime he was captured afterwards.

In the manga, when decoding
Jiraiya
's message,
Shiho
 shows the correct way to write 'ta' and the way that Jiraiya did,
 and in the anime however,
Shikamaru
 does this. In the anime, they also confirm it by comparing the 'ta' with a book containing Jiraiya's writing in it.

In
Shippūden
 episode
157
, there are a few changes:

In the manga, when the
assault
 on Konoha began, the
Animal Path
 summoned one
centipede
 that was killed by Sakura.
 In the anime, three centipedes were summoned, one that was killed by Sakura as in the manga, and later another that was killed by Shikamaru. The third one's fate however was unseen.

In the manga, after Kakashi saves him from Pain, Iruka informs Sakura that Akatsuki is invading the village.
 In the anime, Iruka informs Sakura of the attack but has no idea who is invading, which happened before his encounter with Pain.

In the manga,
Ino
's first thought about
Katsuyu
 was that the slug was part of the enemy's attack during
Pain
's invasion.
 In the anime however, this incident happened earlier during the Three-Tails' Appearance, when four divisions of Katsuyu appeared in time to help the sealing team by giving them an extra supply of chakra. Ino and
Hinata

Sasuke
 and his team are seen getting ready to head to Konoha,

In
Shippūden
 episode 246
, the fact that Kushina migrated to Konohagakure is played on very heavily. She even stated that she didn't hold much hope to be rescued when kidnapped by

-nin because she was an "outsider". However, in the manga, this is not the case as she told Naruto that Konoha immediately sent out a search party to look for her.

In the manga, when
Hiruzen
 is driving the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox

It was said by an unknown Iwagakure shinobi that
Gari
 was the former captain of the Iwagakure's
Explosion Corps
. However, in the manga, he was said to be the former member of the given organisation.

In the manga, Suigetsu is shown freeing Jūgo when the chapter focuses on them.
 The anime expands that sequence, showing how Suigetsu escaped his cell. During that time in the manga, Suigetsu's clothes was also shown to be in a semi-liquid state. In the anime, however, only his body is still in this state.

In the manga, Asuma noticed the arrival of his students before they faced Kinkaku.

 with his body, despite using his
Spiralling Serial Spheres
 in the manga.

When

's torso with the
Kubikiribōchō
, he just sliced him with the sword. In the manga, Kakashi applied a lightning chakra flow on the sword to increase its piercing.

Daimyō Protection Squad
's fight against Black Zetsu is shown near the beginning before Madara is summoned, while in the manga it is not shown.

Pakura, Gari and Mangetsu are shown fighting the Third Division along with Fuguki before retreating into the forest after Fuguki is sealed, while in the manga they are not shown and only mentioned by Lee that only three remain.

In
Shippūden
 episode
329
, when the
jinchūriki
 and the
tailed beasts
 introduce themselves to Naruto, small dialogue changes were made,
Isobu
 commenting on meeting Naruto
before
, and Utakata telling Naruto that he already knew his name. In the manga, neither had met Naruto before, and therefore both introduce themselves normally.

In
Shippūden
 episode
331
, the contents of the scroll Suigetsu finds at one of Orochimaru's hideouts is shown. In the manga, the scroll's contents were not revealed until much later. Also, in the manga, Karin's chains were linked to a wall, in the anime they weren't linked to any walls.

The following scenes from the manga were omitted or changed in the anime episode
364
:

A
Sunagakure
 shinobi from the
Intelligence Division
 having an argument with a
Kirigakure
 shinobi from the
Sensor Division
 about evacuating the place or not shortly before the
Ten-Tails
'
Tailed Beast Ball
 hits the Alliance's headquarter.

An elderly
Kumogakure
 shinobi praising the
Hyūga clan
's prowess on the battlefield.

In the manga, Sakura Haruno was saved from the Ten-Tails's rampage by Kakashi Hatake. In the anime, however, Sakura protected herself instead of being saved by Kakashi.

The shinobi on the battlefield defending themselves against the Ten-Tails'
Wood Release: Cutting Technique
 by using
Earth Release
 and
Fire Release
.

Naruto throwing 3 Rasenshuriken towards the barrage of wooden spikes in the manga, slicing paths through the Cutting Technique and detonating midair. In the anime, Naruto throws 5, each one disabling one of the Ten-Tails' tails.

During Kakashi's flashback about a previous sparring with Obito, the latter failed to perform the
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
.
 In the anime, however, his usage of the technique succeeded.

In the manga, once Naruto handed everyone in the Shinobi Alliance Nine-Tail Chakra Cloaks, an unnamed member of the Akimichi clan didn't gain a Nine-Tails Chakra Cloak in the background.
 In
Shippūden
 episode
365
, he was not present, and was replaced with
Chōji Akimichi
 who had gained a Nine-Tails Chakra Cloak from Naruto.

In the manga, when Obito attempted to
attack
 Naruto, Sasuke shielded the latter using the hand of his Susanoo. The hand was penetrated,
 while in the anime, the attack did not pierce through.

In the manga, when Madara activates the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
, Yamato is already under the genjutsu once Tobi releases him.
 When he is released in the anime, Yamato quickly gains consciousness, asking Hiruzen about what has taken place in the war, and only then gets caught in the genjutsu.

In
Shippūden
 episode
476
, there are several changes:

While explaining his interpretation of the
Hokage
, Sasuke catching and crushing a floating leaf to allude to his detachment from the current
Konohagakure
 is original to the anime.

In the manga,
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 recalled becoming a new form of Hokage as Sasuke's answer to his previous question.
 In the anime, this was omitted.

 In the anime, the characters aren't shown.

The fight between Naruto and Sasuke starts with clashing their arms against each other on top of Hashirama's statue.
 In the anime however, the two run down the statues and clash in the middle of the lake, all while their development over the course of the series is shown. Additionally, the following fighting sequences up until Naruto blocks Sasuke's
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
 with a
chakra arm
 are original to the anime.

The Great Fireball Technique mentioned above is depicted much stronger in the anime than in the manga, pushing against Naruto's defence with such power that the ground under his feet starts to crack.

In the anime, Naruto's recollection of Sasuke stating that top-class shinobi could understand each other when their fists meet is omitted.

In
Shippūden
 episode
477
, there are some changes:

In the manga, Naruto summons three
shadow clones
 in his
Tailed Beast Mode
.
 In the anime, he summons four.

In the manga, Naruto begins merging his Tailed Beast Mode with those of his clones into a single avatar before receiving the natural energy. In the anime, he does it only afterwards.

In
Shippuden
 episode
479
, there are a few changes.

 In the anime, it was expanded to also include all the people who died in the war and the graves of
Shikaku
 and
Inoichi
 were also seen.

In the manga, Sasuke was only seen after the war being told by Kakashi that he is being pardoned and therefore would not have to be imprisoned.
 In the anime, Sasuke was first seen imprisoned in Konoha's jail, before Kakashi had him pardoned and released.

The
final chapter
 in full was never adapted for the
final episode
 of
Shippūden
, instead ending the anime with an adaptation of the
Konoha Hiden: The Perfect Day for a Wedding
 novel. Eventually for the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime, the chapter is very loosely adapted, with Naruto holding a Five Kage Summit in Konoha and Boruto planning the deface the Hokage Rock. Moegi and Udon inform Naruto of the graffiti in the manga, but in the anime, it is only Moegi.

  In the anime, the exams begin in a
later arc
.

After Naruto blocks Shin's attacks with
Tailed Beast Chakra Arms
, Sarada and Chōchō mention that they know Naruto having the
Nine-Tails
 inside his body, while in the manga, they don't mention this fact.

In the manga, after meeting Sarada, Sasuke has a flashback of him discussing the possible threat greater than Kaguya with Naruto, Sakura and other Kage at the
Five Kage Summit
.
 In the anime, during this flashback, he discussed the matter only with Naruto instead.
 Later in the anime, the Summit on that matter is eventually shown, although it's set in the present time instead of the flashback and Sasuke doesn't show up on it.

In the manga, Sakura got warped away by
Shin Uchiha's Space–Time Dōjutsu
 of his
creature
 while standing next to Shin and his clone.
 In the anime, Sarada was supposed to be the one warped away, but Sakura pushed her out of the way and was teleported in her place.

In the manga, when Naruto notices Sarada's Sharingan, he mentions her having it aloud.
 In the anime, he hands her a mirror to look on it.

In
Boruto
 episode
23
, there are a few changes:

In the manga, during their final encounter, Shin was quickly defeated by Sasuke catching off guard and crushing him with Susanoo.

teleporting
 her close enough to cripple him in a single
blow
.

In the manga, Sarada kills Shin's creature with a punch. And then not long after, attacks the Shin clones with an earth shattering punch. In the anime however, Sarada does not fight the clones but kills Shin's creature with the same amount of power she used against the clones in the manga.

, while in the anime, he dies offscreen during the fight against the clones.

In the manga, Boruto ambushes Sasuke in an alley.

 and Kankurō in the
Thunder Rail
.
 However, in the anime, Gaara wasn't with the others and instead he watched them off.

In the manga,
Shinki
 briefly battles
Metal Lee
 with a skeletal puppet.
 In the anime, he does not possess the puppet and utilises his
iron sand
.

In the manga, Boruto’s usage of the Shinobi Gauntlet is discovered by Naruto after winning his match with Shikadai in the semi-finals. In the anime, this happens after his victory over Shinki in the finals, which Naruto noticed when Boruto used Kakashi's
Lightning Release: Purple Electricity
. The Chūnin Exams also did not get that far in the manga or movie.

In the manga, Mitsuki is present with Sarada beside Boruto's bedside at the hospital after the Ōtsutsuki invasion.
 In the anime, Mitsuki himself is also being treated at the hospital, after an encounter with
Urashiki Ōtsutsuki
 during the attack.

In
Boruto
 episode
65
, there are some changes:

In the manga, Naruto used himself to shield Boruto from
Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki
's shockwave.
 In the anime, he used an Earth-Style Wall to protect him.

Kurotsuchi attempts to punch Momoshiki, but is swiftly knocked out on the spot in the manga.
 In the anime, she attacks him with the
Earth Release: Fist Rock Technique
 and is then sent distances away by Momoshiki.

In both the anime and manga, Naruto and Sasuke’s fight with Momoshiki is mostly different, with the anime reusing some footage from the movie.

In the manga, after his death, Momoshiki's soul communicates with Boruto while time around them is frozen.
 In the anime, Momoshiki speaks with Boruto in a mental plane.

In the manga, there is a scene of Team 10 together several days after the defeat of the Ōtsutsuki awaiting a new mission.

148
, there are a couple changes:

In the manga, Team 7 is chasing three members from the
Mujina Bandits
.
 In the anime, it was changed to a trio of thieves with no shinobi training.
 This change also reduced the fight between Sarada and the thieves.

In the manga, Naruto and Shikamaru discuss the intel they have on the Mujina Bandits and their leader Shojoji, mentioning that he is in the Bingo Book. In the anime,
Kōtarō Fūma
 recaps the events that took place at Hōzuki Castle and the current status of the gang. Ibiki Marino, Sai and

Iwabee Yuino
 from assaulting Tentō after he had continuously goaded him into giving him his

 card. Also in the manga,
Metal Lee
 had relayed the summoning to Boruto, the former did not appear in the anime. The events that took place in the anime was what resulted in Boruto being chosen for the mission, while it was solely Ikkyū's suggestion in the manga.

In the anime,
Mitsuki
 is alongside Boruto when he discovers the card Tentō snuck into his pocket. In the manga however, Boruto was by himself.

In the manga, Boruto immediately fights Shojoji after dealing with his four Mujina subordinates, when he attempts to eat Boruto, just as Tentō warns him about it.
 In the anime, Boruto attempts to hide, protecting Tentō, and Shojoji himself reveals he had impersonated Tsukiyo at Hōzuki Castle, and later escaped posing as Kokuri.

In the manga, Boruto decides not to employ the Vanishing Rasengan because he thinks Shojoji would read the trajectory.
 In the anime, he makes no such rationale.

In the manga, Ikkyū reunites with Tentō at the Hokage Residence.
 In the anime, their reunion happens shortly after Shojoji's defeat.

Ōtsutsuki Clan
 and the Mujina Bandits, as well as Boruto's
mark
.
 In the anime, the discussion was replaced with one focusing on Kara.

In the manga, Mitsuki stated he would only go on the escort mission if Boruto went as well and also tries to convince Boruto to go on the mission because of his promise to Sarada.
 In the anime, due to further developing his free will in a previous
anime original arc
, Mitsuki stated he would go on the mission with or without Boruto, and the part mentioning Boruto's promise is omitted.

183
, there are a few changes:

 In the anime, the Inners leave before and Katasuke is seen testing Kawaki's blood for Scientific Ninja Tools.

 episode
193

portal
 to continue
watching
 the fully nature of the battle, witnessing Jigen's body begin to break down.

 He does not so in the anime.

In the manga, there were two instances of Boruto lashing out at Shikamaru for being suspicious of Kawaki and at
Nishi
 for speculating Himawari's vase of being a ninja tool or a juinjutsu.
 In the anime, these do not occur.

In
Boruto
 episode
206
, there are multiple changes:

In the anime, Shikamaru isn't informed about Sasuke's condition, already aware of it since before arriving at the Uzumaki residence in the previous episode. In the manga, he was informed right after the children left.

In the anime, Sarada is the one who notices Boro's first acid attack from below and warns the others. In the manga, it was Mitsuki who noticed and warned of the attack.

In the anime, Sarada punches a round boulder down a peak at Boro to get him away from Mitsuki. In the manga, she physically grabs an irregular boulder and throws it at him after jumping up in the air.

In the anime, Sarada stresses the importance of team-work, dubs them the new Team 7, and puts on her forehead protector only after they figure out Boro is using a virus. In the manga, these occur before the discovery.

In the anime, Boruto and Kawaki pass out after explaining how Boro's
Dark Cloud
 feels, and the limitations of what Kāma can and can't absorb. Mitsuki has his snakes bite them, mentions his specially made body when Sarada asks why he had his snakes ingest the mist, and shares his virus hypothesis with Sarada before they regain consciousness and movement. In the manga, Boruto and Kawaki never pass out, Mitsuki isn't revealed to have had his snakes bite them until later, he makes no mention of his special body, and although he did suspect Boro's jutsu involved a virus, he has Sarada confirm it by analysing a bit of the mist his snake captured with her Sharingan.

In the anime, Sarada's Sharingan only have two tomoe, and she consistently keeps them active during battle. In the manga, they're already fully matured, with three tomoe, and she is frequently seen with them off during battle.

In the anime, Boro preaches how he made people believe in miracles with his virus, how he'll save them from their hellish word, and derides the children as not being worth saving. In the manga, he makes no mention of his cult, and merely boasts there are no jutsu that can counter his virus.

In the anime, Boruto creates shadow clones when he first attacks Boro, who counterattacks with his Lava Release, requiring Kawaki to pull out of the way. In doing so, their Kāma resonance slightly enhances Boruto's Rasengan, which both of them notice before they land the first attack which triggers Boro's regeneration. While Sarada prepares to put Boro in position, they explicitly strategise and decide to trigger a much stronger effect on Boruto's Rasengan. In the manga, Boruto makes no use of clones, and his first attack is a regular, non-enhanced Rasengan, his later enhanced Rasengan something they try on the spot.

In
Boruto
 episode
207
, there are multiple changes:

In the anime, Boro boasts about his body before realising Mitsuki harvested his antibodies. In the manga, he makes no boast at all.

In the manga, while explaining his actions, Mitsuki credits Orochimaru's influence on him for the habit of collecting things around him.
 In the anime, he doesn't.

In the manga, Sarada screams for Kawaki when he breaks formation to protect Naruto's seal,
 and Kawaki attempts to block Boro's shuriken while still in the air.
 In the anime, Kawaki lands on the ground before blocking the shuriken, and Sarada's scream is to try warning him against doing it instead of for breaking formation.

In the manga, Boro mixes gunpowder to make his virus cloud explode.
 In the anime, it's an unspecified flammable substance.

In the anime, after Kawaki is injured by the explosion, Boro comments on Kawaki's body also being a divine gift. He makes no such comments in the manga.

In the anime, Team 7 comment on who wants to protect who. In the manga, no such comments happen.

In the anime, Boruto and Mitsuki's attack on Boruto is extended, while Kawaki holds Sarada back and explains she has to find a core that controls Boro's scientific ninja tools. He later attacks along Boruto and Mitsuki to give Sarada time to find it. In the manga, he only explains it later in the fight,
 after asking Boruto and Mitsuki to buy time without him.

In the manga, Sarada directly asks Kawaki how Boro could have a sizeable core somewhere in his body, considering all the parts of it they already destroyed.
 In the anime, she just thinks it to herself while looking for it.

In the manga, Boruto comments he doesn't have enough chakra for another Rasengan after destroying Boro's shoulder,
 and wonders when Sarada mastered the Chidori.
 In the anime, he has chakra for one more, and continues fighting. He notices Sarada's incoming Chidori, and creates a ruse with smoke-bombs and a Vanishing Rasengan, destroying Boro's arm and making it impossible for him to weave hand seals just before moving out of the way for Sarada's attack. He also doesn't question when she mastered the Chidori.

In the manga, when Kawaki suggests abandoning the fight with Boro after he starts rampaging in favour of releasing Naruto, Mitsuki suggests that Naruto might be strong enough to defeat Boro.
 In the anime, Mitsuki makes no suggestion.

In
Boruto
 episode
208
, there are a few changes:

In the manga, while possessing Boruto, Momoshiki disintegrates Boro with a powered up Rasengan, only his tentacles remaining.
 In the anime, there are no remains of Boro left from the Rasengan, and Boro curses at Koji for deceiving him.

In the manga, after regaining consciousness, Kawaki asks Mitsuki what happened as he witnesses Boruto in the air after Boro is defeated, and Mitsuki confesses he doesn't know.
 In this anime, this exchange is cut.

In the anime, a couple of concerns about Boruto's Kāma are shifted from Sarada
 to Mitsuki.

In the anime, Naruto awakens in the hospital after a two day coma after his rescue. In the manga, it is never specified how long he was unconscious.

In the manga, Shikamaru discusses with Naruto about how he was rescued, as well as punishing Team 7 for disobedience and Jigen being capable of using space–time ninjutsu through Kawaki's Kāma.
 In the anime, discussion of Team 7 being punished is omitted, Naruto is told of his rescue by Hinata, and the topic of Jigen is rearranged to later in the episode.

In the manga, Sakura is present with Sarada in her room at the hospital with Sasuke and Mitsuki, and wishes her to recover. Also, Mitsuki talks with Sasuke in private about Momoshiki's possession of Boruto.
 In the anime, Sakura isn't present and Mitsuki, Sasuke discuss the manifestation with Sarada, and is he who wishes Sarada to recover.

In the manga, Naruto, Shikamaru and Boruto visit Kawaki in his room after Naruto's awakening. Shikamaru states Kawaki would have heavier security after Jigen's intrusion.
 In the anime, Kawaki visits Naruto in his room with Boruto instead and have discussion regarding what had happened and more intel on Kara.

In the manga, Jigen checks in with Code to see if anyone else has attempted to approach the
Ten-Tails
, shortly before his fight with Koji.
 In the anime however, this transpires prior to Koji returning to the hideout and Amado's defection. Delta is also present, who informs Jigen of Boro's demise and Naruto's escape, which he does not learn until later in the manga.

In the manga, upon returning to the hideout, Koji asks Amado the whereabouts of Boro and Code.
 In the anime, Koji asks him where all the Inners are, instead of asking about anyone specific.

In
Boruto
 episode
212
, there are a couple changes:

In the manga, after Amado shuts Delta down, Koji wonders if he himself has a programmed shutdown code before sending Amado to Konoha.
 In the anime, he only wonders it after sending Amado to Konoha.

In the anime, Moegi is with Team 10 during their battle royale sparring, who leaves to get them lunch. However in the manga, Moegi is not seen until Amado takes Shikadai hostage.
 Moegi also notes to herself the team became determined to train after failing to capture Koji Kashin when he had stolen data from the village archives, which had never happened in the manga.

In the manga, Boruto asks Sumire what it means to defect after Amado's request to defect to Konoha.
 In the anime, Sumire merely questions if Amado is defecting from Kara.

In the manga, only Naruto, Sasuke and Shikamaru are initially present in the room with Amado where they listen to what he talks about Kara and the Ōtsutsuki,
 and Sai only joins in when Amado's asylum deal is finalised.
 In the anime, Sai is also in the room with the other three from the start.

In the manga, Amado's interrogation begins before he projects Koji's confrontation with Jigen.
 In the anime, it begins after.

In the manga, Jigen inquires Koji on his report after his return, which leads to him voicing his suspicions that someone had conspired to crash the airship.
 In the anime, this happens offscreen and is moved to the following episode.

In the anime, the live feed of Koji and Jigen disconnects during the beginning of their fight, but resumes prior to Jigen's death.
 In the manga however, the live feed only disconnects after Isshiki's resurrection.

In
Boruto
 episode
214
, there are a couple changes:

In the manga, while Jigen is shrinking the flames summoned by Koji, the latter explains that he had summoned them from another location, rather than creating them through chakra.
 In the anime, instead of it being told by Koji himself, Kawaki and Amado deduce that it is his method while they are observing the fight.

In the anime, Sai comments on Isshiki's shrinking, Amado's explanation of resurrection through Kāma, and the possibility of the village being destroyed by Isshiki in search of Kawaki. In the manga, those comments were made by Shikamaru
 and Katasuke.

In the anime, after Sasuke blocks Kawaki's attack on Amado, Katasuke has Sumire tell Akita and other lab workers to prepare for video analysis.No such exchange happens in the manga.

In the manga, after Amado reveals that the bomb on Shikadai's neck is just for decoration, Katasuke questions what he would have done if they had realised that, and Shikamaru just expresses a little frustration.
 In the anime, Katasuke doesn't question him and Shikamaru angrily grabs him by the collar.

In
Boruto
 episode
215
, there are a couple changes:

In the anime, Naruto and Sai escort Katasuke, Sumire and Amado to the Byakugan proof room beneath Konoha before Isshiki's arrival in the village when Amado mentions Isshiki's Byakugan can track Kawaki, and explain its origin and capabilities as they arrive on it. However in the manga, they are all still in the interrogation room when he arrives,
 and Sai suggests using the room before Amado points out Isshiki can track Kawaki with the Byakugan.

In the anime, Boruto's discussion with Naruto is extended. In addition to what was portrayed in the manga, Boruto points out he helped out in the fight against Momoshiki, but Naruto counters that he might be taken over by his Kāma again.

In the anime, the Byakugan proof room is given more background. It is an old Root facility, built by Danzō as a precaution against a possible Hyūga coup.

In the anime, before Isshiki's arrival, Shikamaru, Tsunade, and Kakashi coordinate the shinobi, and Shikamaru confesses to not having a plan. Tenten, Chōji, Kiba, Rock Lee rally them instead, and Konohamaru visits Mugino's grave. No such events happen in the manga.

In the manga, Isshiki is confronted by two Konoha shinobi and retaliates when he is attacked by one of them. When Isshiki incapacitates the other, the shinobi states that they haven't been told anything.
 In the anime, instead of two unknown shinobi, Isshiki is confronted by a group consisting of Tenten, Chōji, Kiba, Rock Lee and Konohamaru, who he effortlessly defeats. Isshiki comes close to killing Konohamaru until Naruto's arrival. Naruto did not meet Isshiki until after he had left the two shinobi in the manga.

In the manga, Isshiki uses Sukunahikona to shrink a nearby building in order to get Naruto to disclose Kawaki's location.
 This was cut in the anime.

In
Boruto
 episode
216
, there are several changes:

In the manga, Shikamaru is speaking with the
Konoha Barrier Team
 on the status of Naruto and Sasuke, who informs him that they had disappeared from the village after Boruto and Isshiki.
 In the anime, Shikamaru tells the group hiding in the hidden Byakugan proof location of their status instead, having been updated offscreen.

In the anime, shortly after waking up, Kawaki attempts to join the fight against Isshiki by creating rift with his Kāma, before being told he no longer has it. No such attempt happens in the manga.

In the anime, Sumire takes over a couple of Shikamaru's lines about having hope in Naruto.

In the manga, Naruto makes his first move against Isshiki in the other dimension with his Rasengan.
 In the anime however, he does not use it until shortly before Isshiki momentarily incapacitates him.

In the manga, Naruto is separated from Sasuke by Isshiki's
cubes
.
 In the anime, Isshiki pins him between two cubes instead.

The revelation of Isshiki's reluctance in killing Boruto for his plans greatly differs between the anime and manga. In the manga, Boruto and Sasuke learn of it when the former attempted to shield latter from being impaled by Isshiki with his own sword.
 In the anime, Boruto discovers this when he attempts and fails to block Isshiki's cube from crushing Sasuke with his
Compression Rasengan
.

In the manga, after Isshiki shrinks Boruto's kunai, he attacks Sasuke, pinning him down with his cubes. Following that, Boruto uses the Rasengan against Isshiki.
 This does not happen in the anime.

In the anime, Naruto frees himself from Isshiki's cubes upon transforming into
Baryon Mode
. However in the manga, Naruto does not access the transformation until after fending Isshiki off from Boruto.

In
Boruto
 episode
217
, there are a couple of changes:

In the manga, Sasuke physically carries Boruto away from the fight when Isshiki attempts to crush Naruto with his cubes.
 In the anime, Naruto hands over Boruto to Sasuke using one of his Baryon Mode tails before resuming the fight with Isshiki.

In the manga, when Kurama had explained to Naruto how Baryon Mode works in a flashback, he compares it to nuclear fusion, following with Naruto questioning how the form differs from his other transformations.
 In the anime, this portion is cut from Kurama's explanation.

In the manga, Katasuke explains to Amado that Kawaki's prosthetic is able to function via Naruto sharing his chakra. Following his explanation, Sumire asks Amado if he is able to restore Kawaki's arm.
 In the anime, it is Sumire who gives him the explanation instead, but she does not ask about Kawaki's arm afterwards.

In the manga, Boruto passes out during Naruto and Isshiki's fight.
 In the anime, he does not do so until Isshiki brings forth Kawaki through the Kāma Rift. During this moment in the manga, Momoshiki begins to take over Boruto,
 which was cut in the anime.

In the manga, Kawaki uses a smoke bomb that negates Isshiki's Byakugan abilities left by Sasuke when the latter switches places with him.
 In the anime, Sasuke uses the smoke bomb himself.

In the manga, when Isshiki gives Kawaki a 20 second countdown before he kills Naruto, Kawaki remembers back to hiding from him as Jigen.
 In the anime, this is split and expanded into multiple flashbacks.

In
Boruto
 episode
218
, there are several changes:

In the manga, Sasuke notes that Boruto's broken wrist and his other fractures are all healed after Momoshiki's manifestation due to the latter's special healing abilities.
 In the anime, Sasuke does not mention that.

In the manga, Kawaki only attacks Momoshiki with his own shinobiware,
 and Sasuke checks that Momoshiki is avoiding absorbing ninjutsu when he dodges his Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique.
 In the anime, Kawaki first attacks with Fire Release, and Sasuke realises this fact after Momoshiki blocks his Amaterasu with a shadow clone.

In the manga, Momoshiki uses a shadow clone to shield himself against Sasuke's Amaterasu from the get-go.
 In the anime, he manages to avoid Amaterasu by jumping back at first, before utilising a shadow clone to shield himself shortly after.

In the manga, Sasuke stresses to Kawaki that Momoshiki can leave them with his space-time ninjutsu, and that he wants Boruto back in control so they can return to Konoha.
 In the anime, this passage is omitted.

In the manga, Naruto passes out during the fight against the Momoshiki possessed Boruto.
 In the anime, this does not happen until after Boruto overcomes Momoshiki's control.

In the anime, Naruto and Kurama reminisce about their time together before Kurama dissipates. In the manga however, their last conversation is kept brief.

In
Boruto
 episode
219
, there are several changes:

In the manga, Naruto tells Sasuke the cost of Baryon Mode was Kurama's life.
 In the anime, while this was cut, Naruto and Sasuke would later discuss the loss of their abilities with Sakura and Katasuke.

In the manga, Sasuke asks Boruto to use the Kāma Rift to return the group to Konoha. Initially, Boruto is hesistant due to his guilt in Sasuke losing his Rinnegan to Momoshiki.
 In the anime, this scene was largely revised. Boruto is already seen attempting to use Kāma Rift in the beginning of the episode and when the group returns to the village, Boruto apologises to Sarada regarding the incident while both Sasuke and Sarada assure him that he isn't at fault.

In the manga, when Isshiki manifests from Code's Kāma, he relays to him to fulfill the Ōtsutsuki Will and those who were responsible for his demise.
 In the anime, Isshiki's explanation of how Code should proceed with Kara's initial plan to make himself an Ōtsutsuki and who was involved with his death was cut.

In the manga, Amado is seen muttering to himself as those with him await on updates regarding the group that are fighting Isshiki. After Amado is relieved of hearing of that group's return and Kawaki's safety, Sumire is shown to be suspicious of Amado's behaviour.
 In the anime, Amado's suspicious behaviour is omitted.

In the manga, a week after Isshiki's defeat, Boruto is interviewed on his heroics on live tv. Also, Amado informs Naruto and Shikamaru on Code, the last surviving Inner.

 In the anime, Amado providing intel on Code takes place shortly after Naruto's return to the village while Boruto's interview is in the following day.

In
Boruto
 episode
220
, there are a few changes:

In the manga, Kawaki visits Amado and Katasuke for a checkup after he was given a new arm a week prior.
 In the anime, after an unspecified amount of time has passed after Isshiki's defeat, Kawaki receives his new arm soon after Sumire visits him at the Uzumaki household.

In the manga, Kawaki questions Sumire if she has feelings for Boruto.
 In the anime, this was removed.

In the anime, after having counselled Boruto, Naruto is approached by Amado, who offers him medication to delay Boruto's Ōtsutsukification. In the manga however, it is Naruto who meets with Amado to find a solution to the Ōtsutsukification after the Five Kage Summit. Amado states that a side effect to the medication could result in death,
 which is removed from the anime and instead explained that the pills are the reason for Kawaki's slow progression.

In the anime, Kawaki becomes a genin after succeeding in a
test mission
 provided by Naruto.
 He would then join Team 7 as the fourth member
 after Sarada had become chūnin.
 In the manga however, Kawaki has yet to become a genin and Sarada is still a genin three years after Kawaki rewrote the world's memories through Ada's Omnipotence.

In the manga, Code only kills two guards, armed with scientific ninja tools, to gain access to a still staffed facility from Boro's Ōtsutsuki Cult.
 In the anime, the fight is extended with reinforcements from additional guards, including one who enhances himself with several injections.

In the anime, Naruto watches Team 7 alone as their training session escalates into actual combat.
 In the manga, he was accompanied by Konohamaru, who Naruto stopped from interfering when combat began.
 In the anime, Boruto's last Lightning Release: Thunderclap Arrow had a kunai it didn't in the manga, which sliced through Kawaki's forehead protector. This was likely changed so Boruto would have a reason to give Kawaki his own forehead protector during dinner, as Kawaki already had his own in the anime due to his own genin promotion.

In the manga, Momoshiki breaks free of Shikamaru's hold by absorbing his Shadow Immitation Technique with the Kāma.
 In the anime, he makes no such attempt, and gets free when Shikamaru attempts to constrict him, causing the shadows to snap as Momoshiki is too strong.

Animation Changes

These are small changes made in the anime regarding depictions, how characters and objects are positioned or actions. The plot does not acknowledge these minor changes.

Part I

In the anime, Zabuza's
flak jacket
 design was altered
 by adding metal with the Kirigakure village symbol on each shoulder.

In the manga, an unnamed Chūnin Exams proctor is shown with a tattoo on his head.
 In the anime, he is removed completely.

In the manga, up until the second part of the Chūnin Exams,
Neji
's hair tie was higher up, right at the base of his head.
 In the anime, it was much lower.

In the manga, Orochimaru's summoning tattoo has alternating curves coming out of it.
 In the anime, these are removed.
 This is corrected in subsequent appearances, but instead adds another error where the lower part of the seal is incorrect.

In the manga, when Kabuto speaks with
Baki
 after Gaara killed
Dosu
, he wears a sleeveless outfit.
 In the anime, he wears his usual attire.
 In
Shippūden

episode 307
, Kabuto wears a sleeveless purple shirt and blue pants, including his Konoha forehead protector.

In the manga, when Kabuto killed an Anbu during Naruto's battle with Neji at the Chūnin Exams, he wears an Anbu uniform.
 In the anime, he wears his usual attire instead of an Anbu uniform.

In the manga, when a member of the Anbu was killed by Kabuto during the final Chūnin Exams, his face was shown.
 However, in the anime, his face wasn't shown when he was killed.

In the manga, Hiruzen's outfit bore the kanji for Third Hokage (
三代目火影
,
Sandaime Hokage
,
literally meaning:
 Third Fire Shadow) on the back.
 In the anime, it was changed to the kanji for fire (
火
,
hi
).
 His outfit once again bore the kanji for Third Hokage upon his reanimation.

In the manga, when Kabuto speaks with Orochimaru after the Invasion of Konoha ended, he was wearing a sleeveless outfit.
 In the anime, however, he wears his usual attire, including his Oto forehead protector and fingerless gloves.

In the anime at the
Valley of the End
, Naruto stands near to the statue of
Madara Uchiha
 and Sasuke is opposite him. After the scene changes from Sasuke activating his Sharingan, Sasuke is near the statue with Naruto opposite him.

Part II

In the manga, when Yamato suppresses the
Naruto's four-tailed form
 with
Hokage-Style Sixty-Year-Old Technique — Kakuan Entering Society with Bliss-Bringing Hands
, there are ten pillars.
 In the anime, there are eleven.

In the manga, the triangle on
Hidan
's Jashin amulet points up.

In
Shippūden
 episode 80
, when the lower portion of Pain's face is shown, he does not have his two lip piercings.

In the manga, a young
Gamabunta
 is shown to not have had a scar on his left eye when sitting next to
Jiraiya
.
 In the anime, he has a scar.

In the manga,
Tobi
 blocks
Suigetsu
's
sword
 with his artificial right arm.
 In the anime, he blocks it with his left arm.

In
Shippūden
 episode
143
, when
B
 turns into the
Eight-Tails
, his shin-guards and sandals fall off. This didn't occur in the scene in the manga
 or any other time he has transformed.

In the manga, the
Preta Path
 of Pain has six piercings below its mouth.
 In the anime, it only has five.

In the anime, the
Naraka Path
's original body, while still alive, is shown outside, while in the manga, he was in the sewers.

In the anime, the
Asura Path
's original body, while still alive, is shown wearing a rice hat, while in the manga, his bare forehead and crown of the head are shown.

In the manga
Kushina
's hair is shown to fall down almost to her ankles.
 In the anime, Kushina's hair falls to her waist.

In the manga, several of the
Uchiha clan
 members before the founding of
Konohagakure
 are depicted with elaborate facial markings.
 In the anime, however, only one of the members retain his distinct facial markings.

In the manga,
Nagato

deflects
 the
Amegakure
 and
Root
 kunai on his right.
 In the anime, he deflects them from his left.

In
Shippūden
 episode
187
, when Naruto looks at Hokage Rock before leaving with Jiraiya, Tsunade's face is next to Minato's, even though it was not there when they left at the end of Part I in the manga. In fact, when Naruto returned to Konoha, he claimed that the only thing different about the village was that Tsunade's face was now engraved on the rock. This seems to be a mistake from the animators as it contradicts a major part of the story line.

In the manga, when Danzō first reveals a Sharingan, the eye looks unhealthy, having a dark sclerae.
 In the anime, the sclerae is white.

In the manga, Rōshi's headpiece is depicted as having a golden ring on the left side. In the anime, however, this ring was not present.

In the manga, Sasuke's Susanoo has six fingers.
 In the anime, it has five fingers.

In the manga,
Mei Terumī
 strikes
Ao
 with a straight punch.
 In the anime, she strikes him with an uppercut.

In the manga, when Sasuke puts Danzō in a genjutsu, "Itachi" uses Amaterasu with his right eye,
 In the anime, "Itachi" casts it with his left eye.

In
Shippūden
 episode
214
, there are several errors:

Kakashi's Mangekyō Sharingan is inaccurately depicted as having a black background and red tomoe, similar to Sasuke Uchiha's,
 though this was fixed in
Shippūden
 episode
215
.

The teeth of Sasuke's final Susanoo form in the manga are depicted as jagged,
 but when animated they resemble normal teeth with elongated canines.

When Sasuke's complete Susanoo is seen for the first time in the manga it has what appears to be an orb in it's foremost right hand.
 In the anime however the entity is seen with a gourd of sorts in its secondary right hand with the orb being absent altogether.

In the manga when White Zetsu cancels his
Substitute Technique
 the clone resembles a regular Zetsu clone.
 However in the anime, the clone has the venus flytrap like extensions which have never been seen on a typical clone.

In
Shippūden
 episode
221
, the robes from all reincarnated Akatsuki members are depicted with an incorrect colour scheme, black with red lining.
 In the manga, the robes are wine-coloured with tan lining, matching Kabuto's.
 The colour scheme was corrected in
Shippūden
 episode
254
.

In the manga, the object
Kurama
 was bounded to as well as the chains and stakes that bound it while sealed within
Kushina Uzumaki
 had more of a liquid appearance
 while in the anime, they appear to be more solid.
 This was changed in the subsequent episode into something that resembled lava.

In the manga
 and in the
Shippūden
 episode
247
,
 Sasuke appeared to have short spiky black as an infant, however, in the
Shippūden
 episode
248
, he appears to have bangs on both sides of his face and no fringe

In
Shippūden
 episode
255
, there are several errors:

In the manga when Kabuto returns to the
Mountains' Graveyard
, he has several appendages on the lower half of his snake-like body.
 In the anime, however, these are not present.

In that same scene,
Zetsu
's lower half is completely white. Also in the manga, he appears close behind Kabuto while in the anime he is on the same side as Tobi.

In
Shippūden
 episode
256
,
Hiashi Hyūga
 is seen wearing a bandanna-styled
forehead protector
 whereas in the manga, he wears it in the traditional manner. This may have been misconstrued due to the fact that the forehead protector is on a dark cloth and Hiashi has black hair, but in fact the forehead protector is tied in as similar manner to Neji's: with his hair covering the back of the cloth.

In the manga, when
Tsunade
,
A
 and
Ōnoki
 are seen standing side by side, Ōnoki is actually
flying
.
 However, in the anime, he is not.

In
Shippūden
 episode
261
,
C
 who was present in the manga when deploying with the
Sensor Division
,
 is replaced with another shinobi.

In the manga,
Shin
 wears a Konoha forehead protector when he was reincarnated by Kabuto.
 In the anime, he doesn't wear one.

In the manga, when Omoi used the
Cloud-Style Crescent Moon Beheading
 technique, he slashed his sword to the right and the opponents repelled the attack.
 In the anime, however, Omoi slashed to the left and the opponents dodged the attack instead.

In the anime, part of the left side of Tobi's face can be seen through his mask's eyehole.
 While in the manga, Masashi Kishimoto has consistently kept that side of his face, except for his eye, completely shadowed.

In the anime, Shin's eyes are depicted as being black. However, when he was reincarnated — the only time his eyes are seen open in the manga — they are depicted as being light-coloured.
 Curiously in the anime when Shin is reincarnated his eyes are black in colour, however when Sasori uses Shin
as a puppet
, his eyes turn white as if his personality had been eliminated by Kabuto which was not the case.

In
Shippūden
 episode
264
, there are a few changes:

In the manga, when he was reincarnated by Kabuto,
Torune
 was drooling. In the anime, blood was coming from his mouth.

The
Suna
-nin that speaks with the shinobi with the mobile
communication device
 has on glasses. In the manga, he doesn't wear glasses.

In
Shippūden
 episode
265
, there are several changes:

The
Konoha
-nin behind
Tajiki
's comrade has a scar under his left eye. In the manga, none is present.

When
Guy
 and
Lee
 attack
Haku
 with the
Leaf Coiling Whirlwind
 in the manga, Lee is on the right and Guy is on the left.
 In this episode, they are reversed.

In the manga, when Mū is detected by Gaara's
Concealed Sand Picture Cat
, sand rises up from the ground and encircles Mū's foot.
 In the anime, sand is instead seen blowing about on the battlefield.

In
Shippūden
 episode
267
, there are a few changes:

The
Gold and Silver Brothers
 are depicted without the plating on the bridge of their noses.
