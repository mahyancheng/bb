The
Dustless Bewildering Cover
 technique utilises
water
 vapour to bend the light around the user essentially making them invisible.

This technique allows the user to completely erase their presence, causing them to have neither a physical form nor detectable chakra while the technique is active. As such, they cannot be detected through
traditional means
 such as chakra detection or through heightened senses.

Trivia

Mū's mastery of this technique helped earn him the moniker "Non-Person" (
無人
,
Mujin
,
Viz:
 Null Man).

The latter half of the jutsu's name plays on
meisai
 (
迷彩
), meaning "camouflage".
