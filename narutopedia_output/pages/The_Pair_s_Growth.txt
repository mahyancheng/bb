 My, How They've Grown!!) is chapter 246 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Naruto
 and
Sakura
 must once again take one of two bells from
Kakashi
. Since there are only two of them this time (a fact that devastates Naruto and Sakura), there are no underlying lessons of teamwork. Because Naruto and Sakura are no longer fresh
genin
, Kakashi does not read his new
Icha Icha Tactics
 book and immediately uncovers his
Sharingan
. Naruto once again attacks before being given permission, though he is not as easily subdued by Kakashi this time. The contest continues into the night but Naruto and Sakura cannot get close enough to Kakashi. Naruto opts for a trick; he threatens to spoil the ending of
Icha Icha Tactics
, forcing Kakashi to shut his ears to avoid hearing it and his eyes to avoid reading Naruto's lips. This creates an opening for Naruto and Sakura to take a bell.
