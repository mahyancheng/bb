This was a team from
Kusagakure
, which consisted of
Karin
, Shigeri and an unnamed male teammate. Karin's
healing ability
 proved to be beneficial enough that her weaker teammates would often take advantage of her for it.

They took part in the
Chūnin Exams
 held in
Konohagakure
, progressing to the second stage in the
Forest of Death
, where they were given an Earth scroll and began the exam from gate 25.
 After this point, Karin was separated from the rest of her team and attacked by a bear, but she was saved by
Sasuke Uchiha
. The team ultimately failed the second stage.
