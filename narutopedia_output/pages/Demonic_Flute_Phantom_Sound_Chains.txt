This
genjutsu
 is performed with a flute. Because it is transmitted via sound, it is effective against long ranges, working even on those whose location the user does not know. Whoever hears the flute is subjected to an illusion of their limbs being bound, preventing them from being able to move. They are also subjected to morbid visions, weakening them mentally until they finally lose consciousness.
 When
Tayuya
 performs this with her
Demonic Flute
 against
Shikamaru Nara
, Shikamaru envisions himself on a barren landscape strewn with partial skeletons, his arms and legs restrained by ropes suspended from the ceiling. In the manga, he is forced to watch as his flesh seemingly melts from his bones;
 in the anime, it is the entire limb that melts, bone and all.

However, the sound can be blown away by powerful
Wind Release
 techniques. Tayuya acknowledges Wind Release users are her natural enemy because of this.

After acquiring Tayuya's DNA,
Kabuto Yakushi
 is able use this technique through his
Strange Transmission Distant Shadow
. After it is performed with a flute made of
bone
,
Sasuke
 and
Itachi Uchiha
 envision themselves on a vast floor of skulls, from which emerge snakes that coil around their arms and torso.
