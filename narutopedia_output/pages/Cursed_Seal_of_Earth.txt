The
Cursed Seal of Earth
 is one of the strongest of
Orochimaru
's cursed seals, the other being its counterpart: the
Cursed Seal of Heaven
.

Appearance

It consists of three slightly curved lines, which spread in a rip-like pattern. The seal is located on the upper portion of Kimimaro's chest over his
manubrium
. When the first level is activated, the seal turns orange-red and expands in lines spreading all over Kimimaro's body in contorting and parallel lines. When the second level of the seal is active, Kimimaro takes on a dinosaur-like appearance complete with a tail. Several large bones also protrude from his darkened skin and gains four distinguishing figures: two dark black curved like markings under his eyes - one under each eye and two as elongated eyebrows - one above each eye.

Usage

This cursed seal is particularly strong even amongst the other already powerful cursed seals with
Kimimaro
 being the only known user and with the Cursed Seal of Heaven standing as its only equal. Like all cursed seals, Kimimaro receives increased chakra levels, physical capabilities and his ninjutsu skills become more effective when the seal is active. The second level also increases his healing might, as his torn flesh was instantly restored upon his transformation.

Kimimaro must enter his second level in order to properly use the
Dance of the Clematis: Flower
, due to the resultant weapon's size and density.
 In his second level, he can also merge with the bone blades created by his
Dance of the Seedling Fern
, allowing him to launch a deadly surprise attack at his target's blindspot.
