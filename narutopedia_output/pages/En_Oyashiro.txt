This article is about a kekkei genkai collector. For a shinobi of the Tsuchigumo clan, see

En Oyashiro
 (
御屋城エン
,
Oyashiro En
) is a
shinobi
 and arms dealer from the
Chinoike clan
. He would occasionally attend the
Coliseum
 as a patron in order to collect
kekkei genkai
.

Background

As a member of the
Chinoike clan
, Oyashiro lived in the
Valley of Hell
 with his wife and daughter,
Chino
. Although their clan had been able to live in the valley peacefully for many years, being constantly in such close proximity to each other eventually caused disagreements between clansmen to erupt into violence; only Oyashiro and Chino survived. Oyashiro regretted his role in the deaths of his clan, especially his wife's, and wished for Chino to grow up to be better than he was. To that end, he took advantage of Chino's young age by concealing his relationship to her, instead telling her that he had her entire family killed so that she would become the last possessor of the
Ketsuryūgan
, and thus a valuable commodity.

Oyashiro took Chino from the Valley of Hell and started making a career for himself as an arms dealer. He trained Chino to be a combination of bodyguard and means to resolving "business disputes". He also began collecting young children with
kekkei genkai
 such as
Fūshin
, adding them to his bodyguard retinue and providing them the care they needed. After a few years in Oyashiro's service, Fūshin fled with Chino and the other children in his collection; although Oyashiro claimed to feel betrayed, he was glad that they were forging out on their own.

Fūshin went on to form the
Lightning Group
, which targeted Oyashiro a number of times and forced him to withdraw from public appearances, instead sticking to his various secret hideouts. He would still sometimes attend the
Coliseum
 when he learned of a kekkei genkai user competing there, hoping to win them for himself.

Personality

Oyashiro is a greedy and eccentric individual who only cares about collecting kekkei genkai owners in exchange for money. Oyashiro found it to be easy to kidnap small children, to keep up his habits compared to kidnapping adults. He would raise these children into growing up as violent and merciless shinobi to increase the powers of their abilities, as well as make them more impressive to his potential clients. His cruel treatment towards his victims caused him to become a target of hatred from them and they envisioned getting revenge on him, but he finds these feelings unworthy. Oyashiro seems to care less about his status as a criminal and he retorts at Sasuke for once being one when the latter criticised him for exploiting people. Orochimaru comments that En is hopeless when it comes to Chino, his precious daughter, whom En would go at great lengths to protect. It is also commented by Orochimaru that, despite seeming to mistreat her, En is a doting parent to Chino.

Oyashiro's Ketsuryūgan.



As a member of the Chinoike clan, Oyashiro possesses the
Ketsuryūgan

medical ninjutsu

Blank Period

Sasuke Shinden: Book of Sunrise

Main articles:
Sasuke Shinden (novel)
 and
Sasuke Shinden (anime)

Oyashiro learns that
Sasuke Uchiha
, the last possessor of the
Sharingan
, is going to compete in the
Coliseum
. Oyashiro decides to take part and enters
Futsu
 in a fight against Sasuke. Futsu loses, which, per the rules of the Coliseum, means that Oyashiro must forfeit ownership of Futsu to Sasuke. Sasuke declines to take Futsu, instead asking Oyashiro what he knows about
Fūshin
. Oyashiro complies.

Despite Oyashiro's attempt to characterise himself as a compassionate caretaker of Fūshin, Sasuke criticises him as being an exploitative child slave owner. Oyashiro doesn't feel it's appropriate for Sasuke to be finding fault considering that he's made no attempts to help any of the slaves competing in the Coliseum. Sasuke concurs, so challenges Futsu to a rematch. Sasuke beats Futsu again, as well as all the other competitors who challenge him, thus winning their freedom. Oyashiro is amused by Sasuke and so tells him Fūshin's last known location in the
Land of Water
. In the anime, Oyashiro provides the information about Fūshin as thanks for Sasuke's help in stopping an attack by exploding humans.

The Coliseum is later raided by
Chino
 (Sasuke in the anime) and its patrons are all arrested; Oyashiro is able to escape unnoticed. He meets up with
Orochimaru
 afterwards, noting how proud he is with how Chino has turned out. Because his arms dealing business has been brought to an end by the raid, he muses about converting the
Valley of Hell
 into a hotspring as his next enterprise.

Trivia

Oyashiro derives from the Japanese shrine
Izumo Ōyashiro
, which is known for matchmaking for business and personal success.
