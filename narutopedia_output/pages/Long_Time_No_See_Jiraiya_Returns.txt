Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto

attempts
 to wake
Ebisu
 to no avail and demands to know the identity of
his attacker
. The man introduces himself as the Toad Sage of
Mount Myōboku
 and the author of the
Icha Icha
 novels. Recognising the books as
Kakashi
's favourite novels, Naruto declares the man to be a "
Perverted Hermit
" instead and demands that he take Ebisu's place as his teacher. Though the man refuses and leaves, Naruto is impressed by his skill and pursues him. Naruto catches up with the sage as he is being rejected by a woman, but he traps the boy in a jar and escapes once more. Naruto finds the sage again as he is daydreaming outside of town, and after his
Transformation Technique
 fails to fool Naruto, he tells the boy that he will train him in exchange for bringing him curvy "fruit". Having misunderstood the innuendo, Naruto later approaches the sage with a watermelon as he is attempting to impress two women. The man explains that he actually desires an attractive woman and Naruto responds by using his
Sexy Technique
. Thoroughly impressed, he says he will train Naruto provided he remains in that form, but then admits he was kidding when the boy protests.

Under the sage's supervision, Naruto resumes his
training
, but fails to stand on the hot spring water and removes his wet clothing in frustration. Recognising Naruto's
seal
 as the work of the
Fourth Hokage
, the Toad Sage secretly
removes
 the
Five Elements Seal
 preventing Naruto from efficiently controlling his
chakra
. With this impediment removed, Naruto happily walks across the water without trouble. The sage decides that it is time to teach Naruto to control the
Nine-Tails
' chakra, but insists they stop training for the day and head to the hot springs for a bath. Later that night, as Naruto sleeps, Ebisu approaches the Toad Sage and identifies him as Jiraiya of the
Sannin
, one of the few who can stop
Orochimaru
.
