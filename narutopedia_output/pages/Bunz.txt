Part I

Search for Tsunade






Senta and Bunzo beg Naruto for help.



He, along with his partner
Senta
, were sent to collect money
Tsunade
 owed their boss. To blackmail her, they stole the
First Hokage's Necklace
, believing it still belonged to Tsunade.

However, it really belonged to
Naruto Uzumaki
, who fought them to get the necklace back. Afterwards, they explained their position and Naruto agreed to help collect on Tsunade's debt. Ironically, they later find out Tsunade had paid their boss back his money when she and Shizune had visited their village one year before.
