Strong Fist
 (
剛拳
,
Gōken
) is Guy's and Lee's characteristic fighting style, the purpose of which is to cause external damage and break bones. It is the exact opposite of
Gentle Fist
 which is used mainly by the
Hyūga Clan
.
 This style of fighting involves smashing your opponent and is generally used only by extremely physically powerful and dominating shinobi. As shown by Sasuke's initial usage of this style, the user must be exceptionally conditioned or even a brief performance in this style will quickly exhaust and strain the body. It was only after a month of training that Sasuke later became able to use this style unhindered.

Trivia

Sasuke and Kakashi do not actually practise this style, but they use the key elements and a few techniques that were copied with their
Sharingan
 from Rock Lee and Might Guy.

Naruto uses this style in
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2
 as "Taijutsu Naruto", in
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3
 as "The Green Beast" and in
Naruto: Shippūden

episode 186
.

Naruto and Kakashi also imitate this style in
