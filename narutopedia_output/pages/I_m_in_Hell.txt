"
I'm in Hell
" (
オレは地獄に居る
,
Ore wa Jigoku ni Iru
) is episode 345 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Obito
 is tended to by two
artificial

humans
, who help in his rehabilitation, while also telling him about
Madara
's goal and annoying Obito with potty humour. Through months of intense rehabilitation while also recalling his time training with both Kakashi and Rin, Obito recovers and gets used to his new artificial body parts including his new right arm. One day, White Zetsu arrives with news of Obito's teammates being in danger, surrounded by
Kirigakure
-nin. When Obito fails to break through the rock blocking the exit, Guruguru offers himself as an armour for Obito.
 Obito draws power from the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 to break the rock. Madara tells Obito he will properly thank him in the future, and that Obito will come back to him despite Obito insisting that he's leaving for good. On his way to the battle site, Obito has a vision of
Rin
 through his empty eye-socket but simply dismisses it as nothing. He arrives just in time to see
Kakashi
 run his
Chidori
 through Rin's chest with Rin whispering Kakashi's name before she dies. Rin's death awakens both their
Mangekyō Sharingan
. Kakashi passes out, and Obito proceeds to massacre the Kiri-nin. Somehow, Obito manages to draw an enormous power from within himself, using
Wood Release: Cutting Technique
, and while manipulating his new Mangekyō, seems almost impossible to beat. After the last Kiri ninja falls, the remaining ninja having been impaled on trees that he created, Obito disregards an unconscious Kakashi on the ground, and tends to Rin. Deactivating his Mangekyō, Obito stares at the scene and while grieving for Rin, grimly concludes that he is in Hell.

Trivia

In the original Japanese TV broadcast and streaming simulcast, the climactic battle was censored, with several seconds of gore cut and some sound effects muted. The footage was restored in the DVD release.
