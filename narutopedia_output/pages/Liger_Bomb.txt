The
Liger Bomb
 is a certain-kill technique used by the
Fourth Raikage
.

Usage

After covering himself in his
Lightning Release Chakra Mode
, the Fourth Raikage grabs his opponent and lifts them high up into the air. Then, using his extreme strength, he smashes them head first onto the ground in what resembles a powerbomb manoeuvre. This is devastating enough to shatter a large area of the ground itself on impact.
Darui
 noted that nobody has ever survived this attack before, and had
Sasuke Uchiha
 not used his
Susanoo
 to cushion the impact, he would have been killed by it. The impact of this technique was strong enough to snap the ribs of Sasuke's Susanoo.

Trivia

As with many of the techniques of
Kumogakure

shinobi
, this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation. Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as
Raiga Bakudan
.

"Liger Bomb" is also the name of an attack used in professional wrestling, most notably by
Jushin "Thunder" Liger
. A Liger Bomb is, a sit down variation, of the common
powerbomb
. The nintaijustu used by
A
 is the same manoeuvre
Batista
 utilises as his finisher, calling it the "Batista Bomb".
