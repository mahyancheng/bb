Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Unable to escape from the
visions
 that
Itachi
 placed on him,
Naruto
 mentally pleads with
Sakura
 or
Kakashi
 to free him from the
genjutsu
. He is then released by Sakura and
Chiyo
. Kakashi tells Naruto to stay alert, while he rushes towards Itachi. Itachi uses
Fire Release: Phoenix Sage Fire Technique
, which Kakashi is able to zip through and avoid. Itachi launches his
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
 at Naruto, Sakura and Chiyo, and all three manage to avoid its path. Kakashi attempts to hit Itachi with his
Lightning Cutter
, but Itachi is able to jump into the air and evade the attack. However, Naruto attempts to hit Itachi in mid-air with his
Rasengan
. As Naruto makes contact, it turns out that that Itachi is a
shadow clone
.

Kakashi uses the
Hiding in Mist Technique
 that he copied from
Zabuza
 years ago to shroud the environment. Itachi claims it useless as his
Sharingan
 can still see through the mist, and attempts to hit Kakashi with his Fireball Technique. Kakashi muses that something is off about Itachi, and goes under the ground in an attempt to use
Earth Release: Double Suicide Decapitation Technique
, but Itachi manages to avoid Kakashi's attack. Holding Kakashi in place, Itachi attempts to cast a genjutsu on Kakashi. The Kakashi in his grip, however, is a shadow clone, that now has a hold on Itachi. Kakashi tells Naruto to hit both his shadow clone and Kakashi. Since Itachi was able to counter his Rasengan, Naruto recalls his training with
Jiraiya
, in which Jiraiya reminds him that Rasengan is a jutsu created by the
Fourth Hokage
, and that Naruto should use his unique
chakra
 to improve and create his own unique Rasengan, which would be the most powerful technique in his arsenal. Naruto decides now is a good time to use it, and thus, using a shadow clone, rushes at Itachi and the Kakashi shadow clone with his
Big Ball Rasengan
. The attack hits Itachi, but Itachi smirks at Naruto right as he is hit. Sakura and Chiyo marvel at the destructive power of Naruto's technique.

After the technique subsides, the four are surprised to see that the dead body in front of them is not that of Itachi's, but of
Yūra
, an
Anbu Commander
 and a
Jōnin
 from
Sunagakure
. After
Guy
 uses his
Morning Peacock
 to destroy
Kisame
,
Team Guy
 is surprised that the corpse lying in front of them is not that of Kisame's, but that of a stranger dressed in the
Akatsuki
 cloak. Guy reaffirms his original feeling that he has never met the man lying in front of them before.
