Pain
 allocates a portion of an individual's
chakra
 to a living human sacrifice. This causes the sacrifice to become the individual's identical copy, complete with perfect imitations of the original's
kekkei genkai
 (such as the
Sharingan
) and unique weapons (such as
Samehada
). The original controls their copy remotely, thus making the copy's movements and knowledge indistinguishable as well. However, the copy is limited by how much of the original's chakra they are given, so particularly chakra-taxing
jutsu
 cannot be used. Once the chakra from the original runs out, the sacrifice reverts to their own appearance and they die.

Pain uses the Shapeshifting Technique to make
Yūra
 into a copy of
Itachi Uchiha
 and
Mukade
 into a copy of
Kisame Hoshigaki
. The copies are given 30% of their original's chakra and are used to delay
Team Kakashi
 and
Team Guy
.
 Despite the copies supposedly being exactly the same as their original,
Kakashi Hatake
 notices something different about the copy of Itachi, though he doesn't realise why until after the Shapeshifting Technique has ended.
