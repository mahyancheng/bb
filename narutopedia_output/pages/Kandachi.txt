Kandachi
 (
カンダチ
) was a
missing-nin
 from
Amegakure
 and was
Hanzō
's right hand man, before the latter's death.

Background

Sometime after
Pain
 killed Hanzō, Kandachi and a group of Ame ninja fled the country and went into hiding by taking over a village surrounded by a magnetic force that affects a person's chakra flow to the brain similar to
genjutsu
.
Sukune
 interfered with Kandachi's takeover and resulted in his brutal murder by his summon, the
Conch King
. He held the women and children hostage and threatened if word of their hiding was leaked outside the village, the hostages would be killed.

Personality

Kandachi was overconfident in his abilities. He thought that even a
Sannin
 like Jiraiya was no match for him. He was also very cruel.

Abilities

As the right hand of Hanzō, he was quite a skilled
shinobi
.

Ninjutsu






Kandachi using Conch Cannon.



Like his superior, Kandachi fights mainly using the
Summoning Technique
, commanding his personal summon: the Conch King with hand seals. Through this he could give the Conch King a signal to use
specified

techniques
 or to move. Kandachi has also shown capable of using
Water Release
 enabling him to
hide
 in water and cast
genjutsu
 on his opponent through the Conch King. The magnetic field caused by the tree strengthens this genjutsu, as the magnetism disrupts a person's chakra flow, similar to genjutsu.

Part II

Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha






Kandachi puts Jiraiya and Naruto under the Conch King's genjutsu.



When
Jiraiya
 brought
Naruto Uzumaki
 to the forest for training, they encounter
Tanishi
 who tells them of Kandachi's takeover. Naruto (disguised as Tanishi) and Jiraiya, pretending to be captured, meet with Kandachi, surprised to see Jiraiya again. Naruto's cover is blown when the real Tanishi arrives and Kandachi decided to let the Conch King eat the villagers. Naruto fights against Kandachi and the Conch King but their techniques knock Naruto down every time. In the end, Naruto defeats them both with his first
Big Ball Rasengan
.

Trivia

It can be assumed that Pain eventually found and killed Kandachi and his henchmen as Pain killed all friends, family, and associates of
Hanzō
 according to an Ame ninja,
Ryūsui
.
