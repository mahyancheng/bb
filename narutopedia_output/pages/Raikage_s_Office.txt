The
Raikage's Office
 is located in the tallest tower of
the village
 and has the kanji for "
Lightning
" (
雷
,
kaminari
) on the front. It also has a boxing bag and a painting with the kanji for "muscle" (
筋
,
suji
) across the chair that the
Raikage
 sits. The
Fourth Raikage
 has a tendency of bursting out of the windows and walls, rather than using the doors, something that
Mabui‎
, his assistant, reprimands him for.
