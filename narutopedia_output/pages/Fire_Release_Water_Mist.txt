Kakashi creates a bird of
flames
 under his complete control that quickly flies into a designated
water
 source, burning hot enough to cause the water to evaporate. The bird disappears as soon as the water is gone. Alternatively, the bird can release streams of fire from its mouth for offensive purposes.

Trivia

When
Nanara
 pretends to be a ninja, this is among his favourite techniques to use.
