Summary

Kiba
 is carried away to recover. Before leaving, he pleads with
Hinata
 to forfeit if she is matched against
Gaara
 or
Neji Hyūga
. Hinata and Neji are paired together for the eighth preliminary match, and Hinata does not take Kiba's advice. Cousins, Neji and Hinata are members of separate houses of the
Hyūga clan
, which Neji resents. He ridicules Hinata for being weak and thus undeserving of her superior standing within their family and tells her to give up. He analyses her personality shortcomings and deems her a failure, which almost brings her to tears. Upset by Neji's words,
Naruto
 encourages Hinata to defeat him.
