Toroi

Toroi
 (
トロイ
) was a famed
Kumogakure

shinobi
.

Background

In the anime, it was stated that Toroi was partnered with
Osoi
. On one of their missions, Osoi died, but it was reported that he fought to the end. At some point after his death,
Orochimaru
 desired to reincarnate Toroi but ended up reincarnating Osoi instead.

Personality

Toroi is described as being cautious, careful and discreet.

Appearance






Toroi's full appearance.



Toroi had tan skin, a rather broad face with chiselled features, characterised by a strong cleft chin and a pair of prominent sideburns that descend from his medium-length, dull-purple coloured hair. He wore the standard Kumogakure outfit and
forehead protector
, as well as a long scarf wrapped around his neck. He has always been seen with his sealing parchment held in his mouth.

Abilities

He was a renowned shinobi whose skills earned him enough fame during his lifetime that
Kabuto Yakushi
 eventually chose to
reincarnate
 him to fight for
Akatsuki
, during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. During battle, to keep the use of his hands free, Toroi had a tendency to carry his
scroll
 in his mouth. His skills in bukijutsu were held in high regard by his fellow Kumo shinobi, as even his own partner stated he "couldn't hold a candle to Toroi", and while under the impression Musai and Nonota had defeated him themselves several of their allies were amazed.

Ninjutsu

Shurikenjutsu






Toroi's distinctive fighting style.



He possessed several distinctive square-shaped
shuriken
 in various sizes, which were kept
sealed
 within a scroll when not in use. Due to the considerable quantity and/or dimensions of these tools, he often fought with a scroll held between his teeth, so as to retain the use of both hands. Also, to increase the amount of shuriken that could be thrown consecutively, Toroi would thread a substantial number of them along a length of rope, in such a manner that he could launch the entirety with just a single swing.

Nature Transformation

Toroi possessed the
Magnet Release

kekkei genkai
, which he used together with a selection of metallic weapons, in particular, his shuriken. By
magnetising
 these tools, Toroi could produce a powerful magnetic field within any other object that came into contact with them, which would then attract other magnetic objects towards the target, dramatically increasing the chances of a successful follow-up attack. However, the magnetic force that is generated, lessens with each transfer.

In the anime, during Kabuto's transformation into his final form seen in the war, Toroi's body was summoned alongside those of the former Five Kage, Akatsuki members and Jinchūriki. In preparation for the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Toroi is
reincarnated
 by
Kabuto Yakushi
 to fight against the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, before being mobilised alongside
Gari
,
Pakura
,
Haku
 and
Zabuza Momochi
. Separating from this group at some point during their relocation, Toroi is later discovered trailing
Musai
 and
Nonota
, with numerous
shuriken
 in hand and
scroll
 in mouth. Identified by the Kumo-nin, who attempts to alert his ally to the best method to not fall victim to his
Magnet Release
, Toroi goes on the offensive.

Despite the pre-emptive warning, the unaware Suna-nin still falls foul of the
attack
 and is evidently terrified as the details of the technique are disclosed. Prepared to conclude the battle using even larger shuriken, Toroi is ambushed from behind by
Naruto Uzumaki
 wielding a
Rasengan
, before being
sealed
 by the previously panic-stricken Suna-nin.

Later, with the release of the Impure World Reincarnation technique, a light of sorts encased Toroi's sealed body as the technique was dispelled and his soul was returned to the
afterlife
.
