Unique to
Samurai
, this technique employs the concept of
chakra flow
 in a similar manner to the
Flying Swallow
 and
Sword of Kusanagi: Chidori Katana
 techniques. Through the use of chakra flow, the user channels their
chakra
 through their swords, extending both the reach and cutting ability of the blade, while allowing the user to
fire crescents of chakra
 whenever the blade is swung. This released chakra is capable of great destruction, as shown from how these projectiles completely penetrated a considerable stone pillar, before continuing to damage the immediate surroundings.

The samurai have also shown the ability to use
shape transformation
 during the implementation of this technique, sculpting their respective chakra blades into various rudimentary weapons that extend beyond the natural dimensions of their original swords; such as broadswords,
spiked shafts
 and even axes. This capability allows them to rely on smaller swords reminiscent of
wakizashi
, while attaining greater reach, damage and the possibility of conducting surprise attacks as necessary.

This transformational quality also appears to extend to even the crescents of chakra launched from the blade, forming a diverse range of projectiles that includes giant
buzzsaws
 and shafts of chakra, the shape of which are seemingly dependent on the structure of the previously formed weapon.

Trivia

In the anime, the group of samurai who initially demonstrate this technique are never depicted employing shape transformation unlike in the manga, instead retaining just a simple aura of chakra that surrounds their blades for the entirety of their short confrontation with
Sasuke Uchiha
.
