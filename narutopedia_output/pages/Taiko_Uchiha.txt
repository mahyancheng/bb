Taiko Uchiha
 (
うちはタイコ
,
Uchiha Taiko
) was a character in
Jiraiya
's novel within
Tsunade
's
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 dream.

Personality

Taiko believes that by harshly punishing criminals and villagers, the motivation for further crimes gets prevented early, thus justifying his ruthless behaviour towards thieves, but also defenceless villagers. Like a lot of his comrades, he thinks that
Fugaku Uchiha
's policies are too soft and favours his admired lieutnant
Sasuke Uchiha
's harsh methods. His loyalty to his clan led him to violate the
Hokage
's orders and even threaten his
wife
. Taiko justifies his actions by believing it is for the sake of the Uchiha clan.

Appearance

Taiko has black hair which is tied to a ponytail at the back of his head. He wears a black shirt with the Military Police Force's emblem on the back, black shorts with a
shuriken
 holster on his right leg and bandages under it. He also wears black gloves, dark blue sandals and a blue
forehead protector
. On the back of his waist, he carries a
sword
 with him.

Abilities

Being a member of the Military Police Force, Taiko is either a skilled or at least promising
shinobi
. The fact that he used a sword against Kushina implies skills in
kenjutsu
.

Taiko and his comrades threaten Kushina Uzumaki.



Taiko and his fellow comrades notoriously established order in
Konohagakure
 under the orders of his lieutenant Sasuke, with Taiko enjoying the villagers' fears a lot. However, when he violently attempted to arrest an old woman, he was interrupted by the Hokage's son
Naruto Uzumaki
. Seeing his lieutnant being intimidated by his old friend's newly acquired strength, Taiko tried to ask him about what to do, to which Sasuke ordered him to act more independently.
Soon Taiko and his fellows realised that letting the Hokage's son go led to the Police Force losing respect among the villagers, so they took it upon themselves to break into the Hokage's home to settle things, which ended in a failure and was deemed by the Police Force's leader Fugaku an "idiotic behaviour". All the while, Taiko assured to have acted for the clan's sake before being brought into custody. Some time later, while Konohagakure was
imprisoned
 by
Nagato
, Taiko was ordered to secure the civilians alongside the rest of the Police Force.
