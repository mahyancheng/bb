Nauma had short, light brown hair. He also had a scar on the right side of his forehead and another two scars, one on each lower cheek with the one on his right cheek in the shape of an "x". He wore a purple long sleeved shirt and green pants along with the Twelve Guardian Ninja waistcloth being around his waist.

Abilities






Nauma's destructive capabilities using Limelight.



As one of the Twelve Guardian Ninja, he was one of the strongest shinobi in the
Land of Fire
, powerful enough to be chosen to be the direct guard of the daimyō. He has an elemental affinity for
lightning
. When in the four cardinal directions he, Kitane, Tōu, and Seito use a jutsu called
Limelight
 to reduce everything within that area to ash.

Part II

Twelve Guardian Ninja






Nauma and the other Twelve Guardian Ninja revived.



His, Kitane's, Tōu's, and Seito's corpses are stolen by
grave robbers
, and later revived with the use of lightning. After being revived all four of them were approached by Asuma Sarutobi who had figured out the scheme of the robbers. There he tries without luck to stop the latter three who seems to have become mindless puppets. He started walking towards an unknown point emitting large amounts of lightning, only to arrive and prepare his part of the Limelight technique. When Kitane was killed by Asuma, Kazuma's plan failed and he decided to release the summoned Nauma, Tōu, and Seito.
