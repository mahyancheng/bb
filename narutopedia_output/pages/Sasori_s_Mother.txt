This article is about Sasori's mother. For the puppets modelled after Sasori's parents, see
Mother and Father
.

She was a
kunoichi
 of
Sunagakure
. She was also the mother of
Sasori
 and the daughter-in-law of
Chiyo
.

Background






Sasori's parents bid farewell to their son before heading out.



She and
her husband
 were killed by
Sakumo Hatake
 during a war,
 leaving Sasori in the care of his grandmother
Chiyo
 for much of his childhood. After learning the
art of puppetry
, Sasori created
puppets
 with their likeness, in the hopes that doing so would help him feel loved. Because they were still only puppets, this failed, and Sasori lost interest in the two and left them behind when he defected from
Sunagakure
.

Appearance

She had long dark brown hair and brown eyes. She was shown wearing a long, loose-fitting green garment and a poncho-like item over it. As a kunoichi, she is seen wearing a sleeveless and collared black shirt with bandages wrapped around her waist.

Legacy

With his departure, the puppets came into the possession of Chiyo, who once used them against Sasori, and ultimately to their current wielder
Kankurō
.
