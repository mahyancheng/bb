A collaboration technique being used by
Jiraiya
,
Fukusaku
 and
Shima
.



Cooperation ninjutsu
 (
連携忍術
,
Renkei Ninjutsu
), also called
collaboration techniques
 (
コンビ術
,
Konbijutsu
,
English TV:
 collaboration jutsu) in the anime, is the combination of two or more
jutsu
 to create a new jutsu with a strength greater than the sum of its components. This "strength" can be measured in terms of the new jutsu's range or destructive power.

Cooperation ninjutsu are rarely explored in the series. Although there are numerous examples of characters working together and/or jutsu being performed in combination,
Kiba Inuzuka
's partnership with
Akamaru
 being a prime example, these are never labelled "cooperation ninjutsu" and do not seem to exactly fit the definition. The few explicit examples are typically combinations of
nature transformations
, where one nature is used to make another nature even stronger, such as the
Scorch Release: Halo Hurricane Jet Black Arrow Style Zero
, a combination of
fire
 and
wind
.

The anime explores cooperation ninjutsu during the
Three-Tails' Appearance
. During the arc, Jiraiya states that cooperation ninjutsu requires synchronisation between those whose jutsu are being combined. This synchronisation can be achieved either through familiarity with each other or mere like-mindedness. For example, because both
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Gamatatsu
 are "simple", they are ideal collaboration partners.
