This article is about Midori from Kusagakure. For Midori from the video game, see

Midori
 (
ミドリ
) was a
chūnin
 from
Kusagakure
.

Personality

Midori seemed to be very confident in his own abilities, and showed no arguments in using underhanded tactics to help his sponsor to win a bet. However, when his partner was brutally murdered in front of him, he attempted to flee in cowardice, screaming and begging in futility.

Appearance

Midori had long grey hair and his sideburns went down into a beard. He kept his hair in a pony tail in the back and he also wore a pair of reddish-coloured glasses with black lenses. He wore a black Kusagakure bandanna-styled
forehead protector
 which was tied in the back. He wore a big white jacket with a white shirt underneath it and a very light bluish-coloured scarf around his neck with one end of the scarf hanging down the front of him. The scarf had orange lines on it. His jacket was held closed with strings.

Part I

Chūnin Exams

Main article:
Chūnin Exams

Midori and
Shiba
 observe the final round matches of the
Chūnin Exams
 in
Konohagakure
. When the match between
Sasuke Uchiha
 and
Gaara
 is about to begin, they approach Gaara as he heads to the arena (in the anime, they are sent by a
daimyō
 they were hired to guard). Many daimyō place bets on the matches and, as such, Midori and Shiba try to coerce Gaara into throwing the match so that bets on Sasuke can pay out. Gaara is insulted and promptly kills them both, soaking his
sand
 in their blood. Killing Midori and Shiba quenches Gaara's blood-lust, causing him to ignore
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Shikamaru Nara
 when he runs into them shortly afterwards.

Trivia

Midori (
緑
) means "green". This could be a reference to his home village.
