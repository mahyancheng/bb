The
Kazekage's Office
 is where the
Kazekage
 conducts his administrative duties. It contains their office, the meeting chamber of the
Sunagakure

Council
 which also houses the large statues of the previous Kazekage, for which reason the chamber is considered sacred and violence within it is therefore prohibited.
 It is a large, round, sandy coloured building with several rows of windows and the kanji for "wind" (
風
,
kaze
) painted on the side of the building in a circle. The top of the building is flat and tiled much like the roof of part of the
Ninja Academy
 where the
Hokage
's office is with a water tower to one side. In the anime, it was also shown that it also houses a
puppet
 workshop that
Kankurō
 uses.
