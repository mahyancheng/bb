While spinning through the air, a
ninken
 starts urinating, scattering the urine across a wide area. Any opponents that the urine sprays are likely to be confused, embarrassed,
 and, if it gets in their eyes, temporarily blinded until they can flush it out.
 More useful to the ninken and their
Inuzuka
 partner is that they can easily track the urine's scent, allowing them to locate anyone who has been marked by the urine regardless of where they are or where they go.
 This is an essential prerequisite for the
Fang Wolf Fang
, which makes users so fast that they can't see where they're going, necessitating that they locate targets by scent instead.

Akamaru
 is quite skilled with this technique, becoming very accurate through practice with
Kiba Inuzuka
.

Trivia

chapter 14

ninken
