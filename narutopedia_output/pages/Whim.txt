Viz:
 On a Whim…!!) is chapter 307 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Sasuke
 asks where
Kakashi
 is, so
Yamato
 explains that he is Kakashi's stand-in. Sasuke concludes that
Sai
 is therefore his own stand-in, and repeats Sai's claim that he wants to restore the bond between himself and
Naruto
. He laughs at the idea, but
Team 7
 realises they were wrong to doubt Sai and accept his help with bringing Sasuke back to
Konoha
. Sasuke has no interest in returning, so suggests killing Naruto to make things easier.
