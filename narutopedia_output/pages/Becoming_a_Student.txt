"
Becoming a Student
" (
弟子入り
,
Deshiiri
) is episode 200 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Katasuke
 observes
Kawaki
's treated wound, which he has fitted for a prosthetic.
Naruto
 questions if he can't restore his arm, but Katasuke denies it, as the technology at his disposal isn't as advanced as
Kara
's, so making a prosthetic for Kawaki will take time. Naruto suggests using one of the prototypes made for him. Katasuke explains prosthetics are made to react to the wearer's
chakra
, so Naruto decides to keep constantly moulding chakra while he's awake to keep it functioning. He dismisses Kawaki's concern by pointing out the situation is an example of chakra as a connecting force.
Boruto
 comments on how cool it looks and jokes about wanting one. Kawaki offers to blast off his hand, wondering if it would get rid of Boruto's
Kāma
. Boruto explains he was joking while Naruto and Katasuke laugh.
Amado
 finishes performing maintenance on
Boro
's body, who complains about it.
Delta
's
drone
 arrives and connects to a terminal. Amado enters a command, and the terminal downloads her consciousness into one of two spare Delta bodies.
 She kicks open her container, breaking the lid, cursing at Naruto and disparaging Amado. Boro teases her about her defeat. Delta recounts the events for Boro and
Code
, who are surprised that Kawaki protected Naruto's daughter.
Jigen
 quells the discussion, and reminding he told her to follow
Koji
's lead, asks where he is. She answers he's still in
Konoha
 laying low, and that he allowed Konoha to take Kawaki to gather more intel on Boruto Uzumaki, who also has a Kāma. The revelation surprises everyone. She adds that both Boruto and Kawaki got a power boost when their Kāma resonated. Jigen considers
Momoshiki
's final act. Naruto discusses Kawaki with
Sasuke
,
Sai
, and
Shikamaru
. Sasuke agrees that keeping Kawaki away from Kara is a priority, but Shikamaru won't budge on Kawaki having a security detail assigned to him. He tasks
Konohamaru
 with keeping an eye on Kawaki. Koji keeps watching the Uzumaki household through his
toad
. Kawaki asks Naruto why he's doing so much for him. Naruto says it's hardly anything considering he saved
Himawari
, and adds that Kawaki reminds him of himself. Kawaki asks to be taught
ninjutsu
, which Naruto agrees. He also begins gluing Himawari's vase back together. While training Kawaki, Naruto, Boruto, and
Mitsuki
 consistently have to remind him not to use
scientific ninja tools
 or rely on his Kāma. Sasuke prepares to train
Sarada
 to learn the
Chidori
, and gives her a demonstration. Boro overhears Code and Amado, learning that there is a traitor, and offers to kill everyone and assemble new Inners. Sarada practices the Chidori, and is given pointers by Sasuke before he is summoned by Sai. She runs into Boruto, Kawaki, and Mitsuki, who are buying
Extreme: Shinobi Picture Scrolls
 cards. Boruto is sullen for getting another card of his father, and Kawaki gets a rare
Fourth Hokage
 card, which he offers to trade with Boruto. At night, while Naruto is sleeping, Kawaki finishes fixing the vase, but discovers a leak when he pours water in it. He means to go outside to look for a missing piece, but
Kurama
 manifests itself, telling Kawaki not to leave Naruto's side.
