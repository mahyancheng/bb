Personality

Like his teammates, Benten is obsessed with becoming powerful by gaining vast wealth with the Tsuchigumo clan's
kinjutsu

Benten has a very androgynous appearance, even to the point where
Chūshin
 quips that whenever Benten opens his mouth, it looks and sounds strange due to his masculine voice and feminine appearance. Benten has brown eyes and black medium hair with red highlights on his frames and an hair ornament of a bell chime attached from behind. He also wears pink lipstick in addition to his feminine appearance. Benten wears a teal blue and light violet jacket with an opened collar and brown pants with shinobi sandals.

Being a part of the Magaki Group, he specialises in
cooperative techniques
 and, alongside
Nangō
 and
Chūshin
, plays the role to
transfer
 his chakra to
Akaboshi
 in order to increase the deadliness of his attacks. In combination with his teammates, he can use a supplementary techniques like a
team transformation
,
shattering barriers
 or
restraining
 enemies with a shadow-rope, but also a variety of aggressive techniques like a restraining technique in a
small
 and a
larger
 scale, a
pyramid
 that explodes by will, killing the one's trapped inside and also a deadly
Lightning Release

Impermanence of Worldly Things

Part II

Six-Tails Unleashed

Akaboshi, Benten, Nangō, and Chūshin make for
Mount Katsuragi
 in search of the Tsuchigumo clan's kinjutsu. They manage to destroy the barrier around the mountain and make their way up. They could not find the jutsu anywhere and ran into
Tonbee
, whom the group defeated quickly. They discover that
Hotaru
 has the technique and they begin searching for her.






Benten and his team use the Hurricane Thunderclap.



Later, Benten and his comrades are seen receiving new orders from a mysterious man. After meeting with their leader, the four-man team encountered
Utakata
, who single-handedly bested the group until they caught him in their
barrier technique
.

After this, the group headed to the Tsuchigumo Village, where they ambushed Hotaru with the help of the villagers in the hopes of getting the kinjutsu. However, the scroll that
Nangō
 hands
Akaboshi
 turns out to be a rigged trap, which explodes, allowing Hotaru to escape. Benten and the team pursue Hotaru, and, just after catching her, are interrupted by Utakata, who claims to have business of his own with Hotaru.

After Utakata escaped with Hotaru, Benten and the rest of his squad were confronted by their leader, who showed them that Utakata was a
missing-nin
 from
Kirigakure
 with a bounty of 50 million ryō. Akaboshi asked their leader what they should do, to which he began to muse about.






The Magaki Group ambush Naruto.



Later, when
Naruto Uzumaki
 sought out
Shiranami
, the Magaki leader, who believed the latter was an ally, Benten and his comrades ambushed Naruto and used
Infinite Embrace
 to drain his chakra. While Chūshin beat Naruto, Benten almost revealed their plan before Akaboshi silenced him. Angered at being deceived, Naruto unleashed his Nine-Tail chakra and broke out of the Infinite Embrace. Though shocked at Naruto's strength, the Magaki used their
Multiple Infinite Embraces
 to crush Naruto. Much to their shock, however, Naruto was still able to resist. Before they could do anything else, Utakata appeared and performed
Acid Permeation
. He angrily demanded that the Magaki tell him where they took Hotaru, while intimidating them with his Six-Tail chakra. Sensing that they were at risk, Akaboshi ordered Benten and the others to retreat and regroup with Shiranami at the Tsuchigumo village.

At night, when Utakata and Naruto returned to the Tsuchigumo village, it was revealed that the Magaki had taken control by hypnotising all the villagers. Benten mocked them for falling for the trap so easily. Just before things got worse, the rest of
Team Yamato
 arrived while hunting for Hotaru. Benten and the others than engaged them in battle. Benten and his group try to kill Team Yamato with their
Impermanence of Worldly Things
, but fails and Benten ends up getting knocked out by a punch from
Sakura Haruno
.
