Summary

Zabuza
 tries to kill
Naruto
 but is stopped by
Haku
, who asks that he be allowed to fight him by himself. Zabuza agrees. Naruto, planning to help
Sasuke
, enters the ice prison, in the process becoming trapped just like Sasuke. The two try to attack Haku but their efforts are quickly neutralised because of Haku's extreme speed. Haku asks that they stop trying to escape since he has no interest in killing them. He will if he needs to if it means preserving his dreams of being useful to Zabuza. Worried about what will happen to Naruto and Sasuke, Kakashi prepares to fight Zabuza so that he can provide assistance.
