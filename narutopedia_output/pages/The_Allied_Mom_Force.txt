Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Ebisu
 gathers the remaining personnel in
Konohagakure
 to prepare for the eventuality of an attack, but the mothers of the
Allied Mothers Force
 reassure him that they were ready to defend the village. Throughout the day,
Konohamaru
, who is intent on
protecting
 the village, receives intel from the other children in the village about people lurking in the surrounding forests. This however, seemingly turns out to only be a travelling circus, until a group of
Sumo Wrestlers
 attempts to attack the village. They are, however, unceremoniously defeated by the alliance of mothers and later Konohamaru who finishes them off with a
Rasengan
.

Trivia

When the Allied Mothers Force confronted the Sumo Wrestlers, one of the mothers bore a striking resemblance to
Tenten
. Whether or not she is Tenten's mother is unknown.
