Fuen uses this
scroll
 as a medium for her
terrain-altering technique
. After the rock is summoned, Fuen can control the rock by changing her picture, allowing her to insert traps or create tracking mechanisms represented by red dots on her drawing. She can also use it as a medium for Fudō's
Earth Release: Mutability
 technique.
