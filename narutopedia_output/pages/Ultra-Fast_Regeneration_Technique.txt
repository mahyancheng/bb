The user gathers a large quantity of
chakra
 to rapidly regenerate any damage done to the body.

Usage

Mukade utilises this technique with his unlimited resource of Ryūmyaku chakra, repairing any and all damage done to his
puppet
 body, and resealing his ultimate form's weak point should it be exposed, allowing him to recover from fatal wounds and severe chakra drainage. So long as he has enough chakra, he is near immortal.
