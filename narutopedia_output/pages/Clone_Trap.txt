The
Clone Trap
 is a technique that uses an
earth clone
 to restrict an opponent's movements.

Overview

When an opponent is prepared to land a physical blow, the user quickly creates an earth clone to take the hit instead. The earth clone will then revert to mud, which uniquely hardens to restrain the opponent's limb as the rest of their body is spread with
cursed seals
. However, it can be overcome with enough willpower.
