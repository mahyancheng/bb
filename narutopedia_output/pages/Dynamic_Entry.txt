This is a flying kick directed at an opponent, typically their face. The kick serves two simultaneous purposes: as a surprise attack,
 for which reason the user may first throw a
kunai
 to distract targets from the approaching kick;
 as an act of self-sacrifice, with the user's exaggerated stance, confident expression, and the sheer inconceivableness of the attack combining to intimidate the opponent, in the process enhancing the kick's offensive potential. Because the kick's effectiveness very much relies on appearance, any faltering of resolve will weaken it: when
Might Guy
 realizes mid-flight that he's attacking
Jiraiya
, an ally, his surprise causes his kick to do less damage than it otherwise would have.
