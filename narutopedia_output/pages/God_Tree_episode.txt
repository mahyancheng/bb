Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Sentimentally lost in thought, proud of
his son
's growth,
Minato
 notes that Naruto's presence gives off a sense of confidence that with the two of them side by side, there's nothing that couldn't be accomplished. Familiar sensation indeed, reminiscent of the times spent together with
his late wife
. On the verge of tears, mumbling his desire to spend more time together with his son, as there's much more to tell him, Minato is pulled back into reality by his son's words, assured that true men know each others' feelings without verbal exchange. As Minato mans-up, the gravity of the situation once again becomes apparent, when Naruto enters
Tailed Beast Mode
, rushing in carelessly, only for
Tobirama
 to sarcastically confess his confidence in Naruto's mental capability, remarking that Naruto wouldn't forget only
senjutsu
 was effective against the
Ten-Tails
'
jinchūriki
, Tobirama's doubts proven just, as Naruto starts to panic. With
Kurama
 unable but to laugh at the situation, proclaims how Naruto has effectively surpassed the previous
Hokage
, in a way, dumbness. Having to remind its jinchūriki of the instance when its chakra and Naruto's Senjutsu chakra mixed together while facing
Nagato
, the fox tells him that it is now possible to combine
Sage Mode
 with
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
.
 The other half of Kurama inside Minato tells him that he can enter Tailed Beast Mode as well, to provide powerful support for his son. Thanks to Tobirama's
mark
, Naruto and Minato manage to land an
attack
 on
Obito
, who barely defends against it through a combination of
chakra arms
 and
black substance
. In order to destroy the black matter, Naruto and Minato prepare a
natural energy
-infused
Tailed Beast Ball
, while Obito decides to kill two birds with one stone by releasing the Ten-Tails, both defending himself from their attack and further progressing
the plan
. As the Ten-Tails' body turns into a massive tree, the
Six Red Yang Formation
 is released, so its branches can go after every member of the
Shinobi Alliance
, to suck out their chakra, with
Gyūki
 telling B how this was the Ten-Tails' final form. As
Hashirama
 observes the horrors, shocked,
Madara
 explains the situation by narrating a tale of the shinobi's origins. Madara reveals that he discovered this through the
Uchiha Stone Monument
 and such discovery had showed him the worthlessness of reality, with mankind forever cursed to hate and kill each other. As the scenery changes over to Obito's location, he stops the branches of the tree, satisfied enough seeing the Alliance on the breaking point, tells them to lay down quietly, since they had endured enough, with their misery to soon be over as the flower atop the tree blooms, almost ready to cast the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
.

Trivia

When Minato goes into
Tailed Beast Mode
 and jumps to aid Naruto, his right arm is restored for a second before it disappears again.
