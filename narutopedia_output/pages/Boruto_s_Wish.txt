 anime.

Synopsis

Sarada
 watches in disbelief as
Mitsuki
 attacks
Boruto
. Boruto loses consciousness, and dreams of Team 7. Sarada updates
Shikadai
 on what happened, while
Inojin
 and
Chōchō
 look around for enemies, concerned about the enemy's strength. One of the defeated
Akuta
 manages to reform itself. Sarada thinks they should return to
Konoha
, despite the punishment for leaving, so they can report what they know. However, Shikadai wants to continue into the
Land of Earth
, because the situation with the Akuta is something he believes will threaten the peace. The reformed Akuta takes a liking to Inojin, so Shikadai thinks it should join them for the moment, as it's evidence of what has been happening, and it's not being aggressive towards them. Since it likes Inojin, he's picked to keep an eye of the Akuta. Boruto continues to dream of his friends, but
Garaga
 intrudes on it to remind him of the agreement between them regarding Mitsuki. Garaga chases Boruto, who is taken away by Mitsuki. Inojin tries bonding with the Akuta, drawing birds for it to chase, but has to intervene when it tries attacking a rabbit.
 In his dream, Boruto feels the pain where Mitsuki attacked him, and Mitsuki's words encouraging to keep running away make him realise he's dreaming. In his dream, Garaga berates Boruto for clinging to his friends, and running away from betrayal without learning anything. Boruto realises something, thanking Garaga for making him realise it, and wakes up. Shikadai asks for his opinion on their next step. Boruto still wants to go after Mitsuki. Boruto plans on asking
Ōnoki
 for help, recalling his
invitation
 to visit him if he's ever in the Land of Earth. They continue their way to the Land of Earth.
