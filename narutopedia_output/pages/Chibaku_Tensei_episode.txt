Chibaku Tensei

) is episode 167 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

After
Hinata
 is seemingly killed by
Pain
,
Naruto
 becomes enraged, causing Naruto to transform into his
four-tailed
 form. The
Nine-Tails
 then conjures a
twister
, which Pain is able to nullify with his
Shinra Tensei
. The Nine-Tails is able to break the very earth up and hurl it at Pain, who is able to evade most of it, although he suffers a punch from the four-tailed Naruto and is subsequently buried by the debris. Pain emerges, and Naruto's transformation escalates, causing him to grow two more tails and gain a skeletal appearance. Pain proceeds to destroy the ground beneath them, unleashing the water beneath.

In his six-tailed form, the Nine-Tails continues his assault on Pain, firing
Continuous Tailed Beast Balls
 which Pain manages to deflect with Shinra Tensei. The
tailed beast
 then decides to stop its attack; as Pain wonders if that is all the beast is capable of, the Nine-Tails takes advantage of Pain's five-second interval to fire more Continuous Tailed Beast Balls, striking Pain. The
First Hokage's Necklace
 attempts to
restrain
 the Nine-Tails' chakra and revert the transformation, only for the Nine-Tails to rip the necklace off and destroy it. The beast then lunges towards Pain, who attempts to repel him with his Shinra Tensei; however, the attack has no effect and the Nine-Tails is able to strike Pain once more. Hinata, who is revealed to be still alive, mutters Naruto's name as the battle ensues around her. The Nine-Tails fires a
Tailed Beast Ball
 at Pain who attempts to counter it with
Banshō Ten'in
, causing an explosion.

Kō
, using his
Byakugan
, alerts
Sakura
 that Naruto has entered into his six-tailed form; Sakura and
Katsuyu
 decide to have the other villagers evacuate
Konoha
 since Naruto cannot control his transformation. Outside the village,
Yamato
,
Sai
 and
Anko
 are on a mission to find
Kabuto
 when Yamato sees a kanji burn on his hand. Realising that Naruto has entered into his six-tailed form and that the necklace is destroyed, Yamato abandons the
team
, telling them that an emergency has sprung up and that he must return to Konoha immediately.

Meanwhile, Pain begins to flee from the battleground as the six-tailed beast chases him. The Nine-Tails fires its
Nine-Tails Beam
 at Pain, who shields himself with Shinra Tensei. Back in his tower, Nagato muses that the
Deva Path
 is finally close enough for him to use
Chibaku Tensei
. Using the very earth itself, the
Deva Path
 creates a moon-like sphere, which draws in the six-tailed Naruto and traps him within; the technique, however, causes Nagato to begin bleeding from his nose.
Konan
 asks Nagato why he would create such a large orb as Nagato reminds Konan that their opponent is the Nine-Tails, and that he had to use such measures in order to capture the beast. Enraged, the trapped beast grows an eighth tail and begins to break out of the sphere. Within his subconscious, a troubled Naruto muses how he did not have an answer to Pain's question on how to obtain peace, while the Nine-Tailed Fox convinces him to release the
seal
 that binds him, claiming that once he is given total rein over Naruto's body, he would help him by killing those who have caused Naruto pain. Naruto, under the influence of the fox, is about to sprout his ninth and final tail as Yamato, who is alerted by the kanji on his palm, wonders how Naruto's transformation had progressed that far. Naruto succumbs to the Nine-Tails' will and attempts to rip off the seal and free the fox, only to be stopped by the
Fourth Hokage
, who dispels the fox's influence on Naruto and greets the boy by name.
