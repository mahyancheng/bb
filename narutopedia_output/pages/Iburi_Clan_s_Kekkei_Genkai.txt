This unique
kekkei genkai
 is possessed by the members of the
Iburi clan
, which allows them to turn their bodies, either partially or fully, into smoke to serve various purposes. While in their smoke form the user becomes impervious to damage and can use this trait to gain an opportunity in battle, for example by allowing weapons to slip through them without any effects. However, if needed, they can still interact with physical objects.
 In their smoke form, they're also capable of entering a person's body, effectively possessing them. While taking someone over, they're capable of controlling their physical actions and experiencing all of their sensations, such as tasting the food they eat. The ability can also be used offensively by entering the opponent's body to
oxidise them from inside
. According to
Yukimi
, the ability manifests itself greater when the clan member is younger. An individual who does not possess this kekkei genkai can temporarily gain the ability to transform into smoke by transfusing the blood of a young clan member.





Gotta dies from being dispersed by the wind.



Initially, the clan members did not have complete control over this ability, resulting in them transforming into smoke without intending to do so, or causing their smoke forms to dissipate instead of returning to human form. Their ability was partially stabilised, however, through the application of one of
Orochimaru
's
cursed seals
 on each clan member. While transformed, they are vulnerable to wind, as dispersion while in their smoke form is fatal.
