Kagen Uchiha
 (
うちはカゲン
,
Uchiha Kagen
) was a member of
Konohagakure
's
Uchiha clan
.

Background

Kagen worked for the
Konoha Military Police Force
's logistical department, which meant he never had an opportunity to awaken the
Sharingan
. This, combined with the fact that Kagen was of unremarkable talent and had no close relatives, made him the perfect target for
Root
. Root killed Kagen and had the twins
Gozu
 and
Mezu
 — both surgically altered to look like him — split responsibilities of impersonating Kagen in order to spy on the Uchiha clan.
