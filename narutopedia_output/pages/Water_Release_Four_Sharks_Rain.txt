Kisame slams his palm onto a nearby water surface, sending a large surge of water into the air. This water then forms into a group of four
water sharks
, which then rush towards the target from above. Should these sharks be attacked, the water that composes them simply reforms into countless droplet-sized sharks, which continue to rain down upon the target and inflict damage whenever they come into contact with them.

Trivia

This technique's name is likely a reference to "Ameshikō" (
雨四光
), a high-scoring hand in
hanafuda
 involving one rain card and three bright non-rain cards.
