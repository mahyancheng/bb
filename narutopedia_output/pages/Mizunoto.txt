Mizunoto
 (
癸
) is a former member of
Konohagakure
's
Anbu
 faction
Root
.

Background

In the anime, to prevent
Hiruzen
 from being reinstated as
Hokage
,
Danzō
 gave Mizunoto and nine other Root members a mission to assassinate him. Disguised as a foreign
shinobi
, he fought the Anbu accompanying his target, who turned out to be a disguised
Kakashi
, resulting in the mission's failure.

Personality

Like all other Root Anbu, Mizunoto is unwaveringly loyal to Danzō. He also looks out for his best interest, voicing concern that all the citizens of Konoha would die leading Danzō's goal of becoming Hokage pointless.

Appearance

Mizunoto is a tall shinobi, with black hair tied in an elaborate top-knot. He wears a typical Anbu cloak. His mask is unusual in that it has two colours in it, with dark teal, dot-shaped eyebrows, and a red, sharp-toothed mouth.

Abilities

As an Anbu, Mizunoto is a presumably a powerful shinobi. He also wields a
sword
 which indicates him being skilled in
kenjutsu
. Danzō had enough faith to assign him and nine others to assassinate Hiruzen, and though this ended in failure, Mizunoto managed to survive in a battle against the famed Kakashi.

Part II

Pain's Assault






Danzō instructing Root to not assist the village.



When
Pain
 attacked Konoha, Danzō instructed Mizunoto and the rest of the Root Anbu to not assist the village until the chaos died down. Mizunoto, however, questioned Danzō's instructions saying that it would be pointless if he were to become Hokage if all of Konoha's citizens were dead. Danzō responded that most of the villagers will be
safe
 and that it was all for
Tsunade
's era to end.

As ordered, he and the other Anbu remained underground while the battle ensured.

Trivia

"Mizunoto" (
癸
) is the tenth sign of the Chinese calendar.

Mizunoto's name was only divulged in a Studio Pierrot Settei of Root members.

During his début in the anime, he was depicted with brown shaggy hair and again in
episode 197
. His appearance was corrected in the
Kakashi Anbu Arc
 with his entire attire including his coat and mask being changed to match his manga appearance.

His mask is used in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
 as a customisation item for characters.
