" (
相容れない想い
,
Aiirenai Omoi
) is episode 253 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Team 7
 approaches the
Funato
 fleet.
Ikada
 is notified, and allows them to approach.
Boruto
 comments that it's one of
Kajiki
's ships, which he lent them when they said they wanted to meet with Ikada. Ikada destroys the ship with a
waterspout
,
Mitsuki

pulling
 Boruto and
Sarada
 onto the Funato ship.
Kirigakure
 listens in on their conversation from afar. Ikada tells Boruto not to ask for anything ridiculous, threatening to kill them. Boruto wants the Funato to stop the war, and
Araumi
 laughs. Boruto explains he spoke with
Chōjūrō
, who agreed to stop fighting if the Funato stop as well. Araumi and Ikada both can't take the
Mizukage
 at face value.
Misuno
 isn't surprised by their lack of cooperation, but Chōjūrō says they promised Team 7 some more time. Araumi says they won't leave the ship alive, and leaves to attend another matter. Ikada assures them he intends to fight until one side goes down. Boruto reminds him of his dreams of building a big ship, sailing the world with it, connecting islands and people by trading goods.
 Ikada says those dreams died with
Seiren
, and manifests several waterspouts around the ship.
Metal
 informs his
team-mates
 and the
swordsmen
 that Team 7 went aboard a Funato ship, and they get concerned.
Buntan
 thinks joining up with them is the best way to get revenge on the Funato. Ikada blames them for the death of his sister,
brother
, and
Funamushi
, and claims that even if Kirigakure is destroyed or they die, his hatred will never be abated. He says that Seiren always protected him, and that he felt inferior for being the only one in his family without powers, claiming that wanting to become a shipbuilder was an excuse he tried making himself believe. Now that he has power, he will use it to lead the Funato and destroy Kirigakure. The waterspouts subside, the Funato's mobile fortress arrives, the
Shinonome 1
 in firing range of its charging
Chakra Cannon
. Araumi takes a boat to the mobile fortress, which
Kawaki
 notices. Sarada and Mitsuki tell Boruto he's tried more than enough. Boruto says he understand how Ikada feels, recalling his own feelings about
Kagura
's death, and once again asks to end the war. Ikada hits him, telling him he's abandoned the past. Sarada says they're also putting side the feelings of losing people dear to them to stop the war, and Mitsuki adds that there are people who need the Shinonome 1. Ikada calls
Kobuna
 in to confront Boruto. Boruto comments on how Kobuna is like him when he lost Kagura, Ikada saying Kobuna will never abandon his hatred until he kills Boruto. Ikada claims he'll put his sword away if Boruto brings him the Mizukage's head. Kawaki spies on Araumi, having followed him to the chakra cannon on the mobile fortress. Boruto can't do what Ikada asked, but offers up his own life instead.
