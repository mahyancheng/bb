 manga.

"
Meeting!!
" (
対面!!
,
Taimen!!
)

The
Deva Path
 is defeated.
Naruto
 removes its
black receivers
 to make sure it cannot be controlled remotely again and then uses one of them to confirm
Nagato
's location. The
Konoha
 villagers are informed of Naruto's victory, some of which run into Naruto during their own search for Nagato. They offer to help him kill Nagato, but Naruto tells them not to. Despite all he has done, Nagato's death would not solve anything. They trust Naruto to figure out what to do with Nagato.

Chapter 444

"
The Answer
" (
答
,
Kotae
)

Naruto
 meets
Nagato
, who makes one last attempt to capture him, but in his emaciated form he cannot overpower Naruto. Naruto says that although he couldn't forgive Nagato for his crimes, he wished to talk with him before deciding how to proceed. Since they were both students of
Jiraiya
, Naruto asks how Nagato could so completely abandon Jiraiya's philosophies about peace. Interested in seeing how Naruto's views differ from his own, Nagato explains how
Konoha
 ninja killed his defenceless parents when he was a child. Overcome with grief, Nagato awakened his
Rinnegan
 to avenge them.

Chapter 445

"
Top of the World
" (
世界の天辺
,
Sekai no Teppen
)

After the death of his parents,
Nagato
 wandered
Amegakure
 to look for food, something that was in scarce supply due to the ongoing
Second Shinobi World War
. When he was about to die of starvation he was found by fellow war orphans
Konan
 and
Yahiko
. They saved him and became a sort of family, but they could not escape the terrible realities of the war. Upset by the constant deaths, Yahiko vowed to someday rule the world to establish peace, a philosophy Nagato also adopted.

Chapter 446

"
I Just Want to Protect Those Two
" (
ただ二人を守りたい
,
Tada Futari o Mamoritai
)

After the
Second Shinobi World War
,
Jiraiya
 began training the
Ame Orphans
. Although it was partially to help them look after themselves, it was also to teach
Nagato
 to take advantage of his
Rinnegan
. Since Jiraiya wished for peace, he hoped Nagato, having the same eyes as the
Sage of the Six Paths
, could unite the world just as the Sage had. Nagato and the other orphans accepted this quest when Jiraiya left them and spent their adolescent years preaching an end to war.
Hanzō
, leader of
Amegakure
, interpreted this as threat to his rule and kidnapped
Konan
. He then gave Nagato a choice: kill
Yahiko
 or sacrifice Konan. So that Nagato would not need to make the choice, Yahiko killed himself, entrusting Nagato with their dreams of peace. Having lost a friend, Nagato concluded that diplomacy would be useless in obtaining world peace.

Chapter 447

"
Believing
" (
信じる
,
Shinjiru
)

With
Yahiko
, the apparent leader of the
Amegakure
 peace-seekers, dead,
Hanzō
 tried to eliminate
Konan
 and
Nagato
. Nagato protected Konan, called upon the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 and bonded with the statue. Afterwords he slaughtered Hanzō's men and tried to kill Hanzō too, but Hanzō escaped. Nagato severed his ties with
Amegakure
 and adopted the alias of
Pain
, setting him upon the path to peace by world domination. His story done, he asks how
Naruto
 would have done things differently. Naruto replies that he completely understands Nagato's reasoning but that he cannot accept it. Adopting
Jiraiya
's philosophies for himself, Naruto makes not killing Nagato his first step to achieving peace.

Chapter 448

"
Memento…!!
" (
形見…!!
,
Katami…!!
)

Nagato
 rejects
Naruto
 and
Jiraiya
's dreams of peace without casualties, believing human nature renders such a dream impossible. Naruto says he will end the cycle of hatred that curses this world, a quote from Jiraiya's
The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi
. Amazed, Nagato remembers that the main character of the book, "Naruto", was based on him. Naruto is not only named after the character in the book, but he has adopted the character's beliefs, which themselves were the philosophies of Nagato. Because Naruto has chosen to carry the burdens of the world by himself, Nagato decides to put his faith in Naruto and the very ideas he once abandoned.

Chapter 449

"
Flowers of Hope
" (
希望の花
,
Kibō no Hana
)

To help
Naruto
 bring peace to the world,
Nagato
 revives everyone that died during his invasion of
Konoha
. The surviving villagers witness Nagato's change-of-heart firsthand and, by extension, Naruto's victory over
Pain
.
Kakashi
 is resurrected just as his conversation with his father ends, allowing
Sakumo
 to move on with the knowledge that his son is not ashamed of him. Nagato dies because of his technique. He uses his last breath to warn Naruto that the path he has chosen will not be easy, but that Naruto is the only one who can walk it.
Konan
 takes Nagato's body and the
Deva Path
 with her back to
Amegakure
, vowing the village's allegiance to Naruto since he now carries the dreams of her friends.

 is also left in a coma as a result of overexerting herself in the village's defence, forcing the
Fire Daimyō
 to select a new
Hokage
.
Kakashi
, one of the more recent notches of Hokage trained by other Hokage, is considered.
Danzō
 claims that Kakashi and all of the previous Hokage have not been heavy-handed enough in dealing with foreign powers, resulting in Konoha's destruction. The daimyō accepts his reasoning and appoints Danzō as Sixth Hokage.

Chapter 451

Dealing with Sasuke!!
" (

)

 begins to rebuild.
Naruto
,
Sakura
, and
Kakashi
, thinking about
Tsunade
, reunite with
Inari
 and
Tazuna
, who came to repay the debt they gave to the
Land of Waves
 by helping rebuild. After Naruto uses analogies to prevent the two knowing about what happened to Sasuke, he reflects on how
Sasuke
 relates to his new philosophies about pain, vengeance, and peace. Thinking of
Jiraiya
 and
Nagato
, he concludes that he finally understands how Sasuke feels about losing bonds. Because of this, he now knows how to reform the original
Team 7
, making his teammates happy. Meanwhile,
Team Samui
 arrives in Konoha to deliver the
Fourth Raikage
's message.
Danzō
, the new
Hokage
, accepts the Raikage's resolution and takes it one step further by ordering Konoha ninja to kill
Sasuke
 if the opportunity presents itself.
Kiba
 later informs Team Kakashi about this.

Chapter 452

Under Pressure from Danzō!!
" (

Danzō
 instructs
Sai
 to keep an eye on
Naruto
, needing to keep him,
Konoha
's hero, in check if he is to be accepted as
Hokage
. When Sai goes to meet Naruto and
Sakura
 they ask him about Danzō, hoping to find some way to persuade Danzō to spare
Sasuke
. Though not aware of Danzō's new orders about Sasuke, Sai cannot help them because of his
Root
 membership. Members of
Team Samui
 overhear them and ask what they know about Sasuke, wishing to know how to kill Sasuke for the crimes he has committed.

Chapter 453

"
The Eve of the Five Kage Summit…!!
" (
五影会談前夜…!!
,
Gokage Kaidan Zenya…!!
)

While
Taka
 is heading to
Konoha
 they are met by
Tobi
. Tobi informs them that they are wasting their time since Konoha has already been destroyed. What's more, they failed to capture the
Eight-Tails
 and thus are still indebted to
Akatsuki
. To reach a compromise, Tobi sends them to the approaching
Kage Summit
 so that Sasuke can kill
Danzō
, the new
Hokage
 and a conspirator in the
Uchiha clan
's assassination. In Konoha,
Sakura
 is brought to tears by
Team Samui
's requests to give them information that will be used to kill Sasuke.
Naruto
 offers to tell them what they need so that Sakura doesn't need to, adding that they can still save
Killer B
 if they act soon.

Author's Note

“

Ever since I wrote in the author's note of the previous book,
volume 47
, "the finale having been settled, I am drawing full steam ahead," lots of folks have been asking me, "Is the series ending soon?" but it is simply that the premise has been set; it will keep going for a long, long time! I shall not stop drawing at full steam, so please continue enjoying
Naruto
 until the end!
