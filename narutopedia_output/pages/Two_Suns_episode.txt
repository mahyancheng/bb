"
Two Suns!!
" (
二つの太陽!!
,
Futatsu no Taiyō!!
) is episode 283 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

A
 remains adamant that he will not allow
Naruto
 or
B
 to pass despite the flashbacks B shows him. While stopping Naruto from passing, A simultaneously foils B's attacks. Calling to
Tsunade
 to aid him, he is shocked when the
Hokage
 takes the side of the
jinchūriki
. B is finally able to take A down with a
Lightning Release: Lariat
, and as he tries to explain their rationale to him A remembers the words of his
cousin
. Questioning Naruto directly, the young man tells A all about what his
mother
 and
father
 had done for him to enable him to reach so far — citing them as the "two suns" in his life. Knocking B aside, A charges his
Lightning Release Chakra Mode
 to full power and prepares to attack Naruto once again. Naruto, however, is able to bypass the Raikage, earning him the right to continue on to the battlefield as A was now satisfied with the young man's growth. Meanwhile at headquarters,
Shikaku
,
Mabui
 and a
Katsuyu
 clone go over all the intel they had in an attempt to find a way to deal with the
White Zetsu Army
. Elsewhere,
Tobi
 prepares his own version of the
Six Paths of Pain
 technique using the
reincarnated
 jinchūriki, noting that his plan would soon come to fruition.
