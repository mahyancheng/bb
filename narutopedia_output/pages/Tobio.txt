Prologue — Land of Waves

Tobio was in the same graduating class as the members of the
Rookie Nine
. He was first seen in the class talking about aiming and throwing ninja tools. While fooling around in his seat, not knowing that
Naruto
 is perched right behind him, he bumps into Naruto and accidentally knocks him into
Sasuke
, causing Naruto to kiss Sasuke. This upsets many of the girls in the class, including
Sakura
 and
Ino
, who wanted Sasuke's first kiss to be with one of them, and as a result, they beat Naruto up for it, despite it not being his fault.
