Monzaemon Chikamatsu
 (
近松モンザエモン
,
Chikamatsu Monzaemon
) was the inventor of the art of puppetry. Originally using puppets as a source of entertainment, Chikamatsu worked diligently with several shinobi to convert the talent into a unique form of combat. Eventually, he created the
Puppet Technique
, in which chakra strings are used to control puppets.

Background

Being the creator of the technique, Chikamatsu was the very first
shinobi
 puppeteer, and as such he created the
White Secret Technique: The Chikamatsu Collection of Ten Puppets
. The puppets, reportedly strong enough to take down an entire castle, were designed to work together and, as such, were much more powerful than the standard puppet. One such example was the puppets' use of
Three Jewels Suction Crushing
, which consisted of the combining of three puppets to create a vortex that sucked in everything in range.

Each of the ten puppets were controlled by a single chakra string from one of the user's ten fingers. It is unknown how
Chiyo
 acquired them, but she was skilled in their use, as seen when she used them in her battle against
Sasori
.

Personality

Chikamatsu found entertainment in using puppets, and worked diligently to convert this art for shinobi combat.

Abilities

As the very first puppeteer, he was a master in this field, able to create a
fighting style
 that outlives generations of
shinobi
 and became a solid part in the modern shinobi world. He was probably in possession of dozens of puppets he created himself and controlled them with
threads made out of chakra
. A testament to his craft, he created what was to be known as the
Chikamatsu Collection
. This collection of ten individual puppets were created with their own special abilities and equipment. Together, they were able to take down an entire castle and even
Sasori
's
Hundred Puppet Army
.

Trivia

Monzaemon Chikamatsu is based off of a famous Japanese playwright with
the same name
, widely regarded as the greatest playwright in Japanese history. He wrote both for the puppet theatre
jōruri
 and the life-action theatre
kabuki
, and is often called the Japanese Shakespeare.

It was thought that the inventor of the
Puppet Technique
 was Monzaemon Chikamatsu, originally using it for entertainment purposes, and he worked diligently with other shinobi to convert the theatrical art into a unique form of combat. However, the seventh
guidebook
 claims that this technique originated from the
Ōtsutsuki clan
.
