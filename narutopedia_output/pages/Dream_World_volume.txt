 manga.

Chapter 598

"
Shattered!!!!
" (
粉砕!!!!
,
Funsai!!!!
)

Charging forward,
Naruto
 attacks
Tobi
 using a giant
chakra arms
 which Tobi simply phases through, chiding the boy of thinking that he could defeat him on his own. As
Guy
 tries to snap
Kakashi
 out of the shock brought on from Tobi's revelation, they see the masked man send three giant
shuriken
 hurtling towards Naruto from the
other dimension
. Catching two of them on his tentacles, one of
B
 and
Gyūki
's tentacles is cut by the third but is stopped by Naruto who retorts Tobi's earlier remark by telling he's never truly alone as he has
Kurama
 and the others supporting him. Now motivated by Guy to act, Kakashi notes that he had to time the next use of his
Kamui
 perfectly, despite Tobi chastising his "
borrowed power
" and stated intentions of showing him Kamui's true potential. Acting immediately, Tobi jumps into the air and sends out a number of
chakra receiver stakes
 which pierce B and Gyūki. Warning Naruto not to let them touch him as it sealed off the
tailed beasts
' power, Naruto creates a
shadow clone
 while being protected by Gyūki. While a clone charged forward with the
Rasengan
, the original prepared the
Tailed Beast Ball
. As the clone prepares to attack, Kakashi seemingly warps away the Rasengan again while Tobi — seeing the same attack pattern — decides to attack the clone with one of the stakes, rather than having him go through him. With the clone seemingly dispelled, Tobi phases through the Tailed Beast Ball, and fully enters the other dimension. There, Tobi is shocked to see Naruto and realises that Kakashi had warped the clone there to wait for him. Declaring that he had nowhere to run, Naruto slams the Rasengan into Tobi's face, shattering the mask with Naruto asking his enemy who he is.

Chapter 599

"
Obito Uchiha
" (
うちはオビト
,
Uchiha Obito
)

Arriving late for the
Academy
 entrance exam,
Obito Uchiha
 is stunned to see the huge crowd of young
shinobi
 present. After exchanging glares with
Kakashi Hatake
, Obito is given his entrance papers by
Rin Nohara
. During the
Chūnin Exams
, after arriving late for the second round of the exam which was to take place in the
Forest of Death
, Obito, alongside his teammates Kakashi and Rin, faces off against
Might Guy
,
Ebisu
 and
Genma Shiranui
 in a group battle. Wanting to impress Rin, Obito moved to the fore and prepared to attack the group with a
Fire Release
 technique, but the sweet he had been given by the elderly lady whom he had helped with her luggage had slipped down his throat. Guy used this opportunity to unceremoniously kick Obito — unknowingly saving his life in the process. After receiving medical attention from Rin, the two converse, with Obito indicating his pride in being a member of the
Uchiha clan
 and expressing the wish to become
Hokage
. Training arduously for the third round of the Chūnin Exams, Obito later faces Guy in the individual matches, but is quickly defeated despite expressing his confidence in winning prior to the start of the match. As Rin cheers Kakashi on when he defeats Guy in a subsequent match, Obito appears jealous and resigned over Rin's lack of reciprocation of his hidden feelings. After becoming a
chūnin
, Obito is approached by Rin, and intends to confess his feelings for her, only to become too embarrassed and soon overlooked by Kakashi's recent promotion to
jōnin
. Shortly after, Obito
dies during a mission with his team
. But in the present day, as the mask falls away from Tobi's face, Kakashi and Guy are very shocked to see that Tobi is in fact their old comrade Obito Uchiha.

Chapter 600

"
How Come Until Now?
" (
なぜ今まで
,
Naze Ima Made
)

Shocked by this revelation,
Kakashi
 and
Guy
 started asking the once masked man whether he truly was
Obito
, but upon seeing his
Mangekyō Sharingan
, Kakashi noted that there was no doubt about it. However, Obito reiterated his point that it was insignificant what they called him, and all that mattered to him was his
Eye of the Moon Plan
. Kakashi had a flashback to the time when Obito died, and then asked whether he had survived the cave in. This led
Naruto
 to ask them who the person in front of them was. Guy answered that he was a former classmate of theirs who supposedly died during the
Third Shinobi World War
. Kakashi, still in shock, asked Obito that if he had survived then why had he not made this fact known until now. Obito retorts that whether he survived or not was unimportant. However, if Kakashi really had to have an answer to why Obito had done what he did, it was simply because Kakashi had failed to protect
Rin
. Even more devastated by this response, Kakashi asked him if he was going to blame him for it. Obito answered that he did not see any point in blaming this useless reality which would disappear soon enough. Naruto tried to rally his sensei, telling him that right now, Obito's plan needed to be stopped and that he would listen to the story later. Obito used the
Fire Release: Blast Wave Wild Dance
 technique sending a giant vortex of flames towards his opponents. Kakashi, unable to register what was happening, simply stood there despite Guy calling out to him. Naruto, however, intercepted the attacks with
Kurama
's tails. Before any side could act further, they were interrupted by
Madara
's appearance on their battlefield. Standing beside the younger
Uchiha
, the legendary shinobi remarked that Obito seemed to be having fun, much to the onlookers' surprise.

Chapter 601

"
Obito and Madara
" (
オビトとマダラ
,
Obito to Madara
)

As
Madara
 arrived on the battlefield,
Naruto
,
Kakashi
,
Guy
 and
B
 were all shocked to see the legendary
shinobi
 before them, leading them to wonder what had happened to the
Kage
. As Madara and
Obito
 casually carried on their conversation, Madara noted that the Naruto in front of them was also a clone. Madara tells the
jinchūriki
 that the Kage were probably not doing well much to the latter's enragement. Elsewhere,
Tsunade
, who had been split into two, managed to summon
Katsuyu
. Katsuyu was distressed at Tsunade's condition and immediately wanted to piece her back together. However Tsunade told the giant slug to bring the other Kage to her as there might still be time to save them. Back on the battlefield, Obito returned Madara's
gunbai
 to him in time for the famed
Uchiha
 to block a volley of
black receivers
 which Naruto had sent flying at the two of them. After hearing the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, Madara asked Obito why he started the
plan
 half-way through without the
Eight
 and the
Nine-Tails
 being captured and deemed his actions as hasty. He also accredited the
manner
 in which he was brought back to the world of the living as being due to Obito's haste and questioned him about what had happened to
Nagato
 and the
Outer Path: Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 that was supposed to bring him back. Upon hearing that they wanted to use his fellow disciple in this manner, an enraged Naruto moved to attack them with a
Super Mini-Tailed Beast Ball
. Madara, however, blocked the attack and
sent the force back
 at the clone, expelling it. Concluding the fact that the young Uchiha must have a plan, Madara moved to capture the Eight and the Nine-Tails, leaving Obito to deal with Guy and Kakashi. Kakashi used this opportunity to question his old friend about what had happened to him and Obito had a flashback of being heavily bandaged and stitched together in a place that an old and wizened Madara referred to as being between the land of living and the dead.

Chapter 602

"
Alive
" (
生きている
,
Ikite iru
)

Disoriented,
Obito
 asks
Madara
 whether he was also an
Uchiha
 after seeing his
Sharingan
, then after seeing his
scythe
, whether he was a
Shinigami
 who had come to take him to heaven or hell. Obito panics pleading to the thought-to-be Shinigami to spare him from hell because throughout his life, his actions had not been all that bad. As the young Uchiha winced in pain from his sudden movement, Madara tells him to take that pain as a sign that he was still alive, however barely. Madara then tells the young man that it was he who saved him after he appeared in his underground passage, but in return, Obito must repay him his debt. Obito, however, tells the old man that he can't stay too long for he still had friends to protect as a
war
 was still ongoing. Madara chastises Obito, telling him that with his body in the current state that it was, he could no longer be a shinobi. Dismaying, that he had finally awoken the power to protect his comrades, Madara lectures Obito about the reality of the
shinobi
 world and all its ills. Obito then notices the change in demeanour the old man had, though Obito is still adamant that he wants to leave leading Madara to state that he was free to leave, if he was able to do so. Obito then begins to wonder what an old man with a Sharingan was doing in a place such as this. He finally questions the elder on who  he was, asking whether or not he was a
missing-nin
. Madara, now seated, however, responds stating that he was "
a ghost of the Uchiha
": Madara Uchiha. In shocked disbelief, Obito states that the man before him could not be his ancestor as Madara had died during his fight with
Hashirama Senju
 decades ago. The elder explains to the young Uchiha that he escaped death and that he needs constant
chakra
 supply from the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 to survive or he would die right away. Aggravated, Obito forces himself out of bed stating that he would go back to
Konoha
. Madara then warns him that moving will probably rip off the
artificial body
 which he had to use on him. Madara repeats again that Obito needs to do what he says from now on. Obito angrily asks what Madara wants to which he simply replies that he wanted to create a perfect world, but Obito is still adamant, determined to protect his friends. Still weak, Madara explains to Obito that he will take his Sharingan if he dies trying to force himself to leave, noting that he himself was using another's eye, having left his own to someone else and the Sharingan requires two eyes to bring out their true potential. Thinking to himself, Obito states that he can't waste time, and tells
Kakashi
 and
Rin
 to wait for him as he was still alive.

Chapter 603

"
Rehabilitation
" (
リハビリ
,
Rihabiri
)

Left to the company of
White Zetsu
 and
another
 with a spiral-like facial pattern,
Obito
 becomes thoroughly annoyed at the duo, who are fascinated with how human bodily functions work — not having the need themselves to eat, drink, or even use the bathroom. Telling them not to lump him in with their lot, Obito notes that only half of him was made of artificial material. Stating that they were supposed to help Obito with his rehabilitation until
Madara
 woke up, the duo began to question Obito about why he kept repeating a
bell
 sound and "
stupid
Kakashi
" during his slumber. After explaining that the third clone had gone outside to gather information and that they were able to
move through the earth
, the two Zetsu begin to recite Madara's
plans
 for world peace. Disregarding this, Obito once again states his resolve to leave this place and join Rin and Kakashi, thus began his painful rehabilitation while remembering his time with Rin and Kakashi with his memories being trying to kiss a picture of Rin even after taping out Kakashi's face and later after training trying to give Rin a signal that he loves her, only for Obito to discover much to his annoyance that Rin was looking at Kakashi, not Obito. After one training incident that leaves Obito suffering from a wound in his hand, Rin patches him up and tells him it's not good of Obito to hide his wounds because she's looking after him. In the present and after what seems to be a fair amount of time passing, Obito, whose hair has noticeably grown longer, is able to use the artificial limbs perfectly. One day, White Zetsu returned to the hideout and alerted Obito that his comrades were in danger, surrounded by
Kirigakure
 shinobi. Leaping into action, Obito tries to break out of the cave, but only manages to crack the rock and tear off his right arm. The spiral-patterned Zetsu offers up himself as a suit of sorts and encases the young Uchiha, who prepares to head out.

Chapter 604

"
Reunion, and Then
" (
再会、そして
,
Saikai, soshite
)

Accessing the power of the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 while connected to
Hashirama's living clone
, impressing the original
White Zetsu
, a
Tobi
-encased
Obito
 is able to break the boulder used to cover one of the passage ways. An awakened
Madara
 asks whether or not the young
Uchiha
 was leaving and despite Obito thanking Madara for saving his life, Madara disregards it stating that he would be back to thank him more sincerely. With White Zetsu ready to remotely give his clone directions, Obito dons a cloak before leaving. As he rushes towards his friends' location, he receives updates about the situation, and learns that
Minato
 is not with them. The clone then tells Obito that as he was weaker than him, it would be best to let him fight in his stead, but Obito refutes this stating that
Kakashi
 had his other
Sharingan
, and his combination with him would be better. As the clone tells him about the additional benefits of having the
Senju
 and Uchiha DNA, Obito believes that it is raining before he sees giant geysers of water rising up from the earth due to explosions. Continuing to that location, Obito begins to see flashes of
Rin
 from his left eye socket with a hand running through her chest. Believing these to be nothing more than phantom images, the young Uchiha presses on only to arrive on the battlefield to see Kakashi's hand
run through
 Rin's chest.

Chapter 605

"
Hell
" (
地獄
,
Jigoku
)

As
Kakashi
 releases
Rin
 from his grip, both he and
Obito
 watch her die, causing them to awaken their
Mangekyō Sharingan
. As Kakashi passes out, Obito flies into a fit of rage and disbelief which catches the attention of the
Kirigakure
 ninja. Wooden spikes begin to grow from Obito's right side as he commences his assault. Mercilessly, Obito uses a combination of
Kamui
 and the
Wood Release: Cutting Technique
 to kill all the Kiri-nin on the battlefield. Amazed that the young
Uchiha
 could already use
Wood Release
,
Tobi
 noted that he now knew why
Madara
 had chosen the young man. Realising that they could not win, the Kiri-nin decide to pull out but not before retrieving Rin's body. Obito, who was not about to let any such thing happen, slips through several more Kiri-nin and then slaughters the ninja that had tried to retrieve Rin's body. All the while questioning where he was, a blood-spattered Obito crushes the remaining Kiri-nin between giant branches, and as he stands in a pool of his opponents' blood, comes to the conclusion that he must be in hell.

Chapter 606

"
Dream World
" (
夢の世界
,
Yume no Sekai
)

Still in disbelief,
Obito
 walks over towards
Rin
's body, with
Madara
 and
White Zetsu
's words echoing in his head.
Phasing
 right through
Kakashi
's body as he went, he stopped only when he had reached Rin's corpse. Initially phasing through the
kunoichi
's body as he tried to check her pulse, Obito finally realises that she is in fact dead and as he cradled Rin's lifeless body, vowed to create a world where she was alive, and change the fate of this world. After returning to Madara, as the elder
Uchiha
 had predicted, and hearing from White Zetsu that no one saw them, he beckons the young Uchiha to his side. Telling Obito to look into his left
eye
, Madara takes the young man to a genjutsu where as a means to explain his plans, made himself look younger before telling Obito the story of the
Sage of the Six Paths
 and the
Ten-Tails
. Some time after this, Obito and Zetsu would travel to
Amegakure
 to meet
Nagato
 — a young man of
Senju

lineage
 that Madara had implanted his
Rinnegan
 which he had awoken before shutting himself away from the world. Obito remembers Madara telling him that he had acquired the
dōjutsu
 after implanting Senju DNA into his body, but not until he had neared the end of his lifespan, did the dōjutsu awaken. Madara would later explain that this allowed him to summon the
empty shell of the Ten-Tails
 and use it as a catalyst to cultivate the
Hashirama's living clone
. Madara would then teach Obito how to control the statue, several Uchiha
kinjutsu
 and
Yin–Yang Release
. He, at some point, put his will into half of White Zetsu, thus creating
Black Zetsu
, and also into Hashirama's living clone, causing a
black receiver
 to extend from the clone's navel and told Obito to use it when performing the
Six Paths Technique
 before breaking the connection to the statue. As life left the elder Uchiha's body, he told Obito to go until the time he was revived. At this point, Obito and Zetsu approach Nagato, with Obito announcing himself to be Madara Uchiha.

Chapter 607

"
I Don't Care Any More
" (
どうでもいいんだよ
,
Dō Demo Īn da yo
)

Upon hearing who the man claims to be,
Yahiko
 declares him to either be a criminal or an idiot for using the legend's name.
Nagato
, on the other hand, is eager to meet someone who knows more about the
Rinnegan
, but before he can approach
Obito
 and
Zetsu
, a wary Yahiko escorts him and
Konan
 away, telling the masked man not to approach them again. Before they leave, however, Obito tells Nagato that he would reappear at the same time and place everyday until Nagato realised that his words were true. Some time later, Obito returns to
Konohagakure
 clad in his flame-patterned mask, and heads to the
Konoha Cemetery
, where he watches on as
Kakashi Hatake
 stands over
Rin Nohara
's grave. Eventually the young man leaves to visit the
Memorial Stone
, leaving flowers on her grave, and mentioning highly classified information, that their sensei's son would be born soon. Obito, spying on Kakashi from afar, approaches Rin's grave and angrily throws aside the flowers. Later, Obito subsequently
utilises this information to his advantage
, and when confronted by his
former sensei
, he remembers his first encounter with his
team
 and then states that he no longer cared about this world. In present time,
Naruto
 declares to
Madara
 that he was Minato's son and would not be persuaded by him. Noting that he was being lenient because Naruto was a true
jinchūriki
, he declares that now, he would not hold back. Creating an enormous
Wood Dragon
, he notes that it had been used by
Hashirama Senju
 in the past to bind the
Nine-Tails
, which prompts Naruto to manifest Kurama's body in
Tailed Beast Mode
 to fight it. Kakashi asks Obito why he chose to follow someone like Madara, but the
Uchiha
 notes that all that was left was for him and Kakashi to have their final fight as he had nothing left to say to him.

Author's Note

“

It's really hitting me these days, that I've aged...
 No matter how much I sleep, I'm still tired and my eyes are blurry. Yet I can't sleep for very long. I recall writing here before that I was starting to become an old man, but I've already completed my first evolution and am now in the middle of my second evolution from old man to geezer! Pokémon evolve and get stronger, but humans just get weaker!
 But I'm gonna keep drawing manga!
