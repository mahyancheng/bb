"
Gotta See! Gotta Know! Kakashi-Sensei's True Face!
" (
見たい、知りたい、確かめたい　カカシ先生の素顔
,
Mitai, Shiritai, Tashikametai Kakashi-Sensei no Sugao
) is episode 101 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 had started the idea of finding out what was under
Kakashi
's mask, which the two others,
Sakura
 and later
Sasuke
, agreed on after being persuaded by the former. However, they were no match against Kakashi as he threw them off his trail again and again. They soon had a low-rank mission to tend the farm. They didn't notice that the
Moya Triad
 was following them, who wanted revenge on Kakashi. The trio were eventually uncovered and Kakashi left them tied up like he did three years ago. As the team left for
Konoha
 after the mission, Naruto asked Kakashi outright what was under his mask. Kakashi agreed to show them, and each of them imagined what face their mentor has. After their intense anticipation, Kakashi finally took off his mask, only to reveal another mask underneath, making Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura fall to the ground in horror while Kakashi laughed.

Trivia

This episode was based on a three-page
omake
 that was included with the
first
Naruto
 databook
.

This episode was adapted into a mission in
Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution
. However, in the game, Kakashi put
Team 7
 to sleep with a
genjutsu
 instead of tricking them.

Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow
 takes place chronologically after this episode.

When Kakashi left a scarecrow at the
Memorial Stone
, it was a pun on his name; it translates to scarecrow.

A
crow
 appears frequently in the episode, first saying "Worst episode ever! Ever!" and the rest of the episode saying simply "idiot" (
阿呆
,
ahō
), to mock Team 7's efforts.

Sakura says "
Dattebayo
" in this episode while scaring away the Moya Triad.
