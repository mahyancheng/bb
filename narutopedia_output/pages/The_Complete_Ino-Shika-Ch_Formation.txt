,
Kanpeki na Inoshikachō!!
) is episode 274 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Attacking his teacher for calling him fat,
Chōji
 stops midway before landing the blow, stating that he was unable to harm his sensei. Not given the same options,
Asuma
 deflects his old
chakra blade
 thrown at him by
Shikamaru
 before being forced to attack Chōji. Deflecting the attack, everyone is shocked to see Chōji reacting before realising that
Ino
 had
transferred
 her consciousness into Chōji. Calling for the young man to recognise the situation they were in, Ino tells him to remember what those earrings symbolised before Asuma unleashes another
searing cloud of ash
 which
Chōza
 uses his body to protect them from. Calling for his son to start acting like the sixteenth head of the
Akimichi clan
 and the oath he took to protect as such. Recalling the oath he had taken, Chōji grows his butterfly wings, surprising everyone.

Shocking his comrades with the amount of weight he was losing they begin to worry believing that he had ingested one of the
Three Coloured Pills
, Chōza corrects them saying that Chōji was instead using the clan's
calorie control
 technique and would be fine. Deciding that he was no longer needed there, Chōza left apologising that his son had been a hindrance thus far and that this would no  longer be the case. Preparing the
Butterfly Bullet Bombing
 technique, Chōji is joined by his comrades as they prepared their revised attack. Resting on Shikamaru's back, Ino uses the
Mind Clone Switch Technique
 to take control of two fallen
White Zetsu Army
 clones and engages Asuma in battle. Supporting her, Shikamaru uses his
shadow
 to rob Asuma of a foothold, leaving him open for Chōji to punch Asuma into a nearby rock formation.  Before being sealed, Asuma tells the trio that their formation had been perfected — something he states that he couldn't say before. Motivated, Chōji grows to
gigantic
 proportions and declares that he was going to end this battle and required their help to which they emphatically agree.
