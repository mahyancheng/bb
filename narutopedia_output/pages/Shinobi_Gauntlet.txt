The
Shinobi Gauntlet
 (
忍小手
,
Shinobigote
), often shortened to just
Gauntlet
 (
小手
,
Kote
), is a condenser type
scientific ninja tool
 that is worn on the forearm.

Overview

The Gauntlet was developed by
Katasuke
 of
Konohagakure
's
Scientific Ninja Weapons Team
 as a way to allow anyone (even non-
shinobi
) to use complicated
jutsu
 without the need for training or the requisite skills. He anticipates that, once released to the public, Gauntlets will become a huge source of revenue for Konoha. Katasuke (while influenced by
Ao
's
genjutsu
) tries to convince the
Seventh Hokage
 to allow Gauntlets during the
Chūnin Exams
 as a form of advertisement, but the Hokage refuses, reasoning that Gauntlets give an unfair advantage to their user and defeat the exams' purpose of nurturing the shinobi arts. In the novelisation of
Boruto: Naruto the Movie
, the Hokage also doesn't see the point in testing proficiency with a weapon that isn't widely available; when Gauntlets become more common among infantry, their use in the exams will be allowed.





The five one-handed elemental seals.



To use,
Scroll Cartridges
 that have had jutsu
sealed
 into them are loaded into the Gauntlet's chamber. When the user wants to perform one of the loaded jutsu, they make a unique
hand seal
 corresponding to the intended jutsu's nature using the hand of the arm that the Gauntlet is worn on. This causes a system within the Gauntlet to read the Scroll Cartridge and release the stored jutsu, firing it wherever the Gauntlet is aimed. The
chakra
 that fuels these jutsu is accumulated and stored in the device's chakra condenser, and because the jutsu require none of the user's chakra to perform, they can gain an advantage in battle by releasing what would normally be chakra-taxing techniques in quick succession. In some cases, jutsu are even improved over their non-Gauntlet counterparts: the
Rasengan
 cannot ordinarily be launched without
special training
, but all of the Gauntlet's Rasengan are launchable by default.

Trivia

Masashi Kishimoto
 thought of making a tool like this before
Naruto
 even began, but couldn't find the right time to introduce it in the manga.

When Boruto fought
Shikadai Nara
 in the Chūnin Exams, he formed the
Earth Release
 hand seal to release the scrolls that contained the
shadow clones
.
