Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Ūhei

In his initial début, Ūhei's ears and tail were shaded a darker colour than the rest of his fur.
 This was changed in later representations of him.

In his anime début and again in
Shippūden
,
 Ūhei was initially coloured brown. This was corrected after a coloured manga image was released with him in it, giving him a red and white fur colour.
