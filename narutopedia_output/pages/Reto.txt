Reto
 (
烈斗
) was the
First
Kazekage
 (
初代風影
,
Shodai Kazekage
,
literally meaning:
 First or Founding Wind Shadow) who founded
Sunagakure
 in the
Land of Wind
, and was said to have gathered all the desert-dwelling shinobi under his control with his overwhelming power.

Background






The first ever five Kage Summit is convened.



He was presented at the first ever
meeting of all five Kage
. He was accompanied by the future Second Kazekage
Shamon
, noted to his peers that they would not be acting simply based off feelings, and that their agreement was based off the distribution of the
tailed beasts
 under
Hashirama
's control. Later in the meeting, he would reveal that Sunagakure already had
one
 of the tailed beasts and demanded other compensation: namely a portion of the
Land of Fire
's fertile land and 30% of whatever each nation had to pay for the tailed beasts. Though some argued that his demand was too high, he remained unwavering in his request. When threats of war were thrown around at the table and Hashirama beseeched them to co-operate, Reto appeared solemn at the
Hokage
's request.

As with all of Kazekage who came after him, Reto died an untimely death at the hands of assassins, a fate that many people considered to stem from the lineage of the Kazekage being cursed.

Personality

Reto was a very business minded individual, refusing to let personal feelings interfere with any agreement he might sign.

Reto also loved his nation and its people dearly, so much that he went to the first ever meeting of the five Kage to negotiate for beneficial conditions on behalf of his sand-dwelling people, such as a portion of the fertile lands of the neighbouring
Land of Fire
 as well as financial compensation. Despite the other Kage objecting that the 30% asked for to be too high, he refused to back down and even threatened not to sign the agreement should his conditions not be met.

Appearance






Reto wearing the Kazekage headpiece.



Reto had a head of brown spiky hair which he usually wore pinned up in the back with the rest of the hair laying flat. Attire-wise he wore a dark suit which ended in a mask which he generally used to cover his mouth though he would lower it whenever he deemed necessary. Over this he wore a blue poncho-like haori with a thick white collar. In the past at the first Five Kage Summit, he was seen with stone grey eyes while later on he was seen with black-coloured eyes.

Abilities

As the First Kazekage and the founder of Sunagakure, Reto was undoubtedly an extremely powerful shinobi. His power was such that he was able to unify all of the desert-dwelling shinobi under his leadership.

Trivia

In
Naruto Mobile
, Reto utilises
Wind Release
 as his primary fighting style, seemingly incorporating sand into it by creating storms that draw in sand particles.

According to his profile in
Naruto Mobile
, Reto never compromised with anyone for the future of his village. Before he created
Sunagakure
, the
Land of Wind
 was in an era of civil unrest and ethnic wars. Reto used overwhelming force to unite the people, and then tried his best to negotiate with other countries to strengthen the nation's strength.
