Summary

Sakura
 departs from
Konoha
 with
Sai
,
Kiba
, and
Lee
, off to find and speak with
Naruto
. In the
Land of Iron
,
Tobi
 sends
Sasuke
 and
Karin
 away. He then tells the
Kage
 that
Akatsuki
 seeks the
tailed beasts
 for the good of the world. The beasts were created centuries ago when the
Sage of the Six Paths
 split up the immense power of the
Ten-Tails
. If Tobi recombines the tailed beasts into the original Ten-Tails and seals the Ten-Tails within his body, he will be able to place an illusion over the entire world and end all wars. He asks the Kage to help him achieve this goal by giving him Naruto and
Killer B
 (in doing so revealing that B was never captured). They refuse, so he declares the start of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.
