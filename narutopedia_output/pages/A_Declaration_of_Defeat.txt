"
A Declaration of Defeat…?!
" (
敗北宣言…!?
,
Haiboku Sengen…!?
) is chapter 73 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Having gained control of
Sakura
's body,
Ino
 tries to make Sakura forfeit the match.
Naruto
 yells to Sakura not to give up, prompting
Inner Sakura
 to appear and force Ino out of Sakura's mind. Although confused by what had happened, Ino lacks the energy to try again.
Kakashi
 presumes that Ino's lack of
chakra
 was a factor in Sakura's liberation, but also takes note of Sakura's strong will to not lose. Ino and an equally exhausted Sakura charge at each other to exchange final blows, resulting in a double knock out.
Hayate
 decides that neither of them will pass to the next round. They are taken aside to recover while the fifth match between
Temari
 and
Tenten
 commences. When they wake up, they decide to resume their friendship but will continue to compete for
Sasuke
's affection. Meanwhile, Temari defeats Tenten easily and swiftly, with all of Tenten's projectile weapons being rendered useless against her wind techniques.
