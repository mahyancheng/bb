"
Heir to Darkness
" (
闇の後継者
,
Yami no Kōkeisha
) is episode 148 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 is enraged upon seeing the seal upon
Hotaru
's back, remembering how he was mistreated during his childhood for being a
jinchūriki
. Back at
Mount Katsuragi
, Naruto pressures
Tonbee
 and asks how he could have allowed
En no Gyōja
 to have sealed the
Tsuchigumo clan
's
forbidden technique
 within his own granddaughter. However, Hotaru reveals that she had specifically asked for it, since it was her grandfather's wishes to use the
kinjutsu
 to restore the clan to its former glory and that a student must obey his or her master's wishes.
Utakata
 shuns her for her opinion, remembering being strapped down and attacked by his own master,
Harusame
. Tonbee decides that for the sake of the clan and for Hotaru's safety, he will remove the seal from her back, thus rendering the forbidden technique useless; he adds that En no Gyōja would never have sealed the kinjutsu on her back if there was no way to undo it, prompting that no master would do such a thing. As Utakata muses whether
Tsurugi
's words regarding his master Harusame's intentions were true, the group is unaware that they are being
spied
 on by
Shiranami
, the leader of the
four bandits
, who has heard their entire conversation. After Hotaru refuses to have the seal removed, she is slapped by Utakata and flees; Naruto, Utakata and
Sakura
 follow her while
Sai
, under personal instructions from
Yamato
, stays behind.

At En no Gyōja's grave, Naruto and Utakata convince Hotaru to return and have her seal removed. Hotaru, nonetheless, finds another alternative — she reveals that her grandfather's very first pupil,
Hāto
, had a son named Shiranami who possessed even greater skill than his father, and that if Shiranami received the clan's forbidden technique then their hopes for clan restoration would not be lost. Shiranami, who is eavesdropping on their conversation, is surprised to hear his name being spoken. Naruto, understanding what it feels like to have a power sealed within the body and being hunted because of it, promises Hotaru that he will find Shiranami.

Naruto uses his
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 to travel through various villages until he finds a man who knows where Shiranami lives. In
Konoha
,
Tsunade
 and
Shizune
 receive word through Sai's
ink bird
, who relays the situation to them. In order to prevent the clan's forbidden technique from being used by another nation, Tsunade agrees for Konoha to protect and give Hotaru refuge while the seal is either removed or passed down to Shiranami.

Meanwhile, Utakata decides to leave Mount Katsuragi and
drifts
 through mid-air in his bubble, wanting to lure Tsurugi out so that they may talk. The
Kiri

hunter-nin
 spot Utakata and decide to intercept him, only to find their path blocked by one of
Pain
's
multi-headed dogs
.
