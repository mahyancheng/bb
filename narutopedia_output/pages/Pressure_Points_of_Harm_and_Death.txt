Guren
 releases two
tenketsu
 points to greatly increase her
chakra
 and physical capabilities for a short time by changing her life force into chakra. This allows the use of taxing techniques such as
Crystal Release: String of Glory
. The amount of chakra released is so much that it becomes visible and causes water to form a vortex around her, similar to the one caused by opening the "Sixth Gate of Joy" from the
Eight Gates
. Her eyes also turn completely white momentarily.
