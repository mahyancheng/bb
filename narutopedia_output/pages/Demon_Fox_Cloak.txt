In his
four-tailed form
, Naruto plants his hand onto the ground causing a replica of his arm to burst out of the ground which grabs and slams the enemy onto the ground. Naruto then fires a small but violent beam that rapidly expands on impact, going far beyond the enemy and leaving an enormous crater on the ground.
