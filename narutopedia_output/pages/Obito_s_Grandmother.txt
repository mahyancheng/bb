She was a member of
Konohagakure
's
Uchiha clan
.

Background

With both of her grandson's parents dead, she became
Obito
's guardian. On the day of the Youth Ninja Competition, she answered her apartment door when
Rin Nohara
 arrived, and teased Obito about having a great-grandchild. Later that night at dinner, Obito asked her which of his parents he took after. She responded that he takes after both of them and that he must honour them and work for the sake of others.

She presumably died either before, or during the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
 along with the rest of her clansmen.

Personality

A kind woman, she cared very much for her grandson, telling him how much he was like both his parents and wanted to see him lead a bright future. Also seemingly aware of Obito's crush on Rin, she was not above teasing him about the prospect of him giving her future great-grandchildren, despite Obito being only five years old at the time.

Appearance

She was an elderly woman with shoulder-length grey hair and large black eyes. She wears a high-collared purple outfit with a brow vest emblazoned with the Uchiha's crest.
