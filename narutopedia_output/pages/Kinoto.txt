Kinoto
 (
乙
) is a former member of
Konohagakure
's
Anbu
 faction
Root
.

Background

Shortly after the
Third Great Shinobi War
, Kinoto served as a bodyguard to
Danzō Shimura
 during a meeting with
Orochimaru
 after the latter had been passed over for the position for
Hokage
. Later, he informed Danzō about Orochimaru's defection from Konoha. He later took part in an assassination attempt of
Hiruzen Sarutobi
 on Danzō's orders, which was foiled by
Kakashi
 informing Hiruzen of their plans beforehand.

Three years later, Danzō requested Kinoto and
Kinoe
 to retrieve a
Sharingan
 from Kakashi Hatake in order for the latter to replace his own right eye, which was slowly losing its light. However, their mission to retrieve Kakashi's Sharingan became a failure due to Kinoe using a decoy wooden eyeball of the Sharingan.

Appearance






Kinoto without his mask.



Kinoto has spiky black hair and black eyes. His face is generally concealed behind an Anbu mask which features red patterns across the surface. He wears the typical attire of the Anbu along with a tattoo on his left shoulder and a
tantō
 strapped to his right shoulder.

Abilities

As an Anbu, Kinoto is presumably a considerably strong
shinobi
. He was seen to be very stealthy, able to stay hidden and out of sight from an experienced shinobi like Kakashi. He also wields a
sword
 which indicates him being skilled in
kenjutsu
. Considering that Danzō ordered him to place a
cursed seal
 on Kinoe, it stands to reason that he is also skilled in
juinjutsu
.
