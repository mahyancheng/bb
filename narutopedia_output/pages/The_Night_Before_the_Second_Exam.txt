"
The Night Before the Second Exam
" (
二次試験、前夜
,
Niji Shiken, Zen'ya
) is episode 398 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

At night in
Sunagakure
, a masked individual breaks into the
Kazekage's office
 building.
Kankurō
 confronts him, and questions his identity, which he claims to be one of the extremists seeking reform in the
Land of Wind
. As the assassin makes his escape, Kankurō pursues him. Seemingly cornered, he attempts to commit a
suicidal attack
, but
Temari
 arrives in the nick of time to save Kankurō. The next morning, Kankurō and Temari alert
Gaara
 that his rebels are stepping up their efforts against him, but the
Kazekage
 refuses to cave in under pressure.
 Elsewhere, the main teams of the
Konoha 11
 all arrive safely to the
Demon Desert
 checkpoint to secure their qualification, while those that arrive late are eliminated and are instructed to return to their respective villages. During dinnertime, a fight breaks out between the
genin
 after the
Konoha
 shinobi accidentally ruined the food. As
Fū
 arrives and is seemingly hoping to make friends, the other genin leave the cafeteria, much to her dismay. Back in Konohagakure,
Kakashi
 reports to
Tsunade
 of his failure to infiltrate
Amegakure
, suspecting the state of things after having not met
Hanzō
 in person. Meanwhile,
Chōji
 sneaks out to the building where the
jōnin
 are, hoping to get food.
Sakura
 and
Ino
 follow him, and they are all attacked by a giant scorpion. Fortunately, Fū arrives to their
rescue
. Arriving to the scene, Gaara notices the similarity between Fū and
Naruto
 due to her unique charisma. The next day, the second phase begins, and, as in the previous
Chūnin Exams
, half of the teams are given the
Scroll
 of Earth, while the other half are given the Scroll of Heaven, meaning each team must retrieve the counterpart scroll to pass the exam.

Trivia

Even though it takes three days to travel to Suna from Konoha, no matter the route, Kankurō and Temari were able to reach the village in two days.

A kunoichi from
Suna
 in one frame was shown to have failed the exam as she didn't make it to the
Demon Desert
 in time and in the other frame was shown sitting with her fellow Suna
genin
, albeit with a slightly different colouring palette. Whether this was on purpose or an accident is unknown.
