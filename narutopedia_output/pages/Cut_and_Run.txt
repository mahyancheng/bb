"
Cut and Run
" (
脱出
,
Dasshutsu
) is episode 236 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

As the large structure approaches them, they see the
Funato
 crest on it.
Kagura
 thinks it's a fortress, and deduces it was built using technology stolen from
Kirigakure
, as the Funato have never had this kind of firepower. He wants
Boruto
,
Kawaki
, and
Buntan
 to investigate while the others wait to rendezvous with
Sarada
 and
Mitsuki
.
Team 5
 shows Mitsuki and Sarada how the Funato have organised at
Dotō Island
, and where they're holding the islanders hostage. They decide that Team 5 will steal a Funato transport ship that can carry all the islanders, as
Denki
 is the most likely to figure out how to pilot it, while Sarada and Mitsuki will try to smuggle the hostages out without being noticed. Boruto and Buntan butt heads while approaching the Funato fortress. He has Kawaki throw him at the fortress, and uses Kawaki's blast and his own
Wind Release: Gale Palm
 to propel himself, landing in the fortress. He throws a rope, allowing Buntan and Kawaki to board. Team 5 discusses if the riskier situation around their mission is lucky or unlucky.
 One of the Funato leaders receives word they found where the
Konoha
 shinobi were hiding, and promises a gold nugget to whoever can find them. The hostages discuss whether it's better to die where they are, or to be forced becoming a Funato soldier. At the fortress,
Tenma Funato
 kills a newbie in a traditional death match to join his unit. He is notified of
Araumi
's breakout and celebrates. He wants to join his father and brother, but abides to the order to gather gold, and is offended by the suggestion he could become the successor of the clan over Araumi and
Isari
. Buntan explains who Tenma is to Boruto and Kawaki as they watch him. One of the hostages informs the Funato that beyond the shinobi who escaped, there are other Konoha citizens among the hostages, in hopes of securing his freedom. The Funato leader concludes the shinobi will try to rescue their allies. Sarada and Mitsuki take out the soldiers on guard duty, and get into the mines. They take out the Funato watching the hostages, and direct them to the harbour, where Team 5 is securing a ship for their escape. The Funato intercept their escape,
binding
 the Konoha citizens with
Water Release
. Sarada and Mitsuki pretend to surrender, but knock the Funato out with
genjutsu
 and
snakes
, and hurry the hostages before the main Funato unit notices them. Denki takes out the Funato in the ship with a
smoke-flash bomb
, but struggles to hotwire the ship. The Funato leader signals the main force to join him. The Konoha shinobi prevent the Funato from
getting on the ship
. Denki manages to get the ship working with his
Lightning Release
.
Metal Lee
 and
Iwabee
 celebrate. Buntan takes out a guard as they move around, drawing censure from Boruto. Kawaki remains queasy from seasickness, so Buntan cures it to prevent it from affecting the mission. Kawaki relates to her kill or be killed attitude. They discover the fortress' giant
scientific ninja tool
 weapon. Denki steers the stolen ship. Kagura waits for them while another Funato boat approaches.

Trivia

When Boruto propels himself with Wind Release, his
Kāma
 is mistakenly depicted on his left hand instead of his right.
