Rock Lee using taijutsu against Kimimaro.



Taijutsu
 (
体術
,
literally meaning:
 Body Techniques) is a basic form of
techniques
 and refers to any techniques involving the martial arts or the optimisation of natural human abilities. Taijutsu is executed by directly accessing the user's physical and mental energies, relying on the stamina and strength gained through training. It typically does not require
chakra
, though chakra may be used to enhance its techniques. Taijutsu generally requires no
hand seals
 to perform, occasionally making use of certain stances or poses, and are far quicker to use than
ninjutsu
 or
genjutsu
. Taijutsu is, simply put, hand-to-hand combat.

Although it is used by nearly all
shinobi
, only a few of them use it as their primary
fighting style
 like
Rock Lee
 and his teacher
Might Guy
 for example, who are experts of many taijutsu techniques. Example of taijutsu techniques are
Dynamic Entry
 and
Leaf Whirlwind
. The
Hyūga clan
's
Gentle Fist
, however, makes extensive use of chakra and demands great skill in its control. The taijutsu techniques are the right choices for those that want to save their time and chakra, or for those who rely on their physical attributes. It can also be used uniquely in collaboration with ninjutsu to create
nintaijutsu
 techniques. The
Shikotsumyaku
 is said to be the ultimate taijutsu ability, due to the produced bones can be used to augment offensive and defensive powers in versatile ways.
Killer B
's unique style of taijutsu combined with
kenjutsu
 is called
Disturbance Taijutsu
 (
攪乱体術
,
Kakuran Taijutsu
,
literally meaning:
 Disturbance Body Technique) and used through
Acrobat
.

Trivia

Might Guy is a taijutsu master, of such skill that when opened all
Eight Gates
,
Madara Uchiha
 believes him to be unsurpassed.

In the anime, however, this is disputed, since
Chen
 was called the
Strongest Taijutsu User
 (
最強の体術使い
,
Saikyō no Taijutsu Tsukai
), to the point that his talent was considered legendary and implicitly superior to Guy, as he had managed to gradually overcome it and ward it off in battle. At the same time, the two taijutsu masters were generations separated and Chen had the advantage of
limitless stamina
.
