Chapter 67

"
A Heretical Ability!!
" (
異端なる能力!!
,
Itannaru Nōryoku!!
)

Sasuke
 and
Yoroi
 prepare to fight and the rest of the participants go upstairs to observe.
Kakashi
 takes this opportunity to warn Sasuke not to use his
cursed seal
, stating that if he activates it the match will end and Sasuke will be detained. Since he cannot use his
Sharingan
 without inadvertently activating the cursed seal, Sasuke and the watching
Orochimaru
 wonder how he will handle this handicap. When the match starts Sasuke resorts to
taijutsu
, which gives Yoroi ample opportunity to grab Sasuke and absorb his
chakra
. Knowing that a prolonged battle will leave him exhausted and thus unable to win, Sasuke uses his
Lion Combo
, a technique based off
Rock Lee
's
Front Lotus
, on Yoroi.

" (

's

 starts to activate. Fearing disqualification, he suppresses it and defeats Yoroi, impressing everyone watching, particularly

 takes Sasuke away to seal off the cursed seal, disappointing Sasuke since he wants to see the other matches.

 and
Zaku Abumi
 are selected for the second match.

Kyōfu no Hōmonsha!!

With
Zaku
's arms still damaged from his earlier fight with
Sasuke
,
Shino
 suggests that he forfeit since they will only be damaged further. Not wanting his pity, Zaku uses his one good arm to shoot blades of wind at Shino from the tubes in the palms of his hands. Meanwhile,
Kakashi
 seals off Sasuke's
cursed seal
.
Orochimaru
 approaches him and tells him it is useless, as Sasuke's
Sharingan
 will become his no matter what Kakashi does. Kakashi asks about his
Team Dosu
, but Orochimaru no longer has an interest in them. Zaku realises that he has become boxed in by Shino's bugs. Since he cannot destroy all of them with one arm, he unslings his other arm to attack. When he starts to shoot air from his palms his arms detonate and sever, the tubes having been blocked off with bugs. Shino defeats him.

Chapter 70

"
The One Who Dies is…?!
" (

 contemplates fighting

 by himself, but realises that it would only result in his death. Orochimaru leaves, promising to take
Sasuke
 at a later date. After having Sasuke taken care of, Kakashi returns to the preliminaries, assuring
Sakura
 that Sasuke will be fine.
Kankurō
 and
Misumi Tsurugi
 are paired for the next match. Misumi quickly restrains Kankurō and threatens to break his neck if he doesn't surrender. When Kankurō refuses, Misumi does as he warned, only to find that he has broken the neck of a
puppet
. Kankurō takes advantage of Misumi's close proximity to the puppet to capture him and crush him despite Misumi's attempts to give up, winning the match. Sakura and
Ino
 are selected for the fourth match.

Chapter 71

"
A Wall Too High…!!
" (
高すぎる壁…!!
,
Takasugiru Kabe…!!
)

Sakura
 and
Ino
 think back on their childhoods together and how, when they amicably ended their friendship, they agreed they would become rivals that would not show each other any sympathies. Intending to stay true to their promise, both relocate their
forehead protectors
 to their forehead, removing any possibility of mercy by fighting as
Konoha
 ninja and not old friends. The two exchange blows and Sakura punches Ino in the face, making Ino happy that Sakura is taking things seriously.

Chapter 72

"
Rivalry…!!
" (
拮抗…!!
,
Kikkō…!!
)

Sakura
 and
Ino
 continue exchanging blows. Being at par with each other, neither is able to gain the upper hand, so both soon grow tired. Sakura berates Ino for being too focused on her appearance and beauty rather than her
kunoichi
 skills, and Ino apparently snaps at her insults, cutting her hair and throwing it to the ground. Desperate, Ino tries to use her
Mind Body Switch Technique
 to force Sakura to forfeit, despite knowing how inaccurate it is and that she will be left defenceless if she misses. Sakura dodges the attack and appears to have won, but finds that she is immobilised by the strands of Ino's cut hair which have been infused with
chakra
 to form a binding rope. Ino is revealed to only have pretended to snap and to use the Mind Body Switch Technique in order to lead Sakura into the trap. She uses the Mind Body Switch Technique again knowing it cannot miss and succeeds on gaining control of Sakura's body.

Author's Note

“

It's been about two years since
Naruto
 began running in
Weekly Shonen Jump
... and I haven't been back to my parents' house once! While I've been away from home, they've totally remodelled the place, and apparently there's not even a trace left of my shabby, memory-filled room. When I heard that, I got a little sad... Time just keeps flowing by...
