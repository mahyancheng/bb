"
The Five Kage's Decision
" (
五影の決断
,
Gokage no Ketsudan
) is episode 222 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Tsunade
 has a meeting with the
Konoha Council
 where she notifies
Homura
 and
Koharu
 about the seriousness of the
Akatsuki
 threat, led by none other than
Madara Uchiha
. In
Kumogakure
, the
Kumo Council
 discuss gathering intelligence from
the

other

four

nations
.
Killer B
 is also present at the meeting, although he focuses his time and efforts in improving his rap lyrics, unaware that
Kisame
 is spying on the meeting through the
Samehada
 blade.

In Konoha, Tsunade informs
Sakura
,
Shikamaru
, and
Kakashi
 of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
' upcoming war against the Akatsuki. Sakura is heartbroken at the possibility of fighting against Sasuke and is told by Tsunade to keep an eye on
Naruto
.
Shizune
 alerts Tsunade that Naruto suddenly disappeared from
Ramen Ichiraku
. Believing that the Akatsuki may have taken him, they begin a village-wide manhunt for him.
Fukasaku
 sends Naruto back to Ramen Ichiraku, where he is found by Sakura and brought back to Tsunade's office. There, he tells them that he was
reverse summoned
 to
Mount Myōboku
 in order to be given a prophecy by the
Great Toad Sage
 — that he would encounter an
octopus
 at a resort and that he would fight
Sasuke
.

A few days later, the
Fourth Raikage
 calls for a
kage
 meeting in Kumo, where the five leaders discuss intelligence and strategies for the upcoming
Fourth Shinobi World War
. Tsunade initially protests against the other kage's idea to keep Naruto and Killer B in hiding, but acquiesces when the other kage stress on the importance of it, with
Gaara
 adding that Naruto has a tendency to be careless and reckless when it comes to saving a friend. A tells them that he has a perfect spot to secure Naruto and B. In private, Tsunade asks the
Raikage
 if he could convince B, who has full control over his
tailed beast
, to teach Naruto to do the same. At first, A refuses, not wanting to increase Konoha's military strength by giving them full control over the
Nine-Tails
. However, Tsunade convinces him that at some point both
jinchūriki
 would be needed on the battlefield, and A agrees, telling her that the hiding spot he chose for the two is also a training ground where he used to train with B himself. Satisfied, Tsunade returns to Konoha and notifies Naruto that he is being assigned an
S-rank
 mission on an island located in Kumo, with
Yamato
 tagging along as captain.

Trivia

A poster of
Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison
 was shown on a wall in the entrance hall of Killer B's enka concert.
