Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

The
Orochimaru Search Team
 split off into their three respective sub-teams;
Shizune
's team begin to erect their
Four-Corner Sealing Barrier
 while
Yamato
 and
Kakashi
's team head off to defeat
Team Guren
.
Lee
 is dismayed as he is not on Kakashi's team, as he wanted to fight a
Crystal Release
 user, but
Kiba
 comforts him by telling him that her followers are pretty powerful on their own. With
Tenten
 asking to join their conversation, he debriefs them on their attacks, including their reliance on a smokescreen.

As Kakashi's team heads towards the woods,
Naruto
 picks up at the silence and stares between
Shino
 and
Sai
. Realising that the two have never met before, he introduces one another; he tells Shino that Sai is a former member of the
Anbu
 who is weird and reads books all the time, but who can also draw and fight really well. He then tells Sai that Shino is merely Shino. Sai reveals to Naruto that Shino is the son of
Shibi Aburame
, the head of the
Aburame Clan
, and that Shino himself has completed various missions successfully and possesses the ability to control parasitic insects. Naruto is surprised to know that Sai knows that much about Shino, but Shino is insulted that a complete stranger knows more about him than an old friend and comrade. Shino starts to tell Naruto about his favourite foods, likes and dislikes, but is shot down by Naruto, who tells Shino that he does need to know such stuff in order to perform teamwork.

Elsewhere,
Guren
 is conflicted over her loyalty to
Orochimaru
 and her caring for
Yūkimaru
. With
Gozu
 by her side, she resolves to deal with the
Konoha

shinobi
 before dealing with
Kabuto
, whom she is vexed at. The sealing team begin their barrier but it collapses shortly after as
Ino
 is unable to maintain her
chakra
 control. After a few encouraging words from
Sakura
 and recalling when Sakura had done the same thing years ago, Ino gets up and resolves to stick it through. Meanwhile,
Kigiri
 appears out of the water, and Kiba identifies him as the smokescreen user. In order to prevent his tactic, Yamato restrains him with his
Wood Release
 while Lee rushes to deliver a
Leaf Whirlwind
; however, the restrained Kigiri is revealed to be none other than a
Smoke Clone
. As the other members of Team Guren emerge from the water, the real Kigiri disperses a smokescreen that engulfs Lee. As
Kihō
 awaits
Rinji
's orders, the latter merely states that he has other matters to attend to and disappears. Despite his sense of sight being robbed, Lee is able to sense Kihō's presence and manages to strike a few blows on him, before kicking him up into the air and using the
Shadow of the Dancing Leaf
 to seismic toss him back into the water. With Lee safely out of the smokescreen, leaving only their enemies trapped within, Tenten unfurls her scrolls and strikes them with her
Twin Rising Dragons
, causing her to defeat them and nearly knock them out. Kiba, appalled and insulted that he had trouble taking on one when Lee and Tenten managed to easily take them down, rushes at them in order to regain his pride. Using
Akamaru
's
Dynamic Marking
 to mark them with urine, he tracks them down through Kigiri's smokescreen and hits all three of them with his
Fang Passing Fang
, sending them flying away. With the cohorts having been dealt with, Yamato's team heads off to provide support and backup for Kakashi's.

In the meantime, Shino prepares himself while Kakashi reminds Sai that his job is to protect his comrades at all costs, something he may not be familiar with as he was a member of the Anbu, who value mission completion over the lives of teammates. Sai reveals that the reason he is still on
Team Kakashi
 is because he wishes to do exactly that, having learned the value of friendship. However, they are then ambushed by Gozu, who attempts to strike them. Naruto spots Guren and exclaims that he is willing to do what it takes to take Yūkimaru away from her since she views him as nothing but a mere tool; wounded by Naruto's words, she strikes back in anger, only for her jab to be countered by Kakashi. Sai attempts to retaliate with an
ink beast
, but Gozu is able to restrain and destroy it. Shino, who is observing the battle as he prepares his chakra, suddenly stands up and releases his insects.
