The
Fission Technique
 is a highly advanced
ninjutsu
 which allows Mū to literally split his own body into two identical — yet entirely independent — duplicates of himself.

Unlike
clone techniques
 that only appear to be similar, the ability is instead a physical separation and so does not require hand seals to activate, making it faster in comparison as a result. This also means that even if one is incapacitated, the other remains completely unaffected as neither can truly be regarded as the original.

Because the duplicates cannot be dispelled like normal clones, they will be unable to reunite if one is sealed. This poses a great risk to Mū as his chakra reserves are also halved in the process. In doing so, he is left unable to use more taxing techniques like his
