"
The Heart's Eye
" (
心の目
,
Kokoro no Me
) is episode 306 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As the remnants of the
White Zetsu Army
 are eradicated one by one, the
Hyūga
 cousins,
Neji
 and
Hinata
, fight side by side with Hinata protecting the newly-recuperated Neji. During this time, Hinata remembers the time that Neji protected her when they were younger: Neji was left in charge of Hinata's training as her father
Hiashi
 had left the village on other duties. During the gruelling training, Hinata's
eyesight
 would become severely strained and she was put on bed-rest by a
doctor
 in order to recover. Not wanting Hinata to miss the fireworks that she had made plans to attend with
Team Kakashi
, Neji went to seek out the
Eye Medicine Plant
 that was fabled to grow in the
Valley of Judgement
, despite being advised against it.

Accompanied by
Naruto
 and
Sakura
, they made their way to the valley, where they were beset upon by humanoid creatures, without faces. Though they initially put up a valiant effort to stave them off, it was becoming increasingly apparent that it would become a battle of attrition until
Might Guy
 and
Kakashi
 make a surprise appearance and send the creatures scurrying away. After explaining why they were there, Kakashi noted that the search for the plant was futile and that they returned to the village. Later, during the fireworks display, Hinata sat on her veranda for the display. She feels melancholy that she didn't see anything because her eyes were still recovering and that she cannot take the bandages off. In present time, she would reveal to Neji that Naruto and Sakura had told her the lengths he went through to help her, and had always wanted to thank him. With that, they resolved to defeat the enemy until Naruto arrived on the battlefield.
