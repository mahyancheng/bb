This article is about the anime technique. For the game technique, see
Earth Dragon Bullet Technique
.

After creating a
mud source
, the user creates a dragon-like head to shoot mud balls at an opponent. To be more threatening, the user can combine this technique with a
fire technique
 to make the mud balls become searing hot.

Trivia

The
Earth Dragon
 part of this technique would usually be pronounced as
mogura
 and is actually the Japanese word for
mole
. However, given the nature of this technique and similar techniques from other elemental lines, the pronunciation and meaning are likely meant to be
Earth Dragon
 and
Doryū
.
