A technique that transforms the earth surrounding the user into a
fluid
, allowing them to close in on the enemy with high speed by swimming underground. Since being under the ground is a blind spot, the target has no warning; allowing the user to launch a surprise attack. By using this technique in conjunction with a weapon, it also gains great effect as an "assault ninjutsu".

Kisame combines this with
Samehada
, allowing it to protrude from the ground, like a shark's dorsal fin.
