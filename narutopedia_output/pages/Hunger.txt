Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Code
 evades
Momoshiki
's attack, and is amazed by his strength as an
Ōtsutsuki
, understanding how
Boro
 lost to him. Momoshiki states Code is next, and resumes attacking, pressuring him.
Ada
 contacts Code, warning him Momoshiki is too strong. Code immobilises
Kawaki
, using him as shield against Momoshiki, who needs an Ōtsutsuki to sacrifice for a chakra fruit. Momoshiki changes his
Rasengan
 into a
ranged, precision attack
, separating Code from Kawaki, who he grabs. Kawaki attempts to fight Momoshiki, but is overwhelmed.
Shikamaru
 arrives,
pinning
 Momoshiki with his shadow, allowing
Naruto
 to save Kawaki. Ada wonders how Code will retrieve Kawaki now. Kawaki is distressed about Naruto putting himself in danger. Shikamaru attempts to constrict Momoshiki with his shadow, but he's too strong. Code holds Shikamaru hostage, and tells Momoshiki this is an opportunity for him to take revenge on Naruto. Momoshiki revels in the opportunity for making the son kill his father. Kawaki fails to stop Momoshiki, who aims an
Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan
 at them.
 Thinking on his wish for power to protect Naruto, Kawaki
absorbs
 it, manifesting a new
Kāma
, to everyone's surprise. Ada tells Code
Amado
 never intended to let Kawaki make a choice in the matter, probably restoring it along with his arm. Shikamaru wonders who Code is talking to. Momoshiki wonders what Amado is scheming, and admonishes Kawaki for always being used by someone else. Kawaki manifests
Isshiki's Dōjutsu
 and uses his abilities against Momoshiki, startling everyone. Kawaki confirms to Naruto he's himself, and asks him not to interfere while he does what he does for Naruto. Kawaki and Momoshiki fight more evenly, Kawaki making
hand seals
 for a
Fire Release
 with Momoshiki's hand. They fight atop a
cube
. Momoshiki flies to evade Kawaki's weapons and charges back with a Rasengan. Boruto begins to resurface, allowing Kawaki to hit Momoshiki with chakra rods. He attempts to crush Momoshiki with a cube, but Naruto saves Boruto. Naruto tells Kawaki it's enough, but he's determined to kill Momoshiki. Naruto can't kill Boruto, so Kawaki will. Boruto stands up, disappointed the meds didn't work after all. Kawaki asks if Boruto remembers his promise, which Boruto confirms. He pushes Naruto away with
Wind Release: Gale Palm
, and asks Kawaki to do it. Kawaki
transforms his arm
, ramming it through Boruto's upper body, to everyone's shock.
