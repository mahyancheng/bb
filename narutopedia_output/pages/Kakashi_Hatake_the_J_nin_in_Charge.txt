"
Kakashi Hatake, the Jōnin in Charge
" (
担当上忍はたけカカシ
,
Tantō Jōnin Hatake Kakashi
) is episode 179 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

During an emergency council meeting with the
Land of Fire
,
Koharu Utatane
 and
Homura Mitokado
 of the
Konoha Council
 are spurred on by
Danzō Shimura
 to tell the
Fire Daimyō
 that they need a new
Hokage
 since not only is
Tsunade
 in a comatose state, but because they hold her responsible for
Pain's assault
.
Shikaku
, knowing that Danzō is attempting to usurp Tsunade, rushes in to nominate
Kakashi
 as
Konoha
's Sixth Hokage.

The Land of Fire is pleased with the choice, as Kakashi was the student of the
Fourth Hokage
, who was the student of
Jiraiya
, who in turn was the student of the
Third Hokage
. Feeling that Kakashi is the ideal choice, the daimyō nearly approves Kakashi's promotion until Danzō tells him that Kakashi, due to that exact chain, embodies the teachings of the Third, which are unwarranted and weaken their village. He adds that Tsunade's administration did nothing to prevent the rise of the
Akatsuki
 nor did she officially mark
Sasuke
 as a
missing-nin
, and therefore he should be the next Hokage. Convinced, the fire daimyō officially announces Danzō as Konoha's Sixth Hokage.

Meanwhile,
Sakura
 tells
Naruto
,
Shizune
 and Kakashi that Tsunade may not awaken from her coma anytime soon, and that she had entered the comatose state due to
healing
 all of the village's wounded. As Naruto and Sakura go off to fetch some water, Kakashi watches them and reminisces on when he was first assigned to their team.

After being announced as the leader of
Team 7
, consisting of Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke, Kakashi observed them for the
entire day
, witnessing Naruto and Sasuke's kiss, Naruto ambushing Sasuke in order to spend some time with Sakura, as well as Naruto's trip to the bathroom due to spoiled milk. As he takes out his bells, he muses that they don't show much teammwork and that he cannot imagine that they would pass his
bell test
. Meanwhile, the two elders of the Konoha Council berate the Third Hokage for placing the
Nine-Tails

jinchuriki
 on a squad with Sasuke, claiming that Naruto should not be allowed outside the village. Unbeknownst to them, the meeting is being spied on by Danzō, who believes that the Third Hokage only did so due to the
Sharingan
's ability to control the Nine-Tails.

In the present day, Kakashi watches as Naruto and Sakura walk off into the distance and tells himself that it is up to him to stop Sasuke.

Trivia

The majority of the flashback revolving around Kakashi monitoring
Naruto
,
Sasuke
, and
Sakura
 contradicts with the
original episode
 those events took place in.

The
Third Hokage
 and
Kakashi
 visit
Naruto
's apartment as the Third muses how Kakashi was assigned to watch over the Fourth's son as well as an Uchiha. After this, Kakashi notices a carton of spoiled milk. In the original episode, the dialogue between the Third and Kakashi is entirely different, with Kakashi stating that Naruto would be problematic before picking up the carton of milk and noticing that it was spoiled.

In the original episode, Kakashi notices Naruto's carton of spoiled milk at the end of the day. However, in this episode, Kakashi visits Naruto's apartment at the beginning of the day and proceeds to observe the three team members for the rest of the day.

In the original episode, Kakashi was observing the events in the classroom from the Third Hokage's crystal ball with the Hokage and other jōnin. However, in this episode Kakashi was hiding behind the blackboard when he was observing the classroom.

In the original episode, when Iruka announced Sasuke as the third member for Team 7, Sakura got up to cheer this announcement while Naruto unhappily sat back down. However in this episode, when Sakura stood up to cheer, she accidentally knocked Naruto over.

In the original episode, after Naruto returns from the bathroom, he yells at Sakura, believing her to be Sasuke in
disguise
. However, in this episode, he notices Sakura's sad demeanour and does not approach her; instead, he rushes off to find Sasuke, holding him responsible for upsetting Sakura.

Upon finding Sasuke on the road, surprised that Sasuke has
escaped
, Naruto engages in combat against him, with the battle being witnessed from above by Kakashi. Naruto uses his
Shadow Clone Technique
 in an attempt to defeat Sasuke, only for Sasuke to easily take out the clones. Additionally, Sasuke uses the
Tree Climbing Practice
 although it wasn't until
shortly after
 when he had learned to walk up vertical surfaces using only chakra. After their battle, they are approached by Sakura, who tells them that they are late for class. In the original episode, Naruto ran into Sasuke on the way to the bathroom. Surprised that Sasuke had escape from his binds, Naruto attempted to attack him in the hallway with his shadow clones, only to run into the bathroom due to the spoiled milk. Also, at that point, they did not return to the
Academy
 for classes due to the fact that they had officially graduated.

Additionally, Kakashi is seen to have witnessed the fight between Naruto and Sasuke on the road, where Naruto used shadow clones. However, when Naruto
attacked
 him with shadow clones during the
bell test
, Kakashi was surprised that he was able to do so and mused that the rumour about Naruto being able to use shadow clones was true after all.
