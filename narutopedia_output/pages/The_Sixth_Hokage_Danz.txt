"
The Sixth Hokage Danzō
" (
六代目火影ダンゾウ
,
Rokudaime Hokage Danzō
) is episode 197 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Using his
ink mice
,
Sai
 locates
Kabuto
 hiding out in one of
Orochimaru
's old hideouts. Before he can go in,
Tokuma Hyūga
 and his squad arrive, notifying captain
Anko
 that Sai was to return to
Konoha
 immediately while they take his place in the
Infiltration and Reconnaissance Party
. Anko asks what happened, due to the fact that
Yamato
 had left abruptly and stated it was an emergency. Tokuma reveals that the
Akatsuki
 mounted an
attack
 on the village and that it was destroyed, and that due to
Tsunade
's coma,
Danzō
 had been appointed
Hokage
.

Meanwhile,
Team Samui
 make their way to Konoha, surprised at its destruction.
Samui
 takes the
Fourth Raikage
's letter to Tsunade, only to discover that Tsunade is in a coma. She demands to see the acting Hokage, and Danzō enters the tent and proclaim himself as the village's Sixth Hokage. The letter requests that the village take action on
missing-nin

Sasuke Uchiha
 and to hand over all intel gathered on him. Danzō agrees, and passes down an official order to eliminate Sasuke.

Sai is told by Danzō to keep an eye on
Naruto
, whom he promises not to harm at the moment due to the fact that Naruto is viewed as the village's hero.
Kiba
 finds Naruto,
Sakura
 and
Kakashi
, who are about to leave the village, and relays what has transpired. Naruto and Sakura attempt to extract information from Sai regarding Danzō, but Sai reveals that he has a
cursed seal
 on his tongue that prevents him from doing so. He tells the duo that all members of
Root
 are branded with the seal to eradicate any attempts of interrogation should they be captured. Sakura asks Sai why Danzō has called out for Sasuke's assassination, which shocks Sai since he was not made aware of the fact.

The mention of Sasuke's name has the trio held at sword point by
Karui
 and
Omoi
, who stuns them by revealing that Sasuke kidnapped their
master
 and is a member of the Akatsuki. As Sakura begins to cry, the two
Kumo
-nin berate them for not being able to understand what it feels like to know that their master may have been killed. Recalling how he felt when
Jiraiya
 died, Naruto asks whether their master is a
jinchūriki
, much to their shock. Naruto tells them that the Akatsuki capture jinchūriki alive and therefore their master is not dead yet, and notifies them that he is a jinchūriki as well. He agrees to help them look for their master, and Karui accepts his offer, asking him to debrief them about Sasuke on the way.

Elsewhere,
Taka
 continue on their path towards Konoha, only to be blocked by
Madara
. Sasuke tells Madara that Taka has left the Akatsuki, but Madara explains that they blundered in their attempt to catch the
Eight-Tails
 and thus must make amends. His associate,
Zetsu
, appears and notifies Madara that Danzō has been made Hokage, much to Sasuke's indignation, since Danzō was one of Konoha's elders who forced
Itachi
 to
massacre
 his own
clan
. Madara reveals that Konoha had been destroyed by
Pain
 while Zetsu notifies the group that a
Five Kage Summit
 has been called.
