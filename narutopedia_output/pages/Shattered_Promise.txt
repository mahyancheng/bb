"
Shattered Promise
" (
砕かれた約束
,
Kudakareta Yakusoku
) is episode 111 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Kabuto
 explains that he had killed
Rinji
 after the latter wanted to report directly to
Orochimaru
 himself as Kabuto's equal. Using his
Dead Soul Technique
 to summon Rinji's reanimated corpse, he has Rinji attack
Guren
. In order to protect
Yūkimaru
, Guren shields him with her
Crystal Release: Crimson Fruit
 and attempts to fight Rinji, only to realise that Rinji's
Bat Controlling: Ultrasonic Mind Waves
 renders her
Crystal Release
 useless. Sneaking up behind him, she disables his arms and crystallises both of them, and they tumble off the cliff and into the ocean. Believing Guren has died, Yūkimaru's anger and rage increases as he summons the
Three-Tailed Turtle
. The power boost causes the
Four-Corner Sealing Barrier
 to break as the turtle goes on a rampage.

The
Orochimaru Search Team
 find themselves about to be attacked by
Nurari
, who has
absorbed the corpses
 of his
two

comrades
.
Kakashi
 intructs
Yamato
 to bind Nurari with his
Wood Release
 while he strikes it with his
Lightning Cutter
; Kakashi, however, is forced to abandon his attack and move out of the way as the Three-Tails breaches out of the water and eliminates Nurari. Kabuto, glad that
Orochimaru
's plan of using Guren to ignite Yūkimaru's rage has worked in another way, departs in glee, leaving Naruto to deal with the enraged Yūkimaru. As there is a barrier preventing him from reaching Yūkimaru and the Three-Tails is heading their way, Naruto decides to deal with the
tailed beast
 on his own.

Due to the fact that his
Rasengan
 fails to land a blow and his
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
 is forbidden, he
summons

Gamakichi
 and
Gamatatsu
 in order to use his
Wind Release: Toad Gun
. However, Gamakichi reminds him to use his head, as the turtle is amphibious and lives in a lake and would not be affected by a
Water Release
 technique, even it is augmented by
Wind Release
. Naruto remembers his training with Yamato, in which Yamato had told him about
Nature Transformation
 and how each elements had their weaknesses, and how he was a perfect match for
Sasuke
 since his wind would augment Sasuke's
Fire Release
. He exclaims that he has a plan to combine his wind with fire before realising that none of them possess fire and that fire does not beat water. Gamakichi, however, tells him that he knows how to use Fire Release and that fire with a high enough intensity should be able to evaporate water.

Under Gamakichi's instructions, Gamatatsu heads back
home
 in order to ingest toad oil as Naruto summons him back a minute later. Using the same principle behind his Wind Release: Toad Gun, Naruto infuses his wind chakra with Gamatatsu's
Toad Oil Bullet
 to create a new
cooperation ninjutsu
 technique —
Wind Release: Toad Oil Bullet
. They then aim their technique towards the Three-Tails' weak spot, his eye, only for the Three-Tails to counter with his
Water Release: Great Water Mass Bullet
. Gamakichi uses his
Fire Release: Flame Bullet
 in conjunction with Naruto and Gamatatsu's to create another new technique —
Wind Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet
. The three-way collaborative technique proves hot enough to evaporate the Three-Tails attack and to temporarily defeat it. With their problem being dealt with for the time being, the toads dispel themselves as the barrier surrounding Yūkimaru fades away.
