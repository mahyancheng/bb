 manga.

Summary

Having finished reminiscing about his childhood,
Kabuto
 tells the brothers that after assimilating
Orochimaru
's DNA, he continued to add things to himself and that as his pawns were a show of his own power and that he would not allow
Itachi
 to oppose him. Even though Itachi rejects what Kabuto says, Kabuto presses on with his attack. As
Sakon
 emerges from the base of his navel snake, he has him use his
Attack of the Twin Demons
 technique to transform into
Jirōbō
, who then uses the
Earth Release: Earth Shore Return
 technique to part the circle of flames that the Uchiha siblings had created around themselves. Giving them no time to react, he brings forth
Kidōmaru
 next and has him use the
Spider Web Unrolling
 technique to trap the brothers — who use
Amaterasu
 to incinerate the uncuttable web. Moving behind the brothers and producing
Kimimaro
 next, he has him use the
Dance of the Seedling Fern
 technique to block the area behind them while also creating another web in front of them, effectively caging the brothers in. After they manage to escape, Kabuto uses
Tayuya
 and her
Demonic Flute: Phantom Sound Chains
 technique to attack the siblings with an auditory genjutsu effectively incapacitating them. Bringing forth Orochimaru himself finally, Kabuto has him transform into his white snake form and attack the brothers. They however find
a way

to escape
 the
genjutsu
 and fend the snake off by casting genjutsu on each other. Kabuto, however, appears from the mouth of the snake with a surprise attack and
bisects
 Itachi, stating that a genius that has had everything would not understand him wanting to find his true self and then declared that no one would stand in his way with this.
