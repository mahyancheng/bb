Interlude

In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths

After
Konohagakure
 and Sunagakure decided to host a joint
Chūnin Exams
, Mijin and his teammates went to Konohagakure where the first exams would be held. Once entering the exams, Mijin and his teammates were randomly split into different rooms to take the written test. On a monitor,
Shikamaru Nara
 explained that everyone only needs to answer one question on the test, but their team's combined score must equal exactly 100 points to pass. While everyone began to panic on how to pass, Sajin contacted Mijin and Mujin with his
Sand Characters
, telling them which question to answer.

After everyone answered and time was up, Shikamaru revealed a bonus question. The question asked who the team would sacrifice in a situation that requires a decoy, noting that while the answer had to be unanimous to pass, that the person picked will be disqualified. Mijin was communicated by Sajin to be the sacrifice, much to his dismay yet reluctantly agreed to do so.
