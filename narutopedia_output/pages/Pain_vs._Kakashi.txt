"
Pain vs. Kakashi
" (
ペインvsカカシ
,
Pein tai Kakashi
) is episode 159 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Kakashi
 engages in combat against the
Deva Path
, attempting to strike it with his
Lightning Cutter
. Using his
Rinnegan
,
Pain
 is able to disrupt Kakashi, who loses focus and is thus unable to strike Pain. Using the Deva Path's
Shinra Tensei
 ability, Pain repels Kakashi, causing an explosion. Amidst the rubble, Kakashi emerges, and proceeds to use his
Lightning Release: Lightning Beast Tracking Fang
 to attack the Deva Path, although the attack is blocked by the arrival of the
Asura Path
. Using his
Banshō Ten'in
 technique, Pain pulls Kakashi towards the Asura Path's blade, impaling him and seemingly killing him.

The impaled Kakashi turns out to be none other than a
Lightning Release shadow clone
, while the real Kakashi surfaces from the rubble. He is joined by reinforcements, consisting of
Chōji
,
Chōza
 and
Shitō Akimichi
 of the
Akimichi clan
, as well as
three

other

shinobi
. Chōji and Chōza use their
Partial Multi-Size Technique
 to crush the Asura Path as the other three attempt to take out the Deva Path, only for Pain to use its Shinra Tensei to repel and subsequently kill them. Kakashi realises that the Deva Path has a recharge period of five seconds between attacks, and decides to take advantage of the interval by attempting to kill Pain with his Lightning Cutter, only for the Asura Path, who is still able to move, to shield the Deva Path with its body. Wanting to take advantage of the interval once more, Kakashi throws a chain underground and uses his
Earth Release: Hiding Like a Mole Technique
 to
attack
 Pain, but the Deva Path counters with Shinra Tensei to repel Kakashi. Kakashi uses the chain to bind Pain while Chōji and Chōza use their
Double Human Bullet Tank
 to crush the Deva Path. However, Pain manages to repel both Akimichi clan members, with Chōza shielding Chōji with his body.

Discerning that the trapped Kakashi is not a
shadow clone
, Pain's Deva Path uses a nail from a wooden board and fires it at Kakashi's head, seemingly killing him. The Deva Path then leaves, unaware that Chōji is still alive. Chōji notices his father's body and cries, mourning his father's death. Kakashi, who is barely alive, orders Chōji to mourn later and to take the opportunity to report the Deva Path's abilities to
Tsunade
, who is channelling her chakra
along with

Katsuyu
 in order to heal the wounded. As Chōji runs, the Asura Path, who is still alive, fires a
missile
 at him, intending to kill him. Kakashi depletes his remaining chakra to activate his
Mangekyō Sharingan
, using its
Kamui
 ability to warp the missile away; the Asura Path realises that Kakashi had used Kamui to warp away the nail that was fired at him earlier. Kakashi then dies from his wounds and lack of chakra, eager to see
Obito
,
Rin
 and
Minato
 in the afterlife, although he ends up encountering
his father
, who asks Kakashi to share his tale.

Katsuyu reports to Tsunade that Kakashi has died, causing Tsunade to temporarily stop her technique so she could vent her anger and frustration out. As Chōji delivers the Deva Path's profile and abilities, Tsunade thanks him and tells him that Chōza is still alive, and to bring him to the
hospital
. Chōji asks if Kakashi is alive as well, only for Tsunade to walk away.

Trivia

Ino
 is missing her elbow warmers in one scene.
