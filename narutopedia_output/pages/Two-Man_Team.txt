"
Two-Man Team
" (
ツーマンセル
,
Tsū Man Seru
) is episode 329 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Naruto
 succeeds in removing and destroying
Son
's
chakra receiver
, but is upset on learning that Son still isn't free. Son leaves him a gift before being resealed into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
. Intent on going full-out,
Tobi
 has all the other
jinchūriki
 fully transform into their tailed beasts.
Kurama
 offers to lend Naruto more of its power, and is annoyed that Naruto thanks it for the earlier help against Madara. Naruto and Kurama meld their chakra, and Naruto notifies
B
 and
Gyūki
 that they still have a lot of power left to use.
 Gyūki wonders if Naruto and Kurama are cooperating. Naruto acknowledges Kurama as a comrade from
Konohagakure
, opening the
gates
 restricting it. Newly empowered, Naruto deflects five
Tailed Beast Balls
 fired against Guy and Kakashi, changes into a full tailed beast form, and begins attacking the tailed beasts, having created a clone to locate their chakra receivers. The five tailed beasts make a collaborative Tailed Beast Ball, which Naruto matches with one of his own, sending the attacks into the sky. He sends clones through Kurama's chakra arms to remove the chakra receivers. Upon touching them, Naruto finds himself in a mental plane, along with Kurama, the other tailed beasts, and their jinchūriki. They talk, all of them introducing themselves to Naruto, and telling him about their earlier talk with
Rōshi
 and Son. The tailed beasts each gift Naruto with a bit of their chakra, and Kurama recalls their last moments with the
Sage of the Six Paths
 long ago. As Naruto removes the chakra receivers, Kurama asks the others if they agree that Naruto is the one the Sage spoke of, to which they agree. Naruto's tailed beast transformation ends, and Tobi reseals the other tailed beasts into the statue again, noting that nothing about Naruto's predicament has changed. Naruto denies this, explaining he learned many difficult names.

Trivia

Naruto's
Tailed Beast Mode
 design has an extra circle in the middle of the seal's location.

To bridge the anime's continuity, both
Utakata
 and
Isobu
 – who had
previously

encountered
 Naruto – had an extra line stating they've met Naruto before.
