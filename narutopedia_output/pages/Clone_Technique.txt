This article is about the actual ninjutsu. For the classification of this ninjutsu, see
Clone Techniques
.

This is a basic technique that every
shinobi
 can use. In fact,
Konohagakure
's
Ninja Academy
 prevents students from graduating unless they master this technique, and it was for this reason that
Naruto Uzumaki
 failed three exams in a row. For this technique, users create one or more afterimages of themselves. Unlike most other
clone techniques
, these afterimages have no substance and thus are incapable of damaging opponents. Because of this, it is only useful for distracting enemies while other attacks are prepared.
 Opponents can identify clones from their original through careful observation, as clones won't crush grass, kick up dust, etc.
