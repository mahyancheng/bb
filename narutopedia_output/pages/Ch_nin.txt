Chūnin overseeing the Chūnin Exams.



Chūnin
 (
中忍
,
literally meaning:
 Middle Ninja,
meaning (Viz):
 Journeyman Ninja) are ninja who have reached a level of maturity and ability that primarily consists of leadership skills and tactical prowess. Chūnin are typically sent on
C-rank
 or
B-rank
 missions. Some chūnin, such as
Iruka Umino
 and
Shino Aburame
, move on to become
Academy
 teachers.

To become a chūnin,
genin
 participate in a large examination, known as the
Chūnin Exams
. Those who pass the test and become chūnin are eligible to wear an identifying
flak jacket
 that holds
ninjutsu

scrolls
. This vest is not mandatory.

As a result of the peaceful era that the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 established after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, the number of chūnin has decreased.
