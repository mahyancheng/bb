Itachi creates a
water clone
 to punch and hold the opponent. Kisame slashes them into the air while using the remains of the destroyed water clone to summon a
water shark
 to strike the opponent. The opponent falls in the wake of Itachi's
Tsukuyomi
 in which the opponent withers away as though they were water.
