"
The Secret of Jinchūriki
" (
人柱力の秘密
,
Jinchūriki no Himitsu
) is episode 16 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Team Kakashi
 and
Team Guy
 are both able to come to the conclusion that the fight they had was nothing more than a distraction to prevent them from rescuing
Gaara
.
Chiyo
 summons a mechanical bird to deliver a message to her brother
Ebizō
 regarding
Yūra
, the man used as a sacrifice for
Itachi
. Chiyo explains that for the
Akatsuki
 to use such a technique would mean that they have already begun the extraction. When
Sakura
 asks what she means, Chiyo explains that the
tailed beasts
 were often harnessed for their power by sealing them inside individuals. Those individuals would become host to the beast itself and would be able to keep the beast sealed within them while using the beast's power for themselves. Those individuals, known as
jinchūriki
, would however die if the beast was extracted from them. Chiyo explains that before Gaara,
Sunagakure
 had two jinchūriki who had
Shukaku
 sealed within them, and they died following the extraction. Sakura is angry that shinobi harnessed the power of the beasts during the war and is about to criticise the jinchūriki who were created, before stopping herself short when she realises that
Naruto
 is a jinchūriki himself. Tearful at the idea of the Akatsuki killing Naruto by extracting the
Nine-Tailed Fox
 out of him, Sakura is about to talk to Naruto when Naruto interrupts, telling them that they should be on the move if they expect to save Gaara.

In Suna,
Kankurō
 stumbles out of bed when he hears that Chiyo has sent a message. He and
Baki
 head to a
Suna Council
 meeting, where it's revealed that Yura was indeed an Akatsuki spy, thus explaining how
Sasori
 and
Deidara
 got into the village undetected. Not wanting to wait for Gaara to return, the council deliberates on choosing a new
Kazekage
. Kankurō and Baki are appalled, stating that there is nothing that proves that Gaara will not return. A councilman, however, states that Gaara being gone is perhaps best for the village, since most of the village is fearful that the One-Tail Shukaku spirit within Gaara will be unleashed upon them. The council men decide that electing a new Kazekage would bring much needed stability to the village. Kankurō protests, but he is told that once before, the
Third Kazekage
, the strongest Kazekage Suna ever had, was also kidnapped. Suna had sent many recovery teams to locate him, but they could not even locate his corpse. To make matters worse, neighbouring nations attacked their village when it became known that the Kazekage was no more. Wanting to avoid a war and believing that it is best not to have Gaara in the village, the councilman decides a new Kazekage should be the best course of action. Kankurō tells the Council that while he agrees with their points, he still cannot write off Gaara's fate since Gaara is his little brother.

Kakashi
 notices that Naruto's pace has slowed down considerably, realising that he must be wiped out from using his
Big Ball Rasengan
. Kakashi calls for a break, which Chiyo calls a wise decision. Naruto protests, but Kakashi explains that if they were to rest up and then continue, they would reach Gaara much faster than if they continued at their current pace. Kakashi also adds that Naruto would have to be at his full strength in the event that he faces those who kidnapped Gaara. Meanwhile,
Pakkun
 notices that
Guy
 is in pain, due to the toll of opening the
sixth gate
.
Lee
 asks him if he is okay, but Guy crashes into a tree branch and is knocked out.
Neji
 decides that Guy deserves some rest after using the
Morning Peacock
, and they decide to take a break as well.

Back at the Akatsuki hideout, the
Akatsuki leader
 commends Itachi and
Kisame
 for stalling the enemy. Sasori believes that he should be praised as well, since it was his two subordinates that were used as sacrifice for the
leader's technique
. The leader claims that it his technique that did the trick and that his two subordinates should be thankful for the opportunity to serve the Akatsuki, albeit a very brief opportunity. The leader then asks for a status report from Itachi. Itachi states that the
Konoha
 shinobi were none another than Kakashi Hatake, Sakura Haruno and the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tailed Fox, Naruto Uzumaki, along with Suna shinobi Lady Chiyo. Sasori is surprised to hear that his grandmother is on their pursuit. The leader of the Akatsuki then orders
Zetsu
 to find the corpses of the sacrifices and to dispose of them.
