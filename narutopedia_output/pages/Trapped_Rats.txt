Viz:
 Trapped Like Rats!!) is chapter 62 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Team Oboro
 surrounds
Team 7
 and
Kabuto
 with their
mist clones
. Although the clones are apparently able to attack their enemies, all counter-attacks pass through them. With his
Sharingan
,
Sasuke
 realises that the clones are only an illusion and thus are not actually able to attack, the hiding members of Team Oboro merely synchronising their own attacks with that of the clones. Intending to make this a battle of clones,
Naruto
 creates a group of
shadow clones
 that fight the mist clones through out the night. Later that morning, when Team 7 and Kabuto appear exhausted, Team Oboro reveals themselves so that they can take a scroll. The real Sasuke,
Sakura
, and Kabuto then confront them, having switched places with disguised shadow clones during the night so that they could rest.
