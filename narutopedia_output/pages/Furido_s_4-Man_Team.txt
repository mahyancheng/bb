A team led by
Kazuma
, who during the time beared the alias Furido (
フリド
), was formed to try to once again overthrow the
Hokage
, believing that the
Land of Fire
 should have only one head of state, the
daimyō
. Kazuma
resurrected
 four
lightning
-
chakra
 users from the
Twelve Guardian Ninja
, intending to use
Limelight
 to destroy
Konoha
. When one of the four resurrected was defeated, he released the others and tried to use
his son
, but that failed as well. All members of the team were ultimately killed by Konoha-nin.

Trivia

All the member's names (though Kazuma's was an alias) begin with "Fu" (
フ
).
