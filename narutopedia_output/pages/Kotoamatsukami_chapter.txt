Summary

Itachi's crow
 flies out of
Naruto
's mouth.
Itachi
 attempts to use
Amaterasu
 on Naruto but the crow locks the eyes with Itachi causing him to stop. Itachi then uses Amaterasu on
Nagato
's
dog summon
 and then turns to use it on Nagato himself and the
bird summon
. Itachi explains to Naruto why the crow has a
Mangekyō Sharingan
 and how he got it.
Shisui Uchiha
 had given his Sharingan to Itachi and wanted him to use it to protect
Konoha
. Kabuto overhears the conversation and states that his luck keeps getting better. Nagato uses
Shinra Tensei
 to free himself from Itachi's flames, and Kabuto seemingly removes his personality. Nagato sneaks behind Naruto with his
chameleon summon
 and uses Shinra Tensei once again to attack
Killer B
 and Naruto. Nagato appears behind B and tries to attack him, but B goes into his
Version 2
 transformation and counters Nagato's attack with a
Tailed Beast Lariat
. Nagato uses the
Preta Path's ability
 to absorb B's chakra, which leads Nagato to regain a youthful appearance. Nagato then grabs hold of Naruto and uses the
Human Path technique
.
