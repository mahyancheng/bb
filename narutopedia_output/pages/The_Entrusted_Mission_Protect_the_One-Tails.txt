 anime.

Synopsis

After
Sasuke
 was teleported to another dimension,
Boruto
 tries to attack
Urashiki
, but is stopped by
Gaara
, who takes him to a safe location. Gaara
binds
 Boruto and explains to him that Urashiki is an
Ōtsutsuki
 and he has no chance against Urashiki. Urashiki takes advantage of attacking an exhausted Gaara, but he is saved by
Shinki
 and
Shukaku
. Shinki attacks Urashiki with his
Iron Sand
 but Urashiki evades it with ease. Shukaku uses his
Wind Release
 to try to push Urashiki away and grab him with his paws, but Urashiki evades him. Gaara uses his
Desert Layered Imperial Funeral Seal
 to seal Urashiki temporarily with Urashiki stating that he will "just bide his time patiently".
Kankurō
,
Yodo
, and
Araya
 arrives after hearing news that Urashiki plans on targeting Shukaku.

Gaara gives a mission to Kankurō, Shinki, and Boruto to take Shukaku who at first refuses to be sealed in a tea kettle but later goes in willingly, to
Naruto
 in
Konohagakure
 to keep him safe. At first Shinki refuses because of Boruto's immaturity and because Shukaku belongs to
Sunagakure
 but relents when Boruto is the only one who knows Konohagakure's terrain. Gaara states that Shinki can learn something from Boruto from what Boruto has that Shinki does not. Yodo and Araya will take Gaara back to Sunagakure to be healed. Kankurō, Shinki, and Boruto head out with Shukaku clinging onto Boruto's back for the first portion of the trip.

Kankurō, Shinki, and Boruto arrive at an abandoned wind generation building in hopes of finding communications but instead finds a map of routes leading to Konohagakure. Shinki later scolds Boruto for allowing Shukaku to trick him into letting Shukaku wander off to think that he needed to urinate when Shukaku just wanted to relax. Shinki takes charge in keeping Shukaku safe within his Iron Sand armour. As Kankurō, Shinki, and Boruto head out, they are sensed by enemy
puppets
. Kankurō instructs Shinki and Boruto to go on ahead while he takes down the enemy puppets with his own puppets and the two departs.
