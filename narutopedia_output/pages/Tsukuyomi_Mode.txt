This technique is a variation of
Tsukuyomi
, a high-level
genjutsu
. The user transforms the Tsukuyomi into a barrier that slows the opponent down. This does not happen physically but rather mentally. It makes the opponent think they are being held back by a barrier. While using this technique, Itachi's health and chakra slowly drain.

Trivia

In
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes
, Itachi used this technique without any health drawbacks or range-limits.
