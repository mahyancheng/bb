"
Granny Chiyo and Sakura
" (
チヨバアとサクラ
,
Chiyo-Baa to Sakura
) is chapter 265 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Chiyo
 informs
Sakura
 that
Sasori
 is hiding within
Hiruko
, a
puppet
 used as his armour. Sakura believes that Chiyo, as Sasori's grandmother, will have useful knowledge of Sasori's puppets, but they have been apart for too long for this to be the case. They must also be wary of the fact that Sasori's entire arsenal is likely coated with poison. Chiyo is nevertheless confident in their success. Meanwhile,
Deidara
 informs
Naruto
 and
Kakashi
 that Sasori is stronger than he is and suggests they go back to help. Sasori attacks, but Sakura dodges his attacks with unusual
dexterity
 and
destroys
 Hiruko.
