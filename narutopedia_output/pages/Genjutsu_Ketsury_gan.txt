By establishing direct skin or eye contact with a target, the user can lock them within a
genjutsu
 for one of various purposes. They can brainwash them into mindless drones with a set order to follow, or trap them into a dream-like state. For more defensive means, this technique can create a powerful barrier against mind reading, protecting information from being acquired. In the novel, it also allows the user to place genjutsu guards upon their mind and see through the target's memories.
