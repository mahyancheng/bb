When Naruto first obtained
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
, his
previous seal
's outward appearance had changed into a shape of a
magatama
, along with a swirl design that resembled
Uzushiogakure
's symbol.

By using the seal's key, he can create several massive interlocking torii that can even immobilise and imprison
Kurama
 with ease. Naruto then isolated Kurama's chakra in another part of him away from the fox itself in between four torii, so he could access it freely.
 It was later revealed that Kurama isn't always bound by the torii and has freedom of movement behind its cage, but Naruto can enter the cage without breaking the seal and still manipulate the torii to immobilise the fox if he wants.

Trivia

A
torii
 (
鳥居
,
literally meaning:
 bird perch) is a traditional Japanese gate most commonly found at Buddhist temples and Shintō shrines, where it symbolically marks the entrance to a sacred area. Torii were traditionally made from wood or stone, but today they can also be made of reinforced concrete, copper, stainless steel, or other materials. They are usually either unpainted or painted vermilion with a black upper lintel. Located in Kyoto,
Fushimi Inari-taisha
, which is the head shrine of the Shintō
kami

Inari
, is very well known to hold thousands of such torii.

When this seal was made, Kurama made an allusion to the
Sage of Six Paths
, but never finished its statement.
