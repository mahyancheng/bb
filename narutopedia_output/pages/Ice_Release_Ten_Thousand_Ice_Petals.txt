The user unleashes a barrage of ice darts. The intensity of the cold is so great, that should a person attempt to block them, it will cause severe damage to the afflicted limb. The user can also use this defensively by creating a wall of ice to create distance between the user and their combatant.

The hardness of the ice itself along with its momentum is dangerous. A metal sliding door on a
Thunder Rail
 car was severely dented and deformed when it buckled under an onslaught until it was torn from its frame and railings.
