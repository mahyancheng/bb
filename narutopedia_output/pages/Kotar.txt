This article is about the medicinal drug. For the Konoha Military Police Force captain, see
Kōtarō Fūma
.

Kotarō
 (
虎打狼
) is a form of
saigenzai
 that was originally created by
Tenma Kodon
 as a way to
control

Rōen
. It can only be produced within the bodies of
Kodon clansmen
: by consuming a plant that grows in abundance around the
Howling Wolf Village
, the Kodon's body starts to produce Kotarō. The Kodon can exhale the Kotarō as a purple cloud that induces
genjutsu
-like effects in anyone who breathes it in. It smells like
cape jasmines
.

If Kotarō is mixed with other herbs and medicinal plants, a powerful medicine can be produced with different potencies depending on how it's prepared:

Refined (
上品
,
Jōhin
) - its weakest form but which has zero side effects when taken.

Medium (
中品
,
Chūhin
) - its middle form which has no side effects if taken in moderation.

Coarse (
下品
,
Gehin
) - its strongest form but with guaranteed and powerful side effects, with symptoms varying depending on how it is taken.

Itachi Uchiha
 used the coarse form of Kotarō as an eye drop in order to extend his life, though it caused temporary blindness.
Sasuke Uchiha
 also uses this to eliminate eye irritation as his
Mangekyō Sharingan
 awakens.
