The user tightly clasps their hands together and extends their middle and index fingers, resembling the Tiger
hand seal
.
 Using the full weight of their body, the user thrusts these four fingers between the target's buttocks. Despite the technique's dramatic name, it is not actually harmful. The pain is fairly extreme, however, so much so that, when
Kakashi Hatake
 uses it on
Naruto Uzumaki
, Naruto comically leaps into the air,
 travelling a fair distance.
Sakura Haruno
 blushes to see it used and
Sasuke Uchiha
 declares both Kakashi and Naruto "buffoons".
 The anime shows those who are familiar with One Thousand Years of Death are very unwilling to be subjected to it.
 It has no effect on unconscious targets.

Naruto later uses this technique against
Gaara
. Instead of his fingers, Naruto uses a
kunai
 with an
exploding tag
 attached. Unlike previous responses to the technique,
Pakkun
 calls Naruto's attack "brilliant".
