With this technique, a countless number of summoned
snakes
 crawl out of
Orochimaru
's mouth and hunt down the enemy. With such overwhelming numbers, a true "wall of snakes" is formed, making defence and evasion meaningless. The enemy can do nothing but become buried by the snakes. The snakes can bite the enemy with their
poison
 fangs and open their mouths to extend
Kusanagi
-like blades, making them even more deadly. Furthermore, when the inexhaustibly crawling snakes gather together, they become a defensive wall, and can block any kind of attack.

Trivia

Mandara
 is the Japanese pronunciation of the word
mandala
, a concentric diagram with great spiritual and ritual significance in both Buddhism and Hinduism. It's written as 曼陀羅 in kanji. The first kanji is pronounced the same as the kanji for
ten thousand
 (
万
) and actually overlaps somewhat in meaning. The second kanji bears a strong resemblance to the kanji for
snake
 (
蛇
). The last kanji is the same in both words and means
silk
, or
gauze
. However, it is only used for its sound.

This technique is part of other technique that appears in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 5
, called "Uwabami", but the snakes that Orochimaru spits don't spits swords, but instead attack the opponent like a tsunami.
