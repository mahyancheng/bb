Kigiri can produce an extremely thick smokescreen which immediately makes the opponent cough and blinds them, it also covers up the scent of the user and his allies. He may then attack at free will. The caster and those who have been specially trained for it can see clearly through the smokescreen. This also makes fleeing from battle or hiding quite easy.
