The
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 (
外道魔像
,
Gedō Mazō
,
English TV:
 Gedo Statue) is the husk of the
Ten-Tails
 that remained after its
chakra
 was separated from its body.
 It was
sealed
 in the
moon
 by
Hagoromo
 and
Hamura Ōtsutsuki
,
 where it remained until
Madara Uchiha
 awakened the
Rinnegan
. This allowed him to break the seal and
summon
 the statue down to
Earth
,
 where it was used as a container for the
tailed beasts
 captured by
Akatsuki
.

Background






The Demonic Statue sealed in the moon.



At the conclusion of their battle with the Ten-Tails, the brothers Hagoromo and Hamura Ōtsutsuki used
Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei
 to transform the beast into the core of the newly-formed moon,
 while also extracting the beast's chakra and sealing it in Hagoromo.
 Hamura then took leadership of the
Ōtsutsuki clan
 and migrated to the moon in order to guard the Ten-Tails' husk.
 A millenium later, Madara Uchiha awakened the Rinnegan, which allowed him to break the seal and summon the husk out of the moon.

Madara used the husk, which he named the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, as a
catalyst
 to cultivate
Hashirama Senju
's cells, producing a
non-sentient clone of Hashirama
 housed within a gigantic flowering tree. He was then able to live beyond his natural lifespan by attaching himself to the tree, which served as a means of life support by continuously supplying him with the Demonic Statue's chakra.
 Madara believed that the combination of the Demonic Statue and Hashirama's cells caused
artificial humans
 to grow on the tree's branches,
 but in actuality,
Black Zetsu
 was secretly removing them from inside the statue, where they had been stored for centuries.
 At some point, Madara transplanted his Rinnegan into
Nagato
 without the boy's knowledge, making him the only other person capable of summoning the statue.
 When
Obito Uchiha
 later agreed to continue Madara's
Eye of the Moon Plan
 following his death, the elderly
Uchiha
 explained that he must revive the Ten-Tails by sealing the nine tailed beasts inside the statue. Madara then disconnected himself from the statue's chakra, and with his dying breath, told the young Uchiha that he was to act using his name until the time of his
resurrection
.






The Demonic Statue summoned by Nagato.



In the anime, during the
Third Shinobi World War
, Nagato unconsciously summoned the Demonic Statue in a fit of rage when
his friends
 were injured in an enemy ambush, though he quickly regained his senses and fell unconscious, at which point the statue disappeared.
 An enraged and grief-fuelled Nagato later summoned the Demonic Statue after being forced to kill
Yahiko
 by
Hanzō
. The statue pierced Nagato's back with
black receivers
 and drained his life force,
 leaving him permanently emaciated while also granting him a means of killing Hanzō's men, with only Hanzō himself escaping the altercation alive.
 As Pain, Nagato would summon the Demonic Statue whenever a
jinchūriki
 or tailed beast was captured by Akatsuki so that the organisation's members could
seal
 the beast inside it.

Appearance






The statue's full appearance.



The Demonic Statue is a giant, earthen-coloured humanoid entity with a mummified appearance, a body shaped similar to a robe, and a number of spike-like protrusions on its back. It towers over even the tailed beasts, with
Gyūki
 only reaching its chin, and
Akimichi clan
 members at their
maximum size
; it is nearly half the size of a
tall mountain
.
 The statue has nine eyes the size of an adult man, which usually remain closed.
 When opened, the eyes are featureless and white, but one gains a light blue iris each time a tailed beast is sealed inside the statue. After being summoned by Madara, the statue initially wore a blindfold that completely covered its eyes, but the blindfold gained holes for each of its eyes sometime after Nagato's encounter with Hanzō. The statue's wrists and ankles are usually bound by shackles and it bites down on a scroll, which is held in place by two ropes extending from beneath its blindfold on either side of its head. When summoned into battle, the statue breaks free of its restraints, causing the scroll in its mouth to hang from the left rope like an earring. During its transformation into the Ten-Tails, the statue's mouth widens and the protrusions on its back extend and warp in shape.

Abilities






The statue overpowering the nine tailed beasts.



The Demonic Statue can only be
summoned
 through the use of the Rinnegan; artificial Rinnegan created by the
Impure World Reincarnation
 will not suffice.
 Though incapable of summoning the statue, non-wielders who possess the powers of both
Uchiha
 and
Senju
 are still able to control it.
 The statue's summoning can also be performed through the
Six Paths of Pain
.
 Instead of requiring a blood offering like other
summons
, the Demonic Statue drains its summoner's life force when not fuelled by Tailed Beasts, a process which Nagato was able to survive due to his
Uzumaki
 lineage, though he was left permanently emaciated.
 However, both Obito and Madara could summon the statue without any adverse effects, the latter even using a blood offering to do so.

Life Force and Physical Prowess

The Demonic Statue emanates a tremendous life force, enabling a jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails to survive the extraction of all nine tailed beasts as long as the statue remains inside them, though they will still be greatly weakened and rendered paralysed for several months.
 Madara was able to use the statue as a catalyst to cultivate Hashirama's cells into a gigantic tree,
 as well as extend his lifespan by continuously absorbing the statue's chakra.
 The
White Zetsu
 were also able to access its power by connecting themselves to the tree, which
one
 did to augment his strength, enabling him to break a massive boulder.

As evident from its enormous size, the statue possesses great physical strength, enough to clash with the likes of
Chōza
 and
Chōji Akimichi
 in their
colossal forms
. It is durable enough to take one of Chōji's
Butterfly Bullet Bombing
 punches without being pushed back, as well as stop
Kitsuchi
's
Earth Release: Sandwich Technique
 by simply outstretching its arms. It also displayed a high level of agility despite its massive size, as it could leap tremendous distances.

Ninjutsu






The phantom dragon extracting chakra.



The Demonic Statue is able to emit phantom dragons formed out of
absorption chakra
 from its mouth, which are capable of instantly extracting the chakra of anyone they touch.
 The members of Akatsuki utilised a
fūinjutsu
 in which
nine dragons
 would surround a jinchūriki or tailed beast for a period of several days until all of the tailed beast's chakra had been sealed inside the statue.
 The tailed beasts must be sealed in order to some degree, as the statue will crumble if the
Nine-Tails
 is not sealed last.
 Nagato intended to use the sealed tailed beast chakra to create a
kinjutsu
 weapon capable of destroying an entire country.

The Demonic Statue is also capable of emitting
chakra chains
 from its mouth. The chains have a
cursed seal
 that suppresses the power of tailed beasts,
 and can be used to both extract them from their jinchūriki and quickly seal them inside the statue.
 The statue also serves as a source of black receivers, which can emerge from its torso in a manner similar to an umbilical cord.
 Using black receivers, Obito was able to temporarily redirect the chakra of the tailed beasts inside the statue into his Six Paths of Pain, then quickly withdraw the beasts into the statue using its chains.
 The statue can also create shock waves capable of devastating an entire battlefield, as well as launch bolts of chakra from the protrusions on its back.

The statue being used to extract Shukaku from Gaara.



When
Sasori
 and
Deidara
 arrived in an Akatsuki hideout with
Gaara
, Pain summoned the Demonic Statue to
extract and seal
 the
One-Tailed Shukaku
. When the sealing began, the bit fell from the statue's mouth and nine dragon-like entities burst forth, encompassing the jinchūriki's body. As the sealing neared completion, the statue's eyes opened and the eye corresponding to Shukaku gained its iris and pupil. After three days, the sealing concluded and the statue disappeared.

After accepting the terms of
Kabuto Yakushi
's alliance, Tobi revealed to him the statue located in the depths of his
headquarters
, seated atop the giant flowering tree that harbours
Hashirama's clone
. Directing Kabuto's vision downward to the tree's roots housed in a deeper underground cave, Tobi presented the
army of White Zetsu clones
 that he had supposedly created using the chakra of the tailed beasts imprisoned within the statue.

The statue summoned to the battlefield.



During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Tobi summoned the Demonic Statue to the battlefield in order to obtain a substitute for the Nine-Tails, and it proceeded to rampage against the
Allied Shinobi Forces
'
First Division
 as
Chōza
 and
Chōji Akimichi
 used their
Super Multi-Size Technique
 to combat it. However, the statue withstood their combined assault and unleashed a shock wave following a bellowing roar, sending the two of them reeling. In the wake of its destruction and in retaliation to
Kitsuchi
's
Earth Release: Sandwich Technique
, it released powerful bolts of chakra, further devastating the battlefield. The statue then attempted to crush
Darui
 and
Shikamaru Nara
 underfoot when they tried to prevent Tobi from taking the
Benihisago
 and
Kohaku no Jōhei
 before disappearing. Retreating to a forested area, Tobi stood upon the statue's palms alongside his new
Six Paths of Pain
 as dawn broke on the second day of the war.

Later, when
Son Gokū
 was freed from Tobi's control during his confrontation with
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Killer B
, he immediately summoned the statue to his location, where it proceeded to draw the
bound
 tailed beast back into its awaiting maw. As Tobi continued to observe the ensuing battle from atop the statue, he was ultimately forced to reseal the remaining tailed beasts in the same manner as Son when they too were freed by Naruto. The statue then remained on the battlefield, aiding Tobi in his fight against Naruto, B,
Kakashi Hatake
 and
Might Guy
.

The statue transforming into the Ten-Tails.



After a combined assault from Naruto, B, Kakashi and Guy knocked the statue down, Naruto's goading prompted Tobi to summon the Kohaku no Jōhei and Benihisago and feed them to the statue, allowing it to consume the Nine-Tails' chakra sealed within the relics. Having previously sealed a portion of the Eight-Tails' chakra, the Demonic Statue contained all nine tailed beasts' chakra and began painfully regressing to its original form. Refusing to let anyone interfere, Obito protected the statue with the
Uchiha Flame Formation
 long before Madara's arrival on the battlefield. Realising that
Gyūki
 and Kurama had not been sealed into the statue like the other tailed beasts, Madara attempted to correct this before the statue could finish its transformation.

As a final attempt to eradicate the statue, a
transformed
 Naruto and B produced a giant collaborative
Tailed Beast Ball
 and launched it at the statue. Noting that the statue's evil chakra had vanished, they began celebrating before the smoke cleared and the resurrected Ten-Tails was revealed.

The statue summoned after losing an arm.



After the Allied Shinobi Forces managed to extract the tailed beasts from Obito, the statue remained sealed inside him. Its life force kept Obito alive, despite the severe debilitation caused by the extraction. After regaining one of his original Rinnegan, Madara was able to summon the statue out of Obito's body, though Kakashi's quick use of
Kamui
 did sever its right arm. Under Madara's control, the statue then sealed all of the tailed beasts using its
chakra chains
 and opened its eyes as it began transforming once more. Madara subsequently cancelled the statue's summoning to await the Ten-Tails' revival.

When
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 was subdued by Naruto and Sasuke's
Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei
, the tailed beasts and Madara's unconscious form escaped from her body, which then reverted back to the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path. The statue was then sealed in the core of the new moon alongside
Black Zetsu
, left isolated in Kaguya's
core dimension
.

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Demonic Statue of the Outer Path

Gedō
 (
外道
,
literally meaning:
 Outer Path), derived from the Sanskrit
Tīrthika
, refers to any doctrine which "treads the outer path" to enlightenment. This is opposed to the teachings of orthodox Buddhism, the
Naidō
 (
内道
,
literally meaning:
 Inner Path), and is thus considered misguided and heretical, resulting in an alternate translation of the statue's name being the
Demonic Statue of Heretical Doctrine
.

The decayed appearance of the statue and its posture when not in use resemble
Sokushinbutsu
 (
即身仏
), a practice by Buddhist monks to commit ritualistic suicide by self-mummification.

When Tobi first tells the story of the
Sage of Six Paths
 and the Ten-Tails at the
Five Kage Summit
, he claims the Sage single-handedly sealed the beast inside himself, then later separated its chakra from its body and sealed its husk in the moon at the end of his life.
 However, it is later revealed that Hagoromo and Hamura sealed the beast inside the moon together while they were still young.

Toneri Ōtsutsuki
 recounts a version of events similar to Tobi's in the novelisation of
The Last: Naruto the Movie
.

Strangely,
Kurama
 implies that Hagoromo was able to survive the
creation
 and extraction of the nine tailed beasts because of the life force of the Demonic Statue inside him,
 even though the statue had been sealed in the moon decades earlier.

In the manga, the shackles on the Demonic Statue's ankles are missing in all appearances following
chapter 512
.

In the anime, the
Genjutsu World
 version of the statue was capable of using the
Tailed Beast Ball
.

When the Demonic Statue reappeared during Kaguya's
sealing
, it appeared to have both its arms despite previously losing its right arm to
Kakashi
's
Kamui
. It was also depicted with only one eye, despite having nine in previous appearances.
