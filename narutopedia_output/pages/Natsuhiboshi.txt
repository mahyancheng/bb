English

Summer Star, Why are you so red.

Because, I had a sad dream last night.

My eyes are red from the tears I've shed.

Swollen as I cried.

Summer Star, Why've you lost your way?

I'm searching for a child whose gone afar.

He can't be found, though I've searched all day.

My sad dreams come once more.

Summer Star, Why are you so red.

Because, I had a sad dream last night.

Swollen as I cried.

I'm searching for a child whose gone afar.

He can't be found, though I've searched all day.

My sad dreams come once more.
