"
Record of the Gutsy Ninja Master and Student
" (
ド根性師弟忍風録
,
Dokonjō Shitei Ninpūroku
) is episode 188 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Kandachi
 finds it odd that a child like
Tanishi
 managed to capture one of the legendary
Sannin
.
Jiraiya
 recognises Kandachi as the right hand man of
Hanzō
, the ruler of
Amegakure
, and asks what Kandachi is doing taking over the
Genjutsu Tree Village
. Declaring that Ame has no ruler, Kandachi prepares to thank Tanishi for bringing him Jiraiya, only for the real Tanishi to show up.
Naruto
 undoes his
Transformation Technique
, and believing that Tanishi was an accomplice, Kandachi decides to kill the hostages, including Tanishi's mother.

Kandachi
summons
 the
Conch King
 to devour the hostages, but Jiraiya manages to sever the ropes holding the hostages in their cages with his
Fire Release: Flame Bullet
. With the hostages rescued, Naruto attempts to strike the Conch King with his
Rasengan
, only to fail as the Conch King's defensive shell is able to withstand its impact. Naruto is whipped repeatedly with the
Conch Whip
, prompting Tanishi to remember how his father was killed in the same fashion and how he viewed his father and Naruto for being fools for defying Kandachi. Jiraiya and Naruto are placed under the Conch King's
Water Release Genjutsu: Demonic Phantom Fog Prison
, which neither of them are able to break out of naturally. However, Tanishi, deciding to be a fool like Naruto, frees them with his
Chilli Pepper Bombs
, which are able to dissipate the effects of
genjutsu
.

Jiraiya restrains Kandachi and the Conch King with his
Needle Jizō
 while Naruto continues to form his Rasengan until it grows into a
Big Ball Rasengan
, which he uses to defeat the Conch King and knock out Kandachi. With Kandachi and his goons defeated, the village is restored back under the villagers' control. As Naruto and Jiraiya leave the village, Jiraiya reminisces how Naruto reminds him of his father,
Minato
. An apparition of Minato tells Jiraiya that since he had viewed Jiraiya as his father, Naruto would be a grandson to him. Jiraiya proclaims out loud that Naruto is his grandson and attempts to hug him, only for Naruto to be disturbed by his affection and push him away.

Trivia

When Jiraiya asks Kandachi if he deserted his village, Kandachi answers there's no longer a leader in the village, meaning Hanzō was overthrown, but when Jiraiya infiltrates Ame a few years later, he initially believed that Hanzō was still the village leader.
