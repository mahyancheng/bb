She was the former leader of the
Nadeshiko Village
 and
Shizuka
's mentor.

Background

One night, decades ago, she encountered
Jiraiya
 who had entered her village to do "research" for his next novel. After he escaped, she pursued him and challenged him to a duel for his hand in marriage. As the match dragged on into the next day, Jiraiya called for the match to be postponed, as neither party was making headway against the other, to which the village leader grudgingly agreed. Jiraiya promised that their students instead should one day seek each other out and fight if the two never met again. This promise fell to her student Shizuka and Jiraiya's last pupil
Naruto Uzumaki
.

Personality

In her youth, she was a driven and somewhat confrontational individual, tracking Jiraiya for a great distance in order to fight him. While being bound by her village's traditions, she was also a kind and empathic individual with her being capable of understanding Jiraiya's feelings for
Tsunade
. She also showed a diplomatic streak, when she accepted that her and Jiraiya's battle was postponed and would possibly be taken up by their respective students, should they not be capable. In her old age, she had become quite loving and caring, offering words of wisdom to her student in regards to her love life and supporting her when
Sagiri
 was killed.

Appearance






The former village head in her youth.



She had green eyes and brown, light brown chin-length hair that covered her ears and framed her face. In her youth, she was a fairly tall woman of a curvaceous build. She wore a red pink form-fitting outfit with only a long-sleeve on her left side and an orange sash. In her old age, her hair had greyed and she wore a yellow, loose fitting kimono.

Abilities

Little is known about her abilities, but in her youth, she was undoubtedly a powerful combatant, proven from how she was able to fight against Jiraiya in his prime for an entire day, a battle that ended in a stalemate. She was also an expert tracker, able to track Jiraiya quite some distance away from her village, something the
Sannin
 praised her for. She was presumably skilled in
kenjutsu
 as it appeared to be her preferred style of combat.
