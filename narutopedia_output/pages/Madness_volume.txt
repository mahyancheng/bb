Chapter 60

"
Place to Belong
" (
居場所
,
Ibasho
)

Sai
,
Shikamaru
, and
Ibiki
 discuss
Code
's ability, as explained to them by
Amado
. The
Claw Marks
 he creates tags locations, allowing him to instantly travel between them, which Shikamaru compares to the
Flying Thunder God Technique
 despite it not being
space–time ninjutsu
. Sai reports that no marks having been found inside the village at the moment, but four marked spots have been discovered near the outer wall. He has others looking for more, and Shikamaru is concerned they're decoys to spread them thin. Ibiki reports the other villages have also found marks, but still no sign of Code, which exasperates Shikamaru. Sai adds that none of the captured Outers, but their interrogations yielded nothing useful. Their only viable avenues are to continue investigating the marks, and the targets of Code's revenge for
Isshiki
's death.
Kawaki
 observes them from the
Hokage Rock
, as well as shinobi assigned to monitor him.
Sumire
 asks what are Amado's plans for Kawaki after restoring his
Kāma
.
 Amado is vague, saying it's a personal matter with Kawaki, and assuring her he has no intention of wronging
Konoha
. Noting a container by him, she asks what he's working on. Amado says it's something he has already run by
Katasuke
, that should result in a powerful ally for Konoha. Code grows impatient with
Daemon
 riding on his back, and asks
Ada
 for assistance. She's glad the two of them have become friends. Daemon notices
Bug
 sneaking away, and jumps on him. He screams, asking where Bug is going. Code attempts to mark Daemon, only succeeding at marking Bug, Daemon's ability reflecting the marks at him without conscious intent. Code claims he's demonstrating his ability, finding it quicker than explaining it as he pulls Bug through a mark. He explains only he can move through them, and at most take one other with him at a time. Bug thanks him for removing him from Daemon's grasp, but Code claims he was only making a demonstration. He asks Daemon for a more detailed explanation of his ability, but Ada stops Daemon before he can give one. Code asks if she doesn't trust him, but she says what she told him is enough. They just met and she needs more time before showing him everything. He asks if she has other abilities she hasn't demonstrated, and she thinks that would be interesting. Daemon does as Ada says and reveals nothing. Kawaki notices civilians staring at him, and recalls
Shikadai
's warning. At home,
Boruto
 completes a week taking Amado's medication, but notices no change.
Hinata
 asks him about Kawaki, noting he's never been late for dinner.
Naruto
 finds Kawaki, asking if the water and once rice ball he bought are all he's having for dinner. Kawaki claims he's bored of Hinata's food, but Naruto points out he always cleans the plate. He says he likes that spot, gazing down at the village, but he thinks there's no place for him in it. He thinks
Jigen
 or Isshiki were right about him. Naruto picks Kawaki up to take him home, calling him a son. At home, the Uzumaki have prepared a proper welcoming party for him, the vase he fixed prominent on the table. Kawaki tells
Himawari
 she should have used the vase he bought, the one he fixed looking ugly with all the cracks. She says the vase is even more special to her now. Boruto says he has something for him, and shows him his
forehead protector
. Kawaki points out he's not an official shinobi, but Boruto counters he has started training, and that he,
Sarada
, and
Mitsuki
 consider Kawaki a team-mate. Kawaki says Boruto won't have one if he accepts, but he says he has
Sasuke
's, so Kawaki should keep his until he has his own. Hinata and Himawari think it suits Kawaki, but Boruto finds him dorky with it. Himawari suggests he wear it around his neck, like she has seen others doing it. Later, Naruto tells Kawaki he does belong, and that it he doesn't feel it, if someone like him can't live at ease, that Naruto has failed as
Hokage
. In his bedroom, Boruto shifts his attention from the medication to his Kāma. Kawaki thinks of Amado's offer to give him a purely offensive Kāma, and dismisses it, thinking there's still one thing he can do to protect Konoha and Naruto.

狂気

Kyōki

Boruto
 buys
Extreme: Shinobi Picture Scrolls
 card packs, and is frustrated by still not getting
Sasuke
's card.
Kawaki
 notices his surveillance, whose blatancy bothers Boruto.
Shikadai
 points out such surveillance is why he can move out freely despite the threat of an attack. Kawaki questions how much it actually bothers Boruto, who sleeps soundly at night. Boruto questions why direct surveillance is necessary when the
village's Barrier Team
 has a
Sensing Barrier
 in place. Kawaki is unfamiliar with it, so
Inojin
 and Shikadai explain it to him. Going by their explanation, Kawaki determines the barrier merely identifies intruders, and dealing with them is another matter. Boruto doesn't have faith that the shinobi watching them would be a match for
Code
 should he attack. Inojin believes him to be a sensor who would relay their location and situation, so
Naruto
 or Sasuke would fight Code. Boruto is still irked by the lack of privacy. Kawaki recalls
Amado
's words about Naruto fighting Code. Inojin vouches for the village's sensing unit since the
Yamanaka Clan
 is involved in it, pointing out it would be necessary to
erase one's chakra signature
 to evade them.
 Boruto complains about his every moment being watched by strange, older men, and buys another card pack. Kawaki ponders on Inojin's words. Sasuke investigates one of the
Claw Marks
 around the village, and the shinobi watching them report no activity since their discovery. He doesn't believe this is where Code will emerge, as this is not where he would do it, but concedes he has no authority to tell the shinobi to stop monitoring it.
Shikamaru
 receives reports while smoking atop the
Academy
. Amado joins him, admitting surprise by the trouble, finding Code to be cautious, but not particularly bright. He pulls out a cigarette, but Shikamaru tells him not to get carried away and that smoking is prohibited there. Shikamaru is suspicious that Amado would find anything unexpected, still believing everything to be going accord some secret plan of his, and Amado assures him the chain of surprises so far would be unthinkable for him. The biggest surprise for him has been Kawaki's love and devotion to Naruto. Upon the mention of devotion, Shikamaru asks if Code's devotion to
Isshiki
 and how long they haven't heard from him could mean he's too depressed to attempt vengeance. Amado finds it too optimistic, but great if it were true. At night, at the Uzumaki home, Kawaki takes out the trash, noting the sensor shinobi watching him. He goes back inside, going through a tree in the garden. Boruto talks to Kawaki inside, but senses him still outside. He determines the Kawaki inside to be a
shadow clone
, while sensing the real one moving away from the house. Boruto thinks that if he's caught, their surveillance will be tightened, but is surprised the sensor shinobi hasn't pursued Kawaki. He determines that Kawaki somehow erased his chakra signature.
Ada
 reports to Code that Kawaki is on the move alone. He questions how Kawaki managed it if people are watching him, and Ada explains that erasing one's chakra signature is a standard
Ōtsutsuki
 ability. She believes Kawaki shouldn't be aware of it yet, having accessed it on instinct. Code wants to seize the opportunity, and emerges from a Claw Mark discreetly applied to a tree. He puts his mouth through a mark to ask Ada for guidance, who finds it gross. Boruto can't go after Kawaki without the sensor shinobi following him, and wonders how Kawaki did it. He asks Kawaki's shadow clone how he erased his chakra signature, and puzzled, wonders how he can still sense Kawaki. The real Kawaki speculates on the explanation. Ada reports on Kawaki's movements to Code, who intends to ask Kawaki why he's outside the
village
 directly.

Run-in
" (
邂逅

Kaikō
)

Boruto
 determines
Kawaki
 is beyond
Konoha
's limit, and questions Kawaki's
shadow clone
, who tells him not to interfere. Boruto alerts
Nishi
, who doesn't believe him, still
sensing
 Kawaki's shadow clone.
Ada
 gives
Code
 directions to intercept Kawaki, Code wonders what to talk about with him. Boruto warns
Naruto
 of Kawaki's escape, as well as his
erasing his chakra signature
 to avoid detection. Boruto insists on it, and Naruto has Nishi expand his sensing range and notify
Shikamaru
. Kawaki's shadow clone disperses frustrated. Kawaki finds Code, who
marks him with his claw
, closing the gap between them, and asks if he's gained weight. Naruto questions Boruto on his claim, and how he can still sense Kawaki. He confesses having reservations about Boruto's claim, as he has complained about the surveillance. Naruto and Boruto don't find the shadow clone, and Nishi reports that Kawaki's chakra has suddenly vanished from inside the house. Naruto
confers
 with Shikamaru and
Ino
, warning them that Kawaki's chakra is currently undetectable.
 Boruto can no longer sense Kawaki and wishes to pursue him. Naruto is against it, as Boruto is under surveillance for the same reason, but Boruto argues the
Sensing Unit
 won't be able to find him, and soon neither will he. He slips out when Naruto is still coordinating the search with Ino.
Amado
 and Shikamaru wonder how and why Kawaki left. Boruto goes towards where he last was able to detect Kawaki, hoping they'll track his chakra to find them both. Code and Kawaki fight, Ada reminding Code not to kill him. Kawaki says he left to see him, and confirms that Code wants vengeance against
Isshiki
's killers. He claims responsibility for Isshiki's death, and offers himself up if Code leaves Konoha alone, saying none of it would have happened if he hadn't fled
Kara
. Code finds his proposition ridiculous and continues attacking him. He is furious with his begging, seeing it as defilement of Isshiki's rightful vessel. Ada's pleas for Code not to hurt Kawaki wake
Daemon
 up. Code explains to Kawaki he already knows all the details of Isshiki's death, and has inherited his will and plans. He reveals that Kawaki is excluded from his revenge because there's someone who wants to meet him, and prepares to leave with him. Boruto arrives, freeing Kawaki by kicking Code aside. He tells Kawaki to tell him where he's going next time so he doesn't get yelled at.

Chapter 63

"
Ask No Questions
" (
問答無用
,
Mondōmuyō
)

Ada
 blames
Code
 for rushing in without listening to her, so she wasn't able to warn him of
Boruto
's arrival. When Code asks, she's unsure how Boruto tracked
Kawaki
, attributing it either to being
Ōtsutsuki
 or to the
Kāma
. She's jealous of the bond they share. Boruto and Kawaki argue about the other being there. Kawaki tells Code to ignore Boruto and leave together. Code remains silent, and the two resume arguing. Boruto says that
Konoha
 will be able to track him there, but keeping
Naruto
 away and safe is what Kawaki wants. Ada reports to Code on the likelihood of Konoha finding them now that Boruto is there. Code asks what Kawaki thinks he can do to protect the
Hokage
. Kawaki wants to talk with whoever wants to meet with him. Ada perks up at him wanting to meet her. Kawaki wants to negotiate with that person, because whoever they are, they were able to influence Code to exclude Kawaki from his vengeance. Code questions on the unreasonable demands Kawaki might get, but he counters that he's used to people always wanting unreasonable things from him.
 Code was willing to drag him, but is glad for Kawaki's willingness to come with him, and manifests a
Claw Mark
 by Kawaki. Boruto tells them both not to ignore him, and tells Kawaki that Naruto wouldn't want this. Kawaki says he's doing it for Naruto. Boruto punches him, and while saying he gets it, he wants to protect Kawaki. Ada is excited by it. Code properly introduces himself to Boruto, and affirms that as
Momoshiki
's vessel, he reveres him. As such, it pains him that he must sacrifice Boruto to cultivate a
God Tree
. Boruto thinks that talking to Code is useless, and activates his Kāma.
Ino

reports
 to Naruto that despite extending their range to beyond the village, they can't find Kawaki. He recalls Boruto words, and tries finding him. He asks
Nishi
, who reports Boruto is nowhere nearby. Code blocks a kick from Boruto, who uses their proximity to try landing a
Rasengan
. Code slips away through a Claw Mark and counterattacks. He deflects
shuriken
 from Boruto, but one of them is a
transformed

shadow clone
, who attacks with
Lightning Release: Thunderclap Arrow
. Code avoids it again, and finds fighting with shinobi fun. However, he deems Boruto an amateur with the Kāma, activating his own, and going on the offensive, blocking Boruto's attacks and landing his own. Code explains there's more to the Kāma than making them faster and stronger, it also grants the user the accumulated battle experience of the Ōtsutsuki who branded it, if one knows how to draw from it. Code knows there's more to Boruto, and asks to see Momoshiki's power. Boruto avoids a stomp from Code, and begins drawing more power from the Kāma.

Author's Note

“

Two locations of a family restaurant chain that were closest to me closed for good. I'm in shock... I was thinking something was up, because they had recently stopped appearing on Uber Eats. Darn COVID.

Fortunately, my favorite Denny's is still going strong. It's a relaxation spot where I go to eat a parfait when I finish a chapter, so it would be a problem if it went away. The seasonal parfaits are good, but personally, I'm a fan of the Mini Choco Sundae. The biggest bang for your buck!
