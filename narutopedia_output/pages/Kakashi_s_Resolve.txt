" (

) is episode 362 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

After hearing
Obito
 and
Madara
's discussion,
Naruto
's
shadow clone
 moves in to attack them with a
Super Mini-Tailed Beast Ball
. Madara, however, blocks the attack and
defeats
 the clone. Then, he manages to capture the
Eight
 and
Nine-Tails
 during which time
Kakashi
 questions his old friend about what happened to him.
 Meanwhile, Naruto declares to Madara that he is the
Fourth Hokage
's son and would not be overpowered by him. Madara then creates an enormous
wood dragon
, forcing Naruto to enter
Tailed Beast Mode
. Kakashi asks Obito why he chose to follow Madara's path, but the former notes he has nothing more to say to him. Continuing their battle, Obito executes an attack with many
shuriken
, but is stopped by Kakashi's
wall of earth
. As Obito
slips through the wall
, Kakashi continues to ask him if the reason was related to
Rin
, to which Obito sharply retorts telling him to be silent. Obito then warps Kakashi to the
other dimension
, but Kakashi soon returns with the same technique. In the meantime, the Wood Dragon begins absorbing Kurama's chakra, causing Naruto to go on the verge of a breakdown. Hearing Naruto's words that he would protect his friends, Kakashi and Guy both spring into action with the former using
Lightning Cutter
 to destroy Obito's other shuriken and Guy using
Daytime Tiger
 to attack Madara. Gyūki then decides to attack the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 before the
Ten-Tails
 could be revived when noticing the crack of
barrier
. Kurama then reveals that Kakashi was attacking Obito from the other dimension and that it had given the shinobi some of its chakra when touching his hand. As Kakashi returns to the real world thanking Kurama, Naruto and Killer B both combine their
massive sphere
, firing the Demonic Statue far away. After the explosion, they note that the statue's
chakra
 had vanished, causing them to question whether this is the end. However, when the smoke clears, the revived Ten-Tails appears, prompting Obito and Madara to begin their
plan
.
