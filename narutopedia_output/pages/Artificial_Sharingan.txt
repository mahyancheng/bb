This cybernetic eye is modelled after the
Uchiha clan
's
Sharingan
, created by
Teguse
. In addition to granting its wielder perfect vision, it can replicate the various abilities of a natural Sharingan, and with no apparent drawbacks. Even a non-Uchiha who is implanted with this eye suffers no fatigue nor excessive
chakra
 drain from continued usage. Also, this eye is capable of copying other
dōjutsu
 that could only be used by certain bloodlines. Despite being artificial, it could also attain a
Mangekyō Sharingan
 state, directly mirroring the design of the copied Mangekyō when using said target's personal techniques.

Due to the cybernetic features of this eye, additional surgery is required to properly transplant and accommodate the eye. While Merz obtained two eyes for each socket, granting him full usage of its power, only his right eye was fully fitted to allow the eyelids to cover it while the left eye was still crudely patched up and bulging out because of the poor fit.
