Trivia

The title is grammatically incorrect. If the title indicates that there are two vortices that are blue, then "Vortex" should be "Vortices", whereas if the title indicates that there are two different blues in one vortex, then the title is missing a hyphen between "two" and "blue". In the case of the latter, "Blue" might make more sense as "Blues", but the singular may grammatically work as well. It may also be more grammatically correct to say "Two Blues in a Vortex".
