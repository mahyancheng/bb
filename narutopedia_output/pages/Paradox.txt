Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As the
Fourth Division
's attacks prove futile against the
Third Raikage
, he re-emphasises how they were to attack him.
Temari
 and a few other
tessenjutsu
 users attack the Third with the
Wind Release: Cast Net
 technique which appears to have finally incapacitated the
Raikage
, but as shinobi from the
Sealing Team
 move in to
bind
 him, they are sent reeling. Spotting his former aide
Dodai
 amongst the
Allied Shinobi Forces
' ranks, he steps forward and tells Temari a bit more about the Raikage and noted that they needed a more powerful
Wind Release
 technique to attack him. Noting that there was not a more powerful Wind Release user amongst their ranks or even in the Alliance,
Naruto Uzumaki
's
shadow clone
 arrives, announcing that he would be able to do the job.

Leaping into action, Naruto forms a
Rasenshuriken
 which after some
manipulation
, finally lands an attack on the Raikage which proves to be just as futile. Retreating as
Kabuto Yakushi
 eradicated the Third's persona, Dodai instructed the
Earth Release
 users to erect a
wall
 which he himself
fortifies
. Telling his comrades to retreat nonetheless, his words fall on deaf ears as the Raikage breaks through the wall using his
Hell Stab
. As the division is set upon again, Naruto and Dodai discuss the legacy of the Raikage leading Naruto to want to know how the Third got the scar on his body which was noted to be the "ultimate shield". Needing to ask the
Eight-Tails
 directly, Dodai creates a
distraction
 which the Third chases, buying them time to contact
Inoichi Yamanaka
 who patches them through to
B
.

Upon hearing of the monstrous battle between the Third and the Eight-Tails, Naruto formulates a strategy using
Sage Mode
 as his cloak had dissipated due to attempting to make a
Tailed Beast Ball
. Ultimately, the Third ends up stabbing himself with his One-Finger Nukite, and his body begins to disintegrate and he is eventually bound and
sealed
. Dodai surmises that in the end, no one person could have the strongest shield and spear, noting that in the end, the Third had the strongest spear. Naruto agrees, noting that
Gaara
 probably had the strongest shield. Meanwhile on Gaara's battlefield, the division struggles to defeat the
Second Mizukage
.

Trivia

tate
), setting the theme for the episode.
