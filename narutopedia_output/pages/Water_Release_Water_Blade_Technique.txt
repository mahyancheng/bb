The user forms a
hand seal
 and raises a column of underground water from beneath their feet, which takes the shape of a high-pressured water blade. If one were to take a direct hit from the blade, it would cut clean through flesh and bone. This technique is perfect for digging through bedrock without creating igniting sparks. Using hydrated calcium and volcanic rock from the underground water, the shape of this technique can also take the form of a javelin, which is capable of piercing though the
Shield of Sand
. This technique was noted to have been created by
