The
Gatō Company
 (
ガトーカンパニー
,
Gatō Kanpanī
,
English TV:
 Gato Transport) is the shipping company formerly operated by
Gatō
, using his import/export as a front to make his fortune as a smuggler of illegal goods and selling drugs. Gatō had become the richest man in the world as a result, and went to great lengths to protect his interests through blackmail and murder. The majority of his subordinates are thugs and mercenaries, including his bodyguards
Zōri
 and
Waraji
, who did Gatō's bidding to ensure
Land of Waves
 remained under his control by crushing any resistance.

When
Tazuna
 begins building a
bridge
 to free the Land of Waves from his influence, Gatō hired
Zabuza Momochi
 to kill Tazuna. However, the president also intended to have a group of hired thugs to kill off Zabuza when he is weakened in his fight against Tazuna's bodyguards,
Team 7
, in order to save expenses. Gatō underestimated Zabuza's remaining strength and met his end at Zabuza's blade. The remaining thugs intended to loot the Land of Waves as compensation of losing their employer (and salary) but were driven back when the citizens stood up to them.
