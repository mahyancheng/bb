The
Silver Wheel Reincarnation Explosion
 is a powerful technique utilised by
Toneri Ōtsutsuki
.

Usage

While using
Tenseigan Chakra Mode
, Toneri focuses his chakra into one of his
Truth-Seeking Balls
 and grasps it in his hand to create a powerful silvery typhoon. The power of this gust is on par with
Naruto Uzumaki
's
Planetary Rasengan
 and the clash between the two techniques was enough to break through the
Moon
's exterior crust.
