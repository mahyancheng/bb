The Suna Aviary.


The
Suna Aviary
 is a building located in
Sunagakure
 where messenger birds such as
hawks
, deliver messages and rest. The building houses a number of cages where Sunagakure houses their messenger hawks. The messages the birds transport are encrypted with special seals to prevent anyone except the intended target to be able to decipher. When
Gaara
 was captured by the
Akatsuki
, Sunagakure quickly sent for assistance from
Konohagakure
 through
Takamaru
, who is said to be the fastest hawk in the village, and only being surpassed by his son
Tobimaru
.
