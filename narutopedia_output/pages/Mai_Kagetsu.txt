Funeral Proxy Mission

Mai informs Fūta,
Shino
 and
Naruto
 that dinner is ready, and proceeds to join them at it. She panics as Shino manically starts to laugh, having eaten some food with a laughing drug in it. Later, when Tōbei makes his appearance at his own funeral, it is revealed for the rest of the family that Mai helped her father fake his death. This was done to unite the family, and try to make them happy as they once were.
