Summary

While carrying out
Akatsuki
's mission,
Itachi
 learns about
Sasuke
's state of being, as well as learning of
Naruto
's existence. He learns Sasuke has awakened his
Sharingan
, and learned
Chidori
 from
Kakashi
. At a latter occasion, he questions Naruto about how he would measure the safety of
Konohagakure
 against Sasuke's. Sasuke finishes reminiscing on Itachi's memories. Meanwhile, back on the battlefield, the light of the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 fades and Sasuke dispels his protective
Susanoo
 barrier.

Madara
 returns back to the ground and chastises the survivors, explaining why he believes
Hashirama
's dreams were flawed, but before he can do much more,
Black Zetsu
 suddenly stabs Madara through the heart. Exclaiming in shock, Madara begins to swell and huge amounts of chakra are drawn to his location. Sasuke and Naruto attempt to stop the plan from succeeding, while Black Zetsu explains that he has been waiting for this moment for aeons and that it is the will of
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
. While Naruto is worried that if they don't stop the massive chakra, it will end up killing everyone, Black Zetsu tells him that Kaguya had once used the technique, but didn't kill anyone. Instead, she used it to create soldiers, revealing that humans who were caught under the genjutsu previously eventually became the
White Zetsu Army
, through a slow process over time. Madara asks why the
tablet
 said the technique would calm all wars in the world, only to realise in shock that Black Zetsu had made revisions to the tablet and that he was merely a pawn for the revival. Just before he is swallowed, he dwells on his mistakes, before the swelling stops and Madara is replaced by the reborn Kaguya.
