"
When You Curse Someone, You Dig Your Own Grave
" (
人を呪わば穴二つ
,
Hito o Norowaba Ana Futatsu
) is episode 87 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Team 7
 arrives to
Team Asuma
's rescue,
Kakashi
 asks that a long-range fighter and a
medic
 help
Shikamaru
 defeat
Hidan
, the other
Akatsuki
 member. Before
Sai
 and
Sakura
 leave, the latter tells
Naruto
 that the outcome of the battle is all up to him. On the way to the woods, Sai asks whether Shikamaru was smart in pursuing Hidan alone, with his motives being personal. Recalling a conversation with
Tsunade
 in which she found out that Shikamaru was invited to be one of the
Twelve Guardian Ninja
, Sakura claims Shikamaru would be alright, calling him the smartest
shinobi
 in the
Land of Fire
.

In the woods, Hidan approaches Shikamaru, preparing to kill him with his
Retractable Spear
. However, Shikamaru manages to use his
Shadow Gathering Technique
 to pull all the
explosive tags
 he had set around the woods and bind them to Hidan. On top of that, Shikamaru destroys the ground beneath Hidan, destroying his
Jashin
 circle and revealing a huge hole six feet deep. Hidan wonders when Shikamaru had set such a trap and is shocked to find out that it has been created long before Team 10 ambushed them. Hidan reminds Shikamaru that he cannot die, but Shikamaru notifies him that the woods they are in belong to the
Nara
 clan, and that only clan members can enter the area; on top of that, various deer around the area would always be watching him. Lighting
Asuma
's lighter, he tells Hidan that the moment he cursed Asuma, he had dug his own grave, and that the hole beneath him would serve as his grave. Shikamaru has a vision of Asuma standing next to him, congratulating him and passing down his
Will of Fire
 to him. Smiling, Shikamaru throws the lighter at the explosive tags, causing Hidan to explode.

Meanwhile in the clearing, Naruto prepares to fight
Kakuzu
. Kakashi asks in disbelief whether Naruto had already mastered his new
Wind Release
 technique, but
Yamato
 tells him that Naruto can only pull it off half of the time. Kakashi alerts them that Kakuzu had five hearts and that they only managed to destroy two, and that Kakuzu would not be defeated unless the other three are also destroyed. He also adds that Kakuzu is able to use the five
elements
. Naruto takes his information in stride, and using his
Shadow Clone Technique
, has his shadow clones fight Kakuzu in close combat. When Kakuzu defeats and dispels the clones, Naruto uses the acquired knowledge from his clones to analyse the Akatsuki in front of him, surprising and impressing Kakashi. Naruto creates more shadow clones, but instead of rushing towards Kakuzu, begins to prepare his
Wind Release: Rasengan
. Kakashi recalls his training with Naruto, in which he pitted his
Rasengan
 against Naruto's Wind Release: Rasengan, only for Naruto's enhanced version to cancel out Kakashi's and injure the latter's arm. After turning to look back at the improved Naruto, Kakashi sees his former sensei, the
Fourth Hokage
, within Naruto.
Chōji
 notices the sound Naruto's Rasengan is making and realises that the noise is emitted due to the sheer amount of
chakra
 in the technique; Naruto then proceeds to use his shadow clones to add more wind chakra to the Wind Release: Rasengan, creating a new unique technique -
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
.
