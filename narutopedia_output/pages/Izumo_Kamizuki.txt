Izumo Kamizuki
 (
神月イズモ
,
Kamizuki Izumo
) is a
chūnin
 from
Konohagakure
.

Personality

Izumo is never seen without his partner, and best friend
Kotetsu Hagane
. He is characterised as being the more responsible, mature and serious of the two. This is seen when he angrily burst into the
Jōnin Standby Station
's lounge to drag his partner back to work.
 Similarly, in another omake, he admonished Kotetsu's lack of pride in his work when the latter complained that they were simply the
Fifth Hokage
's errand-boys, before adding sagely that guarding Konoha and the villagers was "
the best mission you can get
" as a shinobi.

Izumo is also noted to be a
germaphobe
 and as such, pays excessive attention to cleanliness.
 This, however, doesn't seem to affect his duties as a shinobi very much.

Appearance






Izumo in
The Last: Naruto the Movie
.



Izumo has brown hair, and dark eyes. His hair is combed down and always covers his right eye. He wears his
forehead protector
 like a bandanna along with the standard Konoha shinobi outfit which goes all the way up to his chin, in a similar manner to
Yamato
's and a
flak jacket
.

In
The Last: Naruto the Movie
, two years after the war, he bares a small change in appearance, with only changing to the new standard Konoha flak jacket with high top sandals, and an armband with an
Uzumaki clan
 logo emblem on his left arm.

Abilities

Izumo is quick-witted and highly analytical. When not on missions or training, Izumo spends the majority of his time collecting, and sorting out information as he
strongly believes
 that battles are not won with power but with intelligence. With this information, he is able to produce accurate data and make relevant decisions in any situation.

Nature Transformation






Izumo using the Water Release: Starch Syrup Capturing Field.



Izumo is capable of using
Water Release

nature transformation
. Using this ability, he has formulated a two-fold attack with his partner Kotetsu. When Izumo uses
Water Release: Starch Syrup Capturing Field
 to blanket the ground in high-viscosity water that immobilises the opponent once they come in contact with it, Kotetsu would then attack the enemy using his
Conch Shell Mace
.

Bukijutsu

In combat, Izumo regularly wields large, bladed
weapons
 alongside his partner Kotetsu, which they use with great proficiency; often attacking from either side of the opponent giving their target no chance to escape them. They can attach a chain to the hilt of these blades which they use to render their targets immobile before or after they attack them. He has also been seen to be able to wield a bō.

Izumo arrives alongside Ibiki and the other invigilators.



Later, Izumo and other chūnin arrive alongside
Ibiki

He and Kotetsu were later seen together in the stands watching the preliminary matches. The two discussed
