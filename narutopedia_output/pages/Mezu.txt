This article is about the Konoha Anbu. For the missing-nin, see
Mezu (missing-nin)
.

Mezu
 (
メズ
) was a member of
Konohagakure
's
Anbu
 faction
Root
, led by
Danzō Shimura
.

Background

Mezu and his older twin brother,
Gozu
, were surgically altered to look like
Kagen Uchiha
, allowing them to take turns spying on the
Uchiha clan
 by impersonating Kagen. When not in the village impersonating Kagen, Mezu wore a blue marked mask resembling a monkey. Both reported directly to Danzō about their findings for several years, but in the year leading up to the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
, they also helped
Itachi Uchiha
 as he tried to avert the clan's attempted coup. On the night that Itachi wiped out the Uchiha clan, Mezu was impersonating Kagen. He offered no resistance to being killed by Itachi, well aware that Kagen's body must be among the dead; he felt it was his responsibility as the younger brother to die so that Gozu didn't need to.

Trivia

Mezu and Gozu shared their Anbu mask design, a monkey. Despite the identical design, the colours were different; Mezu's mask was blue, while Gozu's mask was red.
