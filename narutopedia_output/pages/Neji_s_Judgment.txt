"
Neji's Judgment
" (
ネジの判断
,
Neji no Handan
) is episode 412 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Matsuri
 offers
Team Guy
 her "Heaven Scroll" in exchange for helping her rescue
Gaara
 from
Hōichi
, with the
Konohagakure
 team deciding to help her out without a reward. As
Neji
, with the help of his
Byakugan
, pinpoints the
Kazekage
's location, the four decide to go to his aid, even if it would mean defaulting the
Chūnin Exams
 in the process. Meanwhile, Hōichi continues to
pull
 the
tailed beast

chakra
 from both
Fū
 and Gaara. In response to her opponent's technique, the girl creates a
Cocoon
 using her
Chakra Threads
, which delays the
chakra absorption
 caused by the chains. With Gaara informing her that nobody will come to their rescue, Fū tells him not to lose hope, making the boy find her behaviour to be similar to
Naruto
's.
 At the same time,
Kurenai
,
Asuma
 and
Guy
 notice the Kazekage's absence in the village, confirming that their fear of Gaara setting himself as bait to lure out the enemy was fulfilled. The three then notice
Yukata
 and
Mikoshi
, struggling in the
desert
. Meanwhile, Matsuri and Team Guy make it to their destination, noticing the cocoon and Hōichi, playing his
biwa
. As
Yōrō
 and
Kegon
 arrive, looking for their comrade, Neji uses his Byakugan on the cocoon, realising that both Gaara and Fū's tailed beasts are being extracted. The two
jōnin
 ready their weapons against Neji, only for him to convince them to work together. After he devises a plan, Yōro, Kegon, Matsuri and
Lee
 attack Hōichi, only for the priest to block their attacks with his
barrier ninjutsu
. As Matsuri notes that their attacks aren't helping their current situation, Lee assures the girl that their efforts would buy Neji and
Tenten
 time. At the same time, Neji uses a chakra
sword
 to pierce through the cocoon. After the first attempt failed, the
Hyūga
 uses his
Gentle Fist: Tenketsu Needle
  technique a second time to halt the chains' chakra absorption. When Hōichi notices that the chains are no longer active, he begins fearing that the chains will target him. Failing to stop the technique, Hōichi's
chakra
 gets sealed, only for him to be freed by Neji, due to Gaara's plea. As Gaara and Fū thank Neji and Matsuri for their help, Kurenai, Asuma and Guy arrive, only to note that their help is no longer needed.

Trivia

Matsuri
 is briefly shown with a Konohagakure
