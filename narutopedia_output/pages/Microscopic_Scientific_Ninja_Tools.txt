These are microscopic
Scientific Ninja Tools
 developed by
Amado Sanzu
 which are integrated into an individual, allowing them to
manipulate the soft body tissues
 of certain appendages in a variety of ways, including triggering rapid cellular division and undergoing spontaneous sclerosis and malacia (hardening and softening). The soft tissues can even be shed, leaving behind a sort of hardened husk.

Wielders can use these augmentations to quickly heal injuries or even regenerate the limb if it is lost, or to transform the affected limbs into weapons of various shapes and sizes. The altered appendages can also amass and release chakra; Kawaki is able to gather chakra in his forearm and fire blasts from his palm, while Delta's legs can split open vertically and release a continuous stream of chakra in a manner similar to jet propulsion, allowing her to fly.

The tools can be found flowing throughout the user's bloodstream, and will spontaneously transform in the presence of certain chemicals, even outside of the body. According to
Katasuke Tōno
, those possessing these tools can effectively be considered "living Scientific Ninja Tools".

Trivia

The body augmentation granted by the tools strongly resembles
Jūgo
's
clan
's
Sage Transformation
. While they're almost indistinguishable in the manga, their portrayal in the anime shows more difference.

In the anime, the transformed appendages give off a coloured subdermal glow for each of the users; orange for Kawaki and Code and pink for Delta.
