Naruto
 manga.

This article is about the chapter. For the ending theme, see
Absolutely
.

Summary

As
Naruto
 lies dying,
Sakura
 continues to use
medical ninjutsu
 on him to no effect. With
Sasuke
 in no better a condition, an anguished
Tobirama
 laments his inability to help the young Uchiha, fearing the worst when he could no longer
sense
 Sasuke's
chakra
. Meanwhile, as the remainder of Kurama's chakra dissipates from around Sakura, she wonders why her techniques are ineffective until
Gaara
 informs her that Kurama had been extracted from Naruto, and his only hope was to get to
Minato
 and Yin-Kurama as Yang-Kurama had instructed.
 As Gaara anchors Sakura with his
sand
 and begins moving faster, Sakura switches her tactics and after making an
incision
 in Naruto's chest, begins to manually pump his heart, and performs
CPR
, adamant that Naruto is not going to die on her watch. Elsewhere a desperate
Karin
 is able to manifest the
Uzumaki

chains
 and decimate parts of
Tobi
's
statue
. Despite being impaled by
wooden stakes
, Karin merely
bites herself
 to recover from the injuries. Following up on the assault,
Suigetsu
 launches his
Water Gun Technique
 at the Zetsu clone's head revealing there is someone inside and giving
Orochimaru
 enough time to place a
cursed seal
 on the artificial clone, and
Jūgo
 the chance to rescue Karin; who notes that while she was fine, she could no longer
sense
 Sasuke's chakra as they rushed to his aid. All the while,
Madara
 casually
seals
 the
Ten-Tails
 into himself and after assuming his
jinchūriki
 form, departs to claim his left
eye
. With Sasuke's predicament looking grim, he is approached by an unknown barefooted individual.

Trivia

In one panel, Sakura is mistakenly depicted wearing a
Konohagakure

forehead protector
 instead of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
'. However, it was corrected in the tankōbon version.
