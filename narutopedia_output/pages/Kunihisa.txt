Part I

Daimyō Heir Escort Mission






Kunihisa imitation "Money Release" technique.



He was dreaming about becoming a ninja so his father went to his friend
Tsunade
 looking for help. Tsunade directed Naruto to "play" ninja with Kunihisa. Kunihisa used what he called his "Money Release"
ninjutsu
, which was really only using fake hand signs, such as "alligator" or "bunny ears", and having his greedy bodyguards rush to his aid. Naruto soon grew tired of Kunihisa's spoiled attitude and the way he treated his bodyguards. Naruto argued that Kunihisa could not solve everything with money but the young boy would not listen. When two kidnappers named
Shinayakana
 and
Fukuyokana
 targeted Kunihisa, they used the money Kunihisa had wastefully tossed aside to buy his bodyguard's loyalty. Naruto managed to escape with Kunihisa and the boys faced a situation where Kunihisa had to overcome his fear. Naruto was in trouble, but Kunihisa overcame his fear and selfishness and then saved him. While Naruto and Kunihisa evaded falling into the dark gorge, Shinayakana, Fukuyokana, and those they paid to help them weren't so lucky.

They then returned to
Konohagakure
 with Kunihisa having a better attitude towards life. Kunihisa thanked Naruto and asked him to visit in the future.
