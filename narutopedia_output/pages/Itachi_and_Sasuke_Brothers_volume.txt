Chapter 220

"
Itachi and Sasuke, Brothers
" (
兄と弟
,
Itachi to Sasuke
)

One day when they were younger,
Sasuke
 accompanied
Itachi
 on one of his training sessions. Impressed by Itachi's skills, Sasuke asked Itachi to teach him something, but Itachi, as always, refused by poking him on the forehead and promising to help him later. As they returned home, Sasuke marvelled at the
Uchiha clan
's accomplishments as explained to him by Itachi. When they encountered their father,
Fugaku
, he spoke to Itachi about an approaching mission. Itachi refused to take part, wishing to take part in Sasuke's
Academy
 orientation. Seeing that Itachi was determined, Fugaku volunteered to go in his place.

Chapter 221

"
The Too Distant Elder Brother
" (
遠すぎる兄
,
Tōsugiru Ani
)

Sasuke
 was pleased to have
Fugaku
 accompany him on his first day at the
Academy
. However, the weight of his father's, his instructors', and even his classmates' expectations for him to measure up to
Itachi
's achievements left him disheartened. Despite Sasuke's best efforts and initial praise from his father, the pressure intensified. Meanwhile, Itachi, burdened by the anticipated responsibilities as the future of the
Uchiha clan
, began showing signs of strain. At one point, he speculated that Sasuke harbored resentment towards him. Sasuke tried to convey that this wasn't the case, but Itachi insisted that, as an older brother, his role was to serve as an obstacle for Sasuke.

Chapter 222

"
Itachi's Doubt
" (
イタチの疑惑
,
Itachi no Giwaku
)

Itachi
 was confronted by members of the
Konoha Military Police Force
 about his recent actions, having not lived up to the
Uchiha clan
's expectations since he joined the
Anbu
. They questioned him about the death of
Shisui Uchiha
, Itachi's close friend, who had been instructed to keep tabs on Itachi's movements. Although Shisui's death appeared to be a suicide, the police believed Itachi may have staged the scene. Itachi attacked them and easily overpowered them, expressing his distaste for the clan.
Fugaku
 stepped in and demanded Itachi's apology, but Itachi persisted, saying he had lost faith in the clan's future. It was only after
Sasuke
's pleaded for him to stop that he apologised.

Chapter 223

"
Sasuke and his Father
" (
サスケと父
,
Sasuke to Chichi
)

Sasuke
 thought about that tension that had arisen between
Itachi
 and
Fugaku
, wondering what could have ruined Itachi's standing amongst the
Uchiha
. However, from that point further, Fugaku became interested in Sasuke's development. After he taught Sasuke the
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
 in less time than it had taken to teach Itachi, Fugaku said he was proud of Sasuke for the first time. He added that Sasuke should no longer try to follow in Itachi's footsteps. Sasuke nevertheless continued to idolise Itachi.

Chapter 224

"
That Day…!!
" (
その日…!!
,
Sono Hi…!!
)

Sasuke
 asked his mother about
Fugaku
, wondering what their father really thought of him and
Itachi
. She assured him that Fugaku only ever had words of praise for Sasuke and that his interest in Itachi was only for the
Uchiha clan
's benefit. Soon afterwards, Sasuke returned home one night to find all the members of his clan dead; murdered by Itachi. Itachi used his
Mangekyō Sharingan
 to torture Sasuke and destroy the facade of a loving older brother he had assumed for so long. Explaining to have killed the Uchiha to measure his abilities, Itachi added that Sasuke now represented his greatest challenge. If Sasuke were to grow up hating him and acquire the Mangekyō Sharingan, they would be a match. However, to gain it, Sasuke would need to kill his closest friend.

Chapter 225

"
Within Darkness…!!
" (
闇の中…!!
,
Yami no Naka…!!
)

Itachi
 confirmed that he had killed
Shisui
 to acquire the
Mangekyō Sharingan
, the death of one's closest friend being needed to awaken it. He directed Sasuke to the
Naka Shrine
 and encouraged him to use the information stored there to become enough to gain power and kill him, avenging their clan. Sasuke passed out and woke up as the last
Uchiha
 in
Konoha
. Distraught over the loss of the family that had just started to accept him, Sasuke agreed to live the rest of his life hating Itachi. Sasuke, realising that
Naruto
 is his closest friend, decides to kill him to pave the way towards killing Itachi.

 to kill Naruto. Naruto, intending to drag Sasuke back to

Author's Note

“

My favourite video games are from the old floppy disk system software that was sold such a long time ago. Now, those games are being re-released as retro games for the
Game Boy
. They're so ridiculous that they're irresistible!
