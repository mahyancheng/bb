"
The Tailed Beast vs. The Tailless Tailed Beast
" (
尾獣VS尾のない尾獣
,
Bijū Bāsasu O no Nai Bijū
) is episode 207 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Danzō
 and his two guards:
Torune
 and
Fū Yamanaka
, make their way out of the
Land of Iron
 when the latter is able to
sense

Ao
 tailing them. Danzō orders Fū to retrieve Ao's
Byakugan
 at all costs. Using his
Mind Puppet Switch Cursed Seal Technique
, Fū transfers his consciousness into a puppet he leaves lying in a tree, which he rigs to attack Ao in order to use it as a medium to perform his
Mind Body Switch Technique
 on the
Kiri
-nin. With Ao's consciousness confined to the puppet, Fū attempts to extract the Byakugan with a
kunai
, but Ao's
talisman earrings
 form a barrier around the eye. Ao tells Fū that only he and certain Kiri-nin can undo the barrier seal. Undeterred, Fū decides to decapitate "himself" on the blade of the sword, cancelling his Mind Body Switch technique at the last second, as his original body is given the same injuries as his host body.

As he jumps off a tree and prepares to slice Ao's head off, he is saved by the
Fifth Mizukage
. "Ao" tells her that he was under the enemy's Mind Body Switch technique and apologises for being careless. The
Mizukage
 offers to undo the barrier seal, and "Ao" thanks her. At that moment, the Mizukage tightens the ropes on Ao's hands and tells
Chōjūrō
 to hand her his
Hiramekarei
. She reveals that she knows Ao is still under the technique, as he would have never apologised in front of Chōjūrō along with the fact that Ao is aware that she was incapable of removing the seal around his eye. Fū insults her and dispels the technique causing the enraged Mizukage to attack the actual Ao. Back in his original body, which is being carried by Torune, Fū seeks Danzō's forgiveness for failing his mission.

Meanwhile,
Killer B
 is engaged in combat with
Kisame
. Killer B goes into his
Version 1
 seven-tailed form and rushes towards Kisame, but the latter merely uses his
Samehada
 to devour the
tailed beast
 chakra, causing B to lose six of his tails. The
Eight-Tails
 asks B to unleash his power, but B reminds him that
Sabu
 and
Ponta
 are in the vicinity. He then enters into his
Version 2
 state and hits Kisame with his
Lightning Release: Lariat
. Although he manages to severely wound Kisame, Kisame's blade once again devours his chakra, instantly reverting Killer B into his Version 1 four-tailed form. Siphoning the chakra his blade stole, Kisame uses it to heal the injuries sustained from the Lariat. He muses that he is known as the tailless tailed beast and proceeds to utilise his
Water Release: Great Exploding Water Colliding Wave
 to create a
giant water dome
.

Kisame fuses himself with the Samehada, sprouting gills and furthering his shark-like appearance. As the Eight-Tails realises that the dome moves in conjunction with Kisame's movements, the beast suggests that Killer B move in the opposite direction as Sabu and Ponta. Kisame manages to trick B into thinking he would be killing the two comrades; as B swims to protect them, Kisame restrains him. Killer B enters into a partial transformation, morphing the lower half of his body into octopus tentacles to bind Kisame. B manages to get loose as Kisame drains his chakra and shoots out
ink
 to cover his tracks, although Kisame is able to sense his chakra and attacks him until B's chakra is at its lowest. Bursting the dome of water, Kisame prepares to cut off B's legs to prevent him from running away. However, the Samehada blade grows a liking to Killer B's chakra and refuses to sever his legs, instead choosing to transfer back the chakra it stole. In anger, Kisame kicks the blade away and picks up one of B's
Supervibrato Lightning Release Swords
. Before he can use it to cut off B's legs, the
Fourth Raikage
,
C
, and
Darui
 intervene, having spotted the water dome. Using their
Lightning Release: Double Lariat
, Killer B and the
Raikage
 decapitate
Kisame
, whose detached head amusingly remarks how fast the two are. The Raikage then berates Killer B for running away from
Kumogakure
.
