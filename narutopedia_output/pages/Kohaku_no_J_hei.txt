The
Kohaku no Jōhei
 (
琥珀の浄瓶
,
literally meaning:
 Amber Purifying Pot) is a large pot that had the ability to seal anyone within it, if the target responds when called by the wielder of the pot. If the person responds, the pot records their voice and then seals them. It is similar to the
Benihisago
 in function, but more advanced, as less preparation is required.





The Third Raikage sealing the Eight-Tails.



The pot has a stylised kanji for "
lightning
" (
雷
,
kaminari
) on it and a thick rope tied around its rim.
Kurama
 noted that it is such a powerful tool that whatever is sealed into the pot cannot escape it,
 and can keep those brought back with the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 technique sealed even after the summoner releases the technique. In the anime, it is filled with a dark liquid. The person that is sealed into the pot seemingly merges with the liquid.

The Kohaku no Jōhei is revered as one of the
treasured tools
 of the
Sage of Six Paths
. All five of the tools consume enormous amounts of
chakra
 when used, so much so that normal humans would die after using the tools for only a short period of time. When the tools later came into the possession of
Kumogakure
, only the
Gold and Silver Brothers
 — due to their large chakra reserves — were able to wield the treasures without fatal repercussions. According to the
Fourth Raikage
, the pot was the only treasure that Kumogakure was able to wrest possession of from the brothers.

The
Third Raikage
 used the pot to temporarily seal the
Eight-Tails
 when
its jinchūriki
 lost control of the beast.
Darui
 would later use it in the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 to seal
Kinkaku
.
Tobi
 was later able to snatch the Kohaku no Jōhei from the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, and later allowed the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 to devour it, granting it the
Nine-Tails
' chakra from Kinkaku.
 After
Madara Uchiha
 became the
Ten-Tails
' jinchūriki, with both Gyūki and Kurama's Yang half fully instilled as part of the Ten-Tails, he spat out both the Kohaku no Jōhei and Benihisago from his body, deeming them useless. They landed on top of
Might Guy
 and
Rock Lee
.

Tenten
 kept it within one of her scrolls in hopes to later use it against Madara.

Trivia

The Kohaku no Jōhei is based on a tool from the Chinese classic "
Journey to the West
". In this story; there are two demon king brothers, known as the Great King Kinkaku (
金角大王
,
Kinkaku-daiō
) and the Great King Ginkaku (
銀角大王
,
Ginkaku-daiō
). The siblings possess five treasured tools, one of which is called the
Kohaku no Jōhei
 (
琥珀の浄瓶
,
literally meaning:
 Amber Purifying Pot).

When the Third Raikage used the Kohaku no Jōhei, he did not follow the ritual of calling out the person's name and having them respond. Instead he is seen forming a seal.
