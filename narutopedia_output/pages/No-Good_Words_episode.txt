Synopsis

At the
Allied Shinobi Forces
' Headquarters, a visibly anxious
A
 discusses the history of the
Gold and Silver Brothers
 with
Tsunade
. At the coastline of the
Land of Lightning
,
Darui
, who is now joined by
Samui
 and
Atsui
, face
Kinkaku
 and
Ginkaku
 who reveal their weapons of choice to be the
Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths
. Right off the bat, Atsui launches an
assault
 against the
White Zetsu Army
 clones and then rushes to attack the brothers, but Kinkaku hits him with his
Kōkinjō
: a cursing rope. Samui also charges in after her brother, but gets hit by the Kōkinjō as well.

Ginkaku severs their
soul words
 using the
Shichiseiken
: a sword that displays their most used word after it severs the word soul. Atsui accidentally mentions his forbidden word "
hot
" and gets sucked into the
Benihisago
. Ginkaku catches Samui, restraining her mouth, and threatens to kill her if Darui moves. Darui severes Kinkaku's arm and frees Samui by hitting Ginkaki with his
Storm Release: Laser Circus
 technique. However, Darui gets hit by the Kōkinjō and Samui is still sucked to the Benihisago. Darui, after figuring out his forbidden word, deduces that staying quiet for too long triggers the curse, which was why Ginkaku had gagged Samui. Ginkaku then states that trickery and betrayal are tactics of a shinobi claiming Darui to be merely a pawn to the
Raikage
. Darui recalls his conversation with the Raikage as he was worried about the loss of the Raikage's left arm. A then states that he has two arms anyway, his and Darui's. Full of resolve, Darui answers back to the brothers that he is the right hand man of the Raikage, not just merely a pawn. However Darui's speech accidentally causes him to say his most uttered word "dull" and began being sucked into the Benihisago.

Due to his constant apologies just as he was about to be fully sucked in, he evades the sealing as his most-uttered word "dull" changes to his second most-uttered word "sorry" and he attacks Ginkaku, forcing him to evade the attack and accidentally hit Kinkaku's Kōkinjō. Now taking the opportunity, Darui commandeers the Shichiseiken and the Benihisago, and manages to seal Ginkaku after he speaks his most-uttered word, "Kinkaku". Infuriated by the loss of his brother, Kinkaku transforms into his
six-tailed jinchūriki form
 and begins his rampage on the
First Division
.
