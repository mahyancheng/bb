This is the ultimate technique of the
Fire Temple
 that is taught only to its
ninja monks
, and requires the special
Gift of the Hermit Group
 chakra. The technique is activated when the user takes a specific stance with their left hand making a half-ram and then extending their right hand down with his palm parallel to the ground. Once the stance is taken, the spirit of the Thousand-Armed
Kannon
 is summoned to defend the user, or attack their enemies. The spirit is normally calm, angelic and looks peaceful. However, whenever the user gets angry, the spirit turns red and transforms into a demonic-looking creature. Kannon then attacks the user's target with its 1000 spirit fists. The size and power of the spirit is dependent upon the skill of the user.

Trivia

Although the spirit appearing with this technique is the bodhisattva Kannon, the
Welcoming Approach
 refers to the appearance of the
Amida Buddha
 at the time of one's death, welcoming the nearly-departed into the
Pure Land
. However, images of this Welcoming Approach often depict the Amida Buddha sitting on a purple cloud flanked by Kannon and
Seishi
, another bodhisattva. These three form a kind of trinity, especially revered in Pure Land Buddhism.
