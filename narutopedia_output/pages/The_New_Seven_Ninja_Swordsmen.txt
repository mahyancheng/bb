Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Shizuma's swordsmen
 collect the remaining swords from the vault, triggering the activation of several security puppets, which they destroy with the swords.
Kagura
 questions
Shizuma
's belief of being able to pull off a revolution just by having acquired the swords, and Shizuma reveals he has backers connected to the
Land of Water
's
daimyō
 who disagree with
Chōjūrō
's moderate administration. After the revolution is done, Shizuma plans to install Kagura as
Mizukage
, so
Yagura
's blood would rule over
Kirigakure
 again, as a place that accepts him. Chōjūrō and
Mei
 examine their message left over the vault. Chōjūrō deduces Shizuma coaxed Kagura into giving them the key to the vault. He decides to impose a gag order on the situation, and have them executed should they attack villagers.

Boruto
 and
Sarada
 reach Chōjūrō and Mei, and Boruto tells him Kagura went along with the plan so he'd be spared. Chōjūrō states that as a shinobi, Kagura knows the consequences of breaking the rules. Boruto suggests they downplay the situation to an incident between kids who don't know better. When Mei expresses disagreement, he implies he'll play up the injury he sustained from Shizuma to stir a diplomatic incident. Chōjūrō agrees to let them handle it, on the condition he accompanies them, and that they resolve the situation within a time limit. Shizuma and
Buntan
 think fondly of the upcoming conflict. Kagura dreads what he might have to do should Boruto interfere.
Iwabee
 goes for a walk after he and
Denki
 notice Boruto's absence during the day. Boruto and Sarada ask Denki to come up with an excuse should they be absent during roll call.
Shikadai
 and
Inojin
 find this sketchy, and decide not to ignore it. Iwabee finds and presses on
Tsurushi
 for information. Meanwhile,
Mitsuki
 tells
Suigetsu
 he knows he's been followed. Suigetsu passes on instructions for Mitsuki not to get further involved so Kirigakure doesn't learn of the connection between them. Suigetsu dislikes having to stay hidden after being away from home for so long, and decries the new group calling themselves swordsmen despite having no war experience. Mitsuki decides to do as he pleases. Shikadai and Inojin watch the exchange, but are discovered by Suigetsu. The situation gives Mitsuki an idea on how to deal with Shizuma, and Suigetsu hands him a scroll. Shizuma's swordsmen try destroying the memorial, but are interrupted by Boruto, Sarada, and Chōjūrō. Shizuma intends to kill Chōjūrō, and puts up a barrier, which he notes is superior to Tsurushi's.
Hebiichigo
 halts Chōjūrō's movements with wire.
Ichirōta
 breaks the ground below Sarada with
Shibuki
, and Buntan goes after Sarada.
Hassaku
 and Hebiichigo voice their grievances to Chōjūrō, who accepts some of their criticism, and also discuss Kagura. The two and
Kyohō
 attack him. Ichirōta is concerned the others will play for too long, allowing reinforcements to arrive. Boruto, unable to see through the mist, fails to notice Kagura approaching.
