) is episode 422 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Konohamaru
 cleans
Naruto
's apartment. Soon after that, Naruto returns home from his long training, with
Team Ebisu
 and
Sakura
 meeting up with him. Konohamaru shows Naruto his improved
Sexy Technique
, but the boy reveals that he has already created an advanced version of the technique, only to be hit by Sakura for being a pervert. Naruto and Konohamaru then come back to Naruto's apartment, with the boy putting his old jacket into one of the drawers for safe keeping. After that, Naruto is shown to begin teaching Konohamaru
Rasengan
, who's imagining that he's being taught an advanced version of the Sexy Technique. Naruto then impresses Konohamaru by showing him the Rasengan first-hand and gives him a water balloon, telling him to practice rotation.
 Soon after that,
Gaara
 is kidnapped by the
Akatsuki
 and Naruto leaves to help him. In the meantime, Konohamaru, not comprehending the rotation aspect of the technique, asks
Kiba
,
Chōji
 and
Hinata
 to help him out, but to no avail. Deciding to heat-up the sexiness of his Sexy Technique, Team Ebisu goes to
Ebisu
 for some help, thinking that it would help Konohamaru learn the Rasengan more quickly. Taking a few magazines from his sensei, the team takes their leave. Later, using the
Transformation Technique
 to transform into a girl spinning a hula-hoop, Konohamaru, with enough practice, pops the water balloon using
chakra
 and shows it to Naruto, who gives him a rubber ball and tells him to practice power. Having no idea how to do it, Konohamaru, alongside
Moegi
 and
Udon
, go ask Ebisu for help again. Meeting him in the park, alongside
Iruka
, all three transform into sexy girls and asks which one, in his opinion, is the most attractive. Ebisu then gives some advice to Konohamaru, which inspires him to use his Sexy Technique to transform into a girl, hiding her breasts and then revealing them, sending Ebisu flying with a bloody nose, in a comedic fashion. Soon after that, Konohamaru begins training again, determined to learn the technique.

Trivia

The episode shows Konohamaru cleaning Naruto's apartment so that it is clean when Naruto returns. This contradicts
episode 7
 of
Naruto: Shippūden
 where Naruto returns to his apartment to find it dusty and filled with cobwebs.
