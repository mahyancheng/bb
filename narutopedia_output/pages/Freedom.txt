English

My arms and legs are tied up

I'm like a marionette

Is something like that even possible

What the hell is going on

(Tell me tell me) Who's the ruler? So I can stay away from him

I don't want to hear more of your thinking, starting now i will make my own decisions

It seems as if the strings are cutting themself up

Just in time now we have to do our best until the end

Together we will win this

Nobody wil interfere

Stand up!! Come on, let's reach up for liberty

Now is the best time to strike

Wake up! Come on, let's step up and scream it out

Oh yes we are the dreamers

Run for you freedom

Nobody will left out

Run for you freedom

Break the doors into your dreams

(So you better) Stand up!! Come on let's reach out for liberty!

Now is the best time to strike

Wake up! Come on let's step up and scream it out

Oh yes we are the dreamers

Run for your freedom

Nobody will be left out

Run for you freedom

Break the doors into your dreams

Fight for your freedom!

English (Full Version)

My arms and legs are tied up

I'm like a marionette

No way this is happening

What the hell is going on?

Tell me, tell me

Who's the ruler?

Don't touch me so familiarly

I don't want to hear your half-truths any more

From now on I'm taking the decisions!

Cut off those invisible chains

Go to the very end of your limits

If you don't grab hold of victory by yourself

It's going to fall in someone else's hands

Stand Up!! Come, everyone, reach out for liberty

Now is the time to act

Wake up!! Come, everyone, step up and shout

Oh yes, we are the dreamers

Run for your freedom

Even if you don't have the means*

Run for your freedom

Kick in the gate to your dreams

Fight for your freedom!!

Count down 1.2.3!

The bomb's fuse is lit

You have to get out of here by yourself

Funky time is running out

Show me, show me

Who's the leader?

Confront, even if it kills you

Advance fearlessly

It's time to take wing!

Until the invisible door opens

keep holding on to your determination

If you don't desire it

It's going to fall in someone else's hands

Stand Up!! Come, everyone, reach out for liberty

Now is the time to act

Wake up!! Come, everyone, step up and shout

Oh yes, we are the dreamers

Run for your freedom

Even if you don't have the means

Run for your freedom

Kick in the door to your dreams

Fight for your freedom!!

Before asking "why? why? why?"

try to move, move, move

Look, listen, use your body

There's nothing but lies in this world

Watch your step for booby traps

The tricks out there are unreasonable

If you want a way out, grab it yourself

In this thorny bush there is but one truth

It hurts, it hurts, boy it hurts!

Hit it, hit it, crush it!

Before using your head, feel it with your entire body

If you remain unhurt you can't get no freedom!!

Stand Up!! Come, everyone, reach out for liberty

Now is the time to act

Wake up!! Come, everyone, step up and shout

Oh yes, we are the dreamers

Run for your freedom

Even if you don't have the means

Run for your freedom

Kick in the door to your dreams

So you better

stand Up!! Come, everyone, reach out for liberty

Now is the time to act

Wake up!! Come, everyone, step up and shout

Oh yes, we are the dreamers

Run for your freedom

Even if you don't have the means

Run for your freedom

Kick in the door to your dreams

Fight for your freedom!!

Ah Oh Ah Oh Ah Ah Ah Yeah Yeah

Ah Oh Ah Oh Ah Ah Ah...

Trivia

This is the third song by HOME MADE KAZOKU used in
Naruto
 media, the first and second song were "
Shooting Star ~Shooting Star~
" and "
NO RAIN NO RAINBOW
".

Sakura, Ino, Hinata, and Tenten are nearly similar to
eighth ending
 in Part II.

The second version of the ending was made as a tribute to the victims of the
2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami
. This can be seen on the sign at the end, which translates as "Stay strong".
