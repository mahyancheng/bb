This technique is a unique form of
sealing
 which was passed down in the
Land of the Sky
 and used to restrain the
Zero-Tails
.

Overview

This technique is designed to use dark
chakra
 generated by the Zero-Tails rather than to seal it. It would appear to be a complex sealing technique, given the many sealing formulas in surrounding sealing room, as well as a rather large tablet, which is actually used to restrain the beast.

The exact mechanics of this technique are unknown, however, after the Zero-Tails was sealed, the beast became encased in a tan coloured cocoon-like structure, with the addition of several tubular attachments, which allow the beast to channel its dark chakra through the Ancor Vantian. The technique also acts to protect the Zero-Tails by absorbing any chakra from external sources which pose a threat.

Trivia

Even restrained, the Zero-Tails is still capable of manifesting itself, and using its abilities.

In
Naruto Mobile
, Zero-Tails himself is able to use this technique to "freeze" an opponent for 15 seconds and attack them without hindrance.
