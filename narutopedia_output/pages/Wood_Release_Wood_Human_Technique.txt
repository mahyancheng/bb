After forming the required hand seals, the user creates an enormous statue-like creature out of wood. This humanoid creature with a full body and an oni-like face is usually created with a
wooden dragon
 wrapped around its torso, and is generally used in battle as an avatar. The wooden dragon can be multiplied and be used to attack its enemies directly as well. This creature is stated to be as powerful as the
Nine-Tails
,
 and could catch an uncompressed, uncharged, standard
Tailed Beast Ball
 fired by the latter. If the user doesn't have enough time to manifest the entire body, they can manifest a limb or two first to buy enough time for the full body to form.
 It could even clash against the likes of
Madara Uchiha
's Complete Body —
Susanoo
, which was stated by Madara himself to have destructive powers rivalling even the
tailed beasts
.

In the anime, it is capable of spawning multiple Wood Dragon heads, each capable of self-destructing.

Influence

This technique seems to be based upon
Ryūtōki
 (
竜燈鬼
,
Dragon-Lamp Demon
), a creature from Japanese folklores, who is typically depicted as a small
oni
 with a dragon coiled around its torso. Together with Tentōki (
天燈鬼
,
Heavenly-Lamp Demon
), the pair symbolise the power of the
Shitennō
 to repel and defeat evil.

The Buddhist monk
Kōben
 sculpted notable wooden statues of both Tentōki and Ryūtōki, which are each considered a National Treasure of Japan.

Trivia

When Hashirama used the
Sage Art Wood Release: True Several Thousand Hands
 technique, this creature was depicted sitting atop the statue's head.

While never seen using it in the series,
Tobi
 is listed as a user of this technique in
Jin no Sho
.
