"
Big Adventure! The Quest for the Fourth Hokage's Legacy Part 1
" (
大冒険! 四代目の遺産を探せ・前編
,
Daigōken! Yondaime no Isan wo Sagase Zenpen
) is episode 170 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 attempts to master the
Summoning Technique
 in order to use it during the final rounds of the
Chūnin Exams
, only to
produce a tadpole with legs
. As Naruto
passes out
 from exhaustion, he manages to hear
Jiraiya
 mutter how he had hoped Naruto would be able to use the
Fourth Hokage
's legacy to clear the final rounds.

After being
discharged
 from the
Konoha Hospital
, Naruto and
Chōji
 have lunch at
Ramen Ichiraku
, where Naruto leaves Chōji to pay the bill. He encounters
Konohamaru
, who shows Naruto his new
Sexy Technique: Pole Dance and Nice Body
. However, Naruto spots the
Three Sand Siblings
 and apologises to Konohamaru for not having the time to spend with him, as he needs to find the Fourth's legacy in order to cinch the final rounds. After asking the
Third Hokage
 about the Fourth's legacy and failing to get any answers from
Anko
,
Guy
 tells him to go on a dangerous quest where he shall find the answer. Chōji, who had been spying on Naruto, informs
Shikamaru
 and
Ino
 where the Fourth's legacy is located, since they believe it would help Shikamaru win his match.

Sakura
 joins Naruto's quest as she secretly wishes to pass the Fourth's legacy to
Sasuke
 to help him win. After Guy shows up pretending to be a sage (fooling no one but Naruto),
Team 7
 and
Team 10
 end up travelling together and, except for Shikamaru, find themselves stuck on a spider web. After Naruto uses his
Naruto Uzumaki Combo
 to defeat the giant spider, which was nothing more than a summon, Shikamaru realises that it was an intentional trap and that there are more on their path. Careless, Naruto rushes ahead.

Trivia

A poster of
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower
 appears in this episode.

There are plot holes in this episode:

Konohamaru
 is shown wearing his helmet in this episode, although he had replaced it with goggles after
meeting

Naruto
.

Chōji
 is seen participating in the hunt for the
Fourth Hokage
's legacy, which takes place
the day before
 the final rounds. However, at that time he was hospitalised due to indigestion, and was not discharged until right before
Shikamaru's match
. Additionally, Naruto,
Shikamaru
,
Ino
 and
Guy
 are involved in the quest as well, even though the day before the final rounds, Ino was at the
hospital
 with Chōji while Shikamaru and Naruto encountered
Gaara
 trying to kill
Lee
, who was saved by the arrival of Guy.
