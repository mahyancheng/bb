In the manga, when Sasuke reveals
 and later deactivates

Kage
, both on a map and in their discussion, the hidden village located between the Lands of

" (

 is telling the allied troops about his abilities, he says, "

" (

,
"Washi Raiton o tsukau! Doton no shinobi o zenretsu ni oki washi o seme tatero!!"
).
 In the tankōbon version, this is changed into, "
I'm a Lightning Release user! Place your Earth Release users in the front row to create shields, while your Wind Release users attack me incessantly!!

,
Ōdama Rasen Tairengan
).

While describing the Ten-Tails' power, one of the names Kurama uses to describe it is Daidarabotchi (

,
literally meaning:
 Giant).
 In the tankōbon version, this was changed to Deidarabotchi (
デイダラボッチ
,
Deidarabocchi
), which has the same meaning.

Additions

Several pages were added during Nagato and Naruto's conversation, as the exchange neared its conclusion.

After Nagato's death, as a result of
reviving
 those he had killed, the chapter originally ended with a scene of
Taka
 setting out for Konoha.
 In the tankōbon release, this was moved to
chapter 450
 and replaced with a scene where Naruto creates a
memorial to Jiraiya
.
 Additional panels and text that didn't occur in the original, where also added to the celebrations in chapter 450, partially as a consequence of this alteration.

In the tankōbon version of volume 53, several panels were added and changed. After Naruto seals the
Nine-Tails
,
Kushina
 grabs his hands to congratulate him, in the original she doesn't.

In the original publication, Sasuke ponders his answer in a two-page spread of various moments of his interactions with Itachi through the series, thinking about Itachi's words, and giving his answer in the next page.
 In the tankōbon release, two extra pages are added before Sasuke makes his decision, with Sasuke being zoomed out of against a black background, Itachi's words being scattered through these two pages instead of the spread of their interactions.

In chapter 699 of
volume 72
, two additional pages were added, showing Naruto and Sasuke and the seal to undo the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
.

In the same chapter, two panels were added to Hinata's awakening from the Infinite Tsukuyomi.

An additional word was also added when Naruto came to send Sasuke off. The latter says "I thought that you weren't coming…" in the chapter version
 and "I thought that you weren't coming to send me off…" in the volume version.
