This suit worn by Nurari contains an unknown slimy substance, appearing to be a mucus-like membrane.
Hinata
 claims Nurari's entire "body" is a technique as the suit is full of chakra. She also describes the slime as being like
birdlime
. Nurari can
manipulate the substance
, allowing him to create a shield and fire it as projectiles capable of pinning targets down with its stickiness. Within the suit, Nurari gains shape-shifting capabilities that allow him to form extra limbs and grow many times his own size.
