 (
託された想い!!
,
Takusareta Omoi!!
,
Viz:
 Final Battle) is volume 31 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 272

"
Granny Chiyo vs. Sasori…!!
" (
チヨバアVSサソリ…!!
,
Chiyo-Baa Bāsasu Sasori…!!
)

Sakura
 grabs
Sasori
 before he can reach
Chiyo
 and pulls him towards her. She punches him and he falls apart but,
being a puppet
, he is able to put himself back together. Seeing that he will not be easy to defeat, Chiyo takes a
puppet
's arm to replace the one she lost and brings out the
Chikamatsu Collection
. Sasori is impressed by her ability to control one puppet with each of her fingers, but demonstrates how his puppet body allows him to control
one hundred puppets
. Disappointed that the battle has dragged on for so long, Sasori prepares to finish Chiyo and Sakura.

Chapter 273

"
The Last Battle!!
" (
ラストバトル!!
,
Rasuto Batoru!!
)

While
Chiyo
's
ten puppets
 are individually stronger than
Sasori
's
one hundred
, they are overpowered in a contest of numbers.
Sakura
 protects Chiyo from any
puppets
 that get too close. Knowing this can't go on forever, Sakura attacks Sasori directly, hitting him with a
chakra
-suppressing
seal
. Though the battle seems won, Sasori's body no longer able to move or control puppets, another Sasori appears behind Chiyo. He tries to kill Chiyo but Sakura uses herself as a shield.

Chapter 274

"
An Unfulfilled Dream
" (
叶わぬ夢
,
Kanawanu Yume
)

Despite having been struck by a
poisonous
 blade,
Sakura
 manages to hold on to the
sword
 to prevent
Sasori
 from escaping. She tells
Chiyo
 to take the last antidote, Chiyo having been struck earlier, but Chiyo ignores her and injects her with the antidote. Chiyo collapses and Sasori, disconnecting from the sword, moves to finish her. Chiyo uses the
Mother and Father

puppets
 to stab him through his core, the only part of his humanity he kept when turning himself into a puppet so that he could still use
chakra
. Chiyo begins healing Sakura but Sasori observes that the wound is too severe. Chiyo responds that she is not healing Sakura but transferring her life to Sakura with a
technique
 she created to give life to Sasori's Mother and Father puppets, something he will no longer need.

Chapter 275

"
Reward…!!
" (
褒美…!!
,
Hōbi…!!
)

Because she is using a
life-transferring

technique
, since
Sakura
 was not dead,
Chiyo
 does not die by reviving her.
Sasori
 is disappointed that he has not been able to kill anyone and laments that he is now dying because he could not completely convert himself into a
puppet
. As his life wanes, he does something "pointless": as a reward to Sakura for surviving, he tells her of a
spy
 within
Orochimaru
's ranks that he was scheduled to meet in ten days' time at the
Tenchi Bridge
. He dies in the embrace of his
Mother and Father
 puppets and Chiyo speculates about Sasori not being able to avoid her last attack. She collapses, still poisoned, but refuses Sakura's offers to take her back to
Sunagakure
, claiming to still have something to do. Meanwhile,
Naruto
 and
Kakashi
 are still following
Deidara
. After preparing his
Mangekyō Sharingan
, Kakashi tells Naruto to start.

Chapter 276

"
The New Sharingan!!
" (
新しい写輪眼!!
,
Atarashii Sharingan!!
)

Despite
Kakashi
's
Mangekyō Sharingan
,
Naruto
 offers to finish off
Deidara
 if Kakashi cannot. Kakashi agrees if that becomes necessary. He uses
Kamui
 to try and send Deidara to another dimension, but his aim keeps missing and he is only manages to severe Deidara's arm. This at least creates an opportunity for Naruto to destroy the bird Deidara is flying on. Naruto retrieves
Gaara
's body and Deidara tries to flee on foot, but is attacked by
another
 Naruto.

Chapter 277

"
The Ultimate Art!!
" (
究極の芸術!!
,
Kyūkyoku no Geijutsu!!
)

Naruto
 and his
shadow clones
 surround and pummel
Deidara
, only to discover that they are attacking a
Clay Clone
. Frustrated, Naruto begins to develop a
chakra cloak
, which
Kakashi
 suppresses with a
seal
 given to him by
Jiraiya
 in case this happened.
Chiyo
 and
Sakura
 join up with them, revealing to Deidara that
Sasori
 has been defeated. Upset, Deidara tries to sneak away but is stopped by
Team Guy
, they having finally defeated their exact counterparts. Cornered, Deidara consumes some clay and starts to blow up.

Chapter 278

"
Gaara's Death
" (
我愛羅の死
,
Gaara no Shi
)

While
Team 7
 and
Team Guy
 try to run.
Kakashi
, knowing they cannot get out of the blast radius in time, uses
Kamui
 on
Deidara
 to send the explosion to
another dimension
. Kakashi, exhausted from overusing his
Mangekyō Sharingan
, collapses afterwards. The two teams relocate to a field where
Sakura
 tries to revive
Gaara
, but he has already died so there is nothing she can do.
Naruto
 begins to cry and lashes out at
Chiyo
 for
sealing

Shukaku
 within Gaara in the first place, therefore causing out his death after sentencing him to a life of loneliness. Knowing he is right, Chiyo begins to use her
life-transference

technique
 on Gaara.

Chapter 279

"
A Miraculous Power…!!
" (
不思議な力…!!
,
Fushigina Chikara…!!
)

Chiyo
 lacks the
chakra
 to complete her
One's Own Life Reincarnation
 as she would die for nothing. Eager to help
Gaara
 and ignorant of what it means for Chiyo,
Naruto
 offers to help her bring him back. Glad to see that Naruto, a
Konoha

ninja
, is so willing to help Gaara, a
Suna
 ninja, Chiyo accepts. As the transfer nears completion she encourages Naruto to continue forming the bonds of friendship with rival villages her own generation discouraged. She also tells
Sakura
 not to risk her life for an old woman again in the future. Gaara wakes up and finds himself surrounded by all of the Sunagakure ninja that went to look for him.

Chapter 280

"
Entrusted Feelings!!
" (
託された想い!!
,
Takusareta Omoi!!
)

The
Sunagakure

ninja
 celebrate
Gaara
's revival.
Temari
 and
Kankurō
 thank
Naruto
 for saving their brother, but he tells them they should thank
Chiyo
 instead; when she "wakes up". They then correct him explaining that Chiyo gave her life to
resurrect
 Gaara. Naruto reflects on her final words and realises that Chiyo, like the
Third Hokage
, sacrificed herself to protect the next generation. Everyone present has a moment of silence for her. Elsewhere,
Deidara
, having escaped
Kakashi
 and the others, goes looking for his severed arm with his
Akatsuki
 ring.
Zetsu
 and
Tobi
 also search for
Sasori
's ring, which the latter takes so that he can join the Akatsuki. Tobi then starts to play with the ring, before it accidentally slips through his hand.

Author's Note

“

Recently I carelessly plucked a wart off of my upper arm. Gouging it out left that part of my skin damaged with a depression in it. The whole thing left me with a different kind of depression.
