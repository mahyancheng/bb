" (

) is episode 176 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Working together, the group escapes from the cave-in with the treasure, but learns that
Hinata
 injured her leg. After realising that
Naruto
 and
Kiba
 argue too often while Hinata worries for the others too much, they head into the town to stop their
copies
. The group outwits and defeats their copies except Naruto, who uses
Nine-Tails
' chakra fuelled
shadow clones
 to defeat his copy, because his copy was running up a huge debt under his name, and ate all his food (including some ramen he was saving for a special occasion). Naruto's copy also accidentally bumped into
Sakura
, who was walking out of the library with an extremely tall stack of books. The copy then ridicules Sakura for being such a klutz, which angers her and leads her to unknowingly punch the real Naruto. Naruto, Kiba, and Hinata learn that the mission was a test to see if they could work together as a team, and that they passed it.
Tsunade
 becomes upset when the "treasure" turns out to be a bill for services.
