The Raikage vs. Naruto?!
" (
雷影VSナルト!?
,
Raikage Bāsasu Naruto!?
) is chapter 541 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

The
Raikage
 declares that he won't let
Naruto
 and
B
 go any further, and Naruto attempts to reason with him, albeit unsuccesfully. He then pleads
Tsunade
 to act, but she reluctantly refuses, stating that she's unable to take individual action as the
Hokage
 to help him this time. Naruto, understanding this, tries to escape, but the Raikage intercepts him. Tsunade marvels that Naruto is able to keep up with the Raikage, who states that he is the fastest shinobi alive now that the
Fourth Hokage
 has passed away. He angrily berates Naruto that he is just like his father — a hot-headed idiot — and that if the Fourth Hokage, who
Jiraiya
 had called the
Saviour of this World
, had succeeded in dealing with the
Nine-Tailed Fox
 that they would never be in this situation. The Raikage states that if Naruto still refuses to stand down, then he will have no choice but to kill him in order to prevent
Tobi
's plan from coming to fruition, and moves to attack him, but is stopped by B. The Raikage angrily tells them that they are
jinchūriki
 and cannot act on their own. Tsunade is furious that the Raikage would attempt to act without the approval of the rest of the
Kage
, and that he immediately went for Naruto, to which the Raikage replies that he would kill his brother too, if and when the time came, but that presently B is the more useful jinchūriki. B refuses to move aside, telling his brother that he's not merely a weapon, but an individual with things he loves and would fight for. They bump fists, and the Raikage recalls the time B was chosen to be his brother and partner.
