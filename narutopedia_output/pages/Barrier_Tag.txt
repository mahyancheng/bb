These tags are special pieces of paper inscribed with the kanji to "tie" or "bind" (
結
,
ketsu
), which is short for the word "barrier" (
結界
,
kekkai
). The tag most likely forms a barrier to protect whatever is located within the perimeter it forms.
 When these tags were used, shinobi were stationed above them which indicates that the technique might require maintaining.

Trivia

There were most likely several other tags and shinobi stationed around the area so as to complete the barrier's formation.
