The
Wind Release: Great Cast Net
 technique works similar to its parent technique whereby the user utilises their
Giant Folding Fan
 to create a multitude of extremely sharp blades of wind to attack their opponent with. These blades of wind overlap with one another forming a figurative net which cuts the target from all angles.

This technique can be used in conjunction with other
tessenjutsu
 users for increased power.
