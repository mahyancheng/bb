"
Your Opponent is Me!
" (
お前の相手はこのオレだ!
,
Omae no Aite wa Kono Ore da!
) is episode 115 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

When the
retrieval team
 catches up with the
Sound Four
, they are quickly caught in
Kidōmaru
's spider webs. As Kidōmaru is about to finish off
Naruto
,
Neji
 frees himself from the webbing and saves the rest of his team. Deciding to deal with Kidōmaru himself, as his
Gentle Fist
 techniques are the only able to sever Kidōmaru's spider webs, Neji instructs the others to go on without him, and begins to fight his own opponent.

After a series of battle exchanges, Kidōmaru has Neji pinned to a tree with his webs. He recalls what he had heard from
Orochimaru
 about the Gentle Fist and how Neji manages to cut his threads. Kidōmaru then readies another blow with
Sticky Spider Thread
 technique, but before it can hit its target, Neji succeeds in escaping from his trap. He explains to his opponent that chakra points were not only located to his hands, but all over his body as well. Although Kidōmaru soon believes himself to have the advantage, Neji readies his
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
 to prove him wrong.
