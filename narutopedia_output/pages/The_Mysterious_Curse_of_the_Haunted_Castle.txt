"
The Mysterious Curse of the Haunted Castle
" (
怪奇　呪われた幽霊城
,
Kaiki Norowareta Yūrei-jō
) is episode 194 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

When the
daimyō
's wife,
Kayo
 of the
Land of Honey
 went missing,
Naruto
 was sent on a mission to find her with
Hinata
 and
Kiba
. Upon arriving at the princess' last known location, they found a large castle and decided to investigate, much to Naruto's disapproval due to his fear of the supernatural. Soon after entering, the team began finding all kinds of strange things happening like people in pictures moving and books flying. Soon it became clear that the castle was not what it appears. It was later discovered that fifty years ago the ruler of the castle,
Kōza Kubisaki
, placed a "curse" on the castle so all who entered it would be devoured. Hinata then used her Byakugan to discover that the castle was somehow alive. After discovering this, the castle appearance changed to what appeared to be the insides of a giant creature. They were able to discover that the creature was actually a giant chameleon summon that had been carrying out its dead master's orders for over fifty years. Through the surprising help of the spirit of Kōza they were able to find the summon's summoning scroll and destroy it, causing the summoning to disappear. Naruto and his team were barely able to escape with Kayo and her men. Afterwards, Naruto and his team surmised that Kōza simply wanted their help to finally let the summoning go home.

Trivia

This episode is also known as the
Lady Daimyō Search Mission
.

In the English dubbed version, when Naruto trips over one of the dead samurai, he yells out "Zoinks!". This is a familiar yell of Shaggy, from the
Scooby-Doo
 cartoon series that deals with many supernatural mysteries. The episode itself is very similar to the series in many aspects.

Naruto was able to throw the
Rasengan
, making it a projectile weapon. Only Boruto would eventually
achieve this
.

The summoning scroll of
the Haunted Castle
 contains multiple signatories, including Masashi Kishimoto.
