) is episode 353 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Kakashi
 stumbles across the hideout for the
Iburi clan
, who immediately attack him, citing him as an enemy of
Orochimaru
. As
Gotta

enters
 Kakashi's body intent on killing him,
Kinoe
 puts a stop to it, and binds Kakashi with his
Wood Release
, claiming that he could get intel out of him if he were kept alive. Abandoning the interrogation, Kinoe informs Kakashi that he too was there to get to Orochimaru when he arrived there.
Yukimi
 soon returns and carries Kinoe and Kakashi through a secret passage to the outside world.
 Leaving Kakashi halfway, Yukimi tells Kinoe of how she dreamt of going outside to where the lovely sounds were coming from. She then enters Kinoe's body after turning into smoke, and the two make their way to the town nearby and partake in the entertainment here. Meanwhile, Kakashi is confronted by an enraged Gotta who demanded to know where Yukimi was before attacking Kakashi. Their intense battle does not last long, as an updraft causes Gotta's unstable smoke body to be torn apart. He passes away quickly, though not before passing on information to Kakashi that caused the young
Anbu
 to immediately seek out the renegade duo. Unveiling his true intentions, Kinoe refuses to sacrifice Yukimi, and opts to run away with Yukimi rather than return to the hollow tree. Elsewhere, the gravely injured Orochimaru finally makes it to the Iburi hideout.
