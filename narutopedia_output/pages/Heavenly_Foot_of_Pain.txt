Tsunade
 leaps into the air and concentrates all her strength into her heel. She then rapidly swings her heel down, not only doing severe damage to anyone she hits, but also cratering the ground and decimating the surrounding structures. As with all Tsunade's extreme feats of strength, this technique is possible because of her excellent
chakra
 control.

Trivia

In
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3
, some characters can be customised to use this technique.
