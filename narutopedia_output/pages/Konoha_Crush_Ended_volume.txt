Saigo no Ichigeki…!!
)

Naruto
 manages to wake
Gaara
 up, suppressing
Shukaku
's personality again. Angered by Naruto's actions, Gaara tries to crush him with sand, but
Gamabunta
 protects him with his tongue. Remembering that
Sakura
's life is at risk, Naruto is flooded with the
Nine-Tails
'
chakra
. He charges at Gaara and Gaara tries to restrain him, but Naruto persists, eventually head-butting him. The Shukaku likeness crumbles and both Naruto and Gaara fall to the earth, ready to exchange one final blow. At the
Chūnin Exams

Third Hokage
, meanwhile, realises that he lacks the strength to remove
Orochimaru
's entire soul and settles for putting an end to his schemes.

Chapter 137

"
Konoha Shinobi…!!
" (
木ノ葉の忍…!!
,
Konoha no Shinobi…!!
)

Orochimaru
 encourages the
Third Hokage
 to give up and die, especially since nothing he does can stop him from destroying
Konoha
 and its inhabitants. The Third ridicules Orochimaru for never having appreciated the calibre of Konoha ninja. At the same time, all across the village, the veteran ninja come to the village's defence;
Yūgao Uzuki
 vows to avenge
Hayate
;
Hiashi Hyūga
 defeats dozens of invaders; the fathers of
Team 10
 team up again for the first time in years;
Shibi Aburame
 saves his son
Shino
 from the poison he earlier inhaled;
Tsume
,
Hana Inuzuka
, and their
ninken
 prepare for battle; the two remaining invaders in the
Chūnin Exams
 stadium are surrounded;
Naruto
 and
Gaara
 leap at each other. Promising to teach Orochimaru that strength is not determined by one's techniques, the Third uses the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
 to seal away his arms. The Third looks upon his former student one last time and dies smiling, just as Naruto manages to defeat Gaara.

Chapter 138

"
Konoha Crush, Ended!!
" (
木ノ葉崩し、終結!!
,
Konoha Kuzushi, Shūketsu!!
)

Gaara
, defeated, and
Naruto
, exhausted, fall to the ground. The lifeless body of the
Third Hokage
 falls to the ground and
Orochimaru
 curses him for sealing his arms, thereby leaving him unable to perform techniques. Now unable to continue the
Konoha Crush
, Orochimaru flees with the
Sound Four
 in tow. Seeing this,
Baki
 and
Kabuto
 follow suit, knowing they have been defeated.
Temari
 collects
Kankurō
 and
Sasuke
 makes sure
Sakura
 is okay before proceeding to Naruto. Naruto crawls towards Gaara, who, fearing he is going to be finished off, tells him to stay away. Naruto only sympathises with everything Gaara has gone through, telling him that he might have ended up just like him if he hadn't found friends. Accordingly, if Gaara harms those friends, Naruto will have no choice but to kill him. Seeing that Naruto's strength is gained from fighting for others, Gaara questions his practice of thinking only for himself. While Temari and Kankurō carry him home, he apologises to them which shocks Temari and Kankurō. The remaining invaders flee
Konoha
 and the Konoha ninja gather around the Third's body.

That Person's Name is…!!
" (

cloaked

individuals
 look upon a devastated
Konoha
. Two days after the failed
Konoha Crush

Third Hokage
 is held.
Iruka
 comforts the Third's grandson,

parents
, the Third assured him that they and all others who die in the village's service live on so long as Konoha exists.
Kakashi
 and
Yūgao
 visit the
Memorial Stone
 in memory of others that have died before going to the ceremony.
Jiraiya
 watches them and thinks about his time under the Third's tutelage, shedding a tear over how perverted he and his master were.
Naruto
 asks Iruka why people die to protect others, to which Iruka responds it is human nature. Agreeing, Naruto leaves with the rest of
Team 7
 and Iruka remarks that the Third will inevitably be replaced by someone else who is an equally great
Hokage
.

Chapter 140

"
Approaching…!!
" (
接近…!!
,
Sekkin…!!
)

Kabuto
 examines
Orochimaru
, concluding that there is nothing he can do to remove the
Third Hokage
's seal. He at least finds a positive in
Sasuke
's progress, though regrets that Orochimaru has had to go through so much for Sasuke since he could not defeat
Itachi
. Meanwhile,
Koharu Utatane
 and
Homura Mitokado
 approach
Jiraiya
 and tell him that, after
Sunagakure
 found the
Fourth Kazekage
's body, they surrendered to
Konoha
, their entire involvement in the
Konoha Crush
 having been Orochimaru's doing. With the village's situation and the Third's death, they ask Jiraiya to become the next
Hokage
. He declines, offering to find
Tsunade
 for the position instead, but requests that
Naruto
 be allowed to come with him. Meanwhile,
Kakashi
 tails
two suspicious individuals
. Because he has business with Sasuke, he has
Kurenai
 and
Asuma
 follow the two.

Chapter 141

"
Itachi Uchiha!!
" (
うちはイタチ!!
,
Uchiha Itachi!!
)

Asuma
 and
Kurenai
 confront the two
cloaked individuals
. Discovered, the two reveal themselves as
Itachi Uchiha
 and
Kisame Hoshigaki
. Recognising how dangerous they are, Asuma and Kurenai prepare for battle. Asuma blocks Kisame's sword attack with his knuckle blades while Kurenai prepares to use a
genjutsu
 on Itachi and Kisame. Kisame's manages to overpower Asuma and his sword slices his shoulder. Kurenai's genjutsu takes effect, but Itachi easily
reverses
 it onto Kurenai. Itachi then takes the initiative of attacking her while she's in the genjutsu, but she breaks it just in time to evade his lethal attack. Meanwhile, Asuma is able to avoid Kisame's sword swings, and then delivers a cut to Kisame's face with his
chakra-enhanced knuckle blade
. As the battle begins to get more intense,
Kakashi
 arrives to aid Kurenai and Asuma, apologising for intervening in their battle, but that he felt a bit uneasy about who they may be up against.

Chapter 142

"
Kakashi vs. Itachi
" (
カカシvsイタチ
,
Kakashi Bāsasu Itachi
)

Kakashi
 expresses surprise over the identities of the two men he had been following as
Kisame
 and, more particularly,
Itachi
. When Kisame tries to take him on, Itachi tells him to stand down, citing that they are too equal in strength and that a fight would only become an inconvenience. As he would not have these same problems, he attacks Kakashi. Seeing Itachi's
Mangekyō Sharingan
, Kakashi instructs
Asuma
 and
Kurenai
 to shut their eyes since they are no match for him. Itachi uses
Tsukuyomi
 on Kakashi, who just barely endures the attack because of his
Sharingan
. Struggling to remain standing, Kakashi asks why they have come to
Konoha
. Itachi replies that they are after the
Fourth Hokage
's
legacy
.

Chapter 143

"
The Fourth's Legacy!!
" (
四代目の遺産!!
,
Yondaime no Isan!!
)

Knowing that
Itachi
 and
Kisame
 are after
Naruto
,
Kakashi
 recalled about an earlier conversation he had with
Jiraiya
. Jiraiya informed Kakashi that he would thereafter being looking after Naruto, fearing that an organisation called
Akatsuki
 might someday come after him because of the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 sealed within him. Knowing Itachi is part of Akatsuki, Kakashi asks if this is correct. Angry that Kakashi knows about their organisation, Itachi instructs Kisame to capture Kakashi. As Kisame moves to attack
Guy
 appears and repels him. Seeing that things are becoming too difficult, Itachi leaves with Kisame. Meanwhile, Jiraiya tries to convince Naruto to help him look for
Tsunade
. Naruto has no interest until hearing that he can learn a technique stronger than
Sasuke
's
Chidori
, at which point he eagerly accompanies Jiraiya out of
Konoha
.

Chapter 144

"
Pursuers
" (
追跡者
,
Tsuisekisha
)

Naruto
 asks why
Jiraiya
 was so determined to teach him a new technique, and theorises that it's because he has some special ability. Jiraiya replies that it's because Naruto reminds him of the
Fourth Hokage
. Meanwhile, Sasuke continues to train, trying to become as strong as Naruto was during his fight with
Gaara
 for whenever he meets his brother,
Itachi
. When he visits
Kakashi
 later and finds Kakashi unconscious, he learns that he was defeated by Itachi, who has returned to
Konoha
 to capture Naruto. Sasuke goes looking for him and picks up on his trail, hoping to find him before Itachi does. Jiraiya and Naruto check into a motel a few miles from Konoha. When they catch a woman's attention, Jiraiya sends Naruto to their room so that he can try his luck. When someone knocks at their door a short while later, Naruto assumes Jiraiya has already been turned down and opens it. He instead finds Itachi.

Author's Note

“

Recently, in movies... What?! Film commentary again?! ...But it's pretty much the only thing I can write about... Sorry. So, back to the story... These days, there are usually three performers per character or role. The first is the billed actor (the star). The second is the stunt man. And then there is the CGI stuntman for particularly dangerous scenes or difficult camera shots. They're very well constructed. At this rate we, may even at this rate we may even eventually stop needing real actors...
