The fortress.



It is the cat-shaped fortress of
Nekomata
 which is guarded by numerous
ninneko
. The ninneko have shown to not take kindly to humans, as
Team 7
, who were on a mission to retrieve Nekomata's paw print, had to "disguise" themselves as cats with cat-ears to infiltrate the fortress. It is shown that it isn't completely a fortress as there were restaurants and bars seen within it and that were civilian cats as well. One of the ninneko guards that
Sasuke Uchiha
 questioned had a headband with the kanji for
truth
 or
sincerity
 (
誠
,
makoto
) written across it, like all the hidden villages have.
