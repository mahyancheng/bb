A Water Release technique.



Water Release
 (
水遁
,
Suiton
,
English TV:
 Water Style) is one of the five basic
nature transformations
, and is commonly affiliated with the Dog (
戌
,
Inu
) hand seal.

Overview

Water Release
jutsu
 are most easily performed using existing water sources, such as lakes or rivers.
 Users can also create water within their bodies with
chakra
, which they expel from their mouths, though this is generally regarded as a testament of skill;
Tobirama Senju
's ability to produce his own water is noted to be proof of his position as
Hokage
.
 Water Release is typically used offensively, doing
battering damage
 because of the sheer volume of water or
slicing damage
 because of the water's high pressure. Water Release can be used to trap targets, such as imprisoning them with
dense water
 or ensnaring them with
sticky water
. Defensively,
Water Formation Wall
 is a common option, with users surrounding themselves with water to be protected from harm. Alternatively, users can hide themselves from opponents with
thick mist
 to obscure vision or
water droplets
 to render the user invisible.

Water Release is common among ninja of
Kirigakure
, with the
Water Clone Technique
 being one of the village's trademark techniques.
 Various Kiri-nin utilise Water Release in characteristic ways:
Kisame Hoshigaki
 frequently
shapes
 his water into sharks, such as the
Water Shark Bullet
; members of the
Hōzuki clan
 use the
Hydrification Technique
 to turn their bodies into water, such as to
alter their body
 or
shoot it
 from their hands;
Utakata
 uses
Soap Bubble Ninjutsu
, which he employs for various purposes.

Water Release is naturally strong against
Fire Release
 and weak against
Earth Release
.
 If Water Release is used with
Wind Release
, as with the
Typhoon Water Vortex Technique
, the wind churns the water, increasing its damage and coverage area. If Water Release is used with
Lightning Release
, the water can
increase the range
 of the lightning, or the lightning can give the water a
numbing quality
; in
Sasuke Shinden
,
Sasuke Uchiha

purifies
 all his Water Release in order to minimise its conductivity of lightning. When Water Release is combined with other natures, certain
kekkei genkai
 are produced: water and wind make
Ice Release
; water and earth make
Wood Release
; water and lightning make
Storm Release
; water and fire make
Boil Release
; in
Akatsuki Hiden
, water and earth also make
Mud Release
.

Trivia

"
Suiton-no-jutsu
" is a real-life ninja art, examples of which include throwing duckweed over water in order to conceal underwater movement.

In
Sasuke Shinden: The Teacher's Star Pupil
, Sasuke uses scientific principles to manipulate the molecular structure of his Water Release. By moving the molecules closer together, he can change the water into ice. By moving the molecules further apart, he can change the water into steam.

In the anime, the
Funato clan
 bloodline possesses a mysterious power knows as the "
Power of the Sea Dragon
", which grants them instinctual power over water.
Ikada
, said to have inherited this power at greater magnitude than anyone before him, was able to easily split a gigantic wave despite his lack of experience in combat.
