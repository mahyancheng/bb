Synopsis

Sasuke
 wants
Fūshin
 to tell him everything he knows. Fūshin wonders if Sasuke can make him, and creates a strong windstorm. Sasuke dodges Fūshin's exploding chakra blades, getting nearer to Fūshin, but he increases the strength of the windstorm, turning it into a typhoon. It takes Sasuke manifesting his
Complete Body-Susanoo
 to cut through Fūshin's typhoon. Fūshin creates a greater typhoon, and Sasuke dispels his Susanoo, and takes advantage of the eye of the storm, where there is no wind, to get to Fūshin and strike him with
Chidori
. Sasuke tries reading his memories with the
Sharingan
, but again meets resistance from the
Ketsuryūgan
.
 It takes Sasuke using his
Mangekyō Sharingan
 to break free. Fūshin is no longer there. Sasuke makes his way to the Valley of Hell, and wonders if the
Chinoike clan
 really lived there.
Chino
 reveals herself, telling him they did. Chino tells Sasuke about the plights of being forced to live there, and how she was alone by the time En kidnapped her. The mention of her loneliness reminds Sasuke of himself and
Naruto
. Sasuke's interest in her loneliness causes her to show him her story with the Ketsuryūgan, being forced to become a shinobi by En Oyashiro. After she awakened the Ketsuryūgan, En made her fight in the Coliseum, where she defeated Fūshin, causing him to belong to
En Oyashiro
. Chino befriends him as they talk about
kekkei genkai
 and how each sees the other's past. One day, they found historical documents about the Chinoike clan, Fūshin suggesting them go to the Valley of Hell look for them. They gathered people who wanted to escape Oyashiro and fled. They came in defence of the
Bamboo Village
 one day, and came to be known as the Lightning Group after fighting for the sake of poor villages.
Kirigakure
 began to employ them, until they decided to get rid of them. The group sought asylum at the villages they had helped, where they were denied, out of fear Kirigakure would retaliate against them. Two of their group died and
Karyū
 left, leaving only the two of them, so they finally reach the Valley of Hell. Chino despairs as nothing there triggers any memory of her past. They are attacked by Kirigakure shinobi, and in the fight, Chino causes one of them to explode with her Ketsuryūgan. Chino vows revenge for her clan.
