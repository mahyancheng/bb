The
Land of Claws
 (
爪の国
,
Tsume no Kuni
) is featured in
episode 177
 of the anime. There was, at one point, tension between this nation and the
Land of Fangs
. The two sides barely averted a war thanks to one of
Jiraiya
's
Icha Icha
 novels, which was delivered to the Land of Fangs'
daimyō
 by mistake.
