The Beginning of the Crimson Spring
 (
紅き春の始まり
,
Akaki Haru no Hajimari
,
Viz:
 The Start of a Crimson Spring) is volume 69 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 658

"
Tailed Beasts vs. Madara…!!
" (
尾獣VSマダラ…!!
,
Bijū Bāsasu Madara…!!
)

With the
tailed beasts
 intent on fighting
Madara
 head on, the
Allied Shinobi Forces
' members decide to fall back in order to not become collateral damage. Leading the charge,
Gaara
 and
Shukaku
 attack Madara with their
Wind Release: Sand Buckshot
 technique. Noting that the technique was a good one — albeit without any wallop — Madara is surprised when Gaara immobilises him with the residual sand that was left inside of his body after the attack. Using the opportunity to attack, the tailed beasts each take a swing at their opponent, giving the sand-manipulating duo an opening to use their
Desert Layered Imperial Funeral Seal
 technique to seal Madara away.
 However, Madara escapes with the aid of his
Susanoo
, only mere moments before the sealing was completed. As the
Uchiha
 begins to boast,
Naruto
 and
Kurama
 lead the counter-attack on Madara by giving him a serious tail-whipping. The resulting attack was enough to damage Madara, sending his right arm flying, and forcing him to retreat. At the same time, however, a
White Zetsu Army
 clone
emerges
 from the ground informing Madara that he was able to complete his mission. Lopping off the unflinching Zetsu's right arm to replace his own, Madara notes — as he reveals his right
Rinnegan
 restored — that he would now be able to have some fun with at least one of his eyes restored.

Chapter 659

"
Limbo: Border Jail…!!
" (
輪墓・辺獄…!!
,
Rinbo: Hengoku…!!
)

The taste of his own blood and the pain he feels makes
Madara
 ecstatic, and as he begins to heal as a result of having
Hashirama
's power, he notes that having a living body had made him temporarily careless. Madara prepares to perform a
summon
, which puts
Kurama
 on edge, recalling when it was summoned by Madara once before.
Shukaku
 tells Kurama not to fret over one human, leading the fox to tell the tanuki never to underestimate Madara. Launching his plan, Madara summons the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 from inside
Obito
 which
Kakashi
 tries
ripping
 its head off, but only manages to take out its right arm before the statue is summoned to Madara's side. Madara notices the damage, and while conceding the opposing side has someone with a good dōjutsu, concludes that it would not make much of a difference.
 Naruto and the
tailed beasts
 notice the summon, and that Madara no longer has an
Impure World Reincarnation
 body. Naruto surmises that Madara had Obito
bring him back to life
. Elsewhere,
Black Zetsu
 and Obito argue over the Rinnegan while Madara jumps atop the statue and
focuses
 his
Rinnegan
 on them, causing the tailed beasts to be sent hurtling backwards. The legendary
Uchiha
 then has the statue use
its chains
 to restrain them before declaring that he will first extract
Gyūki
 and Kurama from
their

jinchūriki
.

Chapter 660

"
The Hidden Heart
" (
裏の心
,
Ura no Kokoro
)

As the two targeted
jinchūriki
 continue to struggle against their
restraints
,
Naruto
 attempts to withdraw the
Tailed Beast Mode
, but finds that he cannot suppress
Kurama
's chakra as
Madara
 deemed his efforts futile. The
White Zetsu Army
 clone inquires as to why
Madara
 did not go after
Shukaku
 first. Readjusting his strategy after contemplating his minion's words, Madara turns his focus on the One-Tail. Intercepting Madara's assault, however,
Gaara
 creates two enormous
sand-hands
 to help stop the chain from dragging the tanuki into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
.
 Declaring that he would not let Madara have the beast, Shukaku is shocked by the
Kazekage
's actions; which causes the beast to remember the time when it was sealed within Gaara as a child and its declaration to prey upon his mind, should he ever fall into deep sleep.

As the memories came pouring in, Shukaku also remembers the words of his
previous jinchūriki
: the priest who had foretold the beast of the day someone would come who would cause the beast to understand the words which were carved into his own hands: "heart" and "acceptance". This lead Shukaku to notice that the kanji for the word "love" (which was craved on Gaara's forehead) was actually a combination for the kanji for "acceptance" and "heart". As the White Zetsu Army clone decries Gaara's actions — having protected the creature which caused him to suffer for so long, and also that Gaara won't die even if Shukaku is sealed in the Demonic Statue — Madara equips his
Susanoo
 and launches one of its
swords
 at Gaara. As the sword hurtles towards Gaara, Shukaku intercepts it, declaring that it prided itself on its Absolute Defence after all. Manipulating the sword to boomerang across the battlefield, Madara is able to break the section of the chain Gaara held and reconnect it to the beast all while sending the sword directly at Gaara whose automatic defence protects him against the attack, but he is still knocked down. Telling the young man not to overdo it, Gaara notes that because he was no longer a jinchūriki, he could stay up as late as he wanted, as Shukaku's equal. As the beasts get dragged in,
B
 severs one of his own tentacles, while Kurama calls out to Gaara to ask a favour. Naruto is then ejected from his Tailed Beast Mode shroud. Gaara calls out to Naruto, who begins to fall to the ground.

Chapter 661

"
The Failed World
" (
失敗した世界
,
Shippaishita Sekai
)

With
Kurama
 extracted from his body,
Naruto
 falls unconscious as he hurtles towards the ground.
Gaara
 uses his
sand
 to cushion his comrade's fall while the
tailed beasts
 are resealed into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
. As
Madara
 criticises himself for his lack of power, he soon turns his attention to the talkative
White Zetsu Army
 clone, noting that they were nothing but failed experiments. Unaffected by these harsh words, the clone soon tells Madara that all was being taken care of on their side.
 Narrowly escaping
Tobirama
's
attack
, Madara seemingly gains the upper hand on the Second
Hokage
 only for him to disappear from sight before launching a follow up attack, giving Gaara enough time to escape with Naruto. Madara ultimately pins down Tobirama, and the two exchange words of contempt with one another. Meanwhile,
Sasuke
 prepares to reenter the fray atop
Garuda
 and recalls
Hashirama
 noting that he would give him a technique that would work against Madara in his current state. Though somewhat hesitant at first, Sasuke eventually presents himself to the incapacitated God of Shinobi, who gives him what is left of his chakra to stop Madara. As Madara berates Tobirama, who was once renowned as the fastest shinobi in the world, driving one of the stakes into the Second's head, the Uchiha shares his viewpoint once again before Tobirama makes a last-ditch effort to attack Madara, providing Sasuke with an opening to swoop in. However before Sasuke can land any kind of attack, the young Uchiha finds himself suspended in midair. Ignoring Tobirama's cries to stop, Madara drives the sword through Sasuke's chest, expressing his disappointment in the young Uchiha whom he deemed to have had given more than enough time to do something.

Chapter 662

"
The True End
" (
本当の終わり
,
Hontō no Owari
)

As
Gaara
 rushes to help
Naruto
,
Tobirama
 curses
Madara
 for stabbing
Sasuke
. Elsewhere, an attack from a
miniature version
 of
Hashirama
's
Sage Art Wood Release: True Several Thousand Hands
 technique is fended off by the
Third Hokage
, who is one of the only ones left with enough chakra to fight. The assailant is revealed to be
Tobi
, who still seems intent on uncovering the mechanics behind bowel movements.
 Meanwhile,
Orochimaru
 and his team take cover, planning a surprise attack on Tobi.
Karin
, who is visibly distraught over Sasuke, is barely able to convey what she
senses
. Naruto is brought to
Tsunade
 and her disciples
Shizune
 and
Sakura
, but of the trio Sakura is the only one who still has enough chakra to use
medical ninjutsu
. As the other sensor-type ninja detect Naruto's presence, Hinata
sees
 Naruto's failing heartbeat and rushes to his side, only to stumble and fall due to her low chakra levels. Tobi and a
White Zetsu clone
 note that despite Naruto being an
Uzumaki
, his death is inevitable due to
Kurama
's extraction. Elsewhere, Sasuke clings to consciousness by remembering his resolve to honour his
brother
's sacrifice and to change the shinobi world, but his energy fades as Madara walks away from him. As grief overtakes both Sakura, whose chakra is rapidly diminishing, and Karin, who senses Sasuke's predicament from afar, both realise that if things continue like this both Naruto and Sasuke will die.

Chapter 663

"
Absolutely
" (
絶対に
,
Zettai ni
)

As
Naruto
 lies dying,
Sakura
 continues to use
medical ninjutsu
 on him to no effect. With
Sasuke
 in no better a condition, an anguished
Tobirama
 laments his inability to help the young Uchiha, fearing the worst when he could no longer
sense
 Sasuke's
chakra
. Meanwhile, as the remainder of Kurama's chakra dissipates from around Sakura, she wonders why her techniques are ineffective until
Gaara
 informs her that Kurama had been extracted from Naruto, and his only hope was to get to
Minato
 and Yin-Kurama as Yang-Kurama had instructed.
 As Gaara anchors Sakura with his
sand
 and begins moving faster, Sakura switches her tactics and after making an
incision
 in Naruto's chest, begins to manually pump his heart, and performs
CPR
, adamant that Naruto is not going to die on her watch. Elsewhere a desperate
Karin
 is able to manifest the
Uzumaki

chains
 and decimate parts of
Tobi
's
statue
. Despite being impaled by
wooden stakes
, Karin merely
bites herself
 to recover from the injuries. Following up on the assault,
Suigetsu
 launches his
Water Gun Technique
 at the Zetsu clone's head revealing there is someone inside and giving
Orochimaru
 enough time to place a
cursed seal
 on the artificial clone, and
Jūgo
 the chance to rescue Karin; who notes that while she was fine, she could no longer
sense
 Sasuke's chakra as they rushed to his aid. All the while,
Madara
 casually
seals
 the
Ten-Tails
 into himself and after assuming his
jinchūriki
 form, departs to claim his left
eye
. With Sasuke's predicament looking grim, he is approached by an unknown barefooted individual.

Chapter 664

"
Because I'm a Father
" (
父親だから
,
Chichi Oya Dakara
)

As the mysterious person makes their way closer to
Sasuke
, neither
Tobirama
 nor
Karin
 can recognise them, nor their
chakra
 signature. Worrying that the mysterious person intends to do harm to Sasuke, Karin presses on ahead. Meanwhile,
Guy
 is ready to continue fighting, though he is obviously extremely worn out. Suddenly,
Gaara
 and
Sakura
 fly overhead. Guy deduces that they will head for
Kakashi
's location, and gets even more determined to go, exasperating
Tenten
.
 While
Madara
 flies towards his destination, he gets rid of both the
Kohaku no Jōhei
 and
Benihisago
 noting that the tools were bogging him down. The tools land on Guy and
Lee
 and Tenten then recognises the tools. On the other side of the battlefield, Kakashi and
Minato
 still fight
Black Zetsu
 until Minato's
half
 of
Kurama
 urges him to
sense
 around. As the Kazekage's group arrives, Minato asks Kakashi to fight Obito alongside Gaara as the Hokage starts transferring his
tailed beast
 in
his son
, all the while remembering a conversation with his
wife
 over protecting their then-unborn child. Before he completes the ritual, however, Black Zetsu manages to extend his body and absorbs Kurama's power in Naruto's place. As he laughs over finally getting his hands on Yin-Kurama, Madara arrives to where Minato and the others are and states that Black Zetsu was taking too long so he decided to come himself.

Chapter 665

"
The Current Me
" (
今のオレは
,
Ima no Ore wa
)

Apologising to his
master
 for being delayed so long,
Black Zetsu
 informs Madara that not only was he able to retrieve the
eye
, but also
Yin
-
Kurama
 from
Minato
 as well. Seemingly content with that, he commands Zetsu to bring both to him, but as the clone tries to leave
Obito
's body — no longer concerned about the threat around him — but finds himself unable to as his host regains consciousness.
The two
Uchiha
 have a conversation about Obito's role in Madara's
plan
, with the new
jinchūriki
 stating that the other was not Obito, but Madara, the one who rejected the world created by the
Sage of the Six Paths
 which had failed. Calling to him to stand by his side as he had once before, Obito starts walking towards Madara while Minato,
Kakashi
 and
Gaara
 try to stop them. However, their efforts prove futile as
Sakura
 watches on horrified and confused as she tries her best to keep
Naruto
 alive. Stretching out his hand to his ancestor once again, Obito bypasses Madara's own and instead sticks his hand into Madara's chest recreating the same
shakujō
 he wielded when he was the
Ten-Tails
' jinchūriki. Renouncing Madara's action and his plan as he remembers Naruto's words, Obito states that his current self is the one that wanted to become
Hokage
 — a person who stands at the forefront of hardship themselves and doesn't manipulate others to achieve their own goals. Declaring that he would no longer be Madara's pawn and hurt his comrades: because he's Obito Uchiha.

Chapter 666

"
Two Mangekyō
" (
二つの万華鏡
,
Futatsu no Mangekyō
)

As
Kakashi
 and
Minato
 realise that
Obito
 has finally regained a sense of himself,
Madara
 tries to take
his left eye
 but his outstretched hand
phases
 through him. Locked in their subconsciousnesses, Obito tries to extract the
tailed beasts
 from their current
jinchūriki
's body and manages to acquire a fragment of
Shukaku
 and
Gyūki
's chakra. Ordering Kakashi to teleport
Naruto
 to the
other dimension
, Obito tries to go there himself but Madara manages to stop him by sending one of the
mysterious orbs
 flying towards him.
 As Kakashi rallies to Obito's side, the latter declares that the legend could now witness the power of a paired
Sharingan
. In a bid to stop them both simultaneously, Madara launches two of the orbs towards both of them, but the two
Mangekyō Sharingan
-wielders synchronise their Kamui, doubling the speed of Obito's dimensional transfer. Once in the other dimension a wary
Sakura
 allows Obito to start the
tailed beast transfer
. In the real world, Kakashi is saved from Madara's attack thanks to
Guy
. As Madara ponders the new appearance on the battlefield, Minato silently thanks Guy as well as asks Obito to take care of his son.

Chapter 667

"
The End of Youthful Days
" (
碧き日の終わり
,
Aoki Hi no Owari
)

Finally arriving to
Sasuke
's side,
Orochimaru
 and
Taka
 discover that the mysterious man is
Kabuto
 — who was finally able to break
Itachi
's
Izanami
 by finding his true self. Using his
medical ninjutsu
 along with his knowledge about Hashirama's cells, Kabuto begins treating Sasuke under the instruction of
Tobirama
.
 On
Madara
's side,
Kakashi
 reassures his
sensei
 that he was all right before the Fourth reiterates that only
taijutsu
 and
senjutsu
 attacks would work on the
Ten-Tails
'
jinchūriki
, but that his skills with senjutsu are limited.
Guy
 opens the
seventh gate
 and attacks Madara with
a powerful punch
, but to no avail. With Madara
trying to kill
 Guy, Kakashi launches one of Minato's
kunai
 to
warp the black orb away
, but Guy is instead saved by
Rock Lee
, who brings him to their comrades' side. As the
shinobi
 wonder about how to deal with their enemy, Guy tells Kakashi that it is time for him to become a crimson beast by opening the eighth gate, which will eventually result in his death.

Chapter 668

"
The Beginning of the Crimson Spring
" (
紅き春の始まり
,
Akaki Haru no Hajimari
)

Immediately beginning their attempts to dissuade
Guy
 from his decision, his comrades soon abandon this as a fruitless endeavour. Comforting his
pupil
 by telling him that this was no time to look sad, Guy dashes forward to confront
Madara
 once more, opening the
Eighth Gate
.
 Remembering his father
Might Duy
 in these final moments before the confrontation, he remembers how he had lived his life, and in turn, how Guy had loved his own life, passing on principles of unwavering loyalty and true inner strength right down to the very last moment of his life where his father Duy was able to ultimately protect him, and his team-mates
Ebisu
 and
Genma
, from a generation of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
. Though Madara tried to trivialise Guy's incoming onslaught as nothing more than leaves that fall and rot in autumn, Guy corrected him, declaring that those leaves would become
nourishment for the new leaves
 on the tree before reaching his target and attacking him with the
Evening Elephant
.

Author's Note

“

There's something that I discovered only very recently, in regards to how I draw my manga drafts. I found a B lead 0.9 mm mechanical pencil very easy to draw with. And if I stick it in a pencil extender – that socket you put on the end of a pencil stub to keep using it – it's even easier to draw with. It really reduces the time it takes me to complete a draft!
