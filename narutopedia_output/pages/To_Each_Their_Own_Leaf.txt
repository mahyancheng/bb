"
To Each Their Own Leaf
" (
互いの木ノ葉
,
Tagai no Konoha
) is episode 335 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Kabuto
 is amused at the fact that
Sasuke
 is now getting along well with his late
brother
, despite his intent to kill him in the past. Attempting to manipulate him over to his side by saying both their goals are to destroy
Konohagakure
, Sasuke remains unconvinced as the young man denied his and Kabuto's goals are mutual. Recalling his life as a spy working for Konoha, Kabuto notes that he and Itachi are the same — both worked for the village and yet received dishonour in return. Itachi, however, declares that he is still Konoha's Itachi Uchiha, regardless of its dark side and inconsistencies.
 Casting the conversation aside, Itachi tells Sasuke about a technique that decides destiny —
Izanami
, which he will use to stop Kabuto and the
Impure World Reincarnation
 technique. Wasting no time, Kabuto attacks the brothers once more with his
Sage Art: Inorganic Reincarnation
, causing the cave formations to attack them. Kabuto attempts to rewrite Itachi's mind with the talisman but is
thwarted
 by Sasuke. Kabuto begins to boast about his current abilities and that he is closer than anyone in the world to the
Sage of the Six Paths
. Criticising the
Uchiha
 name in the process, he was stopped by Sasuke before he could say anything more as Itachi noted Kabuto reminded him of his old self. Kabuto recalls his childhood as an orphan, being raised by
Nonō
 in the
Konoha Orphanage
, while stating that from the very beginning, he wasn't aware of his identity and that he had nothing all his life.
