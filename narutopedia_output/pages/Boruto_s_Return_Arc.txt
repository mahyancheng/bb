Three years after
Boruto
's defection,
Shikamaru
 is the acting Eighth
Hokage
, and everyone but
Sarada
 and
Sumire
 think Boruto is
Konoha

Mitsuki
's vigilance against Boruto,
Kawaki
 is cold towards him.
Himawari

Chōchō
, still having faith in Boruto, her experiences with Kawaki protecting her having shifted to Boruto, and believing her
