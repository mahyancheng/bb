The
Conch King
 (
貝螺王
,
Baira Ō
) was a summon of
Kandachi
 who used its abilities with hand seals. The Conch King and Kandachi were defeated by
Naruto Uzumaki
's
Big Ball Rasengan
.

Abilities

The Conch King was a very strong summon, as even a
Sannin
 like
Jiraiya
 had problems to subdue it. By the command of his master Kandachi, it could
shoot spikes
 at several enemies at once or could
use his tongues
 like whips to restrain or kill the opponent. It could also use a unique
genjutsu
, in which the enemy is
frozen
 and unable to move. This technique was strong enough to render a Sannin powerless. Blowing air out of his lower body, it could hover.

Trivia

The Conch King might have been inspired by the
sazae-oni
 of Japanese folklore.

Despite being called "
Conch
 King", this creature is made of three parts, only its tail end resembling a conch while the other two segments resembled those of an
oyster
 and a
Giant Clam
 respectively.
