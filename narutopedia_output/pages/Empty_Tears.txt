"
Empty Tears
" (
空っぽの涙
,
Karappo no Namida
) is episode 201 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Kawaki
 is startled by
Kurama
's appearance, who introduces itself and explains that watching him while
Naruto
 sleeps was a request by the Five
Kage
. He has some concept of
tailed beasts
 from reading
Kara
's files, and assumes that having Kurama sealed in him is why Naruto leads
Konohagakure
. Kurama corrects him, explaining the parallels between Naruto's life and Kawaki's, and summarising all the antagonism it posed to Naruto through the years, from causing him to hurt those close to him, to how the village mistreated him for being Kurama's
jinchūriki
. It comments on the irony of Naruto's use of the
Shadow Clone Technique
 and his loneliness, Kawaki himself recalling Naruto's words on the jutsu. Kurama continues, mentioning how it saw Naruto fill his heart up through the years, and how he's at his strongest when protecting his friends. Kawaki tears up learning about Naruto, and Kurama tells him it's pretty late, so he should look for the missing vase piece the next day.
 The following day, Kawaki recalls how
Jigen
 trained him, and learns
walking up trees
 from Naruto.
Sarada
 and
Mitsuki
 watch from afar, and while sympathetic to Kawaki's circumstances, she is jealous of the treatment he gets from Naruto. Mitsuki points out it's natural for that to happen, as Naruto treats everyone in the village like family, even willing to let him be part of it. After training, Naruto asks
Boruto
 about the pain from
Kāma
. Boruto says it hasn't hurt in a while, and Kawaki reveals his hasn't hurt in a while either. Determined not to be outdone, Sarada comments that
Sasuke
 has been training her, and Boruto asks her to relay the message he wants to train with him again. Boruto invites Kawaki to train with them, but he refuses, saying there's something he has to do by himself at home. Boruto tells him that while he doesn't know how Kawaki feels, he's not alone any more. Kawaki reveals it was Jigen who gave him his Kāma, and he knows all about it. Boruto supports Kawaki, saying they'll defeat Jigen together. Sarada continues practising the
Chidori
 on the waterfall.
Sai
 and
Shikamaru
 discuss whether Kawaki can be trusted, and the intel that
Konohamaru
 recovered from the airship crash. In them, there was a coordinate that can only be accessed through
space–time ninjutsu
, which they can't ignore even if it might be a trap. Sai reveals he already sent Sasuke to investigate. Sasuke
arrives
 at the destination, and notices carved walls.
Boro
 preaches about salvation and
Ōtsutsuki
 rule to his cult.
