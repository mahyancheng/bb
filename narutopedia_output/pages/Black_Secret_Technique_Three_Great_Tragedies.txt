Kankurō uses this technique with
Karasu
,
Kuroari
 and
Sanshōuo
. First, Sanshōuo slams the opponent in the air, then Karasu slashes them several times. After this, the near-unconscious foe is carried by Kuroari in front of Sanshōuo, who opens its mouth to reveal a cannon of sorts, which blasts the opponent in the air.
