A Wind Release technique.



Wind Release
 (
風遁
,
Fūton
,
English TV:
 Wind Style) is one of the five basic
nature transformations
, and is commonly affiliated with the Bird (
酉
,
Tori
) hand seal.

Overview

Wind Release is the rarest of the five nature transformations,
 but those who can use it are able to cut through anything.

Asuma Sarutobi
 uses it by
channelling
 wind
chakra
 into his
Chakra Blades
, making the blades far sharper and giving them
greater reach
. Wind Release can also be exhaled from the user's mouth, such as to
blow away
 everything in the area, or generated with the user's hands, allowing
precision strikes
. Although Wind Release has naturally good range and power, it can be further enhanced by
compressing
 it or
layering
 different wind streams together.

Wind Release can easily launch particles into the air, whether to create
dust clouds
 that conceal the user's movements or
sand storms
 that perforate targets.
Naruto Uzumaki
 adds Wind Release to the
Rasengan
 so that he can throw it, as seen with its
Rasenshuriken
 variant.
Temari
, rather than create winds on her own, instead
generates wind
 by waving her
Giant Folding Fan
 at targets; Temari's
summon
,
Kamatari
, rides these wind currents towards her opponents so that it can
slice them apart
. Despite its rarity, the wind nature is apparently common in Sunagakure ninja, to which the practice of using fans to create wind is a seemingly reoccurring trait amongst their forces.

Wind Release is naturally strong against
Lightning Release
 and weak against
Fire Release
.
 Wind's weakness to fire makes it an effective way to, when used collaboratively, make flames more powerful.
 If Wind Release is used with
Water Release
, as with the
Typhoon Water Vortex Technique
, the wind churns the water, increasing its damage and coverage area. When Wind Release is combined with other natures, certain
kekkei genkai
 are produced: wind and water make
Ice Release
; wind and fire make
Scorch Release
; wind and
earth
 are suggested to make
Magnet Release
. The combination of wind, earth, and fire produces the
kekkei tōta
,
Dust Release
.

Trivia

In
Konoha Hiden
 and
Retsu no Sho
, Temari is referred to as the best Wind Release user in Sunagakure, and possibly the world.
