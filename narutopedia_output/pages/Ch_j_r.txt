Chōjūrō
 (
長十郎
) is one of the last generation of
Kirigakure
's
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
.
 He serves as the retainer of the
Fifth Mizukage
, before later becoming the
Sixth
Mizukage
 (
六代目水影
,
Rokudaime Mizukage
,
literally meaning:
 Sixth Water Shadow) himself.

Background

In the anime, shortly after the
Fourth Mizukage
's passing and Mei Terumī was made the Fifth, Chōjūrō was present when the village received an invitation from
Konohagakure
 and
Sunagakure
 to join an impromptu
Chūnin Exams
 they would be hosting together.
Ao
 noted that the village was still recovering from the Fourth's passing, so it was decided the Kiri-nin would not take part in this event.

Personality






Chōjūrō's new-found determination.



Despite his membership in the elite
Seven Swordsmen
 group, Chōjūrō is a shy individual and seems to lack confidence in his abilities. He also greatly respects and admires the
Fifth Mizukage
, as he commented inwardly on wanting to protect her "
beautiful smile
". By the time of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Mei has noted that he has become a lot more confident in himself as seen when he cut down
Black Zetsu
 without reservation and then declares to the Fifth that as a member of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, he would guard the area with his life.

Years later after becoming the Sixth Mizukage, Chōjūrō has grown well into his new role, becoming much calmer and confident in his abilities. As a leader, he is patient and methodical, carefully observing the situation and considering the best way to approach it. At the same time, in the anime, is shown to still be with some doubts. Wanting so strongly to bring about a peaceful and happy era for his village, he struggles on how to deal with citizens who openly prefer the old traditions.
 Despite his continued doubts, he remains selfless, willing to take on any personal harm to seek success.
 Even when grieving over the loss of a dear ally, he remains composed enough to value the lives of his other allies and hoping to settle things peacefully,
 while also remaining pragmatic to prepare for a likely conflict.

Appearance






Chōjūrō in Part II.



Chōjūrō has short, tufty blue hair, and dark eyes. He also has pointed, shark-like teeth; a common trait of the members of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist as well as apprentices share. He wears square, black-rimmed glasses connected to ear protectors, a blue pin-striped shirt and camouflage pattern pants.

He wears his forehead protector on the front of his holster which he uses to carry
Hiramekarei
. The sword itself is wrapped in bandages leaving only the double hilt visible. He also has shuriken holsters strapped onto each of his legs. During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, he still wears the same outfit but changed his forehead protector to that of the Alliance's.

Years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, Chōjūrō grew noticeably taller and developed a firmer jawline with some chin stubble. He started wearing glasses with thicker frames and the ear-protectors he wore changed design. He retained his overall attire, but the straps of his sword-holster now only covers his left shoulder. Chōjūrō now also wears his light-grey pants without the dual shuriken holsters.

Abilities

Despite his meek demeanour, Chōjūrō is a highly capable ninja, earning acceptance into the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, and being chosen as one of the Fifth Mizukage's bodyguards during the Kage Summit. Due to being part of the Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist, Chōjūrō's skills were already considered some of the strongest in the entire village, showing he had great potential. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, he proved able to defeat
Black Zetsu
 while fighting alongside his allies. Years later, Chōjūrō's abilities improved immensely as he was promoted to the rank of Sixth Mizukage.
 Even against multiple wielders of the Seven Mist Swords, Chōjūrō is able to systematically defeat his foes.
 While working alongside the
Fifth Kazekage
 or
Fourth Tsuchikage
, he was able to hold his own against members of the
Ōtsutsuki Clan
.

Kenjutsu & Physical Prowess






Chōjūrō wielding Hiramekarei.



Chōjūrō is referred as a master swordsman, even amongst the other Seven Mist Swordsmen.
 Amongst the Five
Kage
, he is rumoured to be the best swordsman and assassin.
 As a true wielder of
Hiramekarei
, he is a very versatile fighter, as the sword can take on many shapes. Among such, it can releases the chakra stored in it and shape weapons, such as an enormous hammer, capable of sending Sasuke flying through a wall despite being shielded by
Susanoo
, as well as a massive longsword, capable of taking out several targets simultaneously.
 With its dual handles, the sword can be split into two blade, making Chōjūrō an ambidextrous fighter. As Mizukage, he could fire a detached long-ranged chakra blade with a swing of Hiramekarei, create a copy of it with chakra for dual wielding, as well as create several
knives
 strong enough to immobilise opponents.

As Mizukage, his skills in kenjutsu allowed him to hold his own against
Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki
, and is regarded as having no equal while wielding Hiramekarei.
 In the anime, even without Hiramekarei, Chōjūrō remained a fierce battler, armed only with a standard katana. Against the self-proclaimed
New Seven Ninja Swordsmen
, wielding three of the signature weapons, Chōjūrō proved very resilient, easily taking multiple puncture wounds and breaking free from his wire-bindings. Once on the offence, he seamlessly overpowered the foes with mightier weapons using only a broken sword. He also showed considerable strength, able to easily hold up
Kubikiribōchō
 with a single hand.

Ninjutsu

Nature Transformation






Chōjūrō utilising Water Release.



In the anime, Chōjūrō is highly skilled in
Water Release
, able to perform them with few-to-no hand signs and little need of already-existing water. If he's without an actual sword, he can create a
blade of water
 to work as a replacement, as well as produce a
massive water surge
 from underground to catch an opponent off guard and subdue them.
 He can also produce a barrage of water bullets to assault his enemies.

Part II

Five Kage Summit

Main article:
Five Kage Summit






The Kage's bodyguards on the offensive.



Chōjūrō and Ao were chosen to escort the Fifth Mizukage to the
Kage Summit
. During their trip to the
Land of Iron
, Chōjūrō was frequently embarrassed by the Mizukage's concern over him, which earned him scolding from Ao. Once they finally arrived and the meeting began, Ao and Chōjūrō rushed to her defence during the
Fourth Raikage
's outburst
 and later
White Zetsu
's appearance at the Summit.






Chōjūrō attacks Sasuke.



When
Sasuke Uchiha
 infiltrated the conference hall, Chōjūrō
activated
 Hiramekarei and formed it into a hammer which he used to knock Sasuke into a sealed off, adjacent hall where the Mizukage could fight him alone. Although Sasuke was able to escape, his actions convinced the Kage to begin working together. When
Tobi
 appeared and told the attendees of his
Eye of the Moon Plan
, Chōjūrō silently listened on and later after the masked man had left, as a sign of good faith, Chōjūrō told those in attendance about
Kisame Hoshigaki
 and his
Samehada
 but was cut off by Ōnoki who stated that they were already aware of this information.

After leaving the Summit with Mei, they followed Ao, who was tracking
Danzō
 and his delegation. When they finally caught up with Ao, the Mizukage was able to stop Ao from seemingly beheading himself. She realised that he was under
enemy
 control, and requested to use
Hiramekarei
 to force him out. Fū insulted her upon learning that she knew he wasn't really Ao, and she quickly punched Ao before realising that the opponent had already released the technique. Later, when they return to Kirigakure they are informed that the daimyō had approved the formation of the Shinobi Alliance.

In the anime, Chōjūrō was sent by the Mizukage in a diplomatic mission to better Kirigakure's relationship with
Iwagakure
, along with
Kurotsuchi
 and
Akatsuchi
 who were also sent by the
Third Tsuchikage
 on the same mission to stop
Ganryū
 in the process.

Chōjūrō attended the last meeting that was held by the Alliance in order to fully prepare for the upcoming war. The Mizukage told him to contact Ao in the
Sensor Division
 and tell him that they needed to hurry. Chōjūrō later joined Mei in
guarding
 the various
daimyō
 during war. When
Black Zetsu
 located the daimyō, he,
Genma Shiranui
, and
Raidō Namiashi
, as well as the other members, confronted the Akatsuki member.






Chōjūrō cuts down Black Zetsu.



As the battle between the two sides waged on throughout the night, one of
Naruto Uzumaki
's
shadow clones
 arrived to help in the battle. During the fight one Black Zetsu's branches caught Naruto's foot, causing his
Rasenshuriken
 attack to miss. Chōjūrō used that opportunity to attack from behind with his Hiramekarei. Forming it into a longsword, he cuts through Black Zetsu, and stated that the more confident he was, the stronger his strike. He then pinned Black Zetsu to the ground with the tip of his sword and told Mei — who was being called away — to deal with the
reincarnated

Madara Uchiha
 and that as one of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
 he would defend that point with his life.

Chōjūrō captures Araumi.



Chōjūrō eventually succeeds Mei and became the Sixth Mizukage. Upon recently becoming a Kage, he and
Misuno
 attend a Five Kage Summit in
Konohagakure
. During the meeting Sasuke came forth to reveal evidence of a new White Zetsu Army being formed and a potential threat even greater than Kaguya. Ultimately, it was agreed to keep this information a secret from the public and allow Sasuke to continue his research and further investigate his sources. In the anime, five years prior to
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
's defeat, Chōjūrō led a mission to capture
Araumi Funato
, leading to the pirate's clan falling into disarray and allowing trades on the sea to resume safely. During another summit held in Konoha, Chōjūrō comments on how the Hokage is late for a summit held in his own village.

School Trip Arc

Main article:
School Trip Arc






Chōjūrō welcomes Konoha's Academy students to Kirigakure.



In the anime, to improve relationships with other villages and symbolically show the warring era was over, Naruto set up an official class trip for the Academy to go to Kirigakure. He worked out the details with Chōjūrō, who assigned
Kagura Karatachi
 as a tour guide for the class. The next day, as Kagura continued to grow closer to the Konoha-nin, an improve in outlook made Kagura request the Sixth Mizukage to take the test to claim Hiramekarei. Later, Chōjūrō and Mei learned that Kagura had joined
Shizuma Hoshigaki
's
team
 and helped them steal all the Seven Mist Swordsmen's blades. While the Sixth Mizukage was strongly considering killing them all for the treachery, Boruto insisted that Kagura was not truly a traitor, but being manipulated. Boruto also insisted to treat this as a children's fight so as to not make a public scene. Chōjūrō agreed to this on the condition that he join them in ending the revolt and if it was completed before curfew.






Chōjūrō facing Kyohō.



They found the rebellious group at the Kiri Memorial where Shizuma's team was about to destroy it, seeing it as an insult to Kirigakure's pride. As the fight began, Chōjūrō was subdued by the
Nuibari
. The group voiced their disdain at Chōjūrō, feeling that his efforts for peace were a disgrace to their heritage as ninja and that Chōjūrō was trying to erase the very memory of the fiercest ninja in Kirigakure's history. Chōjūrō did concede to some of their words, voicing his true regret at now being able to make everyone pleased with this modernisation. The group rejected his apology and attacked him with three of the Mist Blades. Chōjūrō anticipated their attack patterns and used it to break free. While his foes scoffed at Chōjūrō facing them with only a standard katana, Chōjūrō retorted that a weapon is only as powerful as its wielders. Proving his point, he continued to exploit the revolutionaries' key weakness and defeated them. After restraining all them, he went to deal with Shizuma.

He arrived to see the rebellious ninja being absorbed by Samehada. He explained to the Konoha-nin that Samehada's ravenous nature makes it so only the most experienced of wielders should attempt usage of it. In his imperfect shark-form, Shizuma went on a feral rampage. While Chōjūrō asked Kagura for Hiramekarei, Kagura wished to fix this mistake personally. Together with Boruto, the two were able to separate Shizuma from Samehada and end the rebellion. Afterwards, Shizuma and his team were sent to prison for rehabilitation. Expanding on Boruto's idea of lessening the severity of the situation, Chōjūrō decided to cover it up in fear of the news spreading leading to the regress of the village to its darker times. He later saw off the Konoha class as they returned home. Chōjūrō then began giving Kagura special training to help him overcome his insecurities at drawing a sword. Realising how full of shame Kagura was for his actions, he insisted to talk to Boruto and apologise with honesty, knowing that the boy would forgive Kagura.

Chōjūrō attacks Urashiki.



Chōjūrō attended the
Chūnin Exams
 and sat with the other Kage during the third round. During which, the village was attacked by members of the
Ōtsutsuki Clan
,
Momoshiki
,
Kinshiki
, and, in the anime,
Urashiki
. During which, Chōjūrō aided Gaara in attempted to subdue Urashiki, only for the foe to escape. After the attack ended, Naruto was captured by the foes. Chōjūrō, the other Kage, Sasuke and Boruto decided to rescue him.






Chōjūrō and Kurotsuchi restraining Kinshiki.



After being transported to the dimension where Naruto was, Sasuke battled Momoshiki while he and the other Kage fight Kinshiki off. During the battle, he
restrained
 Kinshiki from moving after Sasuke destroyed his weapon, allowing Kurotsuchi to
capture
 him. However, he later manages to break free and let himself get absorbed by Momoshiki. Momoshiki then later proceeded to capture Chōjūrō and the other Kage in his shadow jutsu before Boruto threw his
Vanishing Rasengan
 to free them. With Sasuke's help, Boruto managed to defeat Momoshiki with a
giant Rasengan
. After Momoshiki's defeat, Chōjūrō posed for a photograph with the other Kage, Sasuke and Boruto.

Great Sea Battle of Kirigakure Arc

Main article:
Great Sea Battle of Kirigakure Arc






Chōjūrō hands Hiramekarei to Kagura.



In the anime, sometime after
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
's defeat, Kirigakure hosted a ceremony that invited various scientists and dignitaries from around the world to witness the unveiling of their new power plants that both generated great amounts of electricity, but also controlled the raging nature of the ocean. Security was tight due to rumours of an attack. Chōjūrō spoke on the ceremony, and organised the audience to be flown to visit the
Shinonome
 1 power station. However, one of the airships carrying industrialists crashed and exploded. Chōjūrō put out the fires in coordination with other Kiri-nin. He ordered the area to be put in lock-down to prevent potential suspects from escaping before they could be investigated. He later learned the attack on the airship was a distraction by the
Funato Clan
, so they could break out their leader
Araumi Funato
 from prison. Unable to spare the man-power, he allowed Kagura to aid
Team 7
, recruiting
Buntan Kurosuki
,
Hebiichigo
, and
Kyohō Fuefuki
 from prison. He handed Kagura Hiramekarei, and allowed the released swordsmen access to the blades, though they were branded with cursed seals.

Later, with the Funato Clan's continued expansion, with many Land of Water citizens joining them, Chōjūrō was forced to leave the village and join the front-lines. Soon, Chōjūrō met the Funato main fleet, and demanded their surrender. He remained concerned even as Misuno reported that the Funato forces remained on the defensive. When he received Kagura's message about the Funato fleet being a diversion, he chose to feign ignorance not to alert them. By nightfall,
Tenma Funato
 attempted to infiltrate their ship with a small team to assassinate him, but Chōjūrō anticipated it, and prepared an ambush of his own. The Kirigakure forces overpowered Tenma's group until only Tenma remained. He offered to spare Tenma if he revealed the Funato's goals, but Tenma attacked, forcing Chōjūrō to cut him down. He had their fleet attack the Funato fleet, prompting their retreat.






Chōjūrō is protected by Misuno.



Later, Misuno notified him of Kagura's and Hebiichigo's death in action. Kagura's death in particular hit him hard, having wished for Kagura to be Mizukage one day, and firmly declared his desire to wipe out the Funato. He was notified that
Isari Funato
 had reached out, wishing to negotiate. Misuno questioned why he'd be willing to negotiate with the Funato, and Chōjūrō explained that while he has no personal problems eradicating them, prolonging the conflict would only result in more casualties. Isari and Jibiki were brought him, restrained, but Isari broke free of his, wishing to negotiate as an equal. Despite the tension, they agreed to talk, but were interrupted by Araumi's broadcast, announcing an all-out attack. Chōjūrō questioned Isari's presence, though Jibiki vouched for him. When Araumi declared that not even relatives would be spared if they stood against him, the
Marlin Harpoon
 came alive and skewered Isari, before attempting to do the same to Chōjūrō. The harpoon was cut down by Misuno. Upon learning that the Funato intended to attack the Shinonome 1 power station, and were taking the shortest, but dangerous Sea of Death route to get to it, he ordered that all ships that could intercept them set sail.

As the Kirigakure forces prepared to defend the Shinonome 1,
Team 7
 arrived by boat to return Kagura's
Hiramekarei
 to Chōjūrō. They voiced their desire to end the war with no more bloodshed. While sympathising with their desire for peace, Chōjūrō revealed that Araumi was so driven for war and conquest, he even killed Isari when he tried to broker peace. As Chōjūrō insisted that they must protect the Shinonome 1, Boruto noted that the Funato's goal of conquest seemed to originally be sparked from rejection of the Shinonome 1, a construct that many in the Land of Water were openly against. Boruto insisted that he could get through to
Ikada Funato
, who was their friend before joining the war. Reluctantly, Chōjūrō agreed to give Boruto some time to meet with the Funato. In the event of failure, Chōjūrō began galvanising his forces for war. As Team 7 approached the Funato ships, Chōjūrō and Misuno listened in through their ship's instruments. Misuno wasn't surprised by their hostility and asked Chōjūrō what they should do, him telling her Team 7 still had more time. He was shocked when the Funato mobile fortress appeared, its
Chakra Cannon
 charging a shot at the Shinonome 1. Chōjūrō was even more shocked when Boruto willingly offered his own life in order to stop the war. Though Chōjūrō became concerned for Boruto, he couldn't allow the Funato make their first move and told Misuno to prepare an attack on the Funato mobile fortress. He also commented Boruto's determination became merely naïve and that would not stop the war. However, after Team 7's genuine actions made Ikada save Boruto from drowning, and he and his men abandoned their hatred toward Kirigakure and withdrew, Chōjūrō was ashamed for dismissing Boruto's determination and twisting Kagura's wishes because of his own hatred, admitting he still had much to learn.






Chōjūrō and Misuno discuss the aftermath of the Funato war.



In the aftermath, Chōjūrō received a report of the damages, as well as a request by the
Water Daimyō
 to deliver harsh punishment to the Funato commanders Araumi and Ikada. He and Misuno discussed the situation and lives that were lost, and he concluded that the too quick modernisation was responsible for much of the Funato support. The development of the Shinonome project was suspended, so they could get support from the entire country. He delivered Ikada's sentence of constant surveillance, placing him under
Kajiki
's watch. Due to
Team 5
's and Team 7's involvement in the conflict, he notified Konoha of these developments.

Following the defeat of
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
, Naruto had a Kage Summit set up via video. The other Kage were caught up on the newest developments. Chōjūrō asked what the goals were of the last remaining Inner,
Code
. They speculated that Code, as a devout follower of Isshiki, would seek to kill all those responsible for killing Isshiki, and completing the growth of the Ten-Tails. As everyone was concerned to hear about a new Ten-Tails, they asked what Naruto would do with his son if Momoshiki took over Boruto completely through the Kāma. Naruto swore he would handle the matter as it was needed to be done.

Creation and Conception

Wanting to create a younger character,
Masashi Kishimoto
 gave Chōjūrō short hair and attire that was not that of the standard shinobi. Then wanting to give him an air of unreliability, he immediately gave him glasses. The jagged teeth, Kishimoto admits, was simply an indulgence on his part.
