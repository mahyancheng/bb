Potcha disguised as Rock Lee.



Potcha and Mondai went to infiltrate Konoha and gather its secrets by disguising themselves as
Rock Lee
 and
Might Guy
 respectively, while the real Guy and Lee are out on a mission. They are oblivious to the fact that their disguises are fooling nobody, except for
Naruto
,
Tsunade
,
Sakura
, and
Tenten
 force them along by giving them outrageous missions, preventing them from learning anything. They are defeated when the real Guy and Lee attack them with their
Double Dynamic Entry
 technique.

Trivia

Potcha calls himself
Potcha Lee
 (
ポッチャ・ リー
,
Potcha Rī
) while disguised as Rock Lee, which is a pun for "pocchari" (
ぽっちゃり
), meaning "chubby".
