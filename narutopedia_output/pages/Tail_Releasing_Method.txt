This
fūinjutsu
 employs the use of formulae to bind a
jinchūriki
 before extracting the
tailed beast
 from within them. When extracted, the beast initially takes the form of pure chakra, also causing the host to go into a near Version 1-like state. After being extracted, the beast takes a corporeal form. Obito Uchiha waited until
Kushina Uzumaki
's seal was weak enough to use this technique to extract
Kurama
.

Trivia

In
Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie
, Tobi — through
Menma
 — can be seen extracting Kurama from Naruto with his
Sharingan
 alone, without binding him with this fūinjutsu first.
