The Konoha Aviary.
Inside the Aviary.
1/2

The
Konoha Aviary
 is a building in
Konohagakure
 where messenger
birds
 such as
hawks
 deliver messages, and also rest after delivery. They work very closely with the
Konoha Cryptanalysis Team
, and these messages that these birds transport are also received and dispatched from here. The aviary is a circular building built into the top of a tall tree with a spiral staircase. It consists of multiple bird cages lining the walls where the birds stay. It also has a long brown table in the middle, a circular platform on the ground where the ninja can sit while waiting for a message to arrive, and in the front is a U-shaped platform where the birds perch when they arrive at the aviary.

The aviary was destroyed during
Pain's assault
 on Konoha. Following the invasion, the team temporarily set up underneath a canopy, where a member received the letter demanding a
Kage Summit
.
