Konan gathers a large quantity of paper sheets into a single
chakram
-like shape, which she then throws at the intended target. While in flight, the disc spins with tremendous speed, with its trajectory and inclination being freely manipulated by her. This presents opportunities to attack an enemy from all angles, even if the disc is initially avoided. The discs spins so fast that a collision between the two result in a considerable impact.

Trivia

In the manga, Konan was unable to complete the technique due to
Tobi
 suffocating her. However, in the anime, the fight was extended and the use of the technique was seen.
