Taiki
 (
タイキ
) was a citizen of the
Land of Water
.

Background

Having not been born on land, Taiki had lived most of his life in open waters. During his years of sailing, he would occasionally encounter pirates, but managed to get by, from either evading or bribing them.

Appearance

Taiki was a middle-aged man of tan complexion and grey hair. He wore a typical fisherman's attire.

Personality

Taiki was a carefree man with a passion for boating. He was apparently somewhat of a drunk from his constantly flushed face. Despite this, he was a responsible individual, willing to do what is needed, having sacrificed his precious ship to succeed on a mission, though he did expect compensation for such sacrifices.

Abilities

Taiki is an experienced boatmaster.

Great Sea Battle of Kirigakure Arc

Main article:
Great Sea Battle of Kirigakure Arc

After the attack at the Shinonome ceremony by the
Funato clan
,
Team 7
 hired Taiki to sail them and
Kagura Karatachi
's
team
 to Dotō Island, where
Team 5
 and
Scientific Ninja Tools
 researchers from
Konohagakure
 were located.

The next day, the group was stopped by a Funato boat. Taiki nearly bribed their passage into their territory until
Kawaki
 exposed their presence due his seasickness. Taiki told Kawaki to throw the Funato clansmen off the boat and used his boat's short boost to help in their escape. The boat later caught up with them, and rammed at Taiki's boat, damaging it. Taiki rammed his boat the Funato mobile fortress as a distraction at Kagura's request, who wished to assist Boruto, Buntan, and Kawaki, who had infiltrated it.

After the
Chakra Cannon
 on the fortress was destroyed, Taiki and the others drifted for a time on a lifeboat. They were rescued by their allies, who had stolen a Funato ship. Taiki was tasked with steering the ship to
Kirigakure
. During the night, he was killed by
Kobanza
 of the Funato, who had
hidden himself
 inside one of the Dotō Island refugees.

Legacy

As Taiki was killed by usage of
Kabutowari
, the blame for the murder was directed on
Kyohō Fuefuki
. After the true culprit was found, it allowed for Kyohō to open up more about his past and form a trusting relationship with the Konoha-nin of
Team 5
 and
Team 7
.
