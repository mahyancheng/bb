The
Yakiniku
 Q
 (
焼肉Q
,
Yakiniku Kyū
) is a yakiniku restaurant located in
Konohagakure
. Its
salted beef tongue
 with Welsh onion is a very popular dish in the village. The original Yakiniku Q was destroyed during
Pain
's
assault
.

Asuma Sarutobi
 first took
Shikamaru Nara
,
Ino Yamanaka
, and
Chōji Akimichi
 when they met and continued to be regular customers throughout the
Naruto
 series, only going there when they completed a mission and when they host celebrations, such as when Shikamaru was promoted to
chūnin
.

Because of Asuma's status as a regular, the owner of the shop was quite close to him as she broke down in tears upon hearing from Shikamaru he was killed in the line of duty.

Appearance

The restaurant is large with wide windows, multiple green-seated booths, though some tables allow customers to sit down on the floor with green cushions as their seats, and menus plastered on the walls. Each table has a
charcoal brazier
 built in the centre and is equipped with tongs for customers to cook for themselves after ordering.

Other Media

Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire

Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles
, Ino invited

,
Neji Hyūga
, and

 to join her with Shikamaru and Chōji in order to help Lee and Neji's teamwork.
