chakram
-like formation behind their back. The user is able to manipulate it to form various makeshift tools and weapons, similar to
Truth-Seeking Balls

When dispelling the technique or otherwise, the user is able to disintegrate the tools like shattered glass and reshape them.

Trivia

This ability draws inspiration from the Seven Tools of
Benkei
 (
弁慶の七つ道具
,
Benkei no Nanatsudōgu
).

In the manga, the weapons cease to glow after they're manifested, resembling actual physical weapons made of wood and metal.

Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki was claimed to be able to absorb ninjutsu with this technique, however this was never displayed.

In the anime, Urashiki Ōtsutsuki has displayed this with his chakra fishing rod.

While unnamed in the anime and manga, this technique was named in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
.
