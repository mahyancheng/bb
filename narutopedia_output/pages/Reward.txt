) is chapter 275 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Because she is using a
life-transferring

technique
, since
Sakura
 was not dead,
Chiyo
 does not die by reviving her.
Sasori
 is disappointed that he has not been able to kill anyone and laments that he is now dying because he could not completely convert himself into a
puppet
. As his life wanes, he does something "pointless": as a reward to Sakura for surviving, he tells her of a
spy
 within
Orochimaru
's ranks that he was scheduled to meet in ten days' time at the
Tenchi Bridge
. He dies in the embrace of his
Mother and Father
 puppets and Chiyo speculates about Sasori not being able to avoid her last attack. She collapses, still poisoned, but refuses Sakura's offers to take her back to
Sunagakure
, claiming to still have something to do. Meanwhile,
Naruto
 and
Kakashi
 are still following
Deidara
. After preparing his
Mangekyō Sharingan
, Kakashi tells Naruto to start.
