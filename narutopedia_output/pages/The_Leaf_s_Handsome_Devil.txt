The Leaf's Handsome Devil!
" (
木ノ葉の碧き野獣見参!
,
Konoha no Aoki Yajū Kenzan!
) is episode 123 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Naruto
 starts getting frustrated with his lack of progress,
Sasuke
's
cursed seal
 finally reaches its second level, allowing him to exit his coffin. Sasuke's appearance snaps Naruto out of his
Nine-Tails
 mood and he encourages Sasuke to return home with him, stating that everyone is waiting for him in
Konoha
. Sasuke does not comply or respond, instead cackling rather madly which leaves Naruto enraged. Sasuke leaves the enclosure with Naruto attempting to follow, although
Kimimaro
 prevents Naruto from going after Sasuke, intending to kill Naruto. Luckily, the arrival of the newly recovered
Rock Lee
 blocks Kimimaro's attack and saves Naruto. Lee tells Naruto to go after Sasuke, reminding him of his promise to
Sakura
. Lee and Kimimaro begin exchanging blows, though Kimimaro's unique control over his bones makes things difficult for Lee. On top of that, Kimimaro finds Lee's moves to be predictable. Soon after the fight begins, Lee asks for a timeout so that he can take his medicine. Kimimaro lets him, and Lee drinks the contents of his medicine bottle.

Back in Konoha,
Guy
 returns from his mission and rushes to the hospital to ask
Tsunade
 how Lee's operation went. Tsunade tells him it was a success and that Lee could begin training as early as tomorrow, only for
two

aides
 to rush in and claim that Lee is missing. Tsunade realises that Lee must have gone after the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 in order to help out. She also realises that Lee took a bottle of sake instead of his medicine, which causes Guy to freak out. Guy explains that even a sip of alcohol turns Lee extremely inebriated, and reveals that when he is not sober, Lee can be very dangerous and devastating, since he is a natural master at the art of the
Drunken Fist
. Back at the clearing, Lee drinks the sake and becomes inebriated. He assumes the Drunken Fist stance as he prepares to take on Kimimaro.
