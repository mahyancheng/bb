Summary

Seeing as their struggles are ending,
Sakura
 and
Shizune
 depart to assist
Naruto
 and
B
. Elsewhere,
Tobi
 pulls Son towards himself with
chains
 intent on
absorbing
 them both. B's still trying to make Son open its mouth and release Naruto. Naruto fails to make Son open its mouth, and decides using the
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 to make Son puke him out, which it does. B celebrates it. Son tells Naruto that the
chakra receiver
 in him slid from its chest to its neck because of the full tailed beast transformation.
 Naruto spots it, enters in his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
, and sets out to remove it, apologising to Son in advance if he needs to get rough. Naruto
pulls
 himself towards the receiver. Tobi tries binding Naruto with the chains. Kurama recalls Naruto's past achievements, and thinks that if Naruto truly wants to help the tailed beasts, that he should do like he always has and act. Naruto tries pulling out the chakra receiver, while a clone he left inside Son enters
Sage Mode
 tries
pushing it
 from the inside.
