Iwagakure
. Hayama stayed behind to allow the other members of the squad time to escape and report to the village. Along with Tekuno, he wiped out the majority of the ninja.

Personality

Hayama is a very quiet, calm and collected individual able to carefully assess situations and formulate strategies around that making him a good leader. He also has a great sense of duty to Konoha and to his subordinates that he'd rather protect than ever think of sacrificing.

Abilities

Hayama has  shown himself to be an undoubtedly skilled ninja. He is very adept at the use of
kenjutsu
 which he uses in tandem with
wind
-
nature transformation
 to create
sharp blades of winds
 which are capable of serving multiple purposes. It can be used directly to attack his opponents, causing severe damage, or else be used to buffets them. The technique can also be used to counter incoming projectiles. He is also  proficient with the
Body Flicker Technique
, in which he uses leaves to mask his movements.

In addition, his years of experience has made him a highly analytical combatant and a adept strategist. This was seen not only in battle but during his preparation for one mission where he chose to take
Kosuke Maruboshi
 on their mission because of his expertise.
