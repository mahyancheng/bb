"
A Shinobi Bout of Friendship
" (
友情のシノビバウト
,
Yūjō no Shinobi Bauto
) is episode 27 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

After Boruto and company read the
kidnapping note
, it fades.
Kagura
 tells them
Tsurushi Hachiya
, a genin from his class who dislikes the current state of
Kirigakure
, is most likely responsible. Kagura wants to inform
Chōjūrō
, but
Boruto
 doesn't want the field trip to be cancelled, so he and the others convince Kagura to handle the situation himself with their help. The two groups meet, and fighting ensues. Tsurushi erects a
barrier
 to ensure no one outside notice the fight and interfere. Boruto and his friends make short work of Tsurushi's group. Tsurushi dares Kagura to draw his
blade
, revealing he killed while in the
Academy
, and exposing him as the
Fourth Mizukage
's grandson.
 Tsuruchi trips Kagura with wire, distracting Boruto, who himself gets lifted by the neck by another of Tsurushi's friends. He frees himself with a failed attempt at
Mitsuki
's Wind Release technique. Kagura deals with Tsurushi, despite using a wooden sword against his metal one.
Iwabee
 finishes Tsurushi off, and the mist barrier clears. Hachiya's group retreats, and Boruto's frees
Denki
. Back at the hotel, Kagura confirms he is Yagura's grandson, and that since killing classmates when he was in the Academy, he has struggled with being in control when wielding a sword. Elsewhere,
Shino
,
Anko
, and
Mei
 discuss a treaty between the Lands of
Fire
,
Water
,
Waves
, and the
Sea
. When Mei drinks too much, uses chakra control to lower her alcohol levels. Getting back to business, Mei explains that Kirigakure wants the Land of Water to sign the treaty. However, the Land itself is opposed, counting on the instability to amass influence, and fearful that the continued expansion of the neighbouring nations will endanger them. If conflict ensues, the Land of Fire will also have to get involved. Back at the hotel, Boruto invites Kagura to play cards with them. Kagura gets into it, and realises they invited him to get his mind off the earlier talk about him and his grandfather, for which he is thankful. Kagura tells them about his struggle with himself, of having killed his friends at the Academy, and feeling guilt for Yagura's sins. The others try talking him out of it. Partially successful, Kagura lightens up as he wins a match.
Sarada
 comes in, telling Boruto he has to do a roll call. Boruto gives Kagura the card game they were playing as a gift. The next day, Kagura asks Chōjūrō to take a test to claim
Hiramekarei
. Tsurushi reports the meeting to
Shizuma
, who despite claiming it to be fine, seemingly kills the former.

Trivia

Despite being an
academy student
, Yagura was incorrectly depicted wearing his
forehead protector
 along with his
shinobi
 attire during his assault in the Academy. This was corrected in the following episode.
