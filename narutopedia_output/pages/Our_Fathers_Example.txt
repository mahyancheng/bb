Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

In the
Nara
 household,
Shikadai
 is surprised to see his father home. His parents remind him that today is a day of remembrance for those who died in the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. Many
Konoha
 citizens gather at the
cemetery
, where
Tsunade
 acts as speaker. She stresses how the peace they have today is due to those who lost their lives in the war, and that while the new generations don't know war, they should be told of what those who do learned from it.
Ao
 goes to
Katasuke
's lab to ask for maintenance of his prosthetic arm, but Katasuke isn't in today.
Mugino
 sees Ao and approaches him. Tsunade continues to address the crowd, who take turns offering flowers to the deceased.
Ino
 and
Shikamaru
 think back and talk about the last transmission they got from their fathers during the war, their last words. They wonder if some day they'll have to set the example and entrust the next generation to carry on. Later, Mugino takes Ao to the cemetery, and learns about his relationship to Katasuke. At Mugino's suggestion, Ao honours the deceased, and recalls his own survival.
 He spent years in a coma, and upon waking up, he learned of the deaths of so many friends, and went through arduous rehabilitation with Katasuke. He laments the fact he isn't as strong as he used to be before his injuries, and has retired from being a shinobi. He thanks Mugino for bringing him there to grieve. Shikamaru and Ino recognise and approach Ao, greeting him. Mugino is surprised to learn specifically who Ao is. Shikamaru asks Ao if his father truly believed his strategy to stop the
Ten-Tails
 would work. Ao confesses he had doubts, and asked
Shikaku
 and
Inoichi
 the same. They said they were proud of their children and had faith in them. Shikamaru and Ino are moved. Ao leaves. At
Temari
's behest, Shikadai goes looking for his father. Shikamaru decides to take Shikadai to eat out, like they used to after training. He wonders if Shikadai is learning from looking at him as well. At night, Ao catches a leaf blowing in the wind with his prosthetic hand.
