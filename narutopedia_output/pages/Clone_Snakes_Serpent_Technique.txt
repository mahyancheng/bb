Kabuto slams his hand on the surface of water containing his
specially-developed snakes
 and emits dark-red lightning, which causes the snakes to take on the form of a giant blue snake with a red mouth and no eyes. The snake then rams and pushes the enemy underwater in an attempt to drown them. Kabuto used this technique within
The Hole
, which is known to speed up the recreation process of his snakes.
