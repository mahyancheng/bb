Rasa
's watch, Gaara is attacked with kunai, to no effect.
 At night, Gaara asks his uncle why they feel hungry.
Yashamaru
 tells him that maybe it's so they can have good food. While playing in the sandbox, Gaara asks him why the sky is blue, and Yashamaru tells him it's so they can look up at it. Gaara agrees that looking at the sky eases his pain. Gaara asks why he doesn't get sleepy, and why he doesn't have a mother. Yashamaru evades answering. Kankurō and Temari want to play with Gaara, but their father keeps them from doing so. Yashamaru arrives with lunch, and Gaara notices how he resembles his mother.
