The final resting place of Nagato and Yahiko.



Within
Amegakure
 is a shrine that serves as the final resting place of
Nagato
 and
Yahiko
. It was created by
Konan
 after she brought their bodies back from
Konohagakure
.

It consists of a large square display filled with paper flowers upon which the bodies rest. On the wall behind the bodies there is a mural of angels and a pair of large pillars stand in front of the shrine with paper flower bouquets on each of them. There is also a circular, ripple-like pattern on the floor that resembles the
Rinnegan
 between these two pillars.

When Konan exhausted herself during her fight with
Obito
 the paper flowers began falling apart. After Obito found the shrine, he proceeded to absorb Nagato's body to his
personal dimension
 and then teleported away, leaving Yahiko's body behind.
