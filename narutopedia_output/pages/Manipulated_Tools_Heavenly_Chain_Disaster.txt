The
Manipulated Tools: Heavenly Chain Disaster
 is a stronger version of Tenten's
Twin Rising Dragons
 technique.

Usage

Tenten tosses her large
scroll
 into the air above her opponent, then
unseals
 a myriad of different weapons to rain down with enough force to impale anyone in the immediate vicinity and crater the ground. The weapons move so fast that they appear as white streaks, and due to the fact that the attack covers a large area, it makes this technique quite difficult to evade.
