This article is about the technique used by Rock Lee in episode 123. For the technique used by Rock Lee in episode 22, see
Leaf Gale
.

The user delivers a series of high and low kicks, each of which is fast enough that even the
Sharingan
 can't react to them. When
Rock Lee
 performs it against
Sasuke Uchiha
, he starts with a backwards high kick using his left foot, the motion of which then helps him deliver a low kick with his right. Although the first kick is damaging on its own, it's primarily intended as a distraction, forcing Sasuke to block it and thus rendering him vulnerable to the second kick.

When Lee uses Leaf Whirlwind against
Kimimaro
, he performs it more akin to
Dynamic Entry
.

Trivia

Some
Naruto
 media have confused what "Leaf Whirlwind" is. Video games from the
Naruto: Clash of Ninja
 series
, for instance, use its name for moves that more closely resemble
Leaf Strong Whirlwind
. The English anime has at times also used the same translation ("Leaf Hurricane") for both Leaf Whirlwind and
Leaf Gale
.
