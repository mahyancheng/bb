Summoning: Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 is a technique used through the power of the
Rinnegan
.

Usage

One who possesses the Rinnegan is able to
summon
 and control the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
;
 artificial Rinnegan created by the
Impure World Reincarnation
 will not suffice.
 Non-wielders, as long as they possess powers of both
Uchiha
 and
Senju
, can still control it.
 Rather than requiring a blood offering as other summons do, the statue instead drains the user's life force.
 In one instance, when
Nagato
 summoned the statue,
black receivers
 extended from its abdomen and pierced his back, rendering his body emaciated. The statue's mouth then emitted
chakra
 in the form of a dragon capable of extracting the chakra of anything it touched, killing humans immediately. After serving its purpose, the statue disappeared while the receivers broke off and remained embedded in Nagato's back.

Influences

As with many of Nagato's techniques, it is influenced by Buddhist terminology.
Gedō
 (
外道
,
literally meaning:
 Outer Path), derived from the Sanskrit
Tīrthika
, refers to any doctrine which "treads the outer path" to enlightenment. This is opposed to the teachings of orthodox Buddhism, the
Naidō
 (
内道
,
literally meaning:
 Inner Path), and is thus considered misguided and heretical.

Trivia

Both
Obito
 and
Madara
 were able to summon the statue without any adverse effects, instead utilising an offering of blood. When they use this technique, they refer to it simply as "
Summoning Technique
".

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
, Obito summons the Demonic Statue which then launches bolts of chakra at the opponent.

In the anime, when unconsciously summoned by Nagato, the statue didn't drain his life force.
