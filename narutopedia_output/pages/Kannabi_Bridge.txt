The
Kannabi Bridge
 (
神無毘橋
,
Kannabi-kyō
,
literally meaning:
 Bridge where the gods do not help) was a large bridge, spanning a river somewhere in
Kusagakure
. During the
Third Shinobi World War
, this bridge was a vital pathway to
Iwagakure
's line of supply.
Team Minato
, led by newly-promoted jōnin
Kakashi Hatake
, were given the mission of destroying it. They eventually succeeded with the aid of the team's official leader,
Minato Namikaze
. However, a member of the team.
Obito Uchiha
, was incapacitated and was thought to have been dead prior to the destruction of the bridge. Despite his apparent death, the bridge was nonetheless destroyed, turning the tide of the war in
Konoha
's favour despite their massive shortage in manpower, resulting in the end of the war shortly thereafter.

The Battle of Kannabi Bridge took place about 13 years before Part I.
