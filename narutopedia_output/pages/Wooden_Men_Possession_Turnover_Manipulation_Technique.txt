This technique forces two opponents to fight each other through wooden training dummies, with the intent of tricking them into fighting each other until all but one of them is defeated. The only way to break the technique is to have fast and strong taijutsu, by utilising speed so extreme that the wooden training dummies are unable to keep up and thus break apart, effectively breaking the technique. If the victims are familiar enough with one another they will be able to tell who their opponent is. They can also communicate through non-verbal means such as Morse code.
