Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

The
Konoha 11
 wonder what to gift
Naruto
 and
Hinata
.
Lee
 tries Naruto's favourite ramen to get into his shoes and figure out something he'd like. He asks
Iruka
 about Naruto, but Iruka barely sees Naruto nowadays. Lee leaves to find a gift.
Konohamaru
 once again asks Iruka to record a message for Naruto, and Iruka postpones it again. Lee considers giving them dumbbells, but decides against it.
Tenten
 thinks about giving them cute kunai, but realises giving them a weapon might reflect poorly on her.
 Lee arrives asking for help and the two spend the day trying to figure out a gift, Lee always coming up with a weapon and a ludicrous rationale for it being a useful gift. Lee dreams of
Neji
's ghost visiting him to offer advice, but only gets more confused. Iruka records a message for Naruto at last. Lee tells Iruka about his struggle to come up with a gift. Iruka says something that suddenly inspires Lee. Lee, Tenten, and
Guy
 try coming up with ideas together, but Lee and Guy keep going off-topic. Lee and Guy decide to role-play being Naruto and Hinata, with Tenten being their baby to figure out what they should gift them. When they talk about Neji, Lee remembers his dream and has an epiphany, and decides to give them dumbbells anyway, him giving the left one and Guy the right one. Tenten settles for a custom-made kunai. Lee thanks Iruka for his input. Iruka asks Konohamaru to record a new message later, as he wants to learn more about who Naruto is now, and starts by ordering Naruto's favourite ramen at
Ichiraku
.

Trivia

The animation style of this episode is quite similar to Lee's spin-off,
Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles
.

Lee didn't wear his flak jacket during the whole episode, but at the beginning, when he is approaching Tenten, he is seen wearing his flak jacket momentarily.
