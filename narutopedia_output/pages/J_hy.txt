The
jōhyō
 consists of a long rope, typically several metres long, with a handle attached to one end, and a metal dart attached to other, acting as a weight which allows the user to throw the dart out at a long range target to bind them, then either reel them in or perform an attack on them.

This weapon makes an appearance in the
Sunagakure Support Mission
.
Gaara
, as an instructor, introduced the jōhyō, a relatively non-lethal weapon, to his pupil, Matsuri, for practical weapons training over the more bulky weapons to choose from.  As Gaara stated when he demonstrated the Jōhyō's practical use to Matsuri, "
The teeth on the end of the string are not so much for attacking, as they are to prevent the opponent from getting too close.  And then with the rope…  Render them unable to attack
".
