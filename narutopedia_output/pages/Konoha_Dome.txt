The
Konoha Dome
 (
木ノ葉ドーム
,
Konoha Dōmu
,
literally meaning:
 Tree Leaf Dome) is an entertainment arena in
Konohagakure
; its construction was completed a month before the events of
Sasuke Shinden: The Teacher's Star Pupil
. The arena has two levels, a retractable roof that allows it to be used during any weather condition, and is large enough to seat 50,000 people in its audience. The arena's
concourse
 is noted to be hotel-like in quality.
Lily Himeno
, an
idol
, describes the Konoha Dome as an ideal venue to perform in, and in fact she is one of the first performers to take the stage at the Konoha Dome. Said performance is ended prematurely through a combination of the
Purple Moon Religion
,
Team Konohamaru
, and
Sasuke Uchiha
.

Trivia

The Konoha Dome is likely named after the
Tokyo Dome
, and appears to be modelled after it as well, with the Konoha Dome's numerous amenities also borrowing from the adjacent entertainment complex known as
Tokyo Dome City
.
