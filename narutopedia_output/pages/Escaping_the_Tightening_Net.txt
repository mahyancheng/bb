 anime.

Synopsis

Boruto
 warns
Konohamaru
 the castle is completely surrounded. The two escape the castle, and manage to lose the mob, reuniting with
Sarada
 and
Mugino
. The perfume bomb Boruto was hit with makes him easy to track. Boruto goes with Mugino to try get the perfume off of him, while Konohamaru and Sarada track the brothers who stole the
Hashirama
 Cell. The brothers discuss their plans. Mugino tries getting rid of the perfume by getting Boruto to fall into a drainage ditch. They instead use it to move around unnoticed. Konohamaru and Sarada decide to check on the shop owner they previously interviewed, so Konohamaru disguises himself as
Kirisaki
. Boruto manages to get the perfume off of him, but he and Mugino are still being tracked with dogs. As Kirisaki, Konohamaru promises good money for information on the shinobi brothers. Unable to completely throw off their pursuers, Boruto and Mugino decide to leave the village instead of joining up with Sarada and Konohamaru. Boruto climbs to the roofs, having found the shortest route out of the village. The shopkeeper knows the real Kirisaki has been found, so his subordinates prepare to attack. Sarada breaks through the ceiling, allowing Konohamaru to escape. They're surrounded, but are rescued by Boruto and Mugino, who have stolen an unmanned airship.
 This way, Boruto's smell is irrelevant, and they can more easily search for the thieves. However, their pursuers shoot the airship down. They're surrounded, but
Katara
, the black market child who Boruto protected from Kirisaki, shows them an escape route under the village. They meet up with
Mitsuki
 underground, who came back with
Kona
, Katara's sister. Mitsuki comments on Boruto's smell. Boruto shares what he learned about the earring, lookalike shinobi who stole the Hashirama Cell. Mitsuki reveals
Yubina
 determined the Hashirama Cell to be unstable, so it can't be rushed out, which is why they were framed for killing
Sakuya
. Katara gives them intel on the earring shinobi he acquires through his underground friends. They intend to gain on them through the underground routes.
Deepa
 kills everyone at the establishments he eats. The Konoha shinobi split up to find the earring shinobi. The genin are attacked with
Lightning Release
.
