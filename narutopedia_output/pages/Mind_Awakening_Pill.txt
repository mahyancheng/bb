The
Mind Awakening Pill
 (
醒心丸
,
Seishingan
) is a drug created by
Orochimaru
 to speed up the development of the
Cursed Seal
 to increase the level of the user's Cursed Seal to Level 2.
 However, this will greatly increase the Cursed Seal's contamination speed, killing the user in a few minutes. To allow the user's body to get used to the Cursed Seal Level 2, they have to be sealed within the
Four Black Fogs Formation
. This will reduce the permanent death to a false death state.
