Kunugi Mokume
 (

,

) is a
jōnin
 of
Konohagakure
.

Background

During the
Second Shinobi World War
, he was assigned to a team with
Tsunade
,
Dan Katō
 and another unnamed
shinobi
. After Dan was gravely injured, Kunugi watched on as Tsunade tried to save his life but realising that, with so many of his vital organs directly injured, and even with Tsunade's aid, there was little to no hope of doing so. He later tells Tsunade to stop with the medical treatment as Dan had already passed away and restrained her when she broke down after failing to save Dan's life.

Personality

Kunugi tries to keep others from doing pointless things.

Appearance

Kunugi has shoulder-length hair which is concealed under his
forehead protector
 which he wears in a bandanna style, except for two bangs that frame either side of his face. He wears the standard attire of a Konoha shinibi inclusive of the pocketless
flak jacket
 and shinobi sandals.

Trivia

sawtooth oak
