This training method is done by placing a leaf over an individual's forehead and having them direct all their
chakra
 onto the leaf, using it as a focal point.

This exercise can be used by
Academy
 teachers as a way to teach students how to control their chakra more effectively. However, the true purpose of the exercise is actually to hone the individual's concentration and to keep their mind from becoming distracted. As explained by
Iruka Umino
, only those who have worked hard on their ability to concentrate can become excellent
shinobi
. For generations
Konoha
 ninja have practised using this method in order to better their mental focus. The leaf emblem on the Konoha
forehead protector
 is said to originate from this training.

Trivia

While trying to master the
Rasengan
, Naruto thinks back to this lesson, and uses Iruka's advice to complete the second stage of the
ninjutsu
.
