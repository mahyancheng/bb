Rinji's bat.



Bats
 (
蝙蝠
,
Kōmori
) were used by
Rinji
. Rinji had the ability to use ultrasonic waves to use the
Bat Controlling
 technique so that he could communicate with bats, and they could likewise communicate with him. He was able to give them orders, such as to search the area around him.

Once Rinji took control of his bats, he could command them to produce high frequency
ultrasonic waves
 that affect the mind of the opponent. These bats proved to be an effective counter to the
Crystal Release
; the ultrasound waves moved at a frequency that broke down the crystal at a molecular level, allowing the dispersion of crystal particles back into the air.

In the
Six-Tails Unleashed
 arc,
Tonbee

summoned
 a bat that quickly transformed into a
scroll
.
