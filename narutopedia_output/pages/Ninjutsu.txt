The
Rasengan
 is an example of ninjutsu.



Ninjutsu
 (
忍術
,
English TV:
 Ninja Art,
literally meaning:
 Ninja Techniques) is one of the three main
jutsu
 categories. Ninjutsu is the most nebulous of the three, and may most simply be described as anything that is not
genjutsu
 or
taijutsu
. Most ninjutsu require
chakra
 and
hand seals
, but this is not always the case since the mere usage of
weaponry
 qualifies as ninjutsu.
 The huge range of ninjutsu's uses is illustrated by its several sub-classifications:
medical ninjutsu
,
reincarnation ninjutsu
,
space–time ninjutsu
,
barrier ninjutsu
,
sealing jutsu
,
cursed seal jutsu
 and
sensory ninjutsu
.

Most ninjutsu use
shape transformation
, which deals with controlling the form and movement of the ninjutsu, while
nature transformation
 deals with changing the ninjutsu's physical properties. Ninjutsu that use nature transformation tend to follow a naming convention of their nature type followed by a more specific name. With practice and experience, certain ninjutsu can become second nature to a ninja, allowing them to perform it at will.

Background

Ninjutsu is a corruption of the
Sage of Six Paths
'
ninshū
 created by his son,
Indra
, for use in combat;
 rather than using chakra to achieve understanding and create peace as the Sage intended, the development of ninjutsu resulted in mankind weaponising their chakra for war. Over time, shinobi came to believe that Hagoromo was the founder of ninjutsu rather than his eldest son, and the knowledge of ninshū was lost until its history was resurfaced during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

Years later, the scientist
Amado Sanzu
 would determine that ninjutsu are, in essence, a rudimentary and inferior approximation of the
Ōtsutsuki Clan
's
shinjutsu
.

Trivia

The simultaneous use of ninjutsu and taijutsu is called "
nintaijutsu
".

Jin no Sho
 describes
Sage Art: Super Tailed Beast Rasenshuriken
 as "the most marvellous ninjutsu of all time".

Amado considers ninjutsu as attempts to reproduce the effects of the
Ōtsutsuki Clan
's
shinjutsu
.

Kinshiki says the
chakra pills
 are desired because they allow the user to perform supernatural or divine acts.
