The
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 is an extremely powerful
genjutsu
 that traps the entire world in an illusion, enslaving the human and animal populations in a dream so that their
chakra
 may be
drawn
 upon by the
God Tree
.

Overview






Infinite Tsukuyomi cast through the God Tree's blossoming flower.



To cast a genjutsu of this scale, the user's
Rinne Sharingan
 must be reflected off of the
moon
.
 The exact method of achieving this varies from user to user: in the anime
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 uses
Yomotsu Hirasaka
 to create a portal to a
dimension
 containing a moon;

Obito Uchiha
 produces the
Ten-Tails
 and transforms it into a construct of the
God Tree
, which has a Rinne Sharingan within the blooming flower at its top;

Madara Uchiha
, per his
Eye of the Moon Plan
, flies into the sky and reflects his own Rinne Sharingan off of the moon.

Once cast, the penetrating light of the Infinite Tsukuyomi shines across the world, bright enough to dispel the night for as long as it is active. All those who fall under its gaze are trapped in the genjutsu, with the
Rinnegan
's design appearing in their eyes to represent its influence. Victims of the Infinite Tsukuyomi are rendered immobile so long as they are under its effects, allowing them to easily be wrapped by the bark of the God Tree's roots using
God: Nativity of a World of Trees
.
 Over the course of years,
 humans connected to the tree in this manner are gradually drained of their life energy, personalities and defining features, reducing them to shells of their former selves and ultimately converting them into
White Zetsu
 while at the same time, producing a new Chakra Fruit in the process. The user can also draw upon the chakra of those bound to the tree, causing it to erupt from the ground and enter their own body.
 In the anime, the technique seemed to need perfecting as Kaguya discovered in her first usage: most of those trapped in Infinite Tsukuyomi such as
Haori
 died after being trapped in the genjutsu instead of being converted into White Zetsu.

Certain individuals are immune to the Infinite Tsukuyomi. The dead, such as those brought back with the
Impure World Reincarnation
, are impervious to the Infinite Tsukuyomi.
 White Zetsu,
Black Zetsu
, and those whose body Black Zetsu
coats
 are also unaffected.
 However, as seen with
Orochimaru
, a foreign soul that has taken over the body of a White Zetsu is still vulnerable to the genjutsu.
 A Rinnegan user can block the light of the Infinite Tsukuyomi, saving themselves and those within their range from its control.
 In fact, Rinnegan users, through the combination with the chakra of the nine
tailed beasts
, are the only ones capable of ending the Infinite Tsukuyomi and releasing those trapped within its dreams. Should these be possessed by two different people, they must form the rat
hand seal
 together in order to release the technique.

Trivia

"Mugen" (
夢幻
) can also be translated as "dreams", "fantasy", or "visions", which fits the nature of this technique.

Black Zetsu
 revised the
Stone Tablet
 to state that the Infinite Tsukuyomi is the salvation for the
Uchiha Clan
 and the key to world peace, something Madara believed in.

Sasuke referred to this technique as a genjutsu cast by the Rinnegan.
 In the anime, Black Zetsu also connects the technique to the Rinnegan.

In
Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie
, Obito casts a "Limited Tsukuyomi" (
限定月読
,
Gentei Tsukuyomi
,
literally meaning:
 Limited Moon Reader) on Naruto and Sakura, sending them to a
Genjutsu World
 housed within a
crystal ball
. As
Akatsuki
 only has seven
tailed beasts
 at the time, the Rinne Sharingan used has only seven
tomoe
.

Hagoromo believed that in the past, Kaguya had utilised her Byakugan in some fashion when casting the Infinite Tsukuyomi.

In the anime, decades later,
Boro
 would use tales of Infinite Tsukuyomi to persuade many people into joining his cult.
