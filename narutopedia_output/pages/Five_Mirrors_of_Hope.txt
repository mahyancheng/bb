The
Five Mirrors of Hope
 are medium-sized mirrors that have six black
tomoe
 on each side of them: one at the top, two on the bottom left and right sides, two on the upper left and right sides, and one in the centre. They have five different colours: red, blue, yellow, green, and black. They are said to be the only way to stop
Genshō Ryūdōin
 from reanimating the
Spirit Beast
