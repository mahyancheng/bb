Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Yūkimaru
 manages to hold off the
Three-Tails
 long enough for
Guren
 to stand up, who moves out of the way just as the Three-Tails regains its self-control.
Rinji
 stealthily stabs Guren with his
kunai
 and moves Yūkimaru and himself out of the way as the Three-Tails'
Water Release: Great Water Mass Bullet
 strikes the cliff. Seeing the wounded Guren, Yūkimaru is told that she will die unless he takes control of the Three-Tails. Yūkimaru complies, but is unable to continue after running out of chakra. Rinji flees as Yūkimaru decides to protect Guren with his life. As the Three-Tails launches another attack, Guren moves him out of the way and keeps him safely encased with her
Crystal Release: Crimson Fruit
 while she deals with the
tailed beast
.

Team Guren
 nurse themselves from their injuries, unaware that they are being watched by
Tobi
. Tobi then decides that he needes
Deidara
's assistance and runs off to retrieve him.
Lee
,
Shizune
,
Sakura
,
Tenten
 and
Ino
 are all safely on shore as
Kakashi
,
Yamato
,
Kiba
 and
Akamaru
 catch up with
Naruto
 and
Shino
. Naruto rushes off to save Yūkimaru while the others follow behind him. Naruto manages to reach Yūkimaru first, seeing him trapped in Guren's crystal, but finds himself face-to-face with the Three-Tailed Turtle. He attempts to strike it with his
Rasengan
 but fails, and Guren attempts the same with her
Crystal Release: Tearing Crystal Falling Dragon
. As a wounded Guren begins to drown, she
converts her life force into chakra
, allowing her to use powerful techniques such as
Crystal Release: String of Glory
 to withstand the brunt of the Three-Tails' Water Mass Bullet technique and fire a prism at the beast's eyes; Naruto follows up with a
Big Ball Rasengan
 at its eyes as well, having determined it to be its weak spot. Enraged, the beast whips up a tidal wave that engulfs the duo.

Kakashi and his team arrive as Yūkimaru's crystal shield breaks. As they take him away, they are unaware that they are being watched by a vexed
Kabuto
, who claims that they are foiling
Orochimaru
's plan.
