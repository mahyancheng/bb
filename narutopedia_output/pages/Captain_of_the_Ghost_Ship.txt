He was the captain of the "Ghost Ship".

Background

At some point in time, he, along with the rest of his crew were wiped out by the
Giant Corpse Crab
. Before that happened though, he put his youngest crew-mate
Hishaku
 in a barrel and entrusted him with the broom he had from his youth and told him that as his comrade he would protect him.

Personality

He was described as being kind and generous while also being strong. These traits were shown when he told one of his crew members, Hishaku, to flee from the crab as he was young and could survive.

Paradise Life on a Boat

The captain was later seen alongside the rest of the dead crew-mates welcoming Hishaku to the afterlife telling him that as his comrade they could not rest in peace unless his soul did as well.
