Koji links with his
artificial toad
 to access their point of view, seeing and hearing everything around the toad. This can be done via special software or through Koji directly, in which the latter case his pupils will become toad-like. It allows for more discreet surveillance and intel gathering. He can also use two toads to communicate with others if one is left with the person they are in contact with. The connection can even be maintained between separate dimensions.
