Karenbana
 (
カレンバナ
) was a
kunoichi
 from the
Land of the Moon
, and the teammate of
Ishidate
 and
Kongō
. She was hired by
Shabadaba
 to kill its rightful heir and king,
Michiru Tsuki
.

Background

Karenbana and her comrades were hired by Shabadaba to kill
Kakeru Tsuki
 and his family in order for Shabadaba to take the throne of the kingdom.

Personality

Karenbana, despite being an adult, looked like a child and became angry whenever someone mistook her for one. She was very confident in her teammates and her own abilities. She had also been seen to be somewhat brave as seen when she voluntarily tried to attack and injure Naruto while he was in
Nine-Tails state
 and had just beaten Kongō. She was also very cocky and talked down to people a lot, as well as being vain to the point of being a fault, as she wore so much perfume that it negated her camouflage.

Appearance

Karenbana appeared to be a child, but was actually twenty-two years old, and became very defensive when
Sakura Haruno
 insulted her due to her looking far younger than her actual age. She wore a long shaggy white haired wig and she has light pink-coloured eyes. It also appeared that she, like her teammates, wore a wig, underneath which is short, boyish brown hair. She wore a grey headband on her head. She wore a long open white vest that goes down just below her knees and a pinkish-coloured long sleeve shirt that turns into a skirt just above her vest. She also wore a short pair of black shorts and a black pair of gloves. She appeared to be wearing pink lipstick and blushes a lot.

Abilities






Karenbana using her genjutsu.



Karenbana utilises a
special poison
 that slows down her opponents' reaction time, allowing her to evade their attacks while conducting her own attacks with a
kunai
. She uses this poison as part of her
genjutsu
 that creates illusory flower petals to surround her opponents, and that Karenbana herself dissolves into the petals, allowing herself to attack her opponents virtually undetected.

Karenbana can also use
Hiding with Camouflage Technique
 to camouflage herself, though she wore so much perfume that it gave her location away.

Taijutsu

During her confrontations with Sakura, she has shown to be proficient in combat, being swift with her movements and attacks. She has also shown to have above average strength, as she was able to create a crater in the floor when she came down at Sakura.

Plot Overview

She appeared with her comrades when
Team 7
 was attacked under Shabadaba's orders. Her team later attacked Michiru, Hikaru and Team 7.






Karenabana is killed by Sakura.



During her final encounter with Sakura, Sakura was able effectively counter Karenbana's technique by shattering a chandelier and followed Karenbana's movements by listening to the sound of her footsteps on the glass. Once she detected her location, Sakura punched her with a
chakra-infused punch
, slamming Karenbana into a wall, killing her with Sakura saying, "Watch your step." thus ending their battle.

Trivia

Karenbana is the only movie-exclusive antagonist in the
Naruto
 series
 to have her age revealed.

The
Naruto Collectible Card Game
 lists Karenbana and her teammates as members of the
Uemon Clan
.
