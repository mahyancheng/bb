 who was tasked by the
Fifth Hokage
 to deliver
Jiraiya
's code told him that he might have to come back, the head told him to come to his house as he wouldn't be staying at the office.

Appearance

Mitoku is a bespectacled man with dark eyes and black hair held in a high, short ponytail with a small goatee. He wears and orange-brown shirt with  dark-coloured pants, simple sandals and a white trench coat.

Abilities

Naturally, as the head of the Cryptanalysis Team, Mitoku is knowledgeable in all the codes used in Konoha as he was able to tell from a glance that the code Jiraiya had left behind did not conform to any known algorithms.
 Mitoku was also able to guide Shikamaru on the path to figuring out the code, telling him that he should speak to someone who knew Jiraiya personally to try and figure it out after analysing the situation under which Jiraiya had left the message.

Part II

Pain's Assault

When Shikamaru Nara went to the Cryptanalysis Team office to decode the message Jiraiya had left, Mitoku found it unusual that the
Sannin
's encrypted message did not correspond to any code in their he village. He then stated that given the circumstances that Jiraiya left the message under, it could not be anything very complex. He then told them to think of a person that he intended to leave the message for as they would be the best bet for decoding the message. With this, he told Shikamaru that if he needed to return, that he would find him at home, not as work. After Shikamaru left, Mitoku asked
Shiho
 what she planned to do, as he intended to go home and to bed. Shiho responded that someone needed to stay at the office in case Shikamaru returned.
