Santa Yamanaka
 (
山中サンタ
,
Yamanaka Santa
) is a
jōnin
 from
Konohagakure
's
Yamanaka clan
.

Appearance

Santa is a slim, fair-skinned man with slanted, dark eyes and very long, auburn hair which reaches well into his back. He ties it into a high ponytail. He wears the standard attire of a Konoha shinobi, inclusive of
flak jacket
 as well as the
Allied Shinobi Forces
'
forehead protector
.

Abilities

He is proficient in his clan's technique's displayed when he used the
Mind Body Switch Technique
 to exchange bodies instead of just transferring his consciousness into
Kakashi Hatake
's body.
 Even amongst the Yamanaka, Santa has been noted to be a keen
sensor
 and can excel in battle even without the use of sight.
 This keen perception was put to good use during the Fourth Shinobi World War where Santa was able to switch bodies with Kakashi and position his captain's body — through the use of the
Sensing Technique
 — where Kakashi could land a devastating blow on the target.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Kakashi's strategy, initiated.



Santa was placed in
Third Division
 of the Allied Shinobi Forces. He was incorporated into Kakashi's battle strategy in order to gain the upper hand in the fight against the
reincarnated
 shinobi. Because of the
mist
 that hung on the battlefield, visibility was very low hence Santa switched bodies with Kakashi and used his sensory abilities to position Kakashi's body behind
Zabuza Momochi
's. He then cancelled the technique allowing Kakashi to opportunely strike a blow on the opponent. However, the blow was intercepted by
Haku
. Santa was worried that Zabuza had taken down Kakashi when
Ensui Nara
 said he only managed to stop one enemy as the contact time with the other shadow was too short to activate his
own technique
.

In the anime, when dawn broke on the second day of war, Santa was amongst the group of shinobi fighting against
Jinin Akebino
.

Trivia

Santa's name might be a reference to the
Ixora chinensis
, commonly known as the Chinese ixora, written in Japanese as santanka (
サンタンカ
), with one of its name in kanji (山丹花) sharing the first kanji with the Yamanaka Clan.
