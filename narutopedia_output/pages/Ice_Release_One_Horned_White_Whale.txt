This technique allows the user to create a humongous whale with a long
narwhal
 horn out of preexisting ice to attack their opponent. The user needs a source of ice in order to use this technique. The large bulk of this technique is capable of creating great destruction upon landing. However, due to it's size and lack of speed, this technique is used more as a distraction, or to block an opponent's movements rather than attack.
