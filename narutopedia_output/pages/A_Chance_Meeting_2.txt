Summary

Chōchō
 is surprised to see that
Naruto
, the Seventh
Hokage
, has come to their rescue when
Shin Uchiha
 tried to kidnap
Sarada
. Shin reveals his
Mangekyō Sharingan
 and tries to attack Naruto with his
kusarigama
 from behind, only to fail as Naruto blocks the attack with multiple
chakra arms
. At the behest of a
creature
, Shin
retreats
.
 Naruto concludes it's safer for the girls to continue the journey with him, and denies Chōchō's assumption she was the target. Sarada hands him
Boruto
's lunchbox. While having lunch, Naruto eases Sarada's doubts on her parentage by telling her she heavily resembles her father physically and her
mother
 personality-wise. This, coupled with stories Naruto tells her about her father's and his rivalry, give her great joy and anticipation to finally meet him. As they approach the
Ridge Tower
 where Sasuke is waiting, Chōchō collapses to exhaustion and demands rest despite being so close to the destination. Too eager to wait, Sarada fibs needing to use the restroom to go on ahead, awakening her
Sharingan
 from the feeling of finally meeting her father. However, upon seeing her,
Sasuke
 draws his sword at her, asking if she's affiliated with Shin.
