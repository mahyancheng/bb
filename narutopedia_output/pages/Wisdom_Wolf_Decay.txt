The
Wisdom Wolf Decay
 is a ninjutsu unique to Saiken.

Usage

Opening its mouth, Saiken releases a dense corrosive gas (
腐らせるガス
,
kuzaraseru gasu
). Because of its gaseous nature, it can cover a wide cross-area in a short amount of time and is strong enough to instantly disintegrate a rather large tree.

Variants

In the anime, Utakata was seen using this technique in a liquid state as a stream of acid, potent enough to corrode the ground.

Trivia

When Utakata used this technique in the anime, it was white. However, when used by Saiken, it was pink in the anime, but white in the video games.
