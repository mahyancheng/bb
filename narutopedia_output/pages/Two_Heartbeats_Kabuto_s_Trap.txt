" (

,
Futatsu no Kodō	Kabuto no Wana

Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 arrived just in time to save
Sakura
, but not before
Kabuto
 told her that
Sasuke
 was dead. Naruto told her not to believe him, after which a battle ensued. Naruto managed to defeat him with the
Rasengan
, but Kabuto trapped him with some
chakra threads
 that connected their hearts; if Kabuto's heart stopped beating, so would Naruto's. As Kabuto attempted to kill himself in order to end Naruto's life, Sakura tried to free him, but only the special threads are unbreakable.
Sasame
 arrived and gave Sakura a special
Fūma clan
 tag to help save Naruto, only to find out that the Kabuto they had fought was actually
Kagerō
, who died after suggesting that Sasame should not know what
Arashi
 had become. They finally found Arashi, who had been disguised as
Orochimaru
, who revealed that he had indeed changed.
