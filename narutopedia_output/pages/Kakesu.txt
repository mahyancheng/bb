Labyrinth Game Arc

When the Thunder Train she was taking was diverted during her sleep, she woke up confined alongside other passengers. Ōga revealed himself and put them through experiments to test their ability to avoid death. During the first experiment, Kakesu was deceived by
Rokuro
 into undoing his restraints with the promise of saving her from the collapsing platforms they were on. When she released him, he ignored her as the platform gave out under her and she fell to her apparent death.

Everything turned out to be an elaborate plot carried out under genjutsu while everyone was in suspended animation. When Boruto refused to give up on Yatsume, who was the real Ōga, she woke up from the genjutsu on her own and freed everyone.
