Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

With no sign of the enemy, a wary
Kakashi Hatake
 tells the
Third Division
 to rest up while they can while maintaining a half-hour guard shift. Headquarters sends a giant
scroll
 and carrier to the division which Kakashi gives to
Sai
 in order to use the
fūinjutsu
  taught to him by
Danzō Shimura
.
Rock Lee
 is assigned as Sai's bodyguard as he would be rendered unable to defend himself while he used the technique. Sai, however, is still apprehensive about using the technique as it required him to use "emotional energy" to make it more powerful and as an
Anbu
 from
Root
, they were taught to suppress such things. He was also concerned by the fact that when he attempted to use this technique, there lied the potential for him to be consumed by negative emotions.

As dawn broke the next day, the division is set upon by
Gari
,
Pakura
,
Jinpachi Munashi
,
Kushimaru Kuriarare
,
Ameyuri Ringo
, and
Jinin Akebino
 — all of whom take to guerilla tactics to divide the division's forces and take them down individually, and upon realising this, Kakashi sends word to his division to stay together. Confronting Jinin who was slaughtering his forces, while Sai and
Ensui Nara
 stood by to aid in the sealing, Sai is still initially unable to use the technique. Almost completely overwhelmed by memories, Sai finally realises that emotions and even negative feelings were not always detrimental, and is finally able to use the
Sealing Technique: Tiger Vision Staring Bullet
 to seal away Jinin. With Jinin sealed, the other
reincarnated
 shinobi retreat and they are ordered not to pursue them individually.
