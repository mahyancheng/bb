"
Naruto and Sasuke 2
" (
ナルトとサスケ②
,
Naruto to Sasuke 2
) is chapter 695 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Recoiling from the force of their clash,
Sasuke
 quickly launches a
fireball
 at
Naruto
. As the attack approaches, Naruto reactivates his
Six Paths Sage Mode
 and uses a
chakra arm
 to deflect it. Sasuke then
instantly appears
 behind him and attacks with a
Chidori
, which knocks Naruto back across the water. Sasuke continues on the offensive and launches three
Susanoo

arrows
, which Naruto neutralises with three
Truth-Seeking Balls
. Sasuke manifests his
Complete Body — Susanoo
 and charges at Naruto who responds by entering his
Kurama avatar
. As they struggle, the duo reflect on past memories of similar hardships faced in their youth.
 Sasuke claims Naruto will die if he continues to fight at his current pace, but Naruto retorts he doesn't want to kill Sasuke. Sasuke charges a
Chidori via his Susanoo
, while Naruto forms a
Tailed Beast Ball mixed with senjutsu
 to counter. Naruto notes that he will never leave Sasuke alone as their attacks clash, forming a titanic explosion of energy. Inside the blast, Sasuke comments that he truly understands Naruto's actions and has reciprocal respect for them, before rhetorically asking if Naruto feels the same way.
