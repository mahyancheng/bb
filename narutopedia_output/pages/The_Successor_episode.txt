Summary

Hagoromo
 chooses
Asura
 as his successor, to the surprise of all.
Indra
 asks why Hagoromo did not chose him. Hagoromo received word the village Indra was sent to is almost destroyed, and asks how Indra performed his task. He responds he did the same as Asura, giving the village water and destroying what was left of the
God Tree
, and that he did it alone. Hagoromo reveals that after Indra left, the villagers began fighting over the water rights, almost destroying the village. Hagoromo commends Indra for his
Sharingan
, and asks him to support Asura in upholding
Ninshū
.
 Indra leaves, followed by two of people loyal to him. That night, by themselves, Indra's followers think they should appeal to Hagoromo. Indra thanks them, and kills them. A feast is held to celebrate Asura's appointment.
Taizō
 and
Kanna
 discuss about Indra and Asura. Asura questions Hagoromo's decision, and Hagoromo explains how Indra's Sharingan has impaired his ability to understand others, unlike Asura. Hagoromo asks Asura to join forces with Indra, and imparts Asura with power. Indra attacks the celebration, denouncing love as the way to shape Ninshū, seeing cooperation as a sign of weakness. Hagoromo and Asura note his
Mangekyō Sharingan
. Indra attacks, but Asura is able to withstand his attack, surprising him. Indra uses
Susanoo
. Hagoromo and the other Ninshū followers join Asura. Asura blocks one of his attacks with
Truth-Seeking Balls
. After sharing of their chakra, Asura begins using
Sage Art Wood Release: True Several Thousand Hands
, and defeats Indra. Indra escapes, vowing to never acknowledge Asura and Ninshū. Hagoromo recounts how Indra began a sect that emphasises power, and how
Black Zetsu
 tampered with the
Stone Tablet
 he left behind to warn about the Sharingan. As he dies, Hagoromo tells Asura of Indra's visit the night before, when he vowed to reincarnate until love-led Ninshū ceases to be. Hagoromo finishes his story to the four
Hokage
.

Trivia

Asura's method of teaching the people of the village he visited to find water themselves rather than just giving it to them like Indra did is an allusion to the proverb "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime".
