Naruto
 manga.

Summary

The taste of his own blood and the pain he feels makes
Madara
 ecstatic, and as he begins to heal as a result of having
Hashirama
's power, he notes that having a living body had made him temporarily careless. Madara prepares to perform a
summon
, which puts
Kurama
 on edge, recalling when it was summoned by Madara once before.
Shukaku
 tells Kurama not to fret over one human, leading the fox to tell the tanuki never to underestimate Madara. Launching his plan, Madara summons the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 from inside
Obito
 which
Kakashi
 tries
ripping
 its head off, but only manages to take out its right arm before the statue is summoned to Madara's side. Madara notices the damage, and while conceding the opposing side has someone with a good dōjutsu, concludes that it would not make much of a difference.
 Naruto and the
tailed beasts
 notice the summon, and that Madara no longer has an
Impure World Reincarnation
 body. Naruto surmises that Madara had Obito
bring him back to life
. Elsewhere,
Black Zetsu
 and Obito argue over the Rinnegan while Madara jumps atop the statue and
focuses
 his
Rinnegan
 on them, causing the tailed beasts to be sent hurtling backwards. The legendary
Uchiha
 then has the statue use
its chains
 to restrain them before declaring that he will first extract
Gyūki
 and Kurama from
their

jinchūriki
.
