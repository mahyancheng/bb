Used primarily as a defensive manoeuvre, the Ten-Tails has the ability to perform
biological fission
, extruding pieces of its body to create smaller entities that resemble itself, known as
Fission Beings
. After being produced these creatures will act in a coordinated fashion to defend the main body from perceived threats.

As part of this technique, the Ten-Tails can also separate and purge injured parts from its main body. This was done after part of its body was set ablaze by
Amaterasu
.

Code

Ten-Tails
 in
Kara
's captivity, which then reformed into humanoid forms he named
Claw Grime
.
