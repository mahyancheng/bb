,
Unmei no Tokuiten
)

In the past,
Koji
 explains to
Boruto
 the mechanics of
space–time ninjutsu
. Boruto's usage of it appears to be akin to his
grandfather
's
Flying Thunder God Technique
, which is what Boruto had been referring to it as, but is completely separate. Using his grandfather's technique as inspiration, Boruto devised his own
variant
 that utilizes metal objects to mark his desired location. However, Boruto discovers that his technique has several weaknesses, such as a limited visual range and the inability to distinguish which metal object he wants to teleport to. Koji explains that Boruto eventually came up with the idea to use metal symbols of various shapes, that way Boruto can properly distinguish which metal object he wants to teleport to, despite how far away it may be. With the theories and knowledge that would've normally taken him years to obtain, Boruto begins training endlessly to master his new techniques.

The scene returns to Boruto's conversation with Koji inside a hideout. Boruto asks why Koji does not just tell everyone about the futures he's seen so they can help bring them to fruition. Koji explains that once a normal person learns about a future, they can no longer act the same as before they knew, which may lead to the act of destroying that future. However, the more futures one knows, the greater chance they divulge from fate, and they are referred to as singularities, or heretical existences, such as Boruto and Koji. Their roles as explained by Koji are to assist everyone with leading to a good future from the shadows. Koji also notes that
Ada
 is also becoming a singularity, aware that Ada would eventually watch their conversation with the
Senrigan
.

Back in the present,
Sarada Uchiha
 and
Sumire Kakei
 are asking Ada if she can find out what Boruto is hiding. Wanting to keep the conversation she witnessed secret, Ada lies that Boruto is keeping things to himself to prevent unnecessary danger to them. Frustrated that Boruto always seems to shoulder everything himself, Sarada asks if Ada can find out Boruto's current location. However, Sumire interjects that Boruto may not want them to know. Revealing her true feelings, Sumire notes that Sarada is not putting others' feelings into consideration, pointing out Sarada hugging Boruto in front of her, who has a crush on Boruto. Sumire suddenly gets up and leaves.
Shikamaru Nara
 mentally contacts Ada.

Meanwhile,
Koharu Utatane
 and
Homura Mitokado
 are contacted by
Ikkyū Madoka
 regarding
Konohagakure
's failure in apprehending Boruto despite his many appearances in the village. He orders them to recapture Boruto quickly, or those responsible will be brought to task.

Shikamaru meets with Ada on the patio of the cohabitation house, remarking that he would have chosen not to meet Ada in person, as looking at her muddles his thoughts. Ada did not want the sensory unit eavesdropping on them. Ada confirms that there is a new
Human God Tree
, named
Ryū
, who is based off
Shinki
, and his target is
Gaara
. Gaara is safe as of now as he is sealed inside of Shinki's
Magnet Iron Grain Seal Palm
, however Ryu is able to undo the seal. Shikamaru prepares to send a team to
Sunagakure
. Ada also mentions that this intel was from a few hours ago, revealing that there is a
Human God Tree that can look into Eida's eyes
 while she is watching them with her Senrigan. Visibly uncomfortable, Ada apologizes as she no longer wants to be told to watch them in real time. Shikamaru understands and thanks her anyway. Ada is also aware of Shikamaru assisting Boruto in escaping, stating that she will not tell anyone, not wanting to cause Boruto any more trouble and Boruto and
Kawaki
 should be left alone to deal with the Human God Trees.

Shikamaru asks Ada if she is aware of Boruto's mystery accomplice, believing it is Koji Kashin. A
toad
 suddenly reveals itself from Ada's hair, as Koji talks through the toad, praising Shikamaru's intelligence. Koji begins to give Shikamaru a set of orders while telling him not to ask any questions. Shikamaru is to send Sarada,
Mitsuki
 and
Konohamaru Sarutobi
 to Sunagakure as either Ryū or
Matsuri
, or both of them together, will be present. The Konoha team will cooperate with 2 Suna shinobi to defeat them. Dismissing Shikamaru's attempts to ask why, Koji advises him to come up with a plausible reason if they are not convinced. Another order is to not allow
Himawari Uzumaki
 leave Konohagakure, as
Jura
 is targeting her and a confrontation with him will result in her death. As Jura holds Konohagakure's cultural values in high regard, he is not likely to wage battle inside the village, and Himawari should be safe as long as she stays inside the village. All citizens are to also treat Jura as a regular citizen, should he pay a visit to a bookstore. Shikamaru should try his absolute hardest to not provoke Jura, as it will be the end of everything should he be truly angered. To avoid the possibility of Jura intervening, they will deal with the other Human God Trees with the minimum force required, and should Jura show up, orders are to immediately retreat. Koji wishes Shikamaru good luck as the toad prepares to leave. Shikamaru stops him, and Koji commends Shikamaru for helping Boruto escape, following his heart over the village's laws and his peers. As long as he continues to do so, they will achieve a good future. Shikamaru begins smoking a cigarette as he prepares to follow the orders given. As Eida quietly ponders about Koji's words, Sumire is seen in a separate part of the house, regretting her earlier outburst.

Some time passes, as Sarada, Mitsuki, and Konohamaru arrive at the
Land of Wind
, on the way to Sunagakure. Mitsuki notices Sarada's silence and asks what's wrong, but Sarada says it's nothing as Konohamaru advises her to not space out.
Yodo
 and
Araya
 greet the Konoha shinobi. They arrive at the coordinates given to Konohamaru by Shikamaru. Mitsuki questions where he received this intel, and Konohamaru was told it was from a reliable source. Yodo talks with Sarada, noticing her different aura and asks if Sarada is into somebody. Konohamaru spots Ryu and Matsuri in the distance, looking over one of Koji Kashin's toads, dead on the ground. They wonder if this toad will be a clue in locating Boruto.
