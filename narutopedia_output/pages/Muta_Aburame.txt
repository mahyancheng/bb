Muta Aburame
 (
油女ムタ
,
Aburame Muta
) was a
tokubetsu jōnin
 from
Konohagakure
's
Aburame clan
.

Personality

Like his clansmen, Muta was a solemn individual. He cared deeply for his village and comrades and would carry out his missions to the letter. Muta was also shown to be calm even under the direst of situations. He was methodical and analytical, allowing him to send intelligence to headquarters which enabled the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 to make great strides during the war.

Appearance

Muta had long brown hair and like all other Aburame, his eyes were obscured by sunglasses. His attire consisted of a long-sleeved, tan jacket with a high, upturned collar. The remainder of his form was largely obstructed by the low hemlines and overlaying clothes. He also had a harness fastened to the back of his outfit which he used to carry around a gourd in which he carried additional
kikaichū
.

Abilities






Muta communicating with his shōkaichū.



As an Aburame, Muta had a special breed of insects called kikaichū, which inhabited his body and fed off his
chakra
. In battles, he uses them to attack opponents in a wide area, cornering them and draining their chakra. He can also use them to emit a
jamming signal
 to confuse sensors.
 Muta carried at least one other species of insect in his body called
shōkaichū
, which he used to gather information by having them tunnel through the ground to locate nearby chakra signatures and report it back to him.

The Aburame confront Konan.



Over the course of
Pain's assault

clone
.






Muta and his clansmen face off against Konan.



As they look up they realise that they are surrounded by clones of Konan who descend on them. Shibi and his clansmen send their insects to destroy the clones who, to their surprise, detonate. As they narrowly escape the explosion, Konan, who had drenched herself in water to counter the effects of fire and mixed herself in with the clones can be seen walking out of the flames.

Muta sends intel to the Alliance.



Following Kabuto's trail, Muta had his shōkaichū gather intel for him from underground, discovering that
Akatsuki
 had a large number of
living organisms
 underfoot. He then asked Tokuma to use his Byakugan to look underneath the base to see exactly what it was. After, Tokuma reported the army of White Zetsu, Muta and the others are ordered by Anko to leave and inform the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 of this development.

As he ran with his team-mates, he quietly asked Anko to forgive them for leaving her behind and prays that she stayed safe. As they made their escape, Tokuma detects an enemy
team
 approaching them from the above and remained behind to hold them off while Muta and Ranka escaped. Some time passed and after Muta is separated from Ranka, he uses his insects to
confuse
 the enemy sensor. He then tells his kikaichū to take a scroll containing information back to the Alliances' base.






Muta is forced to attack Zaji.



Muta is later captured, and
controlled
 by
Sasori
. He is then used as bait to attack the
Surprise Attack Division
. As Zaji rushes to aid him, Muta tells him to get away from him quickly but is then immediately forced to hold him hostage much to Zaji's shock. After they realise that he was under the enemy's
control
, Kankurō is able to rescue
Zaji
 before Deidara detonated the
explosive clay
 he placed in Muta's insect jar, killing him.
