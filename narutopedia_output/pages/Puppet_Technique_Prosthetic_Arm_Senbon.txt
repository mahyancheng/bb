While inside of his puppet Hiruko, Sasori fires the puppet's torpedo-shaped left arm towards the enemy. The arm rotates at high speed, launching the wooden cylinders attached to it. The cylinders then open, each one releasing a large amount of
senbon
, creating a quick rain of poisoned needles in all directions.

Trivia

The name of this technique was established in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 4
, as it was unnamed in both anime and manga.

This technique was a new installation into the Hiruko puppet, sometime after Sasori left
Sunagakure
, as
Chiyo
 remarked she never saw it before.
