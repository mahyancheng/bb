An
autonomous puppet
 is a
puppet
 that acts on its own after being supplied a portion of chakra without being constantly
controlled
 by the puppeteer. The first known autonomous puppets were used by members of the
Ōtsutsuki clan
. The shinobi world would eventually develop their own autonomous puppets with the use of
Scientific Ninja Tools
. Unlike most puppets, these puppets can endure most damage that would otherwise destroy common puppets and would keep going until they overheat or are completely destroyed.

Urashiki Ōtsutsuki
 was accompanied by these puppets in order to help him to capture the

Kara Puppets





Kara's puppets.



Kara
 was the first to create the autonomous puppets with modern day technology, which were used to guard
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
's
Vessel
 during transport. With the built in Scientific Ninja Tools, the puppets can shoot fire balls continuously until they overheat. These puppets were able to cause
Jōnin
 rank shinobi to struggle in subduing them. In the anime, Victor used some of these puppets to pose as employees at his company.

Scientific Ninja Weapons Team Puppets

The
Scientific Ninja Weapons Team
 created their own autonomous puppets after
Katasuke Tōno
 had examined Kara's puppets, which were sent to assist the miners on
Dotō Island
 with
Team 5
 in order to supervise their progress. After the takeover of the island by the
Funato clan
, a Funato pirate had obtained one of the lost puppets, who had unintentionally made it go hostile until
Sarada Uchiha
 and
Mitsuki
 had restored its functions.
