Hinoko shoots a
chakra
 needle from her fingertips, that will always hit the target. She can alter the properties of the needle to have different effects on the target once they're hit, such as by revitalising, paralysing, or killing them. She is able to fire multiple needles from each finger simultaneously, and even redirect their trajectory after being fired.
