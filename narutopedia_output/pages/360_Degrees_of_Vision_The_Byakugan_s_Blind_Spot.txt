"
360 Degrees of Vision: The Byakugan's Blind Spot
" (
視界360度　白眼の死角
,
Shikai Sanbyaku Rokujū Do, Byakugan no Shikaku
) is episode 116 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Kidōmaru
 manages to shield himself from Neji's attack and flees to the safety of the neighbouring trees. Deciding to attack
Neji
 from a safe distance, Kidōmaru advances his
cursed seal
 to its first level before sending multiple spiders to attack Neji from his
personal summon
. Neji is able to repel them all, with both his
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
 and the advanced
Eight Trigrams One Hundred Twenty-Eight Palms
, although Kidōmaru notices a delayed reaction in some of Neji's blocks. He theorises that Neji's defences have a blind spot, and continues to attack him from this blind spot. His theory is proven correct when Neji is unable to block the attack. Believing himself to have found Neji's weakness, Kidōmaru throws multiple projectile weapons at Neji, stabbing him in the back. Despite this, Neji is able to stand up. Kidōmaru, prepared to finish Neji once and for all, enters into the second state of his cursed seal and fashions himself a
bow and arrow
, in an attempt to strike at Neji's blind spot once more.
