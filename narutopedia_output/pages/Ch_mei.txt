Chōmei
 (
重明
), more commonly known as the
Seven-Tails
 (
七尾
,
Nanabi
,
Shichibi
), is one of the nine
tailed beasts
. It was last sealed within
Fū
 from
Takigakure
.

Background






The young tailed beasts with Hagoromo.



Chōmei and the tailed beasts first came into being in the waning days of
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
, who used his
Creation of All Things Technique
 to divide the
Ten-Tails
' chakra into nine separate bodies and giving each a name. Some time after being created, the Sage explained to the young tailed beasts that a link existed between them despite their separation. He also foretold of a day when they would be brought together again - though not as they were - and that at that time someone would emerge to show them what true power is.
 In the anime, before his death, Hagoromo sent Chōmei to live in a temple built for the purpose of protecting it in a closed forest region covered by mosses.

At some point in the past, Chōmei became affiliated with Takigakure, making it the only tailed beast known not to belong to
Five Great Shinobi Countries
. In the anime, this feat is attributed to the village's reputation of frequently producing skilled jōnin.
 Decades later, the tailed beast would end up being sealed within Fū.

Personality

Chōmei seems to have a happy-go-lucky personality — which it seemingly shares with its jinchūriki as shown when it introduced itself to Naruto, referring to itself as "
Lucky Seven Chōmei
" (
ラッキーセブン重明
,
Rakkī sebun Chōmei
), which might be an allusion to the fact that it has seven tails and the number seven having long been seen as a
lucky
 as well as a
happy
 number. It also had a habit of using the word
lucky
 in conversation, reflecting its personality.

Appearance






A young Chōmei.



Chōmei resembles a blue, armoured
kabutomushi
 (
カブトムシ
,
rhinoceros beetle
), with six of its seven tails resembling green insect wings, along with an actual seventh tail, all growing from the end of its
abdomen
. The stem of the tail is green but the wings are orange. Its eyes seem to be covered by a helmet-like skull, from inside of which, an orange glow can be seen. It also has spike protrusions on its shoulders and a row of slits on each shoulder, and six legs — three on each side. The legs are also covered by the blue armour, with the exception of extreme ends which are green in colour. It has two pincers with three parts on its face, covering a mouth full of sharp teeth.
 On its back behind its head, it has a large two sectioned horned protrusion. During the last remaining days of the Sage of Six Paths, Chōmei was just in its
larval
 stage of
development
, was completely green aside from its tails which were a lighter shade of green, having seven full tails instead of wings, and red eyes.

Chōmei creating a Tailed Beast Ball.



As a
tailed beast
, Chōmei possesses extremely large amounts of
chakra
 that it can
share with others
 and can use the
Tailed Beast Ball
. It also has powerful healing capacities, able to mend injuries in themselves and others in seconds.
 Likewise, Chōmei is effectively immortal, as when it dies, it will eventually revive, albeit in a younger form. Using its wings, it can emit
blinding powder
 and has the ability to fly. It also utilises insect-based attacks, such as
biting
 or
ramming its horn
 into the enemy. In the anime, it can also create a
Cocoon
 which could slow down
Chakra Absorption Techniques
.
 It has immense durability, able to withstand being slammed into the ground by Kurama.

Interlude

In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths






Chōmei resists being extracted from within Fū.



In the anime, during a joint Chūnin Exams between Konohagakure and Sunagakure, Fū attempted to stop the Suna-nin
Hōichi
 from
extracting

Shukaku
 from its host
Gaara
. Her failed attempt caused her to draw the attention of Hōichi, who also began extracting Chōmei from Fū.
 Ultimately, the extraction was stopped by the intervention of
Neji Hyūga
, who used his
Gentle Fist
 to block the chakra points from which Chōmei was being extracted, thereby repelling the chains.
 Fū was later captured by Akatsuki members
Kakuzu
 and
Hidan
, leading to Chōmei being
extracted
 from its jinchūriki and sealed within the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
.

The remaining jinchūriki transform into their tailed beasts.



After
Son Gokū
 was resealed into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, Tobi, who was intent on going all-out from that point on, forced Fū to fully transform into the Seven-Tails. The opposing tailed beasts prepared to attack the shinobi, but they were
rebuffed
 by a fully-transformed
Naruto
. After the Seven-Tails was grabbed mid-flight and sent plummeting to the ground by Naruto and
Kurama
, the opposing beasts regrouped and then prepared a collaborative Tailed Beast Ball, which was met by one from Naruto and Kurama.






Chōmei, alongside other jinchūriki and tailed beasts, encounters Naruto.



As Naruto entered a deeper plane of the tailed beasts' consciousness, Chōmei introduced itself to the young shinobi. Later, as Chōmei was freed from the
chakra receiver
, it affirmed Kurama's belief that Naruto was the person the
Sage of the Six Paths
 had spoken about so long ago before being resealed into the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path.

The tailed beasts being freed from Obito.



Chōmei appeared alongside the other tailed beasts with the exception of Gyūki and
Shukaku
 when the
Ten-Tails
 looked down at Naruto. The image of the tailed beasts, along with a silhouette of the Sage of Six Paths, drove the Ten-Tails to a fit as it evolved further. Later, Chōmei is pulled out of Obito through the combined teamwork of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, thus freeing it, alongside with the other imprisoned tailed beasts.






The tailed beasts working together to attack Madara.



When Madara ran towards the tailed beasts, both Shukaku and
Gaara
 conjured
numerous sand bullets
 and were able to restrain the Uchiha's movements. Using the opportunity to attack, the tailed beasts each took a swing at their opponent, giving sand-manipulating duo an opening to use their
Desert Layered Imperial Funeral Seal
, but Madara managed to escape the sand pyramid with his Susanoo. As Naruto in
Tailed Beast Mode
 pinned Madara down with a tail, Chōmei and the other tailed beasts joined in and did the same to increase the damage, but the Uchiha survived their attacks and retreated to a safe distance. After he received his own right Rinnegan eye from a White Zetsu clone, Madara quickly summoned the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path from Obito's body, and used the Rinnegan to
repel
 the tailed beasts. With the tailed beasts stunned, Madara then
chained
 them up and sealed them back into the Demonic Statue.






The tailed beasts reunite with Hagoromo and Naruto.



Later, the chakra Chōmei transferred to Naruto earlier, manifested within Naruto's subconscious along with the other tailed beasts to speak with the young jinchūriki and the spirit of
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
. There, they all voiced their shared belief to the Sage that Naruto was the child of prophecy.

Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes






The tailed beasts being freed from the Ten-Tails.



After Madara's ambitions were cut short by
Black Zetsu
, who revealed to be the silent manipulator of shinobi history since it was first created by
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
, the black entity used Madara's body as a medium to resurrect its creator. During the battle against the tyrannical princess, Chōmei and the other tailed beasts continued to support Naruto by giving him
their combined power
 to overwhelm her. Ultimately, Kaguya was defeated by Naruto and
Sasuke
, who used the
Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei
 to eject all the tailed beasts from her and seal her away inside a newly-created
moon
 within her own
dimension
.

After the spirits of Hagoromo and the past Kage summoned both the tailed beasts and
Team 7
 back to the real world, the tailed beasts began to discuss their plans for the future since they were finally free. Sasuke, however, made his own intentions known: removing as many people as possible who could get in the way of his plans of leading the world through a revolution to do away with current shinobi systems, including killing all the current Kage and tailed beasts. Just as Sasuke swiftly
subdued
 the tailed beasts with his Rinnegan and sealed them within his
Chibaku Tensei
, Naruto reassured the tailed beasts that he would save them once again. After Naruto was able to defeat and reform Sasuke, the two dispelled the Infinite Tsukuyomi and Sasuke released Chōmei, along with the other tailed beasts, from their prisons.

 for its chakra, it was deduced he was interested in all the tailed beasts' chakra. Naruto organised a telepathic meeting with the other tailed beasts. However, Chōmei,
Matatabi
, and
Kokuō
 each refused to accept aid from humans in fear of being captured and used again by them, despite their trust in Naruto and thereby decided to skip the meeting.

Trivia

"Chōmei" (
重明
,
literally meaning:
 "Heavy Bright") is a term for either "Principal Brightness" or "Principal
Vidya
".

Chōmei is the only tailed beast to have permanently undergone a complete change in appearance, evolving from a larval stage at its creation into a more insectoid adult form.

Alongside Gyūki, they are the only tailed beasts that do not have any known elemental affinity. Strangely, both are also the only beasts whose tails differ from the conventional ones that their siblings have.
