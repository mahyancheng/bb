Kidōmaru
 first creates a
war bow
 by carefully expelling
Spider Sticky Gold
 from his mouth.
 With it he is able to fire arrows, using his body's eight limbs to boost the bow's tension beyond what normal people are capable of. Because of how much power is put into each arrow, they travel incredibly quickly, too fast to see.
 On impact, the arrows pierce cleanly through targets and obstacles alike and can crater the ground,
 to the point that it is described as a "one hit kill". By activating his
cursed seal
's second level, Kidōmaru gains a third eye which further increases his accuracy, allowing him to hit his target's vital spots from hundreds of metres away.

When fighting
Neji Hyūga
, Kidōmaru initially uses a standard arrow without any special properties. By surrounding the area with his
chakra
, Neji is able to sense to arrow in time to avoid fatal injury.
 To account for this, Kidōmaru attaches one of his usual spider threads to the arrow, allowing him to control its trajectory from up to fifty metres and thus improve its accuracy.
 Neji takes shelter behind a tree to throw the arrow off course. To account for this, Kidōmaru modifies the arrowhead into a drill, which will allow it to pierce through the tree if Neji tries that again.
 The combination of the new arrow and the guiding thread is enough to successfully strike Neji, which Neji uses as an opportunity to locate and
kill
 Kidōmaru.
 In the anime, after being
reincarnated
, Kidōmaru can simultaneously fire three arrows.

Trivia

This technique's Japanese name is a pun, as when written as Suzaku (
朱雀
,
literally meaning:

Vermilion Bird
), it is one of the sacred beasts of the
Four Symbols
 in Chinese, Japanese and Korean mythology.

While the databook states Kidōmaru boosts the tension of the bow with his eight spider limbs, which was what he did against Neji for the first shot, the next two shots he fired were only using two arms, despite retaining the same destructive force behind them.
