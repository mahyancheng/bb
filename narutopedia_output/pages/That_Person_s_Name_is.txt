 manga.

Summary

Two
cloaked

individuals
 look upon a devastated
Konoha
. Two days after the failed
Konoha Crush
, a funeral for the
Third Hokage
 is held.
Iruka
 comforts the Third's grandson,
Konohamaru
, and reflects on his own experiences with the Third; when Iruka was upset by the death of
his

parents
, the Third assured him that they and all others who die in the village's service live on so long as Konoha exists.
Kakashi
 and
Yūgao
 visit the
Memorial Stone
 in memory of others that have died before going to the ceremony.
Jiraiya
 watches them and thinks about his time under the Third's tutelage, shedding a tear over how perverted he and his master were.
Naruto
 asks Iruka why people die to protect others, to which Iruka responds it is human nature. Agreeing, Naruto leaves with the rest of
Team 7
 and Iruka remarks that the Third will inevitably be replaced by someone else who is an equally great
Hokage
.

Trivia

The front-cover of this chapter where
Team 7
 are running in the sunset is the exact same image used in the
