A target's chakra being absorbed through contact.



Chakra absorption techniques
 (
チャクラ吸引術
,
Chakura Kyūin Jutsu
,
English TV:
 Chakra Absorption Jutsu) allow the user to absorb the
chakra
 of another individual - usually an opponent's - and utilise it as if it were their own.
 Those who have had their chakra absorbed have reduced options in combat due to the lost chakra, and if enough chakra is taken they may be too weak to move.
 Conversely, those who have absorbed the chakra have expanded combat options due to the increased chakra reserves and their physical condition may improve as a result.
 However, users must be able to process the chakra they absorb; if they absorb
senjutsu
-chakra but do not have the required training in senjutsu, they will turn to stone.

When absorbing another's chakra, most ninja require some medium through which to do so, whether it be a
jutsu
 (as in several
Wood Release
 techniques), a weapon (notably
Samehada
 and the anime's
Infinite Armour
), or some other resource (as in the
Aburame clan
's
kikaichū
). Others are able to absorb chakra simply by making physical contact with a target. Known individuals that can do so are:
Yoroi Akadō
,

Jirōbō
,

Kisame Hoshigaki
,

White Zetsu
,

Black Zetsu
,

Madara Uchiha
,

Obito Uchiha
,

Fūka
,
 and the
Ultimate Summoning Beast
.

Trivia

In reference to Yoroi's use of the ability,
Orochimaru
 describes it as "unholy", but never goes into detail.

In
Naruto Shippūden 3D: The New Era
, the
Rinha clan
 had a kekkei genkai allowing them to
absorb chakra
 and then
imbue
 a
puppet
 with the chakra, even giving it the ability to use other kekkei genkai.

Orochimaru is shown absorbing his own chakra from
Kabuto Yakushi
 through physical contact,
 but it's unclear if he can absorb any target's chakra if he so chooses.
