This technique allows one to send messages through water. By throwing water on a surface, even a vertical one, the water will rearrange itself into a readable message, which will fade after a while.

Trivia

In its only shown usage, the water was dyed red to look like blood. It's unclear if this is part of this technique, or if it was done to make it more legible.
