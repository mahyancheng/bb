Breakdown! The Deal is Off!
" (
交渉決裂!!
,
Kōshōketsuretsu!!
) is episode 93 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Having recognised that
Tsunade
's healing technique was filled with killing intent, due to being a
medical-nin
 himself,
Kabuto
 realised that she had no intention of helping
Orochimaru
. As Orochimaru asked Tsunade why she would betray him, Tsunade replies that though she would have given anything to see her loved ones again, she couldn't bring herself to heal Orochimaru as he would only destroy
Konoha
, the village both her brother and lover died to protect, and was enlightened by
Naruto
. With Tsunade being the only person who can heal Orochimaru, they decide to take her by force, and Kabuto and Tsunade begin to fight. Although Tsunade has far more battle experience than Kabuto, he is able to hold his own against her, even managing to get in a few debilitating attacks. She eventually gains the upper hand, but her
Body Pathway Derangement
 technique is quickly overcome by Kabuto's knowledge of the human body. As Kabuto charges at her and prepares to put Tsunade out of commission, Naruto,
Jiraiya
, and Tsunade's assistant,
Shizune
, arrive to help.
