 gets into a fight with his
shadow clones

Kakashi

switched places
 with one of the clones. Naruto is quickly cheered up when he sees a bell lying on the ground. He goes to pick it up, but is tied to a tree before he can do so. Kakashi appears and lectures him about obvious traps.
Sasuke
 takes Kakashi's preoccupation to attack, but finds that this is also a trap. His location exposed, Sasuke flees.
Sakura
, worried about Sasuke, goes looking for him, but falls prey to one of Kakashi's
genjutsu
. Kakashi tracks down Sasuke, remarking that he is the only one left.
