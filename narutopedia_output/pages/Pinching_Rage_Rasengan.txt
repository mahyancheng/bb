Naruto charges at his opponent, swiftly generating two shadow clones. The clones efficiently craft Rasengan, and with precision timing, the original Naruto propels his opponent towards the clones. This sets the stage for a simultaneous Rasengan assault from both directions, culminating in a decisive finish as the opponent gets caught between Naruto and his clone's Rasengan.
