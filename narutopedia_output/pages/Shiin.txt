Shiin
 (
死韻
) was the leader of a
group of bandits
 originating from the
Land of Rice Fields
.

Background

Shiin was the leader of a group of shinobi who, though small in size, were well-known in the Land of Sound due to their strong will and determination. Around the time of
Otogakure
's conception, the majority of his clan's skilled members defected to the village, and the country's
daimyō
 began hiring them less and less. Needing a way to provide for his men, Shiin set his eyes on a goldmine located near a small, demilitarised village led by
Nan
. He and his men originally planned on simply scaring the villagers away, but they resisted and soon after, Shiin and his clan wiped a majority of them out before fleeing due to a storm.

Personality

Shiin was a corrupt individual, having no qualms attacking an innocent village and killing its people to support his clan.

Appearance

Shiin was a man of pallid complexion. He had long black hair which framed his face. He wore a purple kimono, held closed by a purple sash over which he wore a matching grey haori and beige collar. He carried his flute tucked into the side of his sash.

Abilities

Being a leader of a group of bandits implies that Shiin was a fairly powerful shinobi. He was seen to be able to move at very high speeds, such that Neji Hyūga, Tenten, and Naruto Uzumaki had trouble following him. His main form of combat was the utilisation of weapons, such as kunai and explosive tags. He was in possession of a unique type of
kunai
 with long red ropes attached to the ends. He could use these with great skill, accurately attacking enemies, creating traps out of the rope and using them to swiftly move around the battlefield, being able to avoid attacks from even those who had their
chakra enhanced
.

He was able to utilise a
flute
-based genjutsu to
paralyse
 his opponents.

Menma Memory Search Mission

Eventually, Shiin attacked the village. Having difficulty with getting past the wall and defeating the Konoha ninja, he resorted to using music to paralyse the Konoha ninja, but
Menma
 countered the technique with his own music ninjutsu. This allowed
Naruto
 to break Shiin's flute, plus
Tenten
 and
Neji
 to defeat the raiders.

Shiin, realising the battle to be lost, retreated to the dam at the river. He planned to flood the village to drown the villagers. The gold mine would be left unharmed. Shiin's plan to flood the village was stopped when Menma collapsed the mine. In the end, Shiin was trying to escape but Naruto manages to catch up with him and defeat him with
Rasengan
. Shiin was later seen tied up with the rest of the bandits.

Trivia

Shiin's use of the flute is similar to
Tayuya
's. Even the music to bind the enemy is similar to the one that Tayuya plays.
