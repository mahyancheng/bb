The
Character Bind Technique
 (
字縛術
,
Jibakujutsu
) was a technique developed by
Shiranami
. By pointing his finger out at a target and writing the proper kanji in the air, this technique produces a variety of effects.

Known Words

The effects of these kanji have been shown:

操, which comes from the verb 操る (
ayatsuru
), meaning "to manipulate". This character allows Shiranami to manipulate and control his opponent. The effect manifests when Shiranami writes the kanji in the air at the target's direction; at which point, the kanji appears on the recipient's person. That individual then becomes a subject to Shiranami's will. However, as with the
Infinite Embrace
, it is not absolute, since a person with tremendous chakra can easily dispel the effect.

滅, which comes from the verb 滅する (
messuru
), meaning "to destroy". Shiranami uses this character to track down and destroy a message sent by carrier pigeon.
Utakata
 destroyed the word before it could fulfil its purpose.
