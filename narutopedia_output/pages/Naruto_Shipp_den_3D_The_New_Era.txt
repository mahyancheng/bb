Naruto Shippūden 3D: The New Era
 is a side-scrolling adventure game with 3D image projections for the Nintendo 3DS platform.

Plot

The story is loosely based on the
Five Kage Summit
 arc, and seems to take place shortly after its beginning. The game starts off with Naruto training on
Mount Myōboku
, soon after his training he is called back to
Konoha
 by Kakashi Hatake. When he arrives, Naruto finds out that Tsunade has cancelled the pact with Sunagakure and the hidden villages all seem to be about to go to war. Naruto goes to the different villages and fights the Kage, but they turn out to be puppets. Naruto finds out that it was Malice who made the villages go to war, and created the puppets. Naruto finds out that the reason she did all that was because she hates the ninja world because they took her son, Yūto away from her. Naruto teams up with Sasuke, and the Five Kage to stop her. Malice uses the Reflective Spirit Jutsu to revive Yūto, however, since she used it on a puppet, it transformed Yūto into a giant puppet. Malice asks for Naruto, Sasuke and the Kage's help to save her son. They stop him, Malice thanks them for saving him, and she runs away.
