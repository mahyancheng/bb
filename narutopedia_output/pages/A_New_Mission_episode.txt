Synopsis

Boruto
 dreams of
Momoshiki
's warning to him, and looks at the
mark on his hand
 when he wakes up, wondering why he dreamt of it after all this time. While on mission, Boruto thinks back to
Sasuke
's recommendations about the mark.
Team 7
 pursues bank robbers, but Boruto knocks out the one who was supposed to get away, leading them to their leader.
Sarada
 scolds him for not following the plan.
Kōtarō Fūma
 reports to
Naruto
 that since
Tsukiyo
's death, there hasn't been any reported activity by the
Mujina Bandits
.
Shikamaru
 advises Naruto to focus on his meeting with the daimyō. The daimyō, his son, and his butler arrive by train, with
Sai
 welcoming them.
Tentō
, the son, is excited to meet Sai, who he recognises from his
Extreme: Shinobi Picture Scrolls
 card collection.
Ikkyū
 leaves Tentō under
Yamaoka
's care while Sai escorts him to meet with Naruto. Tentō wants to buy more cards. Boruto buys a pack, but is disappointed in getting another card of his father, which he gives to
Iwabee
. Sarada and
Chōchō
 don't get the appeal of the cards.
 Boruto leaves after failing to get a rare card he's been after. Tentō arrives with Yamaoka, and wants to buy all the packs in the store. He notices Iwabee with Naruto's rare card, and tries to buy it from him. Iwabee refuses, so Tentō keeps buying out all the food stores they visit to get Iwabee to agree. Boruto stops Iwabee from hitting Tentō, and teases him by saying he has five Seventh Hokage cards, and telling him to keep trying to buy out all the cards. Boruto and the others leave the shop. The next day, Boruto is assigned to escort and bodyguard Tentō. The Mujina Bandits watch the village from afar, aware of Naruto and Ikkyū's meeting, and prepare to make a move.
