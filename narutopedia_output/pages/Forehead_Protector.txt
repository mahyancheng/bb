A
forehead protector
 (
額当て
,
Hitai-ate
) is a
headband
 composed of an iron
 metal plate and a band of cloth. Forehead protectors are worn by most
shinobi
 and are engraved with the symbol of their
hidden village
. Forehead protectors have been worn since at least the time of
Asura Ōtsutsuki
, though there was no engraving then.

Meaning

Forehead protectors are usually worn as a sign of pride and fealty for one's village. Ninja consider it an honourable, important part of their tradition, and make a point of wearing it at all times, especially when
sparring
 with a comrade from the same village. Although not wearing a forehead protector is frequently viewed as disrespectful to one's village and peers,
 a ninja who does not wear one may still be loyal to their village. Similarly, to have one's protector removed is to denote one's unworthiness to the name "ninja", as
Naruto
 did to
Boruto
 for cheating during the
Chūnin Exams
.
 When a ninja is to be stripped of their position from the
Shinobi Organisational System
 due to a transgression of protocols, they are to relinquish their protectors as well, as Boruto,
Sarada
 and
Mitsuki
 were to give up their forehead protectors for their unauthorised entrance to
Iwagakure
 (despite Naruto personally praising them for their noble actions).






A scratched forehead protector.



Some
missing-nin
, such as
Zabuza Momochi
, continue wearing their forehead protector even after they've left their village.
Akatsuki
 members who retain their forehead protectors carve a long, horizontal scratch across the symbol, to show they have rescinded their allegiances and rejected their villages. Villagers of
Amegakure
 aligned with
Pain
 bear the same scratches across their forehead protectors, but remain loyal to the village; it symbolises their victory during the civil war against
Hanzō
.






The Allied Shinobi Forces' forehead protector.



In preparation for the
Fourth Shinobi World War
,
Mifune
 designs a new forehead protector to be worn by members of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. Engraved with the kanji for
shinobi
 (
忍
), it symbolises that, whereas once each ninja fought for their villages separately, they now stand united under one banner for the same cause. The members of the Alliance wear this in place of their original forehead protector.

Trivia

On the cover for
chapter 567
, each
jinchūriki
 is shown with a white forehead protector with the kanji for the number of tails of their respective
tailed beasts
.

Masashi Kishimoto
, in an interview, noted that he created forehead protectors because he found it too cumbersome to draw Naruto's goggles every week.

In episode 27 of
Naruto SD: Rock Lee no Seishun Full-Power Ninden
, Chōza is seen wearing a forehead protector with the kanji "shinobi", similar to the ones worn by the shinobi of the Allied Shinobi Forces.

Upon imagining his life if he had returned to Konoha after
Rin Nohara
's death, Obito depicted himself wearing a modified forehead protector with covers that stretched down his left eye to conceal his empty eye socket.

Most forehead protectors are depicted as being tied in a knot behind the person's head, although notably Amegakure shinobi wear protectors with no knot required, implying they are elasticated protectors. Several older shinobi are either seen using custom protectors, or older styles. This style used by Amegakure appears to have been universally implemented after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, as all
Konohagakure
 genin — such as
Boruto Uzumaki
 — are shown using them.

The
Wandering Ninja Clan
 have no village symbol on their forehead protectors, similar to Asura Ōtsutsuki's.

The practical portion of the
Genin Exams
 in Konohagakure, after the curriculum's amendment, involves the students being given a white bandanna that serves as their "life". If the students graduate from the exam, the proctor will remove the
Transformation Technique
 over the bandannas, revealing them to be forehead protectors.

Missing-nin who seek refuge in
Curtain Village
 tend to sell their forehead protectors to support their poverty-stricken lives, indicating they have monetary value.
