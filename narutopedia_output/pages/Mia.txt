Kara Actuation Arc

After her husband,
Anato
 became infected by the cells of
Hashirama Senju
, Mia put in a request to
Team 7
 of
Konohagakure
 to track him down and brought back safely.

Later, she was informed by
Victor
 that her husband was killed by enemies trying to steal his research, much to her sorrow. Days later, as
Boruto Uzumaki
 and
Sarada Uchiha
 returned to give Mia her husband's ring, they revealed that Victor lied about Anato's fate. Learning that Victor was conducting terrible experiments and Anato was another victim of it, Mia was determined to confront him. The genin warned her not to make such reckless actions. Suddenly, there was an earthquake at the company, prompting the genin to urge her to take shelter while they investigated.

Ultimately, as the people began running in fear and talks about Victor's doing was heard, Mia decided to go find answers about her husband. She soon discovered Victor fighting
Orochimaru
, where she was horrified to learn of Victor intentionally sacrificing thousands of lives to gain eternal life from the recreated
God Tree
. Victor's efforts ultimately proved pointless as his God Tree was unable to produce the original's fruit. After Victor was defeated and the God Tree was destroyed, Mia offered to testify against Victor and his company to ensure such evil will never happen again.
