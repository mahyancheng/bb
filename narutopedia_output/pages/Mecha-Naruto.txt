Mecha-Naruto
 (
メカナルト
,
Meka-Naruto
) was a
mechanised
 replica of
Naruto Uzumaki
 that appears in the anime-exclusive episodes,
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
,
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
,
and
Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
.

Background

In the anime,
Orochimaru
 is responsible for Mecha-Naruto's creation. He was designed — based on the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 — as a means to capture
Kurama
 and interfere with the plans of
Akatsuki
.

Personality

Mecha-Naruto was shown originally to be savage, mindlessly attacking everything in its path. While initially having no loyalty, after
Nagato
 repaired and reprogrammed it, Mecha-Naruto became committed to capturing Kurama for Akatsuki. It was relentless in its pursuit of Kurama, destroying everything that got in its way. Despite this programming, Itachi secretly installed an extra function: if Naruto was to voice his devotion to saving Sasuke from his anger, Mecha-Naruto would side with Naruto. After this programming activated, Mecha-Naruto became driven to help Naruto in battle, willingly sacrificing itself to protect Naruto's village.

Appearance

Overall, Mecha-Naruto looked similar to Naruto with bolts all over its body holding it together. Its mechanical forehead protector could change when it wishes to various words and phrases, but by default it remains at the number "7610".

Abilities






Mecha-Naruto absorbs Kurama's chakra.



Mecha-Naruto was shown to be very powerful, able to toss aside Orochimaru, one of the legendary
Sannin
. During its initial pursuit of Naruto for the
Nine-Tails
, Mecha-Naruto proved to be highly adaptive and versatile to seemingly any threat or defence, able to take down various and some of the most powerful ninja in Konohagakure with little trouble.

Taijutsu

Mecha-Naruto was vastly skilled in taijutsu and was able to defeat several Konohagakure shinobi, including taijutsu specialists like
Rock Lee
 and
Neji Hyūga
, with ease. It also had vastly enhanced physical strength, able to effortlessly lift up
Mecha-Kurama
. It was also incredibly fast as it was able to overtake even the speed of Neji's
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
.

Mechanised Enhancements






Mecha-Naruto's various enhancements.



Mecha-Naruto, as a machine, could manipulate its body in a variety of manners. It could
launch its fists
 and used them as grappling hooks. It could fire
lasers
, from its eyes, capable of demolishing Orochimaru's entire laboratory and a good portion of Konohagakure. It was also capable of launching a tremendous volley of
missiles
 from its mechanised chest plates. Additionally, Mecha-Naruto could transform its body into a
plane-like form
, allowing it to fly at high speeds, and its fingers into machine gun-like extensions. Mecha-Naruto was equipped with a
variety of scanners
 and which allowed it to differentiate between targets. When endangered, it could detach parts of its body to avoid damage, such as its head. Mecha-Naruto's hair has been upgraded so that its tips are the handles for
chakra blades
, which the wearer can easily pull out of their head and
engage in close combat
.






Mecha-Naruto vehicle mode.



In addition to its plane-like form, Mecha-Naruto could also transform its body into a
vehicle mode
. While in this mode, its head could
produce multiple blades
 which can then easily slice through large trees. It could also launch these blades as a shuriken. In this mode, it could also produce various weapons, such as
large mallets
 and
drills
 to combat its opponents. Mecha-Naruto can
equip itself to Naruto's body
, allowing the two of them to fly to Konohagakure.

By coming within a certain distance of
Naruto Uzumaki
, Mecha-Naruto could absorb the
Nine-Tails
' chakra regardless of countermeasures to keep the tailed beast chakra contained. It could then use this chakra to enhance its own abilities.
Neji Hyūga
 also noted that Mecha-Naruto is in possession of an
Eight Trigrams Seal
 meant to contain Kurama.

Nine-Tails Mode

Main article:
Mecha-Kurama

After gathering a sufficient amount of the Nine-Tails' chakra from Naruto, Mecha-Naruto could assume a
three-tailed form
 of its own, granting it a tremendous burst of strength and speed. By using all of the tailed beast chakra inside of it at once, it could create a
Nine-Tails Chakra Bomb
 capable of destroying Mecha-Nine-Tails. Like a jinchūriki, should Mecha-Naruto lose all of its tailed beast chakra, it would die.

Part II






The mechanised Naruto destroys Orochimaru's laboratory.



In an
underground lair
,
Orochimaru
 and
Kabuto
 use the power of an ongoing thunderstorm to complete a top-secret project meant to capture the
Nine-Tails
. Kabuto warns Orochimaru that the creation is quickly going out of control, but Orochimaru ignores him resulting in the mechanised creation to go berserk and
destroy
 the laboratory and escape. It is discovered the next day by
Akatsuki
 and brought to
Pain
 who modified the mechanised creation with the
King of Hell
. The Akatsuki leader then commands
Itachi Uchiha
 to go with the mecha to capture the Nine-Tails. Mecha-Naruto later appeared with Itachi overlooking
Konohagakure
 and is commanded to capture
Naruto
.






Naruto tries to fight Mecha-Naruto.



Launching an attack on the village, the cloaked Mecha-Naruto quickly overwhelmed the surrounding villagers, including multiple members of the
Konoha 11
. Naruto arrived shortly thereafter and immediately engages Mecha-Naruto with a
multitude of shadow clones
, which the mechanised shinobi easily dispatches. During the confrontation, Naruto's tailed beast chakra begins to involuntarily leak out as Mecha-Naruto attempted to take the tailed beast within him. After an intervention by
Kakashi
 and
Yamato
, Mecha-Naruto engaged on a rampage throughout the village to hunt down and capture Naruto.

Later, Mecha-Naruto spotted Naruto escaping the village and transformed into a plane-like form in order to give chase. It was quickly intercepted by
Shino Aburame
 who stopped its
missile
 with his
kikaichū
. This resulted in the missile breaking apart into a smaller cluster, easily defeating Shino. Continuing the chase, it was next confronted by
Shikamaru
 who tried in vain to
bind
 it with shadows only to fail and be defeated as well. Pushing the group into the woods, Mecha-Naruto's next opponent was
Kiba Inuzuka
,
Akamaru
, and
Chōji Akimichi
, all three of which it easily dealt with in its new vehicle mode.






Mecha-Naruto vs Neji.



After the palanquin carrying Naruto crashes, Neji stepped up and launched a successful
defence
 against Mecha-Naruto, though the robot's speed quickly overwhelmed Neji, defeating him as well. When even Neji failed, Kakashi took it upon himself to confront Mecha-Naruto, unveiling his
Sharingan
 in the process. However, Mecha-Naruto defeated him with a simple barrage of missile, leaving Naruto alone to be captured at last. As the mechanised shinobi began to overcome Naruto, it was briefly interrupted by the arrival of
Gaara
, who nearly defeated Mecha-Naruto prior to being distracted by the arrival of
Deidara
. With Gaara's departure,
Orochimaru
 suddenly appeared to resume custody of his creation.






Naruto vs Mecha-Naruto in its Nine-Tails mode.



Orochimaru quickly seized control of Mecha-Naruto and proceeded to attempt to take the Nine-Tails only to be interrupted by the arrival of
Jiraiya
 who summons
Gamabunta
. Orochimaru easily defeats Jiraiya and the summon and returns to pursuing Naruto with Mecha-Naruto. In desperation, Naruto engaged Mecha-Naruto and initially loses before
Sasuke
's name brings the robot over to his side, due to a genjutsu placed on it by
Itachi Uchiha
. Mecha-Naruto then returned Naruto his Nine-Tails chakra. To Orochimaru's horror, Mecha-Naruto turned on him, cutting him in two, forcing Orochimaru to summon
Mecha-Nine-Tails
 to Konohagakure.

Uniting
 into one, both Mecha-Naruto and Naruto raced to Konohagakure to rescue the village. After a brief skirmish, Mecha-Naruto realised that it couldn't harm Mecha-Nine-Tails due to the mechanical tailed beast being made out of the same material. Resolving to sacrifice itself, Mecha-Naruto utilised the last of the tailed beast chakra within it to
destroy
 Mecha-Nine-Tails.

In the game,
Tsunade
 states Mecha-Naruto was created by a "certain someone" as a weapon of destruction to rule the world. Mecha-Naruto eventually went berserk and killed its creator. Mecha-Naruto refers to its creator as "Professor". After that, it reveals that it lost its memory because an incomplete "Mental Stone" that is inside of it. Mecha-Naruto seems to be a smart and strategic fighter. It hates and mocks Naruto for looking like himself and "stealing" its name. It also thinks that
Hinata Hyūga
 has a beautiful heart and listens to whatever she says. Mecha-Naruto has a crush on her and calls her "Miss Hinata" (
ヒナタさん
,
Hinata-san
), and it is jealous of Naruto because she prefers him instead of it. During the course of the game, Mecha-Naruto is able to exchange bodies with the real Naruto as a way to be accepted by everyone in the village, since it - as a robot - scared people because the way it looks. Later on after Naruto saves it, it comes to actually like Naruto but still thinks of him as its rival.

Mecha-Naruto's other self, Nine-Tails Mode however, is the result of Mecha-Naruto regaining its Mental Stone after the Ninja World Tournament. In contrast to its counterpart, Nine-Tails Mode is destructive and shows great hatred towards Mecha-Naruto for "sealing him away". In mechanised variations, Mecha-Naruto possesses most of Naruto and
Kurama
's abilities, such as the
Rocket Rasengan
 and a
mechanical variant
 of the
Tailed Beast Ball
. Additionally, it can also shoot rays with its "eyes", after targeting the opponent. It can also merge itself with a huge mechanism to form
Mecha-Kurama
. It is able to switch minds with its opponents. It can make up to three clones of himself that explode when they are touched. It is also well versed in
taijutsu
, using jets to make its punches and kicks even more powerful.

Road To Boruto
 DLC expansion. In
Naruto X Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections

In

Trivia

Masashi Kishimoto
 designed Mecha-Naruto and its Kurama-based forms specifically for
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
.

At the 2014 annual Jump Festa, Kishimoto stated he requested to create an original character for the game and that his idea of Mecha-Naruto was because he liked how
Godzilla
 has a mechanical counterpart,
Mechagodzilla
.

The numbers in its
forehead protector
 is a play on Naruto's name, each number corresponding to one syllable: seven (
七
,
nana (na)
), six (
六
,
roku, ru
), ten (
十
,
jū, to
).

After switching to Naruto's side, the numbers in its
Forehead Protector
 flip to "4649" which is a play on the common Japanese phrase "yoroshiku" (よろしく) which often translated into English as "Nice to meet you" (literally: "Treat me well"). Each number corresponds to one syllable: four (
四
,
yon (yo)
), six (
六
,
roku (ro)
), four (
四
,
shi
), nine (
九
,
kyu (ku)
).

These numbers are replaced by a V sign (meaning
Victory
) whenever he wins a match in
Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
,
Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
 and
Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
.

Maile Flanagan's take on Mecha-Naruto for English dubs of Naruto differs between the games and the anime. In the games, Mecha-Naruto has a voice similar to the original Naruto, though slightly deeper. While in the anime, Mecha-Naruto has a more high pitched voice, clearly distinctive from the original Naruto.

In
Boruto

episode 268
, Mecha-Naruto makes a brief appearance as a toy prize at the
Academy
 festival.
