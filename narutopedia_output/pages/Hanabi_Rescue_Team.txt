Stop the Falling Moon

Rank:
 Unknown

Status:
 Success

Theorising Hanabi's captor to be the orchestrator of the falling moon, Kakashi tasks the Hanabi Rescue Team to investigate his involvement and stop the moon from falling on the Earth. After discovering that Toneri was behind said events, Hinata splinted off from the team, under
Hamura Ōtsutsuki
's orders, to destroy Toneri's
source of power
 (as only she was capable of doing so). After initially failing, the combined effort of Naruto and Hinata succeeds in destroying the Energy Vessel and removing Toneri's
Tenseigan
 halting the moon's fall, hereby completing the mission.
