"
Tsunade's Warning: Ninja No More!
" (
忍者を辞めろ!ツナデの通告
,
Ninja o Yamero! Tsunade no Tsūkoku
) is episode 98 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Konohamaru
 is visibly saddened by the fact that his
grandfather's
 things were being removed from the Hokage's office because of the new
Fifth Hokage
. As Konohamaru rushes up the stairs of the
Academy
 to stop them, he accidentally runs head first into Tsunade's bust. Naruto enters a second later, knocking him over, and asks if he's seen an older woman. It was her duty to heal his friends when she got back. Konohamaru questions who she is, only to learn she’s the Fifth Hokage, and cries uncontrollably. Later, Tsunade goes to the hospital to heal
Sasuke Uchiha
,
Kakashi Hatake
, and
Rock Lee
. She heals both Sasuke and Kakashi then proceeds to examine Lee. With regret, she tells Lee that he will have to end his career as a shinobi as some of the injuries were far too grave and the chances of him surviving the operation were slim. Upon hearing the news, Lee walks out of the room contemplating what Tsunade had just told him.

Trivia

The segment in which Konohamaru accidentally runs into Tsunade's bust is removed in the edited English dub.
