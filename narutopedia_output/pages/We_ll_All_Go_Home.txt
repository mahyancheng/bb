Trivia

This is one of Naruto's more symbolic chapters. The scene where Konan's blood-soaked red paper covered her frog card symbolised the promised they made to return to the cabin to celebrate a job well-done. However, as all four inhabitants died, the cabin symbolised the afterlife and how Konan was the last amongst them to die and had passed to the afterlife to reunited with Jiraiya, Yahiko, and Nagato to celebrate their roles in contributing to peace.
