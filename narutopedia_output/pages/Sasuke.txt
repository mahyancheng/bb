 manga.

Summary

With the preliminaries over,
Kakashi
 leaves to check on
Sasuke
. The
Third Hokage
 informs the finalists that they will compete in a month's time in a series of one-on-one matches. During this time they can recover from the past few days and prepare for their opponents, having had a chance to see everyone's abilities. Meanwhile,
Orochimaru
 is concerned about
Naruto
's positive influence over Sasuke and as such the faster they tear both Naruto and Sasuke apart, the better with Orochimaru adding that he must dye Sasuke in his colors. He then instructs
Kabuto
 to kidnap Sasuke for him, or kill Sasuke; whichever Kabuto prefers. Kabuto goes to Sasuke's hospital room and kills all of his
Anbu
 bodyguards. As he holds a
scalpel
 to Sasuke's neck, Kakashi appears and stops him.
