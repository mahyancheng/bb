The Kazekage's hat.



The
Kazekage
 (
風影
,
literally meaning:
 Wind Shadow) is the
Kage
 of
Sunagakure
, a title bestowed on the village's leader. The Kazekage is generally regarded as the strongest shinobi in the village. There have been five Kazekage in the village's history.

Overview

The Kazekage position was created after the formation of Suna by
Reto
, the village's founder, that in the anime was the last of the five Kage to emerge.
 Although it is not expressly stated how a candidate for office is selected, in
Gaara Hiden
 suggests that the Kazekage position is hereditary, or at least that relatives of the
Fourth Kazekage
 are most suitable for the position; this lineage is referred to as the "
Kazekage Clan
". If the occupant of the post die or reported missing after a long period of time, the next Kazekage is chosen by the
Suna Council
. Once the duties of the position are assumed, they usually move to the
Kazekage's Office
.

Throughout history, the Kazekage have earned a reputation for being feared and respected around the world, due be responsible for keeping Suna on an even footing with the other villages despite its small size. However, the Kazekage title is sometimes considered cursed, as all the Kazekage, including the current, have met untimely deaths at the hands of assassins;
 the village's affairs are decided by the Suna Council in the interim between Kazekage. Full-bodied statues of all the former Kazekage are kept in council's meeting chambers.

jinchūriki
 of the
One-Tailed Shukaku

Naruto Uzumaki
 — a jinchūriki like himself who found strength in his friendships — Gaara began emulating him. He later became Suna's
Fifth
Kazekage
 (

Trivia

The colour of the Kazekage's garbs was originally depicted as blue in the
anime
, but was changed to the manga's green colour in
Naruto: Shippūden

episode 199
.

However, the garbs are sporadically miscoloured blue in certain subsequent episodes.

The Kazekage hat was originally presented as green during Kakashi's description of the Kage in
Naruto

episode 6
.

In the
third databook
, the First and Second Kazekage are mistakenly switched.

In
Gaara Hiden
, before
Shikadai Nara
 was born, the Suna's counsellors state that if his uncles die without heirs, Shikadai, as a descendant of
Rasa
's bloodline, would become the next Kazekage; Suna considered it a crisis for a
Konohagakure
-born shinobi to become Kazekage, and this reasoning was used to force Gaara into taking a wife.

Three of the five Kazekage were killed by
three

different

Akatsuki

members
. The three also wielded the
same

kekkei genkai
 and had their techniques based on
sand
 or
powdered

minerals
.
