 anime.

Synopsis

Misuno
 confirms
Kagura
's and
Hebiichigo
's deaths in action while repelling the detached
Funato
 unit with
Konoha
's help to
Chōjūrō
. Chōjūrō is frustrated, having hoped that Kagura would be
Mizukage
 one day, and is determined to wipe out the Funato clan. A messenger arrives with a top secret message from
Isari
. Back in Kagura's village, everyone is in disbelief that
Ikada
 is a Funato, but
Boruto
 recalls the peculiarity of his body transformation, and believes it. He is heartbroken to have become the target of someone else's revenge. Misuno questions Chōjūrō why he'd agree to negotiate with the Funato. Chōjūrō personally has no reservations against wiping out the Funato, but as Mizukage, he knows the Funato maintain control over northeastern waters, and understands that drawing out the conflict would mean more casualties. Isari arrives with
Jibiki
. Though tense and filled with posturing, Chōjūrō and Isari agree to talk, however, the Funato suddenly take over the airwaves, and
Araumi
 addresses Chōjūrō and the daimyō, announcing an offensive with their main forces. When Araumi says they'll crush anyone in their way, even if they're related, the
Marlin Harpoon
 acts on its own and stabs Isari, killing him.
 Jibiki blames himself for not stopping Isari from coming. The harpoon attempts to attack Chōjūrō, but Misuno cuts it down. All over the
Land of Water
, everyone watches Araumi swear they won't back down to honour the many Funato they have lost. The Konoha shinobi and the
swordsmen
 are shocked when Araumi announces that Ikada has joined him, and will lead them in battle, having previously thought Ikada couldn't fight. Their first target on the way to
Kirigakure
 is the Shinonome 1. Chōjūrō gives the order to protect the power station and intercept the Funato. The captive Funato continues talking down to them, so
Buntan
 knocks him out. Most of them want to keep fighting the Funato, even if Ikada is among them.
Mitsuki
 asks Boruto what his feelings are, and Boruto still thinks of Ikada as his friend. He wants to talk Chōjūrō, who
Sarada
 also wants to see, wishing to return
Hiramekarei
. Buntan and
Kyohō
 intend to keep fighting to avenge Kagura and Hebiichigo, and attack.
Iwabee
 and
Denki

protect

them
, buying them time to escape.
Metal Lee
 does nothing, torn between his
team-mates
 and his desire to avenge Hebiichigo.
Kawaki
 is frustrated by Boruto's choice. Ikada wants the Funato main forces to sail through the Sea of Death, the shortest route to the Shinonome 1 so they can arrive before Kirigakure has time to prepare. Despite the Funato's apprehension in crossing such dangerous waters, Ikada motivates them. Chōjūrō is notified of it, and wants to set sail immediately. Araumi is pleased with Ikada's attitude.
Team 7
 gets close to the sea.
