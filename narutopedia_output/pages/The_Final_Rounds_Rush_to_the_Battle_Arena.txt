モー烈 モー追 モーダッシュ　本選開始だってばよ

) is episode 59 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 goes to the entrance of the stadium where there's a banner announcing that the
Chūnin Exams
 will be the next day. He eats at the
Ramen Ichiraku
, where
Teuchi
 and
Ayame
 gave him a big bowl of ramen on the house, since his match will be tomorrow. The
previous Ino–Shika–Chō
 eat at a restaurant, with
Inoichi
 being teased about the fact that he has a
daughter
.
Chōza
 places an additional order, and then
Shikamaru
 appears, telling his father they need to go home.
Temari
 and
Kankurō
 are preparing their weapons, while
Gaara
 is sitting on the rooftop.
Neji
 and
Tenten
 are shown to be practising, as well as
Shino
. The next day, Naruto meets
Hinata
 where
Team 7
 had their
bell test
. Hinata concludes that he may defeat Neji, adding that Naruto's words of encouragement during her match with Neji made her a better person. This prompts Naruto to say that he likes people like Hinata and invites her to watch his fight against Neji. Hearing fireworks, he rushes to the stadium so he could make it in time. On his way, he sees
Konohamaru
 who tells Naruto that he knows the shortcut to the stadium, but Konohamaru just brings him to the other side of the village. He then tells Naruto to ride the daimyō's bulls to the stadium; Naruto kicks the bull, causing a stampede. Despite the trouble, Naruto finally arrives to the stadium, just in time for his match.

Trivia

Most of the events from this episode do not occur in the manga.

The entrance that Naruto made was ironically related to the event in
Pamplona, Spain
. This is when people race in to the
bullfight
 on narrow streets and try their best to get into the stadium.
