Summary





Jiraiya sets out with Sakura and Naruto on a mission.



After recovering from his battle against
Sasuke
,
Naruto
 joins
Sakura
 in another attempt to save Sasuke from
Orochimaru
. Before crossing Konoha's border,
Jiraiya
 appears. He saves them from becoming labelled missing-nin from leaving the village without authorisation by allowing them to join him on a mission to gather information on Sasuke and Orochimaru. Their journey takes them to the
Land of Rice Fields
, the land of the
Otogakure
. After a couple comedic failures to gather info due to Jiraiya's perverted antics, Naruto and Sakura met a young kunoichi named
Sasame
 of the
Fūma clan
. She revealed her desire to find her cousin
Arashi
, who along with the majority of her clan, went missing. After facing three members of the Fūma clan and managing to escape them, Jiraiya returned with new information he gathered from the remnants of the Fūma clan that saw through Orochimaru's lies.

Jiraiya explained that Orochimaru was gathering as many supporters as he could from various clans simply to gain their
secret technique
. After facing the three members again and defeating them, Sasame led Naruto and his team to Orochimaru's current hideout. Inside the base with no knowledge of where to go, the team took different paths. Eventually, Naruto found Sakura in a long corridor facing off against
Kabuto
. Naruto was able to hit Kabuto with his
Rasengan
, but unfortunately fell prey to a
devastating technique that attacked his heart
. After being saved by Sakura and Sasame, it was discovered that Kabuto was actually another Fūma clan member,
Kagerō
 in disguise.

Soon after, they found
Arashi
, who became the victim of an
unstable technique
 of Orochimaru's that merged him with his two fellow clan members and drove him insane. Naruto, along with Sasame and Sakura, were able to restore his mind. As Orochimaru's hideout began to fall apart, Arashi revealed that Sasuke was safe for now, but Orochimaru was doing everything in his power to make Sasuke a perfect host for him in the near future. After sure that the Fūma clan were free from Orochimaru's control, Naruto and his team returned to Konoha.
