Sasuke and Itachi simultaneously use Amaterasu on the opponent, pushing them back, and then each summons their Susanoo, before shooting an arrow and a group of Yasaka Magatama, respectively. The impact results in an explosion of the black flames, after which they apply a second layer of Amaterasu, compressing the explosion for a moment before it builds up and explodes again.
