 I Just Want to Protect Them) is chapter 446 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

After the
Second Shinobi World War
,
Jiraiya
 began training the
Ame Orphans
. Although it was partially to help them look after themselves, it was also to teach
Nagato
 to take advantage of his
Rinnegan
. Since Jiraiya wished for peace, he hoped Nagato, having the same eyes as the
Sage of the Six Paths
, could unite the world just as the Sage had. Nagato and the other orphans accepted this quest when Jiraiya left them and spent their adolescent years preaching an end to war.
Hanzō
, leader of
Amegakure
, interpreted this as threat to his rule and kidnapped
Konan
. He then gave Nagato a choice: kill
Yahiko
 or sacrifice Konan. So that Nagato would not need to make the choice, Yahiko killed himself, entrusting Nagato with their dreams of peace. Having lost a friend, Nagato concluded that diplomacy would be useless in obtaining world peace.
