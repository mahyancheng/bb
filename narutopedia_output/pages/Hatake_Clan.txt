The
Hatake Clan
 (
はたけ一族
,
Hatake Ichizoku
) is one of the many clans that reside in
Konohagakure
.

Its only known members are renowned ninja:
Konoha's White Fang
 (
木ノ葉の白い牙
,
Konoha no Shiroi Kiba
)
Sakumo
, and his son
Copy Ninja
Kakashi
 (
コピー忍者のカカシ
,
Kopī Ninja no Kakashi
). The latter would later become the Sixth
Hokage
 following the end of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.
 The clan possessed at least one heirloom: the
White Light Chakra Sabre
, which produced white
chakra
 when swung.

Trivia

"Hatake" (
畑
) means "farmland" and perhaps true to that name, their clan symbol resembles a sectioned out piece of farmland.

In Viz's translation of
Chapter 35
, the Hatake clan is mistakenly mentioned.
