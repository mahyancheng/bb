"
Naruto and Hinata
" (
NARUTO・HINATA
) is episode 480 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

A young
Naruto
 walks through
Konoha
, and is ostracised by the villagers. Naruto is hungry, but doesn't have enough money to go to
Ramen Ichiraku
, so he runs home. On his way, he passes by
Sasuke
, who overhears adults talking about Naruto's involvement in the
Fourth Hokage
's death. Naruto sulks by himself at home, and leaves to train in the forest.
 Still hungry, Naruto collects several mushrooms, and catches fish in a nearby stream. As he eats them by a fire, he is joined by
Hiruzen
, unaware he's the Third Hokage. Naruto offers him fish. The two talk over the fire about the world. The next day, Naruto thinks about what Hiruzen told him about the world being much bigger than any one person.

Neji
 trains in
taijutsu
 with his father.
Hizashi
 calls it a day, despite Neji's insistence in continuing training. Neji asks him about his cousin, and Hizashi tells him it's a girl one year younger than Neji. Hizashi begins telling Neji about his role as a
Hyūga
. Neji spars with
Hinata
. Hinata confides in Neji she dislikes training in taijutsu, and he tells her she has an important role as the heiress of the Hyūga. At Hizashi's funeral, Hinata feels for Neji. Hinata wanders off, and ends up meeting Naruto, who walks her home. After Naruto leaves,
Hiashi
 arrives and begins teaching Hinata about the clan.

Trivia

Neji is shown without the
cursed seal
 on his forehead after Hinata's third birthday, while it was explicitly stated in manga and previous anime episodes that he got it when Hinata turned three years old.

Including Part 1, this is the 700th episode of the Naruto anime.
