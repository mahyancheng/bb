Naruto
 creates four
shadow clones
 to assist him for this technique. The clones kick or punch the target into the air, each yelling "U-ZU-MA-KI" ("NA-RU-TO" in some English translations) as they do so as the real Naruto himself leaps off a clone to chase after the target.

While both the target and Naruto himself are airborne, Naruto finishes with a rotating/spinning heel dropper (
回転かかと落とし
,
kaiten kakato otoshi
), sending them back towards the ground as he yells out the rest of the technique's name.

Naruto modelled this manoeuvre after
Sasuke Uchiha
's
Lion Combo
, increasing its lethality by combining the Lion Combo's taijutsu with the shadow clones' ninjutsu.

Trivia

The
Clash of Ninja
 series allows Kakashi to directly copy this technique via his Sharingan.

Also in the
Clash of Ninja
 series, the GameCube titles incorrectly have both Naruto and Kakashi use the Tiger Hand Seal for summoning the shadow clones when using the Naruto Uzumaki Combo. This was eventually corrected in the Wii-sub series.

Later versions of this technique involve multiple shadow clones attacking in a continuous sequence instead of a surrounding-array, which still leads into the upwards kick to prime the heel drop finisher.

In both
Battle Stadium D.O.N.
 and for his Part 1 self in the
Ultimate Ninja Storm
 series, Naruto only uses one clone to start the combination technique instead of at least 4.

In the crossover comic series
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles x Naruto
, Naruto performs a
variation
 of the technique with
Michelangelo
 called
Uzu-Mikey-Angelo Barrage
, without the use of shadow clones.
