Within each division of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, there was a team of
shinobi
 with the express purpose of ensuring that contact is maintained between individuals found throughout the alliance, so that vital information may be relayed both quickly and securely across vast distances. This task is seemingly achieved by working in tandem with the
Intelligence Division
, or more specifically its captain
Inoichi Yamanaka
, whose
telepathy
 makes such communication seemingly possible.
