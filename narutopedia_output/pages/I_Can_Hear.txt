Lyrics

Rōmaji

Arukitsukarete tohō ni kureta

Akarui mirai e' sensei wa iukedo

Dotchi ni aruitara hikari wa sasu ka na?

Toriaezu wakaranaikedo ikōze!

Kirai-goto nanka maji kanbendesu

Itai kurai tsuyoi yatsu o chōdai

Arikitarina mainichi ni hankōdesu

Tagire MIC oretachi no rokku

Kimino koe ga kikoeru

Soredake wa

Riaru-sa hajikero

Kono uta

I can hear you are screaming

I can hear you are screaming

Tsuki ugokasa re

Shōdō no mama ni yoru o kake nda

Can't you see? Can't you see?

Can't you see? My face?

Kotoba janai imadake o kanji tetai

Kimi o kanji tetai

I can hear you are screaming

I can hear you are screaming

Sakebi tsudzukete

Ashita no tobira o kojiakeru nda

Don't worry Don't worry

Don't worry baby

Dareka janai oretachi o shinji tetai

Yume wo shinjite tai

Kanji

歩き疲れて途方に暮れた

「明るい未来へ」先生は言うけど

どっちに歩いたら光は差すかな？

とりあえずわからないけど行こうぜ！

きれいごとなんかマジ勘弁です

痛いくらい強いやつをちょうだい

あリきたりな毎日に反抗です

たぎれMIC 俺たちのrock

君の声が聞こえる

それだけはリアルさ ハジケロ

この歌

I can hear you are screaming

I can hear you are screaming

突き動かされ

衝動のままに夜を駆けんだ

Can't you see? Can't you see?

Can't you see? My face

言葉じゃない 今だけを感じてたい

君を感じてたい

I can hear you are screaming

I can hear you are screaming

叫び続けて

明日のトビラをこじ開けるんだ

Don't worry Don't worry

Don't worry baby

誰かじゃない 俺たちを信じてたい

夢を信じてたい

English

At a loss and tired of walking

"To the bright future"

That's what our teachers said

But where should we walk to go and find this light?

I don't know for the time being, but let's go!

Forgive me for my simplicity

But please give me a challenge to defeat

I'm sick of the ordinary everyday life

Burn up this MIC with our rock n' roll

From here, I can hear your voice

That's the only thing that's real

Just let it go

This song

I can hear you are screaming

I can hear you are screaming

We'll run through the night with our hearts on fire

Can't you see? Can't you see?

Can't you see? My face?

It's not just words, I want to feel just now

I want to feel just now

I can hear you are screaming

I can hear you are screaming

We'll keep on screaming and wrench open the gate to tomorrow

Don't worry Don't worry

Don't worry baby

It's not anybody, but us and our dream

I want to believe the dream

English (Full Version)

Got tired of walking and was at loss

"Head to a bright future" says the teacher but

which way should I walk to see the light shine?

I don't know but in the meantime let's just go

Seriously, give us a break from all those pretty words

Bring out the strong guy

We are sick of these ordinary days

We'll burn the mic with our rock

I can hear your voice

(Wowowowowowowo)

That's the only thing real. Let this song

Burst out

I can hear you are screaming

IwoOw can hear you are screaming

Driven my impulse, I ran through the night

Can't you see?

Can't you see?

Can't you see?　my face

I just want to feel this moment greater than words, I want to feel you

Everything is alright, I'll do it well

In tense moments I'm at my best

I'll aim to where the future shines

Never forgeting this

Go now, beyond lies tomorrow

If I don't hate it then taking action should be OK

A loud shout let it resound, do more rock

Someday make a big jump with all your might

Let me hear more

(Owowowowowo)

Of this song with wishes and hope

Embedded in it

I can hear you are screaming

I can hear you are screaming

We bear the same pain but I fly

Come with me

Ccome with me

ome with me　my friend

You don't smile nor want to do anything,  but you aren't alone

Wonderful...Wonderful...Wonderful...

I can hear you are screaming

I can hear you are screaming

Driven by my impulse, I ran through the night

Can't you see?

an't you see?

can't you see?　my face

I just want to feel this moment greater than words, I want to feel you

I can hear you are screaming

I can hear you are screaming

The door of tomorrow that keeps calling I'll break it open

Don't worry

Don't worry

Don't worry　baby

I want to believe not in anyone else but in ourselves, I want to believe in our dreams
