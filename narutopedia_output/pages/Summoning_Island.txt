The Summoning Island.



The
Summoning Island
 (
口寄せの島
,
Kuchiyose no Shima
) is an island located somewhere east of the
Land of Fire
 and south of the
Land of Lightning
 where research of
summoning
 animals and development of them were done. The
Ultimate Summoning Beast
 was also created there. The lab was located in the mouth of a volcano and on one fateful day,
Honoka
, a
kunoichi
 that the researchers had recruited, was unable to restrain the beast after it had gone berserk killing all of them. Honoka's spirit remained on the island, unable to move on until the delegation from
Konohagakure
 came and helped her defeat the beast completely.
