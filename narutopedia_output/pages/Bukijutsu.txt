A shinobi employing the use of bukijutsu.



A
ninja
's use of
weaponry
 in combat is known as "
bukijutsu
" (
武器術
,
literally meaning:
 Weapon Techniques). All ninja use a weapon at some point in their careers, but not all do so regularly.

Weapons can be just as useful on the battlefield as any other
jutsu
 in a ninja's arsenal, either due to the weapon's design, its special abilities, or the unique way in which a ninja combines it with his or her other skills; ninja frequently coat their weapons with their
chakra
 to alter the weapon's properties, a process called
chakra flow
. Over time, a particular weapon or set of weapons may gain its own fame for one reason or another, as with the
Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths
. Weapons of all types, whether common or rare, are frequently
sealed
 within scrolls or some other flat surface for ease of transport and accessibility in combat.

To be able to create new and powerful weapons makes one prized to one's village, allies, or customers; in the anime, the
Takumi Village
 was once the world's top provider of ninja weaponry.

Subcategories

Some types of weapons are used often enough in
Naruto
 to be considered a specialised discipline within the broader "bukijutsu" classification:

To use a
shuriken
 or a
kunai
, usually as projectile weaponry, is called "
shurikenjutsu
" (
手裏剣術
,
literally meaning:
 sword hidden in the hand techniques). All ninja are taught some amount of shurikenjutsu from a young age, with members of the
Uchiha clan
 being noted specialists. Even those who without any special propensity for shurikenjutsu keep a supply of shuriken and kunai with them for every mission.

Wielding a
sword
 is called "
kenjutsu
" (
剣術
,
literally meaning:
 Sword Technique). It is one of the more common weapons used in
Naruto
, being especially popular amongst ninja of
Kumogakure
 and
Kirigakure
; the latter is even famous for its
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
.

The use of
explosive tags
, whether as traps or as ways to make projectiles deadlier, is similar to the real world "
kayakujutsu
" (
火薬術
,
literally meaning:
 Gunpowder Techniques).
Hanzō
's fighting style makes a heavier use of explosive tags than most ninja, combining them with his
Fire Release
 to create
crippling techniques
.

The use of a staff or
bō
 in close-range combat is called "
bōjutsu
" (
棒術
,
literally meaning:
 Staff Techniques). Members of the
Akimichi clan
 are often seen using a bō in battle. The
Third Hokage
's personal
summon
,
Enma
, can
transform
 the into a large staff, which the Third wields with great skill.

To use a
puppet
 in combat for any variety of reasons requires the
Puppet Technique
, an ability without any real world equivalent. Although ninja from several different villages have been seen manipulating puppets, it is most popular with ninja of
Sunagakure
.

The use of a
war fan
, whether as a blunt weapon or as a type of shield, is similar to the real world "
tessenjutsu
" (
鉄扇術
,
literally meaning:
 Iron-fan Technique). Ninja of
Sunagakure
, such as
Temari
, more often use war fans to facilitate their long-range
wind
-based
ninjutsu
.

The use of a
kusarigama
 is called  "
kusarigamajutsu
" (
鎖鎌術
,
literally meaning:
 Chain Sickle Technique). Only
Hanzō
 has been shown using a kusarigama with any amount of regularity, though
Hidan
's
Triple-Bladed Scythe
 is wielded in a manner similar to kusarigama.

To use a
bow and arrow
 as a long-range weapon is called "
kyūjutsu
" (
弓術
,
literally meaning:
 Bow Technique). Bow and arrows are used very rarely in
Naruto
, and when they are they are typically some sort of
chakra
-based substance that is formed during combat rather than carried into it; examples include
Sasuke Uchiha
's
Susanoo
 and
Kidōmaru
's
Spider War Bow: Terrible Split
.

The use of
highly advanced technology
,
Scientific Ninja Tools
. Some of the Inners in
Kara
 had appeared to had been using or mistaken to be using ninjutsu, but in reality, had their bodies integrated with this technology. The tools either allowed them to
augment
 their bodies or release a
virus
 masked in dark mist.

Trivia

This category of techniques was never named in the
Naruto
 series.
