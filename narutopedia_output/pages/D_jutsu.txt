Dōjutsu
 (
瞳術
,
English TV:
 Visual Jutsu,
literally meaning:
 Pupil Techniques) are ninja abilities that utilise the eyes, a by-product of specific
kekkei genkai
 or
kekkei mōra
. The word refers to both the eyes themselves, which have a number of passive abilities, and any
jutsu
 dependent on the eyes to be performed; the former requires little to no
chakra
 to be used, while the latter varies depending on the technique. Dōjutsu can be transplanted into others, though use of the dōjutsu is typically more limited or taxing for those without a genetic predisposition for it.
 While the user's eyes can be overused and dōjutsu can be prevented from being accessed for a period of time, it doesn't mean the user will be exhausted and they can still use other techniques. Of all the known dōjutsu, the
Byakugan
,
Rinnegan
, and
Sharingan
 are collectively known as the Three Great Dōjutsu (
三大瞳術
,
San Daidōjutsu
,
English TV:
 Three Great Visual Jutsu,
literally meaning:
 Three Great Pupil Techniques).

Inspiration

The concept of dōjutsu may have been inspired by
Futaro Yamada's
 1959 novel,
The Kōga Ninja Scrolls
 (
甲賀忍法帖
,
Kōga Ninpōchō
), which featured two warring clans of ninja that had developed mutations and abilities through selective breeding, with the young heirs to each clan possessing mysterious dōjutsu.

Another possible inspiration for dōjutsu in the series may also be found in the
Journey to the West
 classic's titular character, the Monkey God-King,
Sun Wukong
: After having eaten all of the 'peaches of immortality', the 'pills of longevity' and drunk all of the 'wine of immortality', and then was captured after a long rebellion against Heaven, the Monkey God-King, Sun Wukong, was then sealed into
Lao Tzu's
 Eight Trigram furnace to be burned to ash in order for Lao Tzu to reclaim his pills of longevity. But after 49 days, Sun Wukong broke out--stronger than ever--his body having been refined by the flames instead of being reduced to ash. His eyes had also become a fiery red and golden colour, becoming known as his "
Fiery-eyes golden-gaze
" (
火眼金睛
,
Huǒyǎn-Jīnjīng
); an eye condition that allowed Sun Wukong to now see what's really there just by looking and the ability to see and recognise the real form of evil despite whatever form that it took on — but, likewise, it also gave him a weakness to smoke, fogging his vision.

Trivia






Kagemasa's Magan.



Masashi Kishimoto
 has stated that if a Sharingan user and a Byakugan user were to have a child, their offspring would have one Byakugan and one Sharingan.

When
Kidōmaru
 enters the second stage of his
cursed seal
, the eye on his forehead opens up. This eye seemingly grants him greater accuracy in his attacks as well as what appears to be the ability to see chakra.

In the anime, the movie character Kagemasa has a dōjutsu called the Magan, which grants him the ability to paralyse individuals through sight alone. This ability was only displayed in the on-screen movie.
