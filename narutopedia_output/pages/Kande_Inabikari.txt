Kawaki & Himawari Academy Arc

Kande attended the Academy opening ceremony as part of a new class. His classroom was put under the care of new teacher
Hana Kaka
. His class included many children of famous people, including the daughter of an
acting

duo
, the daughter of the
Seventh Hokage
, and
Kae Yukiwari
, the princess of the
Land of Bamboo
. The class also included
Kawaki
, a noticeably older student.






Kande using Lightning Release to start a fire.



Later, Kande was placed on a practice team with
Konashi Nerikiri
 and
Mimi Inuzuka
 as part of a series of competitions to improve teamwork skills. While making lunch, Kande used his Lighting Release to start a fire for cooking.

When the class had to put on a play about the
Sannin
, Kande was cast as
Gamabunta
. After Eiki's struggle with Kawaki damaged the set, Kande joined in the repair efforts.

The day of the festival, Kande helped his classmates set up the stands and decorations. When the festival received a terrorist threat, he stayed inside. Later, following Hana being hospitalised from the terrorist attack, Kande joined his class in welcoming back their teacher. To make up for the festival being cancelled, Hana arranged for the class to undergo survival training on an uninhabited island. However,
Kikuchiyo
 was injured and their food supplies vanished, stoking fear about a rumour of killer missing-nin settling on the island. Everyone formed groups to scavenge food, and later to look for Neon's damaged drone. By night, everyone enjoyed their food.






Kande and his classmates decide to rescue Kae.



Attracted by an explosion, the class encountered Kawaki and Himawari, who revealed that Hana, actually an assassin, had killed Kae. Himawari pointed out that her actions made more sense if Hana wanted to keep Kae as a hostage. Working together, the students tracked Kae and Hana to a cave. Finding the situation too dangerous for the students, Kawaki revealed himself as a shinobi, and credited them for helping find Kae. Eiki still believed there was something they could do, leading them to the docks, hoping to get word of the situation out. They came across Sai, who came to the island with Team 25 after discovering Hana's Land of Bamboo background. Upon finding Hana defeated, her teacher personality struggled against the assassin one, eventually prevailing with the encouragement of her students and regaining control. As Kae had to return home, the class finally put on the Sannin play, and later saw her off at the train station.
