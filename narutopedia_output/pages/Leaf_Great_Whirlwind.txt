While spinning, the user delivers a series of kicks. As they spin faster, they are lifted from the ground, allowing them to kick different areas of their target: first a low kick, then a middle kick, then a high kick. These are finished off with a heel drop. As a result of the spinning, targets cannot see the incoming kicks until just before they're struck.
