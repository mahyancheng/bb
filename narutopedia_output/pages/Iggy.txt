 (
イギー
,
Igī
) is a citizen of the
Land of Water
.

Background

During his childhood, Iggy made one friend with a boy named
Banna
 because the latter was being picked on due to his appearance.

Personality

Iggy seemed to be a mean, self-centred and somewhat cruel individual readily attack his friend when he got caught by the
Konoha
 shinobi. He is also somewhat of a coward, having to wrestle greatly with the decision to save his best friend after he was captured even though he bragged to others that he was a great shinobi.

Appearance

Iggy has a short, green hair, brown eyes and a pointed chin. His hair also framed the sides of his face in a similar manner to sideburns. He usually wears a long-sleeved blue outfit with a flap on the front and the back and gold trimmings, a pair of white gloves, sandals, baggy pants that was tapered off by bandages and a hat giving him the overall look of a
bellhop

forehead protector
 around his head and carried a shuriken holster.

Abilities

Though not much is known of his abilities, he was seemingly proficient enough in
kenjutsu
 to wield one in battle. He has also shown some aptitude at ambush tactics, being able to successfully track and use kunai with
explosive tags
 attached against targets and even managed to extract Banna safely from his captors.
