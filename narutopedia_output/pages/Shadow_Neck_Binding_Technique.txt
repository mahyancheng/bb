This is a variation of the
Shadow Imitation Technique
, designed for offensive purposes.
 The user extends their shadow along a target's body, which, because the shadow has physical properties, the target can feel.
 There, the shadow can be used for restraint, replacing or adding to the binding of the Shadow Imitation;
 the closer the user is to their target, the stronger this binding becomes.
 Like the Shadow Imitation, the Shadow–Neck Binding requires a great deal of
chakra
 to maintain, making it weaker over extended periods of time.
 For this reason, it is most effective when immediately used to strangle a target, hence the name.

The Shadow–Neck Binding's ability to apply pressure to a body gives the user some additional options. If the user falls victim to a
genjutsu
, they can use their shadow to break their own finger, freeing themselves from the genjutsu's influence.
 In
The Last: Naruto the Movie
,
Shikamaru Nara
 uses the Shadow–Neck Binding to control the
Ōtsutsuki clan
's
puppet
, forcing them to fight among themselves.

Trivia

Its full name is "Leaf Secret: Shadow–Neck Binding Technique" (
木ノ葉秘伝・影首縛りの術
,
Konoha Hiden: Kage–Kubishibari no Jutsu
,
literally meaning:
 Tree Leaf Secret: Shadow–Neck Binding Technique).

In the anime, it was shown that this technique can be manipulated in a similar manner to the
Shadow Sewing Technique
.

The technique appears in
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm
 as Shikamaru's ultimate technique. However, rather than strangling the opponent, it binds them to a nearby rock and then tightly squeezes them, destroying the rock and crushing the opponent.

In
Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2
, using this technique on multiple opponents at once gives it the name "Shadow Sinking Technique".
