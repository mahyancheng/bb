As Tsuzura continued his efforts to help Yuki become better adjusted to living in the wilderness, they were approached by
Boruto Uzumaki
. He offered to help Tsuzura train Yuki. As the two grew closer, Tsuzura had Yuki deliver messages to Boruto. Later, when
Mozu
 learned of Tsuzura's interests that didn't help with business, she decided to take Yuki away from Tsuzura. Mozu decided to sell Yuki to a taxidermist, prompting Tsuzura to try escaping with her. She sent the security officer after them, but relented after
Sasuke
 offered his Senri Hawk in exchange for Yuki and Tsuzura. The hawk had been put under a
genjutsu
, destroying the compound and freeing the animals after they left. When Mozu demanded the hawk back, Tsuzura stood up to her. Yuki remained with Tsuzura, who Sasuke left in
Maruta
's care to become his apprentice.

Trivia

Tsuzura named her for her colouring, 雪 (
yuki
