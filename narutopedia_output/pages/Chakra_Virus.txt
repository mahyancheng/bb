The
Chakra Virus
 (
チャクラウイルス
,
chakura uirusu
) is a very dangerous and rare virus that affects a person's ability to mould
chakra
, turning their own chakra into fever. For this reason,
shinobi
 are very afraid of it. A village that
Naruto
 visited after the
Konoha Crush
 was infected by this virus, so Naruto was considered infected too. This was later discovered to be incorrect.

History

The virus was once prominent during the
Third Shinobi World War
. However, once the war was over, it became less deadly throughout the years before making a resurgence and evolving again, killing hundreds more. Following the events of the Konoha Crush, Konoha worked overtime to develop a vaccine to counteract the new form of the chakra virus while they were eliminating
Akatsuki
 members in the
Land of Fire
.
