The Ame Orphans' hideout.



The
Ame Orphans' hideout
 is a small building in a wide open area in the same country as
Amegakure
.
Jiraiya
 lived here with the
Ame Orphans
 while training them for three years and they maintained it as their base of operations for several years after he left.

Inside — the hideout was divided in two by a curtain with sinks up the left hand side. In the upper area was a small shelf to the right side with
three plaques with pictures of frogs
 on them and one on the opposite side.

When
Konan
 died, one of her sheets of paper stained with her blood floated to the hideout, fulfilling the orphans' promise of one day returning together. For unknown reasons, Jiraiya's hop-in card was flipped to the red side, even though he left them years before it was abandoned. This would also play a key role in their promise as they promised to invite Jiraiya to their old hideout to celebrate a job well-done.
