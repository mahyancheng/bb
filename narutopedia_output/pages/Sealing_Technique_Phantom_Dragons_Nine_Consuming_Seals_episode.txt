 anime.

Synopsis

Deidara
 and
Sasori
 arrive at the
Akatsuki
 hideout. The
Akatsuki leader
 gathers the other members using an
astral projection technique
, and they begin a
three-day long technique
 to extract the
One-Tailed Shukaku
 from
Gaara
 and seal it in a
giant statue
. The leader orders
Zetsu
 to use his physical body to guard the entrance to the hideout while they begin extracting Shukaku.

As she is doing her work in her office, one of
Tsunade
's coffee mugs crack, which she considers a bad omen. After finding out that she has won the lottery, she considers that an even worse omen and has
Shizune
 locate
Team Guy
, who have just returned from another mission. Tsunade and Shizune send them to
Sunagakure
 to provide backup to
Team Kakashi
. Despite Suna being three days away from
Konoha
,
Guy
 is confident that his team will get there in one day, while
Lee
 claims they could make the trip in half a day.

In Sunagakure,
Chiyo
 and
Ebizo
 come out of retirement and return to the village, in order for Chiyo to assess
Kankurō
's wounds. Despite attempting a few antidotes, she is unable to cure Kankurō of his ailment and admits that the only person who may be able to heal him is the Slug Princess, Tsunade of Konohagakure.
Baki
 tells her that Tsunade is now
Hokage
 of Konoha, and that she cannot drop everything and come to Suna, adding that even if she did, Konoha was three days away while Kankurō has only a day to live. Despite this, he tells Chiyo that they have sent word to Konoha asking for their help. Chiyo is disgusted, claiming that Suna is not a prosperous nation due to their reliance and dependence on neighbouring lands like Konoha, and states that if Suna taught and prepared their shinobi properly, there would be no need to ask another village for their help. She finds the mere idea pathetic, and leaves the room to go rest outside.

Meanwhile,
Naruto
,
Kakashi
,
Temari
 and
Sakura
 are on the way to Suna, but get delayed by a sandstorm. Once the storm subsides, they rush to the village, where the four are briefed by Suna shinobi regarding Kankurō's status. Sakura tells Temari not to worry as she will check up on Kankurō. As they reach the hospital, Sakura and Temari rush in to Kankurō's side, while Chiyo gasps as she spots Kakashi, whom she believes is the infamous White Fang of Konoha. Rushing at Kakashi, she tells him to defend himself or prepare for death.
