The
Mission Assignment Desk
 (
任務受付
,
Ninmu Uketsuke
) is located within the
Ninja Academy
 where
shinobi
 go to in order to receive most of their
missions
 from the
Hokage
. The Mission Assignment Desk is located within a huge, wide-open space with six windows and high ceilings with two stick-like lights. The ceiling also has the kanji for the word "shinobi" (
忍
,
shinobi
) printed on it. There is a long table where the Hokage and other ninja sit when distributing the missions. On the front of the desk, there is a white banner with the kanji that says "mission assignment this way" (
任務受付はこちらまで
,
ninmu uketsuke wa kochira made
) and at the top is another banner that says "everybody, do your best" (
皆さんガンバ
,
minna-san ganba
). The Mission Assignment Desk was first seen when
Team 7
 completed their mission to capture the cat,
Tora
, for the
Fire Daimyō
's wife,
Madam Shijimi
.

In the anime, during the New Era, the Mission Assignment Desk has been changed to a simple one in the lobby; it is no longer the large, ornate room. The clerk at the desk reads off missions that a team has been called in for, giving the team leader the scroll containing mission details. Missions can be requested here as well.

Trivia

In the anime, the Mission Assignment Desk rarely appears, as the ninja typically are summoned to the Hokage's office instead to be debriefed.
