A
tantō
 (
短刀
) is simply a small
katana
. Several
chūnin
,
medical-nin
, and
shinobi
 of
Konohagakure
 wear them strapped to their lower backs when going into battle. The version
Root
 uses is straight and double-edged with no tip, meant only for cutting and defence. They carry the tantō vertically on the back, specifically behind the shoulder;
Sai
 is one of the notable ones that uses the tantō, which he carries on his back behind the right shoulder. Sakumo — and Kakashi Hatake after inheriting it — carried a special tantō, known as the
White Light Chakra Sabre
. Gamabunta and Gamakichi also carry these, albeit
gigantic versions
 that fit their size.
