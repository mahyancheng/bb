 anime.

Synopsis

When
Mitsuki
 leaves
Konoha
, he meets with
Sekiei
,
Kokuyō
, and
Kirara
. Mitsuki asks about the
Akuta
 with them and if meeting their creator would answer his question about one's will, and Kokuyō explains their provenance.
Uō
 and
Saō
 find them out, and Mitsuki attacks them so the others wouldn't kill them, faking their deaths, and leaving a snake behind with a message for
Boruto
. In the present, Mitsuki coaches Sekiei in human mannerisms while on their way to the
Land of Earth
. Sekiei's body begins to break down, so Kokuyō leaves to get help, leaving Mitsuki to look after Sekiei.
Kurotsuchi
 visits her grandfather, who is under
Akatsuchi
's care.
Kontsuchi
 asks her how
Ōnoki
 is, but Kurotsuchi says he's in no condition to answer the questions she wants to ask. While discussing who should investigate the matter Naruto warned her about, Kurotsuchi's group is attacked by
Kū
 and
Kakō
, who demand she step down from her position as
Tsuchikage
. As she attacks him, Kurotsuchi seemingly recognises Kū and is shocked. As Sekiei's health deteriorates, Mitsuki gives him flowers to cheer him up.
 Mitsuki explains eating and brushing one's teeth to Sekiei, and the two end up talking about their creators,
Orochimaru
 and Kū. They also discuss death, wondering what it would take for Mitsuki to cry. Sekiei ambushes Mitsuki, putting an explosive centipede around his neck, and questions him about faking the death of the Konoha shinobi and the snake he left behind. Mitsuki explains it was a message telling Boruto he left by his own volition, and not to look for him. Sekiei asks more about Boruto, who still believed Mitsuki was his friend, and how Mitsuki feels about him. Mitsuki explains how Boruto is his sun, how close friends share secrets, and that he's unsure whether this feeling is genuine or was created by someone else. Mitsuki helps Sekiei, and Kokuyō returns with Kakō and Kirara, who injects Sekiei with something that stabilises him. They find it suspicious Sekiei's health failed around Mitsuki, and want to knock him unconscious before continuing. Mitsuki says he agreed to go with them, but not with being captured. Sekiei wakes up and vouches for Mitsuki, comparing his loneliness to theirs, and secretly telling Mitsuki they share a secret now, making them close friends. In
Iwagakure
, Kurotsuchi is held captive while Kū creates more Akuta. The Konoha genin look over an unconscious Boruto.
