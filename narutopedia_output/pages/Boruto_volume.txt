 manga.

Chapter 1

"
Boruto
" (
ボルト
,
Boruto
)

Three years after
Boruto
 and
Sasuke
 left
Konohagakure
,
Sarada
 once again tries to speak on Boruto's behalf to
Shikamaru
, now the Eighth
Hokage
. He is resolute that Boruto crossed the line after being given many chances, and
Konohamaru
, now Shikamaru's attendant, adds they have
Ada
's testimony with her
Senrigan
. Shikamaru adds that even if he rescinded kill orders for Boruto, many villagers would still hate him for killing
Naruto
, and tells her to return to her missions. She mouths off to him, and he expresses concern for her shinobi career, saying she might stay a
genin
 forever. She asks if that's because Sasuke is a traitor as well, but he denies it. She points out Naruto's own history of bringing back Sasuke, a
missing-nin
, and becoming
Hokage
 while still a genin, declaring he's her role model, not Shikamaru.
Kawaki
 visits the
imprisoned
 Naruto and
Hinata
. Sarada discusses her meeting and outburst with
Sumire
, who recapitulates how they're the ones deemed weird, remembering true history. While some inconsistencies bothered others and even Shikamaru at first, like Kawaki's body being modified by
Kara
 despite supposedly being born and raised in Konoha, and
Momoshiki
's absence in Kawaki,
Omnipotence
 slowly dissipated these concerns over the years.
 They wonder how they could go against such an ability, and visit Ada and
Daemon
. Daemon deems it an unwinnable game, and Ada claims to have started to understand how it worked. She summarises what Omnipotence is and how it works. She doesn't know if there's a way to reverse it, but thinks it'll be useless to try convincing those affected. Sarada considers the truth reasonable enough to explain to others, but Ada points out that from everyone else's perspectives, hers and Sumire's memories are the ones that come across as altered. Ada feels it would be more practical to rewrite new memories, which comes with its own risks. She is still puzzled by their retention of their memories when they're not
Ōtsutsuki
, raising the question if they're actually entranced by her. Recalling Shikamaru's warning not to be found out, specially by Daemon, they play it off as putting an effort to hide their feelings. Daemon continues to watch them.
Mitsuki
 checks on Kawaki, who is bothered by Mitsuki's
killing intent
. He believes Boruto still wants to kill Kawaki, and has likely developed the ability to
erase his chakra
 signature. Kawaki reminds him that he can still sense Boruto. He is fine with Mitsuki wanting to protect him, but asks him not to follow him around like a pervert. Kawaki is notified that some
Claw Marks
 were discovered and flies off, leaving Mitsuki to mutter to himself that Kawaki is his sun.
Himawari
 spars with
Chōchō
. They're joined by
Shikadai
 and
Inojin
, who praise Himawari's performance. She confesses she doesn't want to get strong just for the sake of it, but because she wants to help Boruto. What everyone says about him doesn't match what she remembers, and she doesn't believe he'd kill her father, recalling him protecting them before. She feels there must be an explanation, which means Boruto is in deep trouble, and believes her father is still alive. Kawaki
shrinks
 the newly discovered Claw Mark. The Konoha shinobi wonder why
Code
 never attacks despite coming so close, and wonder if he's prioritising Boruto, who he has a grudge against and is away from the village. Kawaki discovers a Claw Mark on one of their necks, getting rid of it. He notifies Shikamaru, and wants to gather everyone who has investigated to check them for marks and shrink any they find.
Claw Grime
 emerge from shinobi around the village and attack. The unknown chakra is detected. Shikamaru orders Konohamaru to coordinate evacuation, and ponders why Code would attack now. Kawaki and Sarada fight the grime, with more arriving through each other's Claw Marks. Code emerges and greets Sarada, telling her he's looking for Boruto. She tells him Boruto left three years ago, but he knows that, having chased him for almost two years. Now, he wants to draw Boruto to him by attacking his friends in Konoha. Boruto arrives, stepping on Code's face, telling him that his attitude is why girls are creeped out by him. Kawaki senses him, as do the
sensors
, who notify Shikamaru. Ada begins watching with her Senrigan. Shikamaru prioritises fighting Code, but wants everyone on alert to find out Boruto's plan. Boruto faces off against Code, while Kawaki is more interested in Boruto's resurgence.

Chapter 2

"
Tree
" (
木
,
Ki
)

Code
 is surprised by how fast
Boruto
 reappeared, regretting not attacking
Konoha
 sooner. Boruto threatens him to withdraw the
Claw Grime
, Code incredulous at that, believing it to be a bluff, recalling how Boruto fled two years prior. Boruto remains resolute, assuring Code he'll lose more than just his left eye this time. Boruto asks
Sarada
 to help the rest of the civilians, promising to talk later.
Shikadai

paralyses
 three grimes for
Chōchō
 to
attack
. Another one
emerges
 behind her, but
Inojin
 catches it, arriving on an
ink bird
 with
Himawari
. The grime slashes the bird's left wing with its tail, causing it to lose balance and toss Himawari off, the grime attempting to bite her.
Kawaki
 arrives flying, yelling at Inojin and Himawari to get out of the way, attacking the grime. Inojin catches Himawari. On the ground, the grime opens a
Rinnegan
, interested in Kawaki. Himawari thanks Kawaki, who berates her for calling him big brother despite his requests not to. Shikadai finds the grime stronger than the rest. It jumps between grimes to slam Kawaki at the ground from behind, referring to him as an
Ōtsutsuki
.
 Shikadai paralyses it, and Kawaki activates his
Kāma
, angry at the Ōtsutsuki appellation and blasts the grime. Shikadai is concerned as more grime arrive, Kawaki determined to destroy them no matter their numbers. Boruto effortlessly
cuts down
 six grimes surrounding him, somewhat validating his threat in Code's eyes. He is unconcerned with the grimes, their numbers so great, and considering them mere tools. Boruto doesn't think Code understands the horrors of the
Ten-Tails
. Sarada defeats more grimes with
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
 and
Chidori
. Other Konoha shinobi wonder if she's really a
genin
, but she thinks ranks don't matter. Another grime attacks her from behind, attempting to bite her, but
Soegi
 blocks it, being bitten instead. The grime turns into a tree, growing around and consuming Soegi. The same happens with another bitten shinobi. Code is aware that the Ten-Tails attempt to bite anyone on instinct, until they eat an Ōtsutsuki to turn into a
God Tree
. Boruto adds that Code's meddling with them changed that, telling him to scrap them while he can still control them, otherwise the worst possible future will come for everyone. Code is undeterred, as his goal lies beyond the future of a dead planet through the consumption of a chakra fruit. Boruto once again offers to spare Code in exchange for guiding him to where the Ten-Tails main body is. He believes that killing Code is easy, and is offering him a chance not to die in vain. Code finds Boruto to be insane, certain he's the one who'll die. Boruto prepares to attack. Code thinks he recognises Boruto's
Rasengan
, finding him a one-trick pony, but the swirling begins to
envelop
 Boruto instead of just forming in his hand.

Chapter 3

"
Uzuhiko
" (
渦彦
,
Uzuhiko
)

Code
 wonders if
Boruto
's new
Rasengan
 is his
vanishing one
, but discards the possibility. He uses
Claw Marks
 to strike him from behind. Boruto dodges it, Code grabs him by the wrist, and Boruto blocks Code's other hand with his sword. Code thinks Boruto can't hit him, but Boruto reveals his technique is already affecting him. The swirling begins enveloping Code, Boruto asks him again where the
Ten-Tails
 is, threatening to kill him. Code attempts to strike him, but can't land a hit, finding Boruto's movements to be beyond dodging, also ruling out
clones
 and
genjutsu
. Boruto lands his
Rasengan: "Uzuhiko"
.
Watching
,
Ada
 is unimpressed by Boruto's jutsu, but
Daemon
 realises it makes use of planetary spin, considering it nifty. Code tries to stand, but falls down due to vertigo. Boruto explains his jutsu, considering it the planet's counterattack, the damage never stopping as long as the planet continues spinning. Boruto can rescind the effects if Code takes him to the Ten-Tails.
Kawaki
 attacks Boruto, arriving with
Team 10
 and
Himawari
.

Shikadai
 asks what Boruto is doing, and Boruto tells him not to interrupt his attempt to make a deal. Code attempts to escape, but Kawaki
shrinks
 the Claw Marks.
Shikamaru
 asks for a report, Kawaki tells he has dealt with the last of Code's marks, cutting off his escape, and can likely kill him on account of how drained he is against Boruto. Kawaki antagonises Boruto, giving Code an opening to call forth a
Claw Grime
 with the mark on his face and escape through it. Shikamaru gives to order to kill every grime.
Sarada
 and another shinobi check on the tree that grew around
Soegi
, considering it a defective
God Tree
, and determine that Soegi is still alive. Kawaki mocks Boruto's Uchiha-like outfit. Boruto is glad that Himawari looks well. Kawaki thinks Boruto came home to die, and while dying in Konoha doesn't sound bad to him, Boruto still has things to do. A hidden
toad
 in his collar reports to Boruto that Code returned to his base. Code stumbles past a tree with
Bug
 before arriving at the pen, with an emaciated Ten-Tails. A toad Boruto planted on Code reports the Ten-Tails' presence to Boruto.

Chapter 4

"
The Awakening
" (
覚醒
,
Kakusei
)

Code
 recalls
Boruto
's warnings about the
Claw Grime
, dismissing it as their only instinct is to devour others. The
toad
 on Boruto hurries him, who replies he's not as skilled as his
grandfather
.
Kawaki
 notices Boruto talking, but not the toad. Boruto teleports to Code's location with the
Flying Thunder God Technique
, surprising him. In the time it takes for Boruto to walk towards the pen, the
Ten-Tails
 has vanished. The toad planted on Code is puzzled, considering him incapable of taking such an action at the moment. Boruto notices a Claw Grime tree nearby, and
a Grime
 who Code mistakes for
Bug
 shows up. Boruto explains that what's in front of them is a
God Tree
. It attacks Boruto, referring to him as an
Ōtsutsuki
, asking if he came to offer himself to be devoured. Boruto repels it with
Lightning Release
, and it changes its arm into a mouth to eat him. Boruto teleports back to Code's side, who demands an explanation as he falls down. Boruto rescinds the effects of the
Rasengan: "Uzuhiko"
, telling him to prepare for an attack. He explains that everyone turned into a tree has become one such God Tree.

Another God Tree
 shows up, floating above them, explaining that thanks to Code's interference, they have developed self-awareness. Another God Tree,
resembling a harlequin
, shows up, berating Code for always ending up being used by someone else. The toad on Boruto advises him to retreat. Boruto notices another God Tree. Kawaki reports the specifics of the encounter with Code and Boruto to
Shikamaru
, such as that Boruto seemed to be chasing Code. Kawaki suspects that someone in the
Konoha Barrier Team
 is covertly aiding Boruto. Shikamaru dismisses the idea, as all those communications are monitored.
Sarada
 arrives, finding the idea ridiculous, stating that Boruto drove Code away, telling them to confirm it with
Ada
. Kawaki tells her that his motives don't matter, and that Boruto should be killed on account of being an Ōtsutsuki, which Sarada points out also applies to him. Kawaki reiterates that he's an Ōtsutsuki who kills other Ōtsutsuki, perfectly willing to die after the job is done. Sarada assures him she won't let him have his way with
Konoha
. Shikamaru tells them to stop, and asks about the trees. Sarada explains the victims are still alive, and from the conversation with Code, Boruto knows something about them. She clarifies that since Boruto and Code are hostile to each other, and Code is hostile to Konoha, they should ally with Boruto against him. Despite the toad's advise to retreat, Boruto prepares to fight, fending off an attack from a
Sasuke God Tree
. It and Boruto clash
Chidori
 and
Rasengan
. The Bug God Tree attacks, holding Boruto's
sword
 in place, and the harlequin one immobilises him with
Earth Release
. Boruto appeals to Code's self-preservation, as the God Tree's will kill him as well, but he abandons Boruto, pointing out they'll eat him without Code having to do anything, which works in his favour. Boruto escapes with the Flying Thunder God Technique. The flying God Tree considers Boruto lucky, as their nascent curiosity currently outweighs their devouring instinct, but is certain Boruto can't escape his fate. Boruto rests against a tree, and
Koji Kashin
 admonishes him for his rashness. Boruto apologises that
Sasuke
, stuck in the tree, will have to wait a bit longer.
