 cry for failing once again to retrieve

Sai
 visits the library to learn about how to make friends. After reading about nicknames, Sai tries to put the concept into practice by calling
Sakura
 "ugly". He and
Naruto
, who tries to keep Sakura at bay, are injured in her wrath. The three meet with
Kakashi
 in the hospital and tell them about their encounter with
Sasuke
. Because Sasuke has become so much stronger than them, Naruto worries that they will only fail again the next time they try to retrieve him. Kakashi replies that Naruto will merely need to get stronger, and proposes a training method that only Naruto can undertake.

 says that

 will need to create a new technique, something he will be able to do in a very short period of time thanks to the training regiment Kakashi has come up with. Before Kakashi can elaborate they are interrupted by
Team 10
, who offers to take
Team 7
 out to lunch. Kakashi and
Asuma
 stay behind while the others go out to mingle.
Sai
 tries once again to use nicknames to make friends. He begins to call
Chōji
 fat, but is advised against it by
Naruto
. Turning his attention to
Ino
, and remembering that
Sakura
 did not like hearing how she actually appeared, Sai concludes that women prefer hearing the opposite of what is true. He therefore calls Ino "beautiful". Sakura becomes angry, having expected him to insult Ino. Elsewhere,
Akatsuki
 members
Hidan
 and
Kakuzu
 attack
Yugito Nii
.

 and attacks them, but they are not concerned. In

,
Asuma
 begins to speak with
Kakashi
 about something when they are interrupted by
Kurenai
. Asuma leaves with her, saying he'll talk to Kakashi later. Hidan and Kakuzu manage to defeat Yugito, though quickly bicker over why it took so long to do so. They then prepare to go to the

,
Kakashi
 explains to
Naruto
 that creating a new technique requires combining
nature transformation
 and
shape transformation
, concepts that Naruto pretends to understand.
Asuma
 also visits his father's, the

bounty station
.

Special Training!!
" (
特別な修業!!

Tokubetsuna Shugyō!!

Kakashi
 explains that, although combining
shape transformation
 and
nature transformation
 usually takes years, Naruto will be able to do so in a fraction of the time by training with
shadow clones
. Kakashi then demonstrates how shadow clones transfer what they learn during their existence back to the originator when they disperse. Having never noticed this before, Naruto asks if training with hundreds of clones to learn things a hundred times faster is how Kakashi became so strong. Kakashi replies that only Naruto can do this sort of training because he has access to the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
's
chakra
.
Yamato
 joins them to help Naruto keep the fox in control. Before Naruto can start on his new technique, they must first determine his nature affinity; it is
Wind Release
.

 and

 explain the different

 to
Naruto
 and how his nature,
Wind Release
, has the greatest offensive capabilities. In order to master wind, Naruto and hundreds of
shadow clones
 must learn how to slice leaves with
chakra
, something they slowly begin to progress with. Meanwhile,
Asuma
 plays
shōgi
 with
Shikamaru
 and they begin relating the various pieces to positions within
Konoha
. After Asuma makes an uncharacteristic move, sacrificing a knight to protect the king, Shikamaru suggests that the knight represents ninja like them while the king represent the
Hokage
. Asuma tells him that he has the identity of the king wrong, and that he'll learn someday.

Konoha
, Naruto makes steady progress with his
Wind Release
 training. He nevertheless asks if there is someone else in Konoha who can use wind and could give him pointers. Kakashi directs him to
Asuma
. Asuma explains to one of Naruto's
shadow clones
 that wind has great piercing potential. Naruto suggests that ordinary weapons would be better for such a purpose, so Asuma demonstrates how superior wind is to every other possible weapon. The clone disperses and passes what it has learned to the others. Meanwhile, word reaches
Tsunade
 of
Akatsuki
's attack on the
Fire Temple
. She orders the
Twenty Platoons

,
Naruto
 was finally able to cut a leaf in two, completing the first phase of his
Wind Release
 training. For the second step, Naruto must use wind to halt the flow of a waterfall that
Yamato
 created. Meanwhile,

As
Asuma
 and his team depart for the
Fire Temple
, they take a detour passed
Kurenai
's apartment, who sees them go. Meanwhile,
Naruto
 and his small group of
shadow clones
 are unable to affect the waterfall they are training with. Naruto says he needs to use more shadow clones and thus a larger waterfall if he is to make any progress, but
Kakashi
 advises against it. Naruto insists that he needs to catch up to
Sasuke
, so Kakashi instructs
Yamato
 to make the waterfall bigger. Naruto trains through the night, motivated by Sasuke, and is eventually able to stop the waterfall with his
Wind Release
.
