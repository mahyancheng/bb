Chapter 648

"
A Shinobi's Dream…!!
" (
忍の夢…!!
,
Shinobi no Yume…!!
)

With renewed determination and a chakra boost from
Yin
-
Kurama
,
Naruto
 heads back into battle alongside
Sasuke
 — who, not to be outdone, has
Jūgo
 use the
Sage Transformation
 on his
Susanoo
 to imbue it with
natural energy
, creating the
Cursed Seal of Heaven
 markings on Sasuke's Susanoo. Ready for action, the two young men plunge back into battle against
Obito
, who took note of how time and time again Naruto would pick himself up from the rut of despair. With this,
Orochimaru
 reflects on how Sasuke seemingly had the potential to surpass even
Madara Uchiha
 himself, while
Tobirama
 notes that Naruto was in a lot of ways like his brother
Hashirama
: faults and all. With the
shinobi
 still somewhat doubting themselves and contemplating waiting for directives from the current
Kage
, Hashirama
shares
 with them all his memories of the
first summit
 of the five Kage.
 How the meeting unfolded is revealed to all; what rings home for them all, is Hashirama's wish for all shinobi to be united. With this, Hashirama rallies the troops to amass their worries, their resolve, their sorrows and strength in order to fight. Ultimately, Hashirama's wish for the future is answered by the appearance of the five current Kage to the battlefield, all standing as a united front.

Chapter 649

"
A Shinobi's Will
" (
忍の意志
,
Shinobi no Ishi
)

Dispersing across the battlefield as soon as they arrive, the five current
Kage
 intend to continue boosting the
Allied Shinobi Forces
' morale as this was no battle they could afford to lose. As
Sasuke
 and
Naruto
 continue to clash with
Obito
, who somehow manages to keep them at bay,
Shikamaru
's treatment progresses slowly, though
Sakura
 is determined to not let him die. Even as they fought, Naruto's Version 1 chakra begins to form around Shikamaru — something
Ino
 later notes was being done by Naruto subconsciously as an extension of his will to protect his friends. Regaining some strength, Shikamaru's memories and feelings are transmitted via Ino's
Mind Body Transmission Technique
, revealing his own will to be an advisor to Naruto when he takes on the mantle of
Hokage
 as he sits up.
 As relief spreads throughout the
Konoha 11
 — none more so than
Chōji
 —
Tsunade
 arrives at their location and expedites Shikamaru's recovery, commending her student for having done so well. Meanwhile, within
Kamui's Dimension
, a battered but recovering
Kakashi
 tends to his wounds, noting that he was almost set to return to the battlefield. After speaking briefly with her
grandfather
, Tsunade,
A
,
Gaara
,
Mei
, and
Ōnoki
 all rally the troops across the battlefield before Hashirama gives the final battle cry to the resolute army.

Chapter 650

"
I Will Sleep
" (
眠るのは
,
Nemuru no Wa
)

As the five
Kage
, their various
shinobi
 factions, along with
Mifune
 and his
samurai
 move out to destroy the
Ten-Tails
 while in its tree form,
Tobirama
 asks
Minato
 to let him use the connection between him and Naruto's chakra to help the shinobi with the
Flying Thunder God Technique
 by teleporting them out of harm's way. Meanwhile,
Hiruzen
 asks
Orochimaru
 if he is only going to watch the battle, to which Orochimaru replies that though he is not interested in the fight, he will still lend a hand because Obito's "
dream
" would mean the abandoning of his experiments. Orochimaru then
attacks
 a part of the tree and declares that for a while, they will reminiscence of the time when they were student and teacher, as Hiruzen destroys the limbs with
Enma
's adamantine form.
 Elsewhere,
Tsunade
 tells
Sakura
 that they can summon nearly one tenth of
Katsuyu
's whole body from the
Shikkotsu Forest
 to heal the forces if they use their
seals
 together. Tsunade informs everyone of Katsuyu's arrival and their intentions
via

Ino
 and the shinobi stand on a dissolved Katsuyu in order to recover. All the while,
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 are still fighting
Obito
, who easily evades all of their attacks with his new-found speed. This created a problem for the duo, though later, Naruto was able to
sense
 Obito, while Sasuke tries to follow him with his
Mangekyō Sharingan
. Obito declares that it's almost time to sleep and fall into dreams, as the flower almost blooms.
Kakashi
, in
Kamui's Dimension
, thinks that Obito still has the
Will of Fire
, though it is overshadowed by his hatred, and now he is able to realise this Will after fighting Naruto. Back in the real world, Obito attacks Naruto and Sasuke, forcing them out of their
Sage Tailed Beast Mode
 and
cursed seal
-enhanced complete
Susanoo
 respectively. As Naruto begins to stand up, Obito chides Naruto while demanding to know why he still stood to fight. But Naruto tells him that he will not change, as never going back on his word is his
nindō
. Both Naruto and Sasuke go in their Tailed Beast Mode and Susanoo once again. Sasuke calls out to finish the battle for once and all, while Naruto says that he will sleep tomorrow and dream on his own as their two forms combine.

Chapter 651

"
What Is Filled
" (
埋めたもの
,
Umeta Mono
)

As
Sasuke
's
Susanoo
 equips itself onto
Naruto
's
senjutsu
-enhanced
Tailed Beast Mode
 mantle, combining the two young men's abilities, much to their surprise,
Kakashi
 — who is still in
Kamui's dimension
 — is able to both see and hear what is going on via the link shared between his and
Obito
's
Sharingan
. Readying himself for one last all-out counter-attack, Obito
manifests
 a gigantic shield and the
Sage of the Six Paths
'
legendary holy weapon
, the latter of which he commented was used to shape the first world, would now destroy the one he considered to be fake.
 Creating nine
Rasengan
 in
Kurama
's tails, Naruto
contacts
 his comrades from the
Konoha 11
 and
Sai
 to join the fray. As they jump directly into Kurama's tails, they themselves don Tailed Beast Mode mantles much to their shock. Naruto charges them to break down Obito's defences using the Rasengan, so that he and Sasuke could have a direct shot at attacking him. As their attack is launched, a confused Obito begins to see more of himself in Naruto and even begins to hallucinate about what his life could have been like — even without
Rin
— if he had returned to the village instead. Ultimately, the
shinobi
 are able to break through his defence, and the two young men are also able to deal a devastating blow to Obito with Susanoo's sword.

Chapter 652

"
Naruto's Furrow
" (
ナルトの轍
,
Naruto no Wadachi
)

As a
Susanoo
-clad
Kurama
 cuts through
Obito
,
Naruto
 and Kurama's objectives are achieved as the
chakra
 of the
tailed beasts
 are pulled out in response to Naruto's use of the chakra the beast had given him. Manifesting their chakra via Kurama's tails, Naruto begins the great tug-of-war against Obito who struggles desperately to retain the chakra of the beasts. When
Shukaku
 and
Gyūki
's chakra reject Kurama's tails as the young man didn't possess a portion of it himself,
Gaara
 — Shukaku's former
jinchūriki
 — and
Killer B
 — Gyūki's current host — aid Naruto in his struggle in order to leave Obito with nothing but the
shell
 of the
Ten-Tails
 hence halting the tree's flower from blooming.
 Recognising what he intends to do, the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 springs into action under
Shikamaru
's directive all the while as the link between the chakra open Naruto up to even more of Obito's conscience which Kurama warns against. Joining in the effort,
Sasuke
 and Naruto's
other

comrades
 all grab hold of the chakra as well and begin to pull while
Minato
 dons his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 mantle once again and sprouting tendril-like tails instructs the Alliance to grab hold of his chakra to join the effort. Within his subconscious, Obito sees himself alone against the entire Alliance, and as he begins to contemplate more and more of his decisions and visualise what his life could have been like, he grapples to come to terms with what he views to be regret. Speaking to him directly from their connection, an empathic Naruto tells Obito that despite his declaration of being no one, he was in fact someone with dreams not unlike his own, bonds with other people in the world: both friends and family, and declared that he was "Obito
Uchiha
" and that he would destroy his real mask which was the face he portrayed of being no one.

Chapter 653

"
I'm Watching You
" (
ちゃんと見てる
,
Chanto Miteru
)

As
Naruto
 reaffirms
Obito
's existence, the
Uchiha
 notes that it did not matter anymore as he had transcended into the "
Second Six Paths
". Unsupportive of this, Naruto says that both of them were similar in a lot of ways including their upbringing, goals and beliefs. Naruto then tells Obito that nobody would acknowledge him for his
dream
 that robbed them of their freedom. Obito responds that both of them were actually indeed very similar and that was the reason he wanted Naruto to think that the world was hopeless. Obito explains that he saw his old self in Naruto, and wanted him to abandon his
ideals
 before they brought him nothing but misery.
 Chiding Obito for running away from life, the young Uchiha, however, sticks to the fact that he is actually doing what a
Hokage
 should do by bringing peace to the world; noting that he had simply found a shortcut to achieving this. Adamant in his beliefs, Naruto tells Obito that there was no shortcut to the dream of being Hokage who was a person who was supposed to go before everyone and make the way easier for them to follow. Obito reflects more on his past and
Rin
, and Naruto says that Obito still has bonds with his friends, as seen when the
Ten-Tails
 tried to take control over his body and how he had maintained control of his consciousness by remembering his
old team
. Naruto asks Obito to accept himself as a shinobi of
Konoha
, atone for his crimes, and come to the side of the Shinobi Alliance and then reaches out his hand to Obito.

Chapter 654

"
It was Obito Uchiha
" (
うちはオビトだ
,
Uchiha Obito Da
)

Naruto
 reaches out his hand to
Obito
. However, instead of accepting his hand, Obito tries to strangle Naruto, saying he has no regrets for anything he has done so far. Naruto punches Obito aside claiming he's not worthy to be a
Hokage
. Obito begins to see more of his old self in Naruto. Naruto then tells him that
Rin
 wanted to look forward to "Obito Uchiha", not what Obito has become now. Obito remembers his past with
Team Minato
 as he struggles with his inner turmoils, meanwhile Naruto forcefully grabs Obito's hand warning the
Uchiha
 to not underestimate the power of
everyone
.
 In the real world, the
shinobi
's attempts to pull out the
tailed beasts
 were successful. Naruto and
Sasuke
, losing their
armour-clad

chakra shroud
 after winning the struggle, had finally defeated and stopped Obito. Obito looks up to moon and grieves that he could not
fill the hole in his heart
.

Chapter 655

"
Furrow
" (
轍
,
Wadachi
)

As the
tailed beasts
 all start to take corporeal forms, they gladly thank
Naruto
 for saving them. Rushing forward suddenly,
Sasuke
 heads towards
Obito
's location with his
sword
 drawn; his intentions clear. With other
sensors
 such as
C

detecting
 that Obito was still alive, the
Alliance
 mobilise to deal the finishing blow. However, both Sasuke and the Alliance are stopped by
Kakashi
's
reemergence
 on the battlefield and
Tsunade
's orders respectively.
 Kakashi informs his former student that this burden was his to bear as he was Obito's friend, but before Kakashi can deal the blow to a resigned Obito, he is stopped by
Minato
. The three men talk about the past, their regrets over
Rin
's death and how everything had turned out. Kakashi then tells a doubtful Obito that Naruto would not turn out the way he they did because if he faltered, he had friends and support that would help him back up. All throughout this, Naruto had moved to locate
Madara
 and
Hashirama
 in order to aid in sealing the
Uchiha
. Standing atop the tree form of the
Ten-Tails
, Naruto and his
shadow clones
 form the
Big Ball Rasenshuriken
 which they continue to increase in size until it becomes like a giant beacon above the battlefield, that illuminates his
comrades
' footsteps.

Chapter 656

"
Shift
" (
交代
,
Kōtai
)

As
Obito
 lay defeated, he watches on as
Naruto
 uses his
Big Ball Rasenshuriken
 to attack
Madara
, who has been
immobilised
 by
Hashirama
.
Gaara
 asks
Shukaku
 for help in
sealing
 Madara to which the raccoon eventually obliges as a way of proving himself superior to
Kurama
. The other
tailed beasts
 also lend Gaara their help, intent on repaying Naruto for freeing them. Meanwhile, giving the regenerating Madara no time to retaliate, Hashirama incapacitated him further by trapping him beneath his
torii seals
.
 Despite his circumstance, Madara grins in anticipation. Kurama tells Minato that even though Obito lost the tailed beasts, he'll survive as he's still connected to the life force of the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
. Obito muses on how
Nagato
 used the
Outer Path: Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 to help the enemy, then ultimately decides to do the same. Obito tells
Minato
 and
Kakashi
 that he finally understands why Nagato would side with Naruto in the end; the teachings of
Jiraiya
 were what gave them hope for a better future. Knowing that his connection to Minato, who was a student of Jiraiya made him similar to Nagato and Naruto, Obito decides to repent by sacrificing his own life the same way Nagato did. At that moment,
Black Zetsu
 suddenly
appears
 and grabs hold of Obito. As Zetsu apologises to him, he declares that this was his singular purpose all along as he begins to merge with Obito's body. Madara thanks Naruto for weakening Obito as it allows Black Zetsu to manipulate Obito into using the
Outer Path
 technique to successfully bring Madara back to life. Now alive the ecstatic Madara declares that he would once again be able to enjoy the thrills of war with a human body.

Chapter 657

"
Madara Uchiha is Back
" (
うちはマダラ、参る
,
Uchiha Madara, Mairu
)

Giving their opponent no time to relent,
Sasuke
 engulfs
Madara
 in the flames of
Amaterasu
. Madara removes his armour, as
Naruto
 insists that is was pointless to simply attack Madara, while
Hashirama
 is puzzled as to why their opponent had closed his eyes. Emerging unscathed from the flames, Madara turns his attention to Hashirama, whom he reminds of the last conversation they had at the
Naka Shrine
, revealing that he believed that only the power of the
Uchiha
 and
Senju
 could bring true bliss. Launching his counterattack, Madara knocks both Naruto and
Sai
 aside and uses the
black receivers
 he had embedded in Hashirama earlier to immobilise his target. Using this opportunity, Madara absorbs Hashirama's
senjutsu
 chakra, which reflects on the face of Hashirama jutting out of his chest.
 Lamenting of the level of power which he was easily able to control, Madara is once again forced on the defensive, as he is attacked by Sasuke once more. Lauding the younger Uchiha for his
Mangekyō Sharingan
, Madara decides that Sasuke's
dōjutsu
 would make a perfect substitute until his
Rinnegan
 came back. Elsewhere,
Black Zetsu
 notes that
Obito
 would die soon after reviving Madara, and declares that he would now retrieve Madara's eye. Set upon by both
Kakashi
 and
Minato
, Zetsu merges with Obito, and explains that he was the only thing keeping Obito alive at this point in time. Explaining how he had escaped from the
Hokage Guard Platoon
 and bided his time, Zetsu exclaims that he was Madara's will and would go as far as to use Obito's body to defeat them.
Staving
 off another attack from his opponents, Madara soon sets his unseeing gaze upon the
tailed beasts
, determined to hunt them down.

Author's Note

“

I visited my family home for the first time in a while and planned to take a really short stroll in the winter snow with my feet exposed. But everything was so nostalgic that I kept going and going. Though I was shivering from the cold, I'd walked over three miles before I realised it. I ended up having someone come give me a ride back.
