Synopsis

Isshiki

pins

Koji
 with the pillars he
shrunk
 earlier in the battle. Koji evaluates his injuries as Isshiki explains and demonstrates his jutsu. He questions Koji's decision to fight him despite the gap of power between them, and offers to relay his last words to
Amado
 as a courtesy. Koji escapes by getting inside a
summoned

toad
 and
reverse summoning
 it. Isshiki
portals away
 to find
Kawaki
. In
Konoha
,
Boruto
 wants to fight against Isshiki, pointing out they fought
Momoshiki
 together, and that
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 already lost to Isshiki when he was weaker. Naruto refuses, pointing out he might get taken over by his
Kāma
 again.
Sai
 arrives with
Sumire
, and notifies them that evacuation of civilians has begun. Amado believes Isshiki will quickly find Kawaki with his
Byakugan
. Sai escorts them to an old
Root
 facility that is impervious to the Byakugan, which
Danzō
 had built as a precaution against a
Hyūga
 coup.

Shikamaru
,
Kakashi
, and
Tsunade
 coordinate the Konoha shinobi in preparation for Isshiki's attack. Shikamaru confesses he doesn't have a plan this time.
Chōji
,
Tenten
,
Kiba
, and
Rock Lee
 rally the shinobi.
Konohamaru
 visits
Mugino
's
grave
. Sasuke tells Boruto he and Naruto are prepared to die for the village, asks about him. He confesses they did struggle against
Jigen
 before, and informs Boruto that
Sarada
 told him about his being taken over by the Kāma. Boruto is fearful of what he might do to the village if he's taken over.
Ino

alerts
 everyone of Isshiki's arrival. Isshiki is unable to find Kawaki with his Byakugan, and considers killing people to force the information out of them. Konohamaru, Chōji, Tenten, Kiba, and Rock Lee attack him, but Isshiki makes short work of them. Sarada wants to fight, but is still recovering, so
Mitsuki
 helps her evacuate from the hospital. Naruto
saves
 Konohamaru from one of Isshiki's attacks. Ino informs Naruto that evacuation is almost over, so he can go all out. Naruto enters
Six Paths Sage Mode
 and begins fighting Isshiki. Sasuke arrives,
switching places
 him, and asks Naruto to cover him with
thrown weapons
. He and Sasuke attack Isshiki, who shrinks all the weapons. Sasuke throws his sword at him, but Isshiki can't shrink it. As it's about to hit him, the sword
transforms back
 into Boruto, who has his Kāma activated. He thinks back to his conversation with Sasuke, where Sasuke swore to take him down if Momoshiki were to taken him over, and he asked Sasuke for his forehead protector again. Boruto creates a rift with his Kāma, taking himself and Isshiki away from Konoha, to another dimension. Sasuke tracks his chakra, taking Naruto with him. Boruto tells them they can now go all out without worrying about damaging the village. They all prepare to fight.
