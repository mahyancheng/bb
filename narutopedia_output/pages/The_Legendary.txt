) is chapter 149 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Guy
 pleads with
Jiraiya
 and
Naruto
 to make sure they bring
Tsunade
 back to
Konoha
. When Naruto promises to do so, Guy, impressed by his dedication, gives him a jumpsuit before heading home with
Sasuke
. As they begin their search, Naruto asks why
Akatsuki
 is so interested in him. Jiraiya tells him that they are after the
Nine-Tails
 for some unknown reason and that, in the future, they are unlikely to give up so easily. Naruto concludes that he will need to get stronger, which he won't be able to do until they find Tsunade. Jiraiya explains that it will not be that easy since Tsunade periodically changes her appearance. Even if it will take a while, Naruto doesn't need to worry about missing out on his training since Jiraiya will be teaching him a new technique. Eager to begin, Naruto puts on his new jumpsuit.
