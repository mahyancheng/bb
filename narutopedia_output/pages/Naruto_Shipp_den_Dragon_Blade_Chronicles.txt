Naruto Shippūden: Dragon Blade Chronicles
, known as
Naruto Shippūden: Ryūjinki
 (
ナルト- 疾風伝 龍刃記
,
literally meaning:
 Naruto Hurricane Chronicles: Dragon Sword Chronicles) in Japan, is a video game for the
Wii
.

Gameplay

Unlike the
Clash of Ninja series
, the game is more of a free-roaming hack-and-slash video game. Despite this, it seems to use graphics similar to the aforementioned
Clash of Ninja
 games, and even reuses several models. All characters wear new, armoured outfits that are based on their normal attire, with the exception of
Tsunade
 and
Jiraiya
.

Plot Overview

The story is loosely based on the
Itachi Pursuit Mission
, and seems to take place shortly after its beginning.
Naruto
's half of the story is more original to the game, and revolves around a small squad of
Konohagakure
 ninja attempting to stop
Kuroma Tatsushiro
, one of the last members of the ancient Dragon Gods, from unleashing and taking the power of the
Genryū
, five eternal dragons originally sealed in
Mount Koryū
, for revenge. To do so, Naruto must slay each Genryū with the ancient Dragon Blade, given to him by Kuroma's younger sister, Akari.

For
Sasuke
's half of the story, on the other hand, he has already formed
Hebi
 by the time the story begins, in order to hunt down and kill
Itachi
. However, his efforts are hindered by
Akatsuki
's attempts to capture the Genryū that Kuroma has summoned for their own purposes. Throughout the story, the player either plays as Naruto or Sasuke along their journey, utilising their respective blades and team members' abilities to fight through various levels.

Almost all characters have scrolls attached to their new clothing. In terms of gameplay, these scrolls are used to perform jutsu of an elemental nature that is not natural to the user, or to enhance the power of techniques that the user already knows. For instance:
Naruto
 can use
Earth Release
,
Water Release
,
Fire Release
, and
Lightning Release
, all of which are not of his elemental nature. The armour that the characters don is to protect their
chakra system
 from the environment of Mount Koryū, which normally has the mysterious effect of rendering people unable to use their chakra and fight.

Reception

Reception of

Naruto
 adventure to avoid".
