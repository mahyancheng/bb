Team 15

Kawaki
 notices
Shinki
 staring at him and leaves. Shinki follows him, telling his
team-mates
 he'll return shortly. Outside the arena, Shinki introduces himself and tells Kawaki he should watch the next match. Kawaki gets angry with being told what to do and grabs Shinki by the collar. Shinki pulls him off with his
Iron Sand
 and reiterates he should watch the match before going back inside. The match between Sarada and Chōchō begins. Chōchō tries landing blows with
enlarged fists
, while Sarada dodges and reads her movements with her
Sharingan
. Positioning herself on a wall, Sarada attacks with
Lightning Balls
, landing hits. She's apologetic about it, which angers Chōchō, who calls Sarada out for not going all out against her and lands a hit. Sarada recalls talking to
Sasuke
 about being committed to taking
Boruto
 out if he became
Momoshiki
.
 She gets serious, and attacks with
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
, which Chōchō
rolls through
, pursuing her around. Naruto,
Sai
, and Shikamaru comment on how the match has improved. Sasuke watches it from the stands. Sarada prepares a
Chidori
 and Chōchō enters
Butterfly Mode
. The two clash, and Chōchō goes down first when the smoke clears, so Sarada is declared the winner. Chōchō's team-mates go check on her. Shinki asks Kawaki if he thought the match was worth watching. Sarada and Chōchō do the
Seal of Reconciliation
. Leaving with Inojin and Shikadai, Chōchō cries about not being able to keep her promise. Inojin tells her not to stress it. Sarada sees Sasuke, and admits that the things shinobi must be prepared to do are more serious than she thought. He asks about Boruto and
Mitsuki
, who still aren't around. The two watch
Amado
 negotiating with a group about
scientific ninja tools
. He refuses their terms, considering himself indebted to
Konoha
. The group decides to take him by force. While Amado prepares to escape by himself, Boruto and Mitsuki engage the enemy and take him. Amado reminds them of the

Denki
 notes how all other remaining participants are strong opponents.
