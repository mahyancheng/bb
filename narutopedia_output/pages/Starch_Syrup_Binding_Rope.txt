After kneading
chakra
 in the stomach and converting it to high-viscosity water, the user spits it out, in the form of ropes that restrains the target's movement. Because of the viscosity of the water, it is even more difficult for them to escape its confines.

Trivia

Mizuame
 is a Japanese sweetener made by converting starch to sugars. It takes the form of a clear, thick, and most of all sticky liquid. It can be literally translated as "water candy", emphasising its likeness to water and explaining why it is used in a water release technique.

In the anime, the
Genjutsu World
 version of
Izumo Kamizuki
 is able to use this technique.
