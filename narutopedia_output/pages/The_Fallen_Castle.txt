Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Team Asuma
 succeeds in bringing
Shū
 into custody, where they secure a room at an inn for the night. Elsewhere
Naruto
 continues to act as Shū's double and has a hard time going through his daily duties. As
Akatsuki
 members
Deidara
 and
Sasori
 bicker while nearing their destination, the real Shū gets the opportunity to relax and enjoy things he was previously not able to. However, Naruto's cover is soon blown as
Tatewaki
 and
Chiyo
 realise he was not the real Shū after seeing his fighting skills, and Naruto is forced to explain everything to them when his escape is foiled. However, no sooner is the
Land of This
 assaulted by Sasori's
hundred puppets
 and Deidara's
explosive creations
. Confronting Sasori and reprimanding him for his actions, Tatewaki noted that even though the
daimyō
 for the country was dead, his allegiance to him was never-ending. Ultimately Tatewaki lost his life, having been
poisoned
 by Sasori's
Puppet Technique: Prosthetic Arm Senbon
 technique. Later, as the Akatsuki members pull out,
Yamato
 watches from a distance noting that overall the mission went well. Back in present time, Tatewaki learns that Chiyo and Shū were safe and moving around with the other daimyō under the protection of the
Daimyō Protection Squad
. Relieved to hear this Tatewaki stops struggling and though wishing he could see them once again, his soul is released to the afterlife, and his body begins to crumble.
