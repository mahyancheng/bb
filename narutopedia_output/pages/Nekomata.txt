Nekomata
 (

) is a giant cat and the boss of the
ninneko
 underworld.

Background

During
Sasuke Uchiha
's childhood,
Itachi Uchiha
 made a game of collecting paw prints of quick, nimble cats from a normal cat to a lion and the last paw print to be collected was Nekomata's. Itachi once defeated Nekomata and his ninja cats and requested him to fight Sasuke with all his might when he got older.






Nekomata confronts Sasuke.



Years later,
Team 7
 was assigned to get Nekomata's paw print and infiltrated his
fortress
. The team was split up during the infiltration. Sasuke was the first to find Nekomata, challenged him but Nekomata seemed to be too much for him until
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Sakura Haruno
 arrived and saved him. Sasuke then told his two team-mates he didn't need to be saved and revealed dozens of kunai with explosive tags on the ceiling above Nekomata and detonated them, having the ceiling on top of him collapse. With Nekomata defeated, Sasuke collected the last paw print for the
Paw Encyclopaedia
.
