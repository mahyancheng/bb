This article is about the anime-only crime lord. For the Academy teacher of Konohagakure, see
Daikoku Funeno
.

Tenzen Daikoku
 (
大黒天善
,
Daikoku Tenzen
) was a crime boss who lost many men to the
blade
 of
Zabuza Momochi
 during the latter's attempted coup d'etat of
Kirigakure
.

Background

Looking for revenge years later, he sought out
Zabuza Momochi
 to capture him, but when he discovered that Zabuza was dead he instead plundered Zabuza's blade from his
grave
 in the
Land of Waves
. He was an aide to the
daimyō
 of the
Land of Water
 and a politician.

Part II

Itachi Pursuit Mission






Suigetsu fights in Tenzen's castle.



After being warned by
Sasuke Uchiha
 (under the impression that Sasuke is, in fact,
Suigetsu Hōzuki
), he sends out his men to fight Suigetsu, who he believed was coming to take the blade of Zabuza Momochi. Suigetsu defeats the men and enters Tenzen's room, asking for
Zabuza
's sword. Tenzen's bodyguard attacks Suigetsu with the sword in question. As the guard takes a swing at Suigetsu he misses, as Suigetsu simply uses the
Hydrification Technique
 to reform, and in moments the bodyguard is defeated. Sasuke enters the room and Tenzen tries to blame Sasuke for Zabuza's death. Suigetsu explains that he doesn't care; he then takes the sword and leaves the place with Sasuke, but not before chopping the pillars in the room with the blade, forcing the castle to crumble. His fate is unknown, but it's likely he perished as the castle fell.

Trivia

Daikoku has a lot of power in both the political and criminal worlds, and was shown to be feared by regular people.

He had control of even more men than
Gatō
 had, and even had control of his bodyguards.
