"
Tailed Beasts vs. Madara…!!
" (
尾獣VSマダラ…!!
,
Bijū Bāsasu Madara…!!
) is chapter 658 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

With the
tailed beasts
 intent on fighting
Madara
 head on, the
Allied Shinobi Forces
' members decide to fall back in order to not become collateral damage. Leading the charge,
Gaara
 and
Shukaku
 attack Madara with their
Wind Release: Sand Buckshot
 technique. Noting that the technique was a good one — albeit without any wallop — Madara is surprised when Gaara immobilises him with the residual sand that was left inside of his body after the attack. Using the opportunity to attack, the tailed beasts each take a swing at their opponent, giving the sand-manipulating duo an opening to use their
Desert Layered Imperial Funeral Seal
 technique to seal Madara away.
 However, Madara escapes with the aid of his
Susanoo
, only mere moments before the sealing was completed. As the
Uchiha
 begins to boast,
Naruto
 and
Kurama
 lead the counter-attack on Madara by giving him a serious tail-whipping. The resulting attack was enough to damage Madara, sending his right arm flying, and forcing him to retreat. At the same time, however, a
White Zetsu Army
 clone
emerges
 from the ground informing Madara that he was able to complete his mission. Lopping off the unflinching Zetsu's right arm to replace his own, Madara notes — as he reveals his right
Rinnegan
 restored — that he would now be able to have some fun with at least one of his eyes restored.
