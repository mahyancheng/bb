The Hokage's hat.



The
Hokage
 (
火影
,
literally meaning:
 Fire Shadow) is the
Kage
 of
Konohagakure
, a title bestowed on the village's leader. The Hokage is generally regarded as the strongest
shinobi
 in the village. There have officially been seven Hokage in the village's history.

Overview





The Hokage Rock.



The Hokage position was created shortly after the creation of Konoha by
Hashirama Senju
, one of the village's founders. The Hokage typically selects their successor. If they die or are otherwise incapacitated, the next Hokage is instead chosen by the
daimyō
 of the
Land of Fire
 with the advice of his committee, the
Konoha Council
, the
Jōnin Commander
 and a representative of the
Anbu
. This choice must then be approved by Konoha's
jōnin
. If one of the Hokage's predecessors is still alive, they may return to office rather than select a new Hokage, as when the Third came out of retirement following the Fourth's death. The choice appears to be difficult to decline, if not impossible -
Jiraiya
 was forced to find
Tsunade
, a suitable substitute, to escape the pre-arranged promotion that would have made him Fifth Hokage.
 The Hokage's inauguration is a major event in Konoha, with most of the village attending. The new Hokage is granted a ceremonial
haori
 on the occasion; the same woman has embroidered the haori for all seven Hokage.
 Once they assume the duties of Hokage, their face is carved into the
Hokage Rock
 and they usually move in to the
Hokage Residence
. The Hokage's office is located in the administrative section of the
Academy
.

Hokage are responsible for most of the village's day-to-day affairs, such as assigning the village's ninja to
missions
 or securing funding for the village's projects and personnel. The Hokage spends most of their time in the village, only travelling abroad for events of vital importance to Konoha. Each Hokage typically lives according to the
Will of Fire
, a philosophy that holds that Konoha is a family and that the Hokage is chiefly responsible for protecting that family. The workload of Hokage can be quite formidable, and as such retired Hokage may continue to oversee certain sections of the village or, if not that, will advise the current Hokage on request. Over a decade after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, the workload of the Hokage had expanded tremendously due to the expansive growth that Konohagakure enjoyed after the War, as well as the Hokage's duties becoming nearly that of a pseudo-head of state in the
Land of Fire
. As such, until his schedule lessened, the
Seventh Hokage
 would be swamped with paperwork and other appearances all over the village turned city to the point where even his massive
chakra
 reserves would be depleted. And he would be unable to spend time with his family, temporarily forming a rift between himself and his
eldest son
.

Sixth
Hokage
 Candidate
 (

Trivia

Hashirama intended for his co-founder,
Madara Uchiha
, to be the First Hokage, but the village's population instead selected Hashirama. Madara feared that Hashirama's selection was the first step in making the Hokage office an extension of the
Senju clan
's authority.
 Ultimately, all of the village's Hokage have a connection to a previous Hokage, which traces origins to the Senju in some way.

The
Second
 was the chief aide and younger brother of the First.

The
Third
 was a student of both the First and Second.

The
Fourth
 was a student of
one
 of the Third's
students
.

The
Fifth
 is direct family to the First and Second, and was a student of the Third.

The
Sixth
 was a student of the Fourth and (in the anime) an aide to the Third.

The
Seventh
 is the son of the Fourth, the godchild of one of the Third's students, a student of the Sixth, and distantly-related to the First, Second, and Fifth.

During his life, the Third Hokage was said to be the strongest Hokage in the village's history as well as strongest
Kage
 of his time.
 Years later, the Seventh Hokage was recognised in the same way.

Orochimaru
 was a prime candidate to be the Fourth Hokage, but was passed over because he didn't embody the Will of Fire.

Fugaku Uchiha
's talents were considered comparable to
Minato Namikaze
 and the
Sannin
, even viewed as a prime candidate to become Fourth Hokage. Despite this, his name was not even suggested. Many in the
Uchiha Clan
 suspected this was due to the village officials not wanting the Uchiha Clan on centre stage.

Jiraiya was considered for the Hokage position multiple times: first prior to the Third's retirement,
 again after the Fourth's death, and once again after the Third's death.
 He refused each time because he believed he couldn't give the office the attention it deserved.

The first six Hokage had their official photographs taken while wearing a ceremonial necklace of sorts.

At one point,
Sasuke
 claimed
Itachi
 to be the "true" Hokage on account of the latter's hefty sacrifices for the sake of the village. A
reincarnated
 Hiruzen would later share this sentiment.

According to Boruto, Naruto refers to Sasuke as the "Shadow Hokage", due to Naruto protecting the village from the inside whereas Sasuke supports Naruto and protects the village from the outside. However, Sasuke never recognises himself as a Hokage due to his past criminal acts and his personal life-long journey of atonement.

In the
Genjutsu World
 seen in
Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie
,
Kizashi Haruno
 was the Fourth Hokage. Like the real Fourth Hokage, he gave his life to save the village.

Naruto Uzumaki
 was made Hokage for a week in the storyline of
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3
.

In the anime, it is revealed that a Konoha-nin does not need any specific rank first to become Hokage, as Naruto remained a genin his entire career before becoming Seventh Hokage.

Might Guy
 was made Hokage ("Guykage" as it was named) in the
Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles
 spin-off.

In Jiraiya's novel
The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi
, the village leader of Shuku is called the
Kokage
 as an obvious homage to the Hokage position.

Several victims of the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 dream of different Hokage:

Kiba Inuzuka
 dreams that he is Hokage, a position he uses to declare a national holiday for dogs.

Tsunade
 dreams that
Dan Katō
 is Hokage.

In the anime,
Karin
 dreams that
Sasuke Uchiha
 is the Sixth Hokage.

It's tradition that a Konoha shinobi's first
mission
 is directly received from the Hokage.
