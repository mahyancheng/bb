Dajimu
 (
ダジム
) is a former member of
Konohagakure
's
Anbu
 faction
Root
.

Background

Dajimu, like most members of the group, was likely trained to lose emotions in order to better accomplish missions. As Root members each use a codename, it is unknown what Dajimu's real name is, if he even has one.

Personality

Even though the organisation has been officially disbanded, Dajimu remains loyal to its head,
Danzō Shimura
.

Part II

Five Kage Summit

Dajimu and
Tera
 had both been secretly assigned by Danzō to assassinate
Anko Mitarashi
, but due to the village's situation at that time, their mission was postponed in preference of finding
Kabuto Yakushi
 before she did.
