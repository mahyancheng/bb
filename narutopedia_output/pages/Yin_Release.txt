Yin Release
 (
陰遁
,
Inton
,
Viz:
 Dark Style or Shadow Style) is a
nature transformation
 that exists outside the five basic elemental natures. Like its counterpart,
Yang Release
, Yin Release is little-explored in the series. Yin Release uses
spiritual energy
 to control imagination, creating form out of nothingness.
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 combined Yin and Yang into
Yin–Yang Release
, notably allowing him to
create
 the nine
tailed beasts
.

Yin Release has tended to be inherited among the
Uchiha clan
, descendants of Hagoromo.
Jin no Sho
 notes, however, certain other clans employ Yin Release via their
hiden
 skills, notably the
Nara clan
, who use Yin Release to manipulate their own shadows. Additionally, most
genjutsu
 also fall under the categorisation of Yin Release.

There have been occasional miscellaneous mentions of Yin Release:
Minato Namikaze

split
 the
Nine-Tails
' Yin and Yang chakra,
 sealing its Yin half within himself and thus becoming its
jinchūriki
;
 Hagoromo's spirit gives his
Six Paths Yin Power
 to
Sasuke Uchiha
, which takes the form of a crescent moon marking on his left palm;

Madara Uchiha
, after acquiring
Six Paths Senjutsu
, uses Yin Release through his
Sage Art: Yin Release Lightning Dispatch
.

Trivia

During explanations of Yin Release within the series, the manga depicts it as being coloured black and the anime depicts it as being red.

The
Mind Body Switch Technique
 and
Revolt of the Demon World
 are mentioned to use spiritual energy,
 though neither have been confirmed to be Yin Release.

The word "Yin" also appears in the names of
Yin Healing Wound Destruction
 and
Yin Seal: Release
, though these also have not been said to be Yin Release.
