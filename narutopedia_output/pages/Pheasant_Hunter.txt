The user creates a giant flamed pheasant that they direct at a target. In
Boruto: Naruto the Movie
, the pheasant merely grapples with
Naruto Uzumaki
's
Tailed Beast Mode
 until it is torn apart by Naruto. In the
Boruto
 anime, it explodes on impact with its target, doing extensive damage to the surroundings.

Trivia

While unnamed in the movie and manga, this technique was named in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
.

Momoshiki's ability to create a pheasant,
dog
 and
monkey
 is influenced by the tale of
Momotarō
, who befriends the three animals.

If this technique were to follow the same naming format as
Inukaitakerunomikoto
, it would be named Tometamaominomikoto (
留玉臣命
,
Resolute Jewel Loyal Lord
), after Tamaomi Tome, one of the three retainers in the legend of
Kibitsu Hiko no Mikoto
.
