 anime.

Summary

As
Orochimaru
 and his team reach
Sasuke
, they realise that the unknown
chakra
 signature is that of
Kabuto
. Since Kabuto has assimilated other people into himself, his chakra signature has become unknown, explaining why
Karin
 could not identify the person near to Sasuke. Kabuto explains that he has decided to save Sasuke, after coming to realise who he was, thanks to the
Izanami
. Elsewhere,
Guy
 releases the
Gate of Wonder
, which fails to damage
Madara
. Knowing that the Seventh Gate failed, Guy realises he must use the
Gate of Death
, which he knows will kill him.
 He remembers his time with
his father
, where he failed to graduate and decided to run 500 laps in order to enter the
Academy
 as an alternate student. However, Guy is unable to finish running 500 laps and ends up passing out while the
Third Hokage
 watches him from the window of the Academy. As Guy apologises to his father only to be scolded for not having faith, Guy becomes frustrated with his father being mocked and attacks two older ninja, only to end up being brutalised. He's saved from further harm by
Kakashi
 taking out the older ninja. After being saved by Kakashi, Guy watches him leaving with his
father
.
