This technique summons a Shop
Toad
 (
見世蝦蟇
,
Mise Gama
) from
Mount Myōboku
. This toad has the ability to transform into a building and with their chakra, the user gives the building a design they imagined themselves. The target is then lured inside, for example, with the promise of cheap drinks. Once the target has entered the store, the toad changes back into its original small form, trapping the target inside the toad's stomach. From the moment the cancellation hand seal is performed, it takes only a few seconds for it to return to its original shape, meaning there is little chance of escape.
