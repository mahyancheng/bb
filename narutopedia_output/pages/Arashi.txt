 hoping to settle down. But, near the end of their journey, they met
Orochimaru
, who offered them a chance to return to their former glory by following him. Arashi, seen as the hope of the Fūma clan, along with Jigumo, Kamikiri,
Kotohime
, and
Kagerō
, accept the offer to restore the Fūma Clan.

Appearance

Arashi had long, smooth, chin-length purple hair and grey-coloured eyes. His bangs hung just over his eyebrows. He wore a green short sleeve shirt, but the collar and sleeves were white. He also wore two black arm sleeves on his lower arms and long grey pants.

Abilities

Arashi was one of the most talented members of the Fūma Clan. He could perform his clan's most
secret technique

absorbing
 the bodies of two other Fūma Clan members, he became a large malleable mass able to unleash the signature techniques of his absorbed kin.

Posing as Orochimaru before being found by

,
Sakura Haruno
, and
Sasame
, Arashi killed his kinsmen
Jigumo
 and
Kamikiri
 and used
Casualty Puppet
 on them to increase his powers to use the Curse Mandala at the cost of his sanity. In the fight that followed, Naruto ripped the corpse puppets off of Arashi's back while snapping him back to his senses. However, the fight caused the lair to collapse as Arashi, with his puppets holding him in place, remained behind as he revealed that he had no intention of leaving as it meant his death either way.
