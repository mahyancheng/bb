Sakura traps her opponent in a genjutsu in which the giant form of
Inner Sakura
 raises up from beneath the opponent. Inner Sakura takes the opponent into the air and crushes the opponent with both her hands, and the genjutsu promptly ends with the opponent on the ground.

In the
Ultimate Ninja Storm
 sub-series, Sakura traps her opponent in a genjutsu. As Inner Sakura appears behind Sakura, she then slides her fist which is imbued with pink chakra against the ground before she uppercuts her opponent into the air ending the genjutsu.
