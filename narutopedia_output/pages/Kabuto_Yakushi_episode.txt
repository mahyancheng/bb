 anime.

Summary

Kabuto
 has a flashback of when the
Konoha Orphanage
 aided several wounded
shinobi
 — through which Kabuto was tasked with
healing

Orochimaru
. Seeing talent in the young man, Orochimaru asked whether or not he wants to become a shinobi, to which Kabuto declined, saying he is not interested in the job. During nighttime at the orphanage,
Nonō
 is approached by
Danzō
 along with Orochimaru and
Tatsuma Aburame
. Danzō and his men seemingly blackmailed her into going on an intelligence gathering mission in
Iwagakure
, much to the other orphanage caretakers' dismay.
 Also recruiting Kabuto in the process, he is tasked with infiltrating the villages of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
. While on a mission in Iwagakure, Kabuto encounters Nonō — whom he had
critically wounded
. Attempting to heal her, Kabuto is shocked upon hearing her stating that she didn't remember him. As he wonders why Nonō forgot about him, he is once again approached by Orochimaru. Following Orochimaru to his
secret lab
, Kabuto learned the truth about
Root
's plan to dispose of both him and Nonō. Kabuto then makes his decision to join Orochimaru and serve as his personal
spy
. After Orochimaru's death, Kabuto injected himself with blood from the latter's remains — as part of his quest to find his "true self".
