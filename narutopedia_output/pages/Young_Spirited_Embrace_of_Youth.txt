Guy
 punches the opponent aside, only to apologise and embrace them, fracturing the opponent's back and doing liberal damage.

Trivia

This technique is a comical reference to Guy's first appearance in the original manga/anime, right down to hitting his opposition while also hugging them (only the opponent unlike
Lee
 in the original segment, does not hug back).

In the
Clash of Ninja
 series, Kakashi can perform this technique by copying it with his
Sharingan
.

If used on Lee, he would scream out Guy's name in pain.
