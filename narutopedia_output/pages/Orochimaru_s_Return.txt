"
Orochimaru's Return
" (
復活!! 大蛇丸
,
Fukkatsu!! Orochimaru
) is episode 341 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Suigetsu
 proceeds to show
Sasuke
 the
scroll
 that he found at
Orochimaru
's
hideout
 earlier. After examining its contents, Sasuke's next motive is to meet with Orochimaru and explained to a confused Suigetsu that he is not one to die so easily as well as declaring that he is going to meet the "
ones who know everything
". With
Jūgo
's
assistance
, Sasuke revives Orochimaru via the
Evil Releasing Method
. Expressing shock that Sasuke would be the one to resurrect him, Orochimaru asserts that he has no interest in the
war
. Instead, his sight is still set on Sasuke's body but notes that such a task cannot be completed in his current state.
 Sasuke then shows Orochimaru the scroll he was given earlier and states he wants to get answers from those who know everything. With that, after absorbing his
chakra
 from the incapacitated
Kabuto
, Orochimaru agreed to his disciple's request as they prepare to depart. Elsewhere,
Naruto
 and the others watch on as
Tobi
 moves forward with the revival of the
Ten-Tails
.
Kakashi
 wonders why Tobi would bluff because the
Eight
 and
Nine-Tails
' chakra are still intact, to which Gyūki notes that
Akatsuki
 may have its chakra from its
clone
. Kurama further notes that its chakra might be present in the
treasured

tools
 that the
Demonic Statue
 swallowed earlier. With the situation analysed, Kakashi is determined to stop the Ten-Tails' revival from being completed, which Kurama agrees. However, the masked man declares that even if the beast's revival is incomplete, the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 can still be achieved either way. As the group is rallied to fight, Naruto enters his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 and attacks the statue.
