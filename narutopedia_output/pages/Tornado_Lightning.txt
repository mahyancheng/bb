Tornado Lightning
 (
旋風雷光撃
,
Torunēdo Raitoningu
) is a technique utilised by
Ranke
 by drawing energy from the
Stone of Gelel
.

Overview

With the power of the Stone of Gelel, Ranke generates electrical energy in her palms that she can whip around in order to attack her opponent, capable of striking at various angles and tearing through rock and metal.

Trivia

Although the Japanese subtitle of this technique is written in kanji, it is pronounced in English, "Tornado Lightning" (
トルネードライトニング
,
Torunēdo Raitoningu
). The Japanese pronunciation of the kanji would be
Senpū Raikōgeki
, which would literally translate to "Whirlwind Flash of Lightning Strike".

During the initial step of executing this attack, Ranke performs several hand gestures that may resemble
hand seals
. However, considering that none of
Haido's Knights
 know what
chakra
 is, these "hand seals" are more likely to be merely attack gestures.
