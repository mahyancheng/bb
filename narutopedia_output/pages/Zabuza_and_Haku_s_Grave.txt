Zabuza and Haku's grave.



This is the place where
Zabuza Momochi
 and
Haku
 were buried after their deaths at the
Great Naruto Bridge
 in the
Land of Waves
. They were interred in a small, grassy area which overlooks the bridge, and Haku's obi, along with Zabuza's
sword
 were placed there in their memory. In Part II,
Suigetsu
 travels there in order to retrieve Zabuza's sword.
 This plot is expanded on in the anime, in which
Tenzen Daikoku
 had beaten Suigetsu to the grave, forcing him to track down the blade.

Their graves were later desecrated by
Kabuto Yakushi
 so that he could
use them
 as pawns in the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.
