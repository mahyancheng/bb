Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Charging forward,
Naruto
 attacks
Tobi
 using a giant
chakra arms
 which Tobi simply phases through, chiding the boy of thinking that he could defeat him on his own. As
Guy
 tries to snap
Kakashi
 out of the shock brought on from Tobi's revelation, they see the masked man send three giant
shuriken
 hurtling towards Naruto from the
other dimension
. Catching two of them on his tentacles, one of
B
 and
Gyūki
's tentacles is cut by the third but is stopped by Naruto who retorts Tobi's earlier remark by telling he's never truly alone as he has
Kurama
 and the others supporting him. Now motivated by Guy to act, Kakashi notes that he had to time the next use of his
Kamui
 perfectly, despite Tobi chastising his "
borrowed power
" and stated intentions of showing him Kamui's true potential. Acting immediately, Tobi jumps into the air and sends out a number of
chakra receiver stakes
 which pierce B and Gyūki. Warning Naruto not to let them touch him as it sealed off the
tailed beasts
' power, Naruto creates a
shadow clone
 while being protected by Gyūki. While a clone charged forward with the
Rasengan
, the original prepared the
Tailed Beast Ball
. As the clone prepares to attack, Kakashi seemingly warps away the Rasengan again while Tobi — seeing the same attack pattern — decides to attack the clone with one of the stakes, rather than having him go through him. With the clone seemingly dispelled, Tobi phases through the Tailed Beast Ball, and fully enters the other dimension. There, Tobi is shocked to see Naruto and realises that Kakashi had warped the clone there to wait for him. Declaring that he had nowhere to run, Naruto slams the Rasengan into Tobi's face, shattering the mask with Naruto asking his enemy who he is.

Trivia

The staging of the final page, where Naruto hits Tobi in the face, matches that used in
Naruto
 chapter 28
, when Naruto hits
Haku
 in the face. In both cases, the mask his opponent is wearing is broken.

The final line of this chapter is, "Who are you!!" (
てめーは誰だ!!

Omae wa Dare da!!
) is the title of
Naruto
 chapter 16
, the cover page of which features the earliest depiction of
Obito Uchiha
.
