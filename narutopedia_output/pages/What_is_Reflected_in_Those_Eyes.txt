Summary

As
Sarada
's
punch
 sends many
enemies
 flying,
Naruto
 and
his clones
 scare the other opponents by showing them a glimpse of
who
's inside his body.
Chōchō
 compliments Sarada's strength and notices the similarity between her and Sasuke's eyes.
Sakura
 tells Sarada that she truly is her biological mother, and Sasuke says that Sarada herself proves the connection between him and Sakura. After returning to
Konoha
, Shin's clones are brought to the
Konoha Orphanage
, where
Kabuto
 presents himself as their new father, with
Urushi
 at his side, while thinking about whether to give a name to every one of them.
 Chōchō finds a man who turns out to be
Chōji
, who lost a lot of weight, and tells him to start training her the day after. That night, the
Uchiha
 family has dinner together, and the following morning, Sasuke leaves again for his mission. He pokes Sarada on the forehead as a goodbye but doesn't do the same with Sakura, much to her annoyance and Sasuke's amusement. At the
Academy
,
Boruto
 thanks Sarada for giving the lunchbox to his father, to which Sarada states that she should be the one saying that and informs him of her wish to become Hokage. Meanwhile, at
Orochimaru
's hideout,
Karin
 tells
Suigetsu
 she wasn't the one who gave birth to Sarada, but the one who helped with her delivery, and that what Suigetsu used for the
DNA test
 was the umbilical cord that connected Sarada and Sakura. Back at home, Sarada looks at a photo of her family together and happily smiles.
