Konohamaru Sarutobi
 and
Sai
 investigated the cult Boro left behind after his death and met with Tsuzumi and
Shirabe
, feigning their curiosity in joining the cult. To gain more information, the
Konoha
 shinobi revealed Boro's fate to Tsuzumi that they claimed they overheard from other shinobi and followed him to a hidden room, where he went to see if there was truth to the rumors. Seeing that the cultist knew more than he let on, Konohamaru and Sai attempted to interrogate Tsuzumi, but he threw a vial of Boro's
virus
 to cover his escape.

Thanks to the antibodies they obtained, the two caught up to him. Cornered, Tsuzumi rallied the cultists together to apprehend them. Although Konohamaru seemingly convinced the cultists of Boro's deception,
Shirabe
 reminded them of their reasons of joining the cult to retain their firm beliefs. Suddenly,
Delta
 attacked the facility in order to destroy Boro's
Space-Time Gate
 from being used by outsiders. Tsuzumi was soon crushed to death by the falling debris.
