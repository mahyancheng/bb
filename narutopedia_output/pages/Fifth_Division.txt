The
Fifth Division
 (
第五部隊
,
Daigo Butai
,
Viz:
 Fifth Company), also known as the
Special Battle Division
 (
戦闘特別部隊
,
Sentō Tokubetsu Butai
,
English TV:
 Special-Range Battle Unit), was a battalion in the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, formed in preparation of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. It is led by the
Land of Iron
's leader,
Mifune
.

Composition

The Fifth Division is particularly composed of samurai. According to
Shikamaru Nara
 in the anime, the shinobi in it are mostly specialised in
hiden
 ninjutsu or attack tactics to provide support for other units who may be in a disadvantage.

History

Upon its formation, the Fifth Division disperses itself along the whole length of the
Land of Lightning
's peninsula. Whenever another Division is in need of assistance, the nearest partition of the Fifth Division is sent to give support. A group consisting of
Shino Aburame
,
Hana
 and
Kiba Inuzuka
 and their dogs meet up with the
Second Division
 to help eliminate an underground portion of the
White Zetsu Army
.
 A second group, which includes
Ino Yamanaka
, joins elements of the Second and
Fourth Divisions
 in providing backup to the overwhelmed
First Division
.






The Fifth Division confronts the reincarnated shinobi.



Mifune personally leads a group of his
samurai
 warriors in assisting the
Surprise Attack Division
. They arrive just in time to stop a
reincarnated

Hanzō
 from killing
Kankurō
. Part of their group heals Kankurō and his men, others engage
Chiyo
 and
Kimimaro
, and Mifune focuses his efforts on Hanzō. After first neutralising
Ibuse
, Mifune defeats Hanzō, who resolves to commit
seppuku
, giving the
Sealing Team
 a chance to restrain him. Then they focus their efforts on sealing the other reincarnated shinobi.






Naruto arrives to aid the Fifth Division.



As the first day of battle ends,
Neji
 falls down due to the overuse of his Byakugan, so Kiba tells him to go to the medical tents and get treated while he's in charge of watching over any enemies' sign. Neji insists he's fine, but can no longer discern between Kiba and Akamaru. Neji rests on Akamaru's back as the others keep on the lookout. Later, one of
Naruto
's clones arrive to aid the Fifth Division in defeating
their

enemies
, with both Kimimaro and Chiyo noting that Naruto has grown.

Seemingly able to defeat all the impostors, they were later instructed to provide backup for Naruto and
Killer B
 on their battlefield. Eventually, the division meets up with the rest of the Allied Shinobi Forces to fight against the
Ten-Tails
 under the command of
Madara Uchiha
 and
Obito Uchiha
.
