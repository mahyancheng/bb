Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Guy
 begins his assault on
Madara
, using the
Evening Elephant
 to attack, however the pain of using the
Eight Gates Released Formation
 causes him to prematurely end the attack. Madara returns to the sky, excited over the opportunity to face a user of all Eight Gates. Kicking the air in order to match Madara's flight, Guy prepares to use the Evening Elephant again.

Minato
 tells the others they have to help Guy, and gives
Lee
 one of his
kunai
. As Guy begins his second use of the Evening Elephant, Madara shields his attack with his
Truth-Seeking Ball
, countering with one of his own. Lee throws the kunai between Guy and the attack, so that Minato can use the
Flying Thunder God Technique
 to send the orbs away.
Gaara
 then lifts
Kakashi
 close to Madara so that he can use
Kamui
 to create an opening in Madara's defence. Guy lands the final "step" of the Evening Elephant directly into Madara, pushing him through the back of his shield. Despite this devastating attack, Madara stands once again, stating his excitement hasn't reached this level since fighting
Hashirama
. Elsewhere,
Naruto
 wakes up and wonders if he has died. However a floating man tells him that he is not. Naruto questions the old man as to who he is, and is shocked to hear that the man is the
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
, the Sage of Six Paths. Hagoromo tells Naruto of the cycle of reincarnation of the Sage's sons,
Indra
 and
Asura
, and tells Naruto of the latter's lack of ability, especially in comparison to that of the elder brother. When Naruto recognises these traits in himself, Hagoromo reveals to him that he is the
reincarnation
 of his youngest son.
