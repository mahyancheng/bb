Kiku
 (
キク
) was a prisoner at
Hōzuki Castle
.

Background

During his time at Hōzuki Castle, Kiku befriended Kedama, who he admired for his defiant attitude towards the guards. Together, the two came up with a plan to escape the prison. Kiku had learned to predict the weather from the clouds from his fisherman father, and determined that despite the good weather, it would soon rain, which he and Kedama intended to use to get rid of the
Heavenly Prison
 seal on them. Kiku proceeded with their plan, but Kedama was late, as he had doubted Kiku's rain prediction until it was too late. Because of that, Kiku was caught by
Benga
, who activated the seal, Kedama arriving just in time to watch Kiku die.
