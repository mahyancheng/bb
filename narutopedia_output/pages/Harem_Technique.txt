After using the
Shadow Clone Technique
 to create many copies of the user, the user and their shadow clones each perform the
Sexy Technique
 to change their appearances into beautiful naked women. The naked forms swarm their target and hang upon them, the intention being to overpower targets with lustful thoughts.

Ebisu
, against whom the Sexy Technique was ineffective, is defeated by the Harem Technique, losing consciousness due to a bloody nose. The
Third Hokage
, who previously fell prey to the Sexy Technique, suspects the Harem Technique would also work against him.

Killer B
 is unmoved by it.

Trivia

In the anime, the naked forms are obscured by heavier amounts of smoke than is used in the Harem Technique's manga depictions.

Naruto
 video games take the additional step of having all the shadow clones wearing swimsuits.

In
Naruto
 episode 193,
Naruto
 instead has his shadow clones
transform
 into (fully clothed)
Sakura Harunos
, taking advantage of
Rock Lee
's feelings for her.

In
Naruto
 chapter 492, Naruto's fringes when using this jutsu are styled different than the usual. This style was never used again, nor was it adapted into the anime in
Naruto: Shippūden
 episode 243.
