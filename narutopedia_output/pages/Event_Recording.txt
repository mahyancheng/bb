This is an unnamed ability possessed by
Black Zetsu
 that allows it to record events that it has personally witnessed.

Usage

When used in conjunction with its signature
Mayfly
 technique, Black Zetsu can gather data from battles without being detected. In order to show these recordings to others, it must first
