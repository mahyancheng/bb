Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Sasuke
 tries to refute
Tobi
's story. He points out that
Itachi
 tried to take his eyes and kill him, but Tobi responds that it was only to draw out
Orochimaru
 and remove his influence from Sasuke. He instead pins blame on Tobi for the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
's attack, thereby causing the Uchiha's demise. Tobi claims he was not involved and that the fox's attack was a freak accident. Sasuke switches back to Itachi's actions, the actions of a criminal. The only proof that Tobi can provide for Itachi's good intentions is that Sasuke is still alive. Accepting that Itachi orchestrated his own death, prolonging his life in the face of a fatal illness to make sure he could be killed by Sasuke, Sasuke reminisces about his brother.
