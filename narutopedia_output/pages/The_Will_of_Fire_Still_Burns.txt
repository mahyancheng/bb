Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Konohamaru
, the
Third Hokage
's grandson, disapproves of
Tsunade
 as his grandfather's successor, and blockades himself in her new office, trying to prevent the inauguration. Naruto races over, and tries to convince Konohamaru to come out. Sakura visits the hospital, looking for Lee with a bouquet of flowers, Lee ends up flustered. She sees him wandering outside, and does what she can to lift his spirits. Tsunade sits down with Shizune to familiarise herself with the genin squads. Meanwhile, Naruto is still at a loss on making Konohamaru feel any better, no matter the approach. Tsunade arrives, busting down the blockade and disarming all the traps set for her, which leaves Konohamaru in awe of her ability. Later, he accepts Tsunade’s position as Fifth Hokage, on the condition his grandfather wouldn't fade into memory. Shizune searches for Tsunade, and finds her studying healing powers, recognising that she's determined to get Lee back on his feet.
