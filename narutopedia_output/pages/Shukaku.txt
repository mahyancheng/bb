Shukaku
 (
守鶴
), more commonly known as the
One-Tail
 (
一尾
,
Ichibi
), is one of the nine
tailed beasts
. It was last sealed within
Gaara
 of
Sunagakure
, after being sealed in two other
jinchūriki
 before him.

Background






The young tailed beasts with Hagoromo.



Shukaku and the tailed beasts first came into being in the waning days of
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
, who used his
Creation of All Things Technique
 to divide the
Ten-Tails
' chakra into nine separate bodies and giving each a name. Some time after being created, the Sage explained to the young tailed beasts that a link existed between them despite their separation. He also foretold of a day when they would be brought together again - though not as they were - and that at that time someone would emerge to show them what true power is.
 In the anime, before his death, Hagoromo sent Shukaku to live in a temple built for the purpose of protecting it in a desert region that would later become part of the
Land of Wind
.

Long before the
First Shinobi World War
, Shukaku was captured by disciples of a temple and kept in Sunagakure, to which the
First Kazekage
, who was invited along with other first Kage by
Hashirama Senju
 into the first
Five Kage Summit
, attempted to use his possession of the tanuki as leverage to gain wealth for his nation, as opposed to gaining another tailed beast.






Shukaku sealed in Bunpuku.



Shukaku's first
jinchūriki
 was a Suna priest named
Bunpuku
, who was locked away in a dungeon with the giant tea kettle, and was kept under constant guard. Over time, the citizens of Sunagakure came to believe that Shukaku itself was a
living ghost
 (
生霊
,
ikiryō
) of a corrupted priest sealed inside a tea kettle.
 Despite the animosity the village showed for Shukaku and its host, the elderly priest held no ill-will towards the tanuki nor the villagers, viewing it as an equal and was content as long as Shukaku hadn't forgotten his name. Shukaku eventually came to appreciate Bunpuku and would later remember the words he imparted to it: that someday someone would appear in the world to teach it about the heart and acceptance.
 Shukaku had another jinchūriki who inspired the
Third Kazekage
 to create his
Iron Sand

fighting style
.
 Shukaku was eventually removed from their bodies, resulting in their respective deaths.






Shukaku goes on a rampage after Gaara loses control.



When
Karura
 became pregnant with Gaara, her husband, the
Fourth Kazekage
, had
Chiyo
 seal Shukaku into Gaara while he was still in the womb because, out of his
three children
, Gaara was the only one compatible with the tailed beast.
 Before Karura died after giving birth, she passionately told her son that she would protect him, and, according to her husband, her love seeped into the sand and was noted to form his automatic defence.
 However, Gaara couldn't properly
control
 Shukaku's powers, killing or injuring several of Suna's shinobi and citizens by accident. Shukaku would even cite its hatred toward humans, warning Gaara not to sleep too long if he didn't want to give Shukaku an opening. Deemed a failure, the Fourth Kazekage chose to test his son one last time, ordering
Yashamaru
 to assassinate him and also tell him that his mother never loved him, and that she was used as a human sacrifice for the sealing process. Gaara failed the test, fully releasing the rampaging Shukaku, to which the Fourth eventually used his
Gold Dust
 to subdue the tanuki.

Personality






Shukaku threatening a young Gaara.



Shukaku is characterised as a childish and short-tempered individual, and often speaks in a bombastic and incoherent manner, giving it the demeanour of a drunkard. It uses "ore-sama" (
オレ様
,
literally meaning:
 my esteemed self) when referring to itself, as it expresses great pride in its own abilities, especially its sealing techniques and defences.
 According to Gaara, prior to its introduction, Shukaku relishes the opportunity to kill anyone in sight, even more so during a full
moon
.
 Shukaku has also shown to harbour a bitter grudge towards
Kurama
 due to the fox's beliefs that the tailed beasts' strength is measured by the number of tails, therefore viewing the tanuki as the weakest.
 Because of this, Shukaku strives to find any opportunity to surpass its arrogant rival.

Shukaku's hatred towards humans appears to stem from centuries of being viewed and treated as a monster that must either be destroyed or captured and weaponized. This led it to spark fear in whomever was its
jinchūriki
, reminding them that if they go into a deep sleep, the tanuki would possess their body and murder all humans; this resulted in Gaara's developing insomnia. Rude as Shukaku can be, it could still be respectful to those who show genuine respect and kindness to the tanuki, as seen from its original harsh attitude toward
Bunpuku
; when its jinchūriki treated the tanuki as an equal, an impressed Shukaku complimented him by comparing him to the Sage of Six Paths. Likewise, during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, as Gaara defiantly fought to protect Shukaku from being sealed and openly thanked Shukaku for helping him find his path in life, Shukaku came to see Gaara in a similar light to Bunpuku and fought to protect Gaara just as earnestly.

Years after the Fourth Great Shinobi War, Shukaku's relationship with Sunagakure was relatively peaceful as it mellowed down. As with the other tailed beasts, Shukaku also came to respect Naruto as well, commenting on his son
Boruto
 with interest when he displayed a similar drive. Shukaku is also not above developing affection as after Naruto's daughter
Himawari
 risked her own safety to save Shukaku, the tanuki began enjoying her company and when finally leaving, bid her a genuine and friendly goodbye.

Appearance






A young Shukaku.



Shukaku is a sandy-brown coloured
tanuki
, with black (dark blue in the anime)
cursed seal
 markings all over its face, body, and tail. It has a jagged, concave mouth with no tongue, and the sclerae of its eyes are black, with yellow irides and pupils that each takes the shape of a black four-pointed star with four black dots around it. During the last days of the Sage of Six Paths, Shukaku in its youth looked the basically same as it does presently, only much smaller with shorter ears and more spaced out markings.

Shukaku creating a Tailed Beast Ball.



Shukaku is such a potential threat, As a precaution, if its jinchūriki lost control and fully transformed into Shukaku inside of Suna, the villagers were to either evacuate beforehand or seek shelter due to the risk of mass casualty from its rampage.
 Shukaku's power is quite impressive to the likes of the
Ōtsutsuki Clan
, with
Urashiki Ōtsutsuki
 expressing glee in taking it.

Physical and Chakra Prowess

Shukaku has great physical strength while using its tail, as seen when overlapping it with the other tailed beasts to shatter and even obliterate a
senjutsu
-enhanced humanoid
Susanoo
.
 As a tailed beast, Shukaku possesses a large quantity of
chakra
. It also has powerful healing capacities, able to mend injuries in themselves and others in seconds.
 Likewise, Shukaku is effectively immortal, as when it dies, it will eventually revive, albeit in a younger form.

Ninjutsu

Shukaku has the ability to control its jinchūriki whenever they sleep, leading its host to develop
insomnia
.
 Like the rest of its kind, Shukaku can also perform the
Tailed Beast Ball
. It is capable of performing
fūinjutsu
 by using its natural cursed seal markings across its own sand body, which gives off a magnetic field to bind its targets. One of its techniques, the
Desert Layered Imperial Funeral Seal
, is strong enough to temporarily restrain and withstand powerful techniques, like the Susanoo.

Sand Manipulation






Shukaku enforcing a fūinjutsu with its curse seal markings.



Shukaku's most notable ability is its
sand
 manipulation, using it as an effective weapon and shield. Since its whole body is completely made of sand, the tanuki can ignore most damage that would otherwise be detrimental, as shown when it had one of its arms
chopped off
 by
Gamabunta
 and was still able to keep on fighting. Taking pride in its motto of absolute defence, Shukaku's sand is durable enough to block a senjutsu-enhanced Susanoo sword with ease.

Nature Transformation






Shukaku using Wind Release.



Shukaku can use
Wind
 and
Earth Release

nature transformations
. It can rapidly fire
wind bullets
 with enough force to level entire forests. Likewise, it can combine its wind abilities with Gaara's sand in order to produce a
mass of fast-moving sand bullets
. He could also charge these wind bullets to the point they could fire like a
Tailed Beast Ball
, and wipe out entire landscapes.
 Shukaku can combine wind and earth elements to use
Magnet Release
, and is the only tailed beast which can use
cursed seals
 from its markings and infuse them into the
Rasengan
 to create the
Sage Art: Magnet Release Rasengan
, which was powerful enough to restrain
Madara Uchiha
's
shadow
 when he was the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki.

Shukaku clashes with Gamabunta.



During the
Chūnin Exams
, Gaara partially transformed into Shukaku during his fight with
Sasuke Uchiha
, lashing out with the tailed beast's arm after being injured for the first time and terrifying Sasuke with a glimpse of its eye. During the
Konoha Crush
, Gaara later transformed into his
full Shukaku form
 during his fight with
Naruto Uzumaki
, who summoned
Gamabunta
 to counteract it.

When Gaara exposed himself on top of Shukaku's head and used the
Feigning Sleep Technique
, Shukaku took full control of its body and battled them. Shukaku's power was too much for Gamabunta to handle, resulting in both him and Naruto using the
Combination Transformation
 to take the form of a giant fox (the Nine-Tails in the anime). Gamabunta used the form's claws and teeth to grab and restrain Shukaku, in order for Naruto to wake Gaara up with a punch, which suppressed Shukaku's power.

Shukaku resists being extracted from within Gaara.



About two years after the Chūnin Exams in Konoha, another exam was held between Konoha and Suna. During this event, Gaara, was attacked by
Hōichi
, who used the
fūinjutsu
 of Bunpuku to subdue Gaara and begin transferring Shukaku's chakra into himself.

Ultimately, the extraction was stopped by the intervention of
Neji Hyūga
, who used his
Gentle Fist
 to block the chakra points from which Shukaku was being extracted, thereby repelling the chains.

During Gaara's time as the Fifth Kazekage,
Deidara
 and
Sasori
 from the
Akatsuki
 were assigned to capture Shukaku. During the battle between Gaara and Deidara, Gaara manifested Shukaku's arms several times to attack the Akatsuki member.

After Deidara defeated Gaara in combat and took him to Akatsuki's lair in the
Land of Rivers
, Shukaku was forcefully
extracted
 from Gaara and placed within the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
. Though the extraction killed him, Gaara was resurrected through
Chiyo
's
One's Own Life Reincarnation
 technique and has still retained the ability to control sand.

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki






The tailed beasts being freed from Obito.



Shukaku was the only tailed beast sealed within the Demonic Statue to have not been resealed into
Obito Uchiha
's
Six Paths of Pain
 and as such, did not meet Naruto during his encounter with the other tailed beasts. When Naruto proceeded in his plan to pull all the beasts from Obito's body in order to halt the tree form of the Ten-Tails' flower from blooming and completing the
Eye of the Moon Plan
, its chakra rejected Naruto as he contained none of the tanuki's chakra. Gaara, having been bonded with Shukaku, instead took hold and began pulling the chakra himself. Through the efforts of the Kazekage, Shukaku was freed from its captivity alongside the other tailed beasts. Upon being freed, Shukaku started to recognise Naruto. Despite showing reluctance to Gaara's request for its help in sealing
Madara Uchiha
, Shukaku decided to comply only for the opportunity to surpass Kurama.






The tailed beasts working together to attack Madara.



When Madara ran towards them and the other tailed beasts, both Shukaku and Gaara conjured
numerous sand bullets
 and were able to restrain the Uchiha's movements. Using the opportunity to attack, the tailed beasts each took a swing at their opponent, giving the sand-manipulating duo an opening to use their
Desert Layered Imperial Funeral Seal
, but Madara managed to escape the sand pyramid with his Susanoo. As Naruto in
Tailed Beast Mode
 pinned Madara down with a tail, Shukaku and the other tailed beasts joined in and did the same to increase the damage, but the Uchiha survived their attacks and retreated to a safe distance. After he received his own right Rinnegan eye from a White Zetsu clone, Madara quickly summoned the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path from Obito's body, and used the Rinnegan to
repel
 the tailed beasts.






Shukaku protecting Gaara from Madara's attack.



With the tailed beasts stunned, Madara then proceeded to
chain
 them up and prepared to seal them back into the statue. As Madara began the process on Shukaku, Gaara
intervened
, declaring his refusal to let Madara get his former tailed beast. Shocked at how determined Gaara was to protect Shukaku despite their negative past, the tanuki remembered
Bunpuku
's words of wisdom. From that, it also recalled Gaara explaining that he'd been grateful to Shukaku as it was thanks to the tanuki that Gaara had met his first friend, Naruto. As Madara launched an attack on Gaara, Shukaku quickly blocked the attack for its former jinchūriki. Despite their new-found team-work, Madara still rebuffed their efforts and all the tailed beasts were resealed within the Demonic Statue.






The tailed beasts reunite with Hagoromo and Naruto.



Later, after Madara succeeded in becoming the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, a reformed Obito managed to steal some of Shukaku's chakra along with some of Gyūki's. Then Obito sealed the
Yin
 half of Kurama into a dying Naruto to save his life, Obito also sealed Shukaku and Gyūki chakra portion into Naruto. Inside Naruto's subconscious, Shukaku, Gyūki, and Yin-Kurama found the young jinchūriki talking with the spirit of
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
. As the other six tailed beasts manifested to join in the meeting, they all voiced their shared belief to the Sage that Naruto was the child of prophecy. As Naruto fought Madara, Shukaku aided him by lending its Magnet Release chakra, allowing Naruto to use a juinjutsu technique against Madara.

Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes

Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes






The tailed beasts being freed from the Ten-Tails.



After Madara's ambitions were cut short by
Black Zetsu
, who revealed to be the silent manipulator of shinobi history since it was first created by
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
, the black entity used Madara's body as a medium to resurrect its creator. During the battle against the tyrannical princess, Shukaku and the other tailed beasts continued to support Naruto by giving him
their combined power
 to overwhelm her. Ultimately, Kaguya was defeated by Naruto and Sasuke, who used the
Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei
 to eject all the tailed beasts from her and seal her away inside a newly-created
moon
 within her own
dimension
.

After the spirits of Hagoromo and the past Kage summoned both the tailed beasts and
Team 7
 back to the real world, the tailed beasts began to discuss their plans for the future since they were finally free. Sasuke, however, made his own intentions known: removing as many people as possible who could get in the way of his plans of leading the world through a revolution to do away with current shinobi systems, including killing all the current Kage and tailed beasts. Just as Sasuke swiftly
subdued
 the tailed beasts with his Rinnegan and sealed them within his
Chibaku Tensei
, Naruto reassured the tailed beasts that he would save them once again. After Naruto was able to defeat and reform Sasuke, the two dispelled the Infinite Tsukuyomi and Sasuke released Shukaku, along with the other tailed beasts, from their prisons.

After having never initiated contact with Gaara since the two parted ways, Shukaku
contacted
 the Kazekage to inform him that it had lost contact with

One-Tail Escort Arc






Shukaku facing Urashiki.



In the anime, as Gaara was battling
Urashiki Ōtsutsuki
, Shukaku arrived to aid its former host. Together, the two were able to
seal
 away the foe. Knowing that the seal won't hold Urashiki for long, it was decided that
Kankurō
,
Shinki
, and
Boruto Uzumaki
 escort Shukaku to Konoha for its safety while Gaara would return to Suna to recover. Also during which, to make sure Urashiki would not sense its chakra, Shukaku willingly sealed itself inside a small tea kettle. However, the seal still allowed Shukaku to move about as a miniature version of itself, wearing the kettle like an armour. During their journey, they were intercepted by four of Urashiki's puppets. Kankurō decided to face the threat alone, while Boruto and Shinki went on ahead with Shukaku.

Along the way, Boruto was amazed at how cold Shinki was. Shukaku noted that Gaara was a lot like this back in the day, until Naruto's kindness swayed him to find a better path. Soon afterwards, they noticed a massive explosion from the battlefield. While Shinki insisted to move on, Boruto refused leave Kankurō when he needed them most, saying it would be a trashy thing to do. Boruto went back, while Shinki continued on with Shukaku. Before long, they were engaged by one of Urashiki's
puppets
. While Shukaku was concerned about this threat, Shinki was determined to avenge Kankurō.

Quickly, the puppet proved itself to be very versatile and dangerous as is easily breached Shinki's defenses and injected him with a paralysing poison. Shinki was forced to retreat with Shukaku, but was saved by the timely arrival of Boruto, Shikadai and Temari. While Shikadai and Temari held off the puppet, Boruto helped Shinki and Shukaku to safety. There, Boruto apologised to Shinki for calling him uncaring about his uncle, but still insisted that one should never willingly sacrifice an ally, proving his belief by returning to help Shikadai and Temari. Shukaku found the whole event very exciting, viewing Boruto to be similar yet smarter and more skilled than his father was at the time. It decided to watch the fight, but Shinki quickly picked up the tanuki and resumed his mission to Konoha.

After Boruto caught up with Shukaku and Shinki, they were soon intercepted by Urashiki. While the genin knew they were no match for him, they were able to pull off a strategy to again temporarily
seal
 him. Knowing Urashiki would soon escape and intercept them again at the border to the Land of Fire, they decided Boruto would distract Urashiki with a clone disguised as Shinki and carrying an empty tea kettle while Shukaku and Shinki went on ahead. During the plan, Shukaku noticed how hesitant he was with this plan that had a high chance with death for Boruto.

Once arriving at the border of the Land of Fire, Shukaku and Shinki were intercepted by
Mirai Sarutobi
 who interrogated Shinki for unsanctioned entrance. While Shinki refused to answer questions to a shinobi not above chūnin,
Sai Yamanaka
 arrived, whose high-ranking prompted Shinki to explain the situation. Sai took over delivering Shukaku to Naruto. Once arriving at the Hokage's office, Shukaku explained the situation for Boruto. Before the Hokage left, Sasuke arrived to reveal that he already rescued Boruto and Urashaki had escaped. They decided to keep Shukaku at Naruto's home for protection.






Himawari playing with Shukaku.



Upon arriving to meet Boruto's family,
Himawari
 immediately took a liking the miniaturised tailed beast, treating the tanuki as a talking Shukaku toy and kept it close to her. While Shukaku found the girl's attachment annoying, it was intrigued to learn that she once knocked out Kurama. Hoping to learn how she did as a chance to have some mocking rights on the fox, Shukaku decided to play nice with the young girl. Ultimately however, when learning that Himawari had no knowledge of the incident, Shukaku quickly turned cold again and told her to leave it alone, much to her sadness. While alone and taking a nap, its tea kettle form was mistaken for trash and taken to a scrapyard. As Shukaku was on the verge of being throwing into a trash compactor, Himawari, who was desperately looking for the tanuki, activated her
Byakugan
 again and quickly saved Shukaku. Amazed at how genuinely concerned Himawari was for it, Shukaku became kinder to her and openly admitted to Kurama that humans can be very entertaining. Later, when Naruto proceeded to move Shukaku to a new safehouse, the tanuki waved Boruto and Himawari goodbye with its tail.

Trivia

A
tanuki
 (
狸
,
literally meaning:
 raccoon dog) is a popular animal
yōkai
 in Japanese folklore and is famous for its mischievous nature and abilities to shape-shift. They are also said to be rivals to the
kitsune
, which created an old Japanese proverb: "A fox and a tanuki matching their cleverness" (
狐と狸の化かし合い
,
kitsune to tanuki no bakashi ai
), meaning two sly characters trying to outsmart one another. Shukaku being sealed inside a
tea kettle
 is a reference to one Japanese tale called
Bunbuku Chagama
. In addition, Shukaku being claimed to be a corrupted Suna priest earlier in the series, has ties to a legend in
Kenchō-ji
 of a tanuki disguised as the shrine's priest.

Furthermore, "Shukaku" (
守鶴
), which literally means "protector crane", was also the name of the
tanuki
 featured in
Bunpuku Chagama
.

Shukaku is the first tailed beast to have its name revealed in the series. In addition, Shukaku is the only tailed beast that hasn't been shown giving its jinchūriki the characteristic red chakra-shrouds (
Version 1
 or
Version 2
 forms). This is presumably because Shukaku appeared early in the story as a sand spirit, since Kishimoto had not yet created the idea of multiple tailed beasts and Shukaku being one of them.

When chapter 629 was first released, Shukaku's image was seen among the tailed beasts, despite not having the chance to give Naruto its chakra like the others, suggesting an error.
 In the tankōbon version, it was removed.
