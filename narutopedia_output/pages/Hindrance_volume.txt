Ato
)

Boruto
 explains the details of his resurrection to
Amado
,
Katasuke
, and
Sai
, according to what he learned from
Momoshiki
. While they understand that Momoshiki can no longer resurrect through Boruto, Amado stresses that the issue of his consciousness taking over remains. Katasuke points out the meds have worked so far, but Boruto claims he doesn't need them anymore. Unable to explain himself properly, he says he feels different from before, and better able to channel Momoshiki's power.
Sumire
,
Shikamaru
,
Ibiki
, and
Naruto
 watch over
Kawaki
, still sleeping, but healed of all injuries. Shikamaru had Sumire check on Kawaki because he's unwilling to let Amado near him before interrogating him. Ibiki questions the decision not to restrain Kawaki, but Shikamaru counters that between
Sukunahikona
 and
Kāma
, Kawaki can escape any restraints they attempt to place on him, so all they can do is avoid antagonising him. His goal is simply to protect Naruto, so they hope he remains their ally. Naruto intends to have a long talk with Kawaki when he wakes up. Sumire notices the heavy atmosphere and asks Shikamaru about it.
 He attributes it to Naruto having just avoided death.
Sasuke
 arrives with intel on
Code
, having discovered a secret facility few in
Boro
's
Ōtsutsuki Cult
 knew about in the
Land of Snow
. He lists its supposed activities, including
scientific ninja tool
 research
Kara
 didn't know about. It also functioned as a disposal facilities for the cyborgs
Jigen
 ordered to be scrapped. Sasuke says an acquaintance of Code's named
Bug
 is there. Sasuke says he heard about Kawaki, and Shikamaru confirms it, adding only
Ino
, Sai, Amado, and Katasuke know about it, still deciding how to proceed. Sasuke wants to see Boruto. At the Land of Snow facility,
Ada
 reviews the events after Code's retreat, and reveals Boruto's resurrection through Momoshiki's Kāma. She could determine Boruto and Momoshiki communicated, speculating they did so in some sort of spiritual plane her
Senrigan
 can't monitor. Code takes it as good fortune, and Ada warns him she's displeased with him using
Daemon
 without her permission. She reminds him his job is to bring Kawaki to her, and that even after he regains his strength, if she determines him to be even a hindrance to her, she and Daemon will dispose of him. Code claims sadness for she doesn't even consider them comrades, and reminds her of the measures he took, hearing through a
Claw Mark
 he placed on Shikamaru's nape. Shikamaru checks on Amado alone, whose analysis confirms Boruto's situation.
Sarada
 and
Mitsuki
 check on Boruto's scar, and Mitsuki asks why Code would try to kill him. Unable to tell him the truth, Boruto claims Code had poor self-control, and didn't seem to think too far ahead. Sarada is concerned he'll be targeted as he's fully
Ōtsutsuki
 now. Sasuke arrives, adding he shouldn't go anywhere alone. He also determines that since Kawaki can challenge Code, he'll want his power limiters lifted, so he'll target Amado. Shikamaru gets rough with Amado, asking why he restored Kawaki's Kāma on his own and without his consent. Amado says Kawaki loathes Kāma and would never consent, but wanted power to protect Naruto nonetheless. The Kāma's manifestation required Kawaki's will, so it ultimately is something he wanted, and points out Shikamaru is alive because of it. Unwilling to let him dodge the question, he asks why he's so obsessed with Kawaki's Kāma. Code emerges from the Claw Mark on Shikamaru. Ada think the conversation was just getting interesting. Code slams Shikamaru at the wall and holds Amado by the throat. He orders Amado to lift his power limiters, and Amado says his intrusion will be instantly
detected
. Code surprises him by knowing all it takes is for Amado to look him in the eyes and issue a command. Ino detects Code and
contacts
 Shikamaru. He tells her to inform Naruto, but not to send anyone yet, Code came because it's just them, asks her to keep monitoring them, and wait for his signal. He
paralyses
 Code, who can still wiggle his fingers enough to kill Amado. Shikamaru reveals he was aware of Code's Claw Mark on him, and commands a cyborg in Amado's lab to awake revealing a new
Delta
 model, reprogrammed to protect
Konoha
. Shikamaru orders her to attack Code. She pins him against a wall with her leg. Shikamaru reveals he baited Code into coming. He spots Code reaching into a Claw Mark, and forces his hand out to stop him from escaping. Code says he's not escaping, and pulls Ada through, shocking Amado.

" (

Amado
 is surprised to see
Ada
 is alive. She mocks him, and
Shikamaru
 notices Amado is terrified, wondering who and what Ada is. Considering her an enemy as she's with
Code
,
Delta
 prepares to kick her with her free leg, but stops before hitting Ada. Ada points out Delta is flashing her. She obeys Ada as she commands her to release Code, shocking Shikamaru. He asks Delta what's happening, but she has no idea. Shikamaru asks
Ino
 for backup.
Sasuke
 apologises to
Boruto
 for failing to keep his promise when
Momoshiki
 took him over, which forced
Kawaki
 to take on that role. Sasuke explains only a few people know Kawaki killed him, which he considers fortunate as many already disapprove of Kawaki. Boruto thinks they shouldn't hate Kawaki as he asked for it, but Sasuke counters that whoever kills him will be hated. Boruto says he could only have asked Kawaki, and Kawaki was only able to do it because they're brothers. Boruto thanks Sasuke for his
forehead protector
, which helped firm his resolve and attempts to return it. Since it helped, Sasuke gifts it to him, even if Boruto thinks it's precious memento between Sasuke and
Naruto
. Boruto puts it on, elated.
 Sasuke is concerned he'll be the next to have to show resolve.
Sarada
 and
Mitsuki
 watch from afar, wondering what they're talking about. They think Boruto could have died, and Mitsuki gets chills thinking of being absent when Boruto needed help, and wonders what he'd do if someone tried to kill him. Sarada feels a mix of shock, relief, and anger over what happened. She doesn't blame Boruto, but wonders if they're so undependable. Mitsuki asks if Sarada likes Boruto, catching her off guard, and she says her wanting to do more for him is independent on the presence or absence of feelings. She points out Mitsuki's eyes light up when it comes to Boruto, and complains that Sasuke is her father first before being Boruto's teacher. Mitsuki says they need to get stronger to face the
Ōtsutsuki
, and she adds she also needs it to be
Hokage
. Kawaki wakes up in a room with
Sumire
 and Naruto, who comments it reminds him of the first time they met. He asks Naruto if he came to talk about old memories, and Naruto asks Sumire to have her leave the room. Before she leaves, he asks Naruto if he condemns him for killing Boruto, shocking her. Naruto reveals Boruto is alive thanks to the
Kāma
. Naruto is thankful he was there, otherwise they might all be dead, and adds that Boruto feels the same. As Naruto assures Kawaki he belongs in
Konoha
, Ino
contacts
 him and Sasuke, reporting Code and Ada's invasion. Sasuke tells Boruto of the attack, and the two move out. Naruto claims to have forgotten an urgent matter, and confirms to Sumire that Boruto is fine. Kawaki focuses on his Kāma, manifesting
Isshiki's dōjutsu
. Shikamaru
paralyses
 Ada, who is surprised he can take action against her, reasoning it's possible because his attack inflicts no harm. Shikamaru notices they're all experiencing consequences of Ada's ability, and asks Ino to connect with him Amado, which she does. He informs Amado of their communication, and warns him not to give it away, before asking about Ada and her ability. Amado informs him they're all Ada's captives, having been enchanted by her, that Ada herself has no control over it, and the effect lasts until she dies. Delta is infatuated with her. Shikamaru wants to kill her, but Amado says it's futile. She tells him to relax, and he struggles to maintain his jutsu, his will impressing her. Amado warns him that resistance might damage his mind. He drops his
kunai
 and releases his jutsu. Shikamaru thinks of the danger if Naruto and Sasuke were to come into the room. Code begins torturing Amado. Shikamaru asks Ada her motive, if she has a grudge against Konoha. She answers Code's reasons are personal to him, and admits she's helping him because she likes Kawaki. In exchange for helping restore his power, he'll help her with Kawaki. Shikamaru asks Ino to change to access codes to the room, and stall the backups he requested. Ada thinks Shikamaru finds her foolish, but he says he's just surprise, and makes a proposition to her. If she comes over to Konoha, they can help each other, and she can tell Kawaki how she feels. Code is shocked by it.

Ada
 pauses to consider
Shikamaru
's offer as he reiterates the
Kawaki
 angle. She activates her
Senrigan
, and
Code
 protests against being left behind, but Ada tells him she has every right to consider it. Shikamaru wonders what she's doing with her eye.
Naruto
 arrives at the door, but is unable to open it. Shikamaru contacts him through
Ino
's
jutsu
, explaining it's a precaution against the enemy's jutsu, and asks him not to interfere or force his way through the door.
Sasuke
 and
Boruto
 arrive as well. Ada asks Shikamaru if she locked Naruto and the others outside to protect them from her ability, shocking him with her knowledge. In thought, he understands it's about her eye, and
Amado
 chimes in, filling him in on the Senrigan's abilities. Shikamaru is very glad for Ino's jutsu. Ada confesses being surprised by his offer, having assumed they'd see her as an enemy over being part of
Kara
, and concedes there's no cause for hostility between her and
Konoha
. Shikamaru adds that if she continues to ally herself with Code, she will be considered an enemy.
Sumire
 asks Kawaki how's the situation after what happened between him and Boruto.
 He says Amado restored the
Kāma
 without his permission, which Sumire speculates happened when his arm was repaired. He confesses he did want it back, and was glad to have it for the first time, as Naruto would be dead otherwise, admitting he needs it. Sumire shares her suspicions about Amado. Code continues torturing Amado, blaming his stalling for the turn of events, and demands the command code. In thoughts, Amado warns Shikamaru he won't last long, who instead points out that Code can't kill him before getting the code, otherwise he'll never get rid of the limiters. Amado thinks he'll die of shock first. Ada suddenly tells Code they have to retreat because Kawaki is coming towards them. Shikamaru realises that Kawaki can
shrink himself
 and enter the room through an air vent. Code is frustrated by it, and Shikamaru attributes it to Kawaki being able to nullify his
Claw Marks
. Amado adds that Ada's enchantment doesn't work on blood relatives or
Ōtsutsuki
. Shikamaru is angry he didn't share that before. Amado thinks Shikamaru would call Kawaki to fight, but he almost died before when it was just Code without Ada, and he can't risk Kawaki dying. He thinks that Shikamaru would find advantageous if Code or Kawaki or both died fighting each other. Ino reminds them it's not time to argue. Amado wants to let Ada and Code retreat, as they'll have another chance, and in the mean time both Boruto and Kawaki can get stronger. Code sends Amado through a Claw Mark, though he wishes he could avoid taking him to their base. Ada hurries him, but Shikamaru
paralyses
 Code with his shadow, and asks Ino where is Kawaki. Ada asks
Delta
 for help, so she kicks Shikamaru, who dodges, but loses focus on his jutsu. As she leaves, Ada apologises, thanking him for his offer and Delta for her help. She hopes them meet again and tells Delta she loves her. Delta reciprocates it. Code tells Shikamaru he's been added to his revenge list, and leaves. Kawaki arrives and grows back to normal size. He notices the Claw Marks and asks where Code is. Shikamaru requests that he gets rid of the marks, and believes Amado might already be dead when Kawaki asks about him. Back in their base,
Daemon
 greets Amado. He confirms that Code will most likely kill him after having the power limiters rescinded. Amado says that's poor motivation, but Code thinks that freedom from pain and peace in death are too good for him. Amado offers to remove his limiters without any resistance if he's spared. Code wonders if he has no pride, but Amado considers it an useless concept. Code tells him to stop wasting time, and Amado issues a command. Code releases some smoke, his appearance changing a bit, including white eye lashes. He feels good feeling like he can't lose to anyone. He asks Amado if his wounds hurt, and feeling good, offers to free him from suffering with death, lifting his clawed arm.

Bug
 watches
Amado
 at
Code
's mercy. Amado wants to talk to
Ada
 about
Kawaki
, which stays Code. Amado explains that Kawaki is his ace in case
Konoha
 abandons or tries to eliminate him. She asks for elaboration, but Code thinks he's bluffing and stalling for time. Ada tells Code not to interrupt, and he thinks Amado is trying to manipulate her. Code says that with Kawaki being off limits, she can't deny him Amado as well. Ada signals
Daemon
 to act, and he holds Code in place. Code's
killing intent
 is reflected on him as a couple cuts. He evades Daemon with a
Claw Mark
. Ada asks if Code attacked Daemon with intent to kill, and he says she can't complain when she fired the first shot. She reminds him she said she'd dispose of him if he ended up being a hindrance, which confuses him. Amado points out that she has an invitation from Konoha as a way of getting close to Kawaki, which is hindered by her association with Code. Code accuses him of tricking Ada and attacks him, but Daemon gets in between them, reflecting his attack. Daemon says that if he can't understand when Ada tells him to stop, he needs to be disposed of.
 In Konoha,
Shikamaru
 explains Ada's enchanting to
Naruto
,
Sasuke
,
Boruto
, and Kawaki. Sasuke wonders if she's a cyborg relic like Code, and Shikamaru recalls Amado explaining that several cyborgs stronger than
Jigen
 had been scrapped. Ada seems to be one of these based on Amado's reaction, and not the only one, mentioning that Code used someone who wasn't Ada to counter Kawaki during their fight the previous night. Code asks Ada to rein Daemon in. She says she's grateful for releasing her, which is why she helped restore his power, but it's time to call it a day. Code tells her he loves her, and asks if she doesn't need his power. She doesn't care for his attitude, and real or not, she has had enough of his feelings. Daemon teases Code, saying that
Ōtsutsuki
 or anyone else, he'll protect his sister. Code realises Ada only needs one knight, him. He intends to best Daemon, who dares him to try. Bug reveals to Code that Daemon's reflection ability only works when he's touching someone else with his hands, hoping that with the knowledge and his restored powers, Code and Daemon take each other out. Daemon has the upper hand as they fight, mocking Code's earlier claim of feeling he couldn't lose. He admits Code seems stronger than Jigen, so neither Naruto or Sasuke should trouble him, but Daemon considers himself stronger than any of them. Code prepares to flee, and Ada is ok with it as long as he doesn't get in her way, promising to have him killed if warranted. Code states his goal, the will he inherited from
Isshiki
, and says that once he's an Ōtsutsuki and her ability doesn't work on him, he'll truly know if he loves her or wants her dead. He escapes, taking Bug with him. Ada mockingly commends Amado for getting out of a difficult situation and separating her and Code, though he points out she also wanted a reason to cut Code off. She claims she just wants to hear the rest of his story, ready to kill him if he's bluffing. He reiterates Kawaki is his ace as Daemon jumps to ride him. He continues, explaining that Kawaki has regained his
Kāma
 and now has access to Isshiki's abilities, his power likely to keep growing. As such, no one in Konoha can oppose him, except for Amado. She realises Amado has given Kawaki something other than Kāma. He reveals he's given Kawaki an emergency shutdown command only he can see. Because Kawaki concerns not only Konoha, but other villages as well, they have no choice but to rely on Amado. Ada accuses him of solving problems he created, and asks why he didn't implant such a command before. He explains that Jigen forbade him from doing that to his precious vessel. Daemon is confident he can beat Kawaki, and she wonders if Amado died, Konoha could rely on them. Amado finds her point interesting, but adds it's insurance for his standing, his goal being different, and requiring Kawaki's Kāma. She tells him he still hasn't answered her question, and he says it'll take a long time, asking if she can wait until they're in Konoha. He elaborates that she should accept Shikamaru's offer to build a relationship with Kawaki. She and Daemon are puzzled by the idea, and Amado assures them he'll mediate. Elsewhere, Bug complains about Code taking him, though Code saw it as rescuing him instead of leaving him to die. Code blames Kawaki for everything, for taking everything he cares about. He vows to kill Kawaki and wreck everything he holds dear, including the
Hokage
, his friends, and Konoha.

Author's Note

“

Just like humans, cats come with an infinite variety of personalities. My cats hate to be held... I'm lucky if they tolerate a few seconds of it. What's depicted in this drawing is my dream of dreams.

But this particular cat, while hating to be held, does like riding around on a human's back. But only a chosen few are allowed this. I am occasionally so utilized as a taxi and get to feel paw pads on my back.
