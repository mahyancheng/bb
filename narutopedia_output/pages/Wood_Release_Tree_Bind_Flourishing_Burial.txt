This technique lets the user summon a tree around their opponent to bind them. This technique is relatively powerful and holds opponents much more gracefully, with less of a strain on the user, because the user sinks them into the ground. Afterwards, the user can enclose the opponent so that their body is crushed.

This technique requires some preparation as Yamato first had to crush the earth and then add water before this technique could be used.
