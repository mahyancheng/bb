Mifune slashes at his opponent a couple times, jumps up, and upon landing, the impact makes the ground in front of him rise up, with a slab of rock sending his opponent up in the air.

Trivia

This technique is a reference to a trick that has been used by shinobi, which involves flipping a
tatami
 to block incoming projectile attacks. Ironically enough, this technique is part of a samurai's arsenal, not a ninja's.
