Ryūsui
 (
リュウスイ
) is a
genin
 from
Amegakure
.

Background






Ryūsui unveils Ajisai's corpse.



He and
Yūdachi
 were the ones delivering corpses to the
highest tower in Amegakure
, where Pain allegedly resides. Their most recent delivery was the corpse of what would be the
second Animal Path
.

Personality

Ryūsui is highly loyal towards Pain and Amegakure, looking up to Pain with admiration due to him protecting the village and will swiftly admonish anyone insulting or even complaining about him. He is also a proud person, refusing to betray his comrades during interrogation, though this seems only to be on a superficial level, given that he squealed moments later due to fear of being forcefully transformed. Ryūsui also seems to harbour resentment towards outsiders who don't know anything about his home country. His
wife
 saw him as being somewhat of a cheapskate.

Appearance

Ryūsui has a long chin-length light brown hair and light-coloured eyes. He wears a black bandanna
Amegakure

He wears a black long sleeved shirt with a white belt around the black shirt. He also wears a pair of short black pants with bandages below on his legs. He also wears a pair of black shinobi sandals.

Abilities

According to
Jiraiya
, he had genin-level skills.

Part II

Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant






Ryūsui and Yūdachi being held captive by Jiraiya.



He and his partner, Yūdachi were captured by
Jiraiya
. When they refused to tell Jiraiya any information on Pain, even after tickle torture on his partner, he
transformed Yūdachi into a frog
, which frightened Ryūsui into divulging information about Pain. Jiraiya then tried to
control
 Ryūsui in an attempt to find Pain, but was found by
Konan
. Ryūsui then followed Konan's orders to leave and was able to escape.

Trivia

Quotes

(To
Jiraiya
) "
Go ahead, make me a frog or whatever! I'm not telling one more damned thing! Even us underlings have our pride, that of a shinobi… ! I don't have anything else to tell an outsider who doesn't know a thing about our country!
"
