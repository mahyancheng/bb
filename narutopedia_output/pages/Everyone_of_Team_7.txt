Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Sasuke
 attacks
Kakashi
 with
Susanoo
, which Kakashi blocks with
Kamui
. Sasuke lashes out at Kakashi for his use of the
Sharingan
, evidence that
Konoha
 continues to profit from the
Uchiha clan
's
demise
. Sasuke promises to make him and the rest of the village pay for that, just as
Danzō
 has. His hatred causes Susanoo to progress to a new level. It dissipates immediately afterwards, Sasuke's eyes finally succumbing to blindness. Sensing this,
Sakura
 sneaks up on Sasuke and tries to kill him. She cannot bring herself to strike him, but Sasuke does not have the same reluctance. Because he used Kamui, Kakashi cannot reach her in time. She is instead saved by
Naruto
.

Trivia

This is the first chapter since
chapter 176
