" (

) is episode 183 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Delta
 is called by
Code
, who is leisurely waiting alone. They trade barbs before about the
vessel
's retrieval before
Amado
 arrives. He reveals
Victor
's treachery and death to them.
Katasuke
 and
Team 7
 arrive at the research facility, which is headed by one of his juniors. They find
Nue
 running around, but he is paralysed by
Akita Inuzuka
 using the
Shadow Imitation Technique
 through a
Shinobi Gauntlet
. Team 7 are surprised to see Nue and
Sumire
 there. Sumire explains some of her efforts to learn how to coexist with Nue as part of the research team. Akita is excited to have Katasuke's latest prototype to test. Despite their enthusiasm and Katasuke's insistence that how they're used matters,
Boruto
 remains unconvinced of scientific ninja tools' value.
 As part of their mission, Team 7 helps to test other tools, some of which Boruto even has fun testing. Tending to an injury Boruto sustained testing one of the tools, Sumire explains she wants to develop a tool to keep Nue from getting out of control so she can support the village, and lets him know that she'll be relocating back to
Konoha
 to act as Katasuke assistant. Boruto notices a plaque with Katasuke's creed of science being used to support others. Akita's ninken
Chamaru
 befriends Boruto, who notices he has a prosthetic leg. Akita explains she became Katasuke's assistant after he helped her ninken. Katasuke shows Boruto a prototype
chakra blade
, but it tires him quickly due to high chakra expenditure. Boruto concedes the tools have a role in supporting the village. Boruto has a call from his father. At
Kara
's headquarters, Amado does maintenance on Delta and Code, who continue to trade insults. They consider
Boro
 might have stolen the vessel before he checks in.
Naruto
 informs Boruto they've lost contact with
Konohamaru
 and
Mugino
, and has his team check on them, as they're the closest. Naruto is concerned that despite being two capable jōnin, they haven't been able to get in contact, and wonders if Kara might be responsible.
Sai
 and
Shikamaru
 shares his concern. Amado shows
Jigen
 the scans he made of the other Inners to identify the traitor among them. Code spies on them.
