Jiraiya
 (
自来也
) was one of
Konohagakure
's
Sannin
. Famed as a hermit and pervert of stupendous ninja skill, Jiraiya travelled the world in search of knowledge that would help his friends, the various novels he wrote, and, posthumously, the world in its entirety – knowledge that would be passed on to his godson and final student,
Naruto Uzumaki
.

Background






Hiruzen and his students.



After he graduated from Konoha's
Ninja Academy
, Jiraiya was teamed with
Orochimaru
 and
Tsunade
 under the leadership of
Hiruzen Sarutobi
, who he developed his ninja skills during his
genin
 years.
 Hiruzen gave them a
bell test
 for the team's first exercise, during which Jiraiya repeatedly fell for Hiruzen's tricks, and for failing to acquire a bell, he was tied to a stump as punishment. Hiruzen encouraged Jiraiya to be more like Orochimaru, but Jiraiya countered that his
Transparent Escape Technique
 was a fair testament to his skills, as he could spy on bathing women without getting caught: Hiruzen offered to accompany him to see if this was true.
 Jiraiya had a certain interest in Tsunade from their first meeting,
 and when her breasts developed, she became a frequent target of his peepings. She nearly killed him when she caught him on one occasion, forcing him to be more discreet about his interests.






Jiraiya and his students.



Jiraiya at some point discovered
Mount Myōboku
, the residence of the
toads
; in the anime, he was brought there when he tried to
summon
 a toad without first having a contract with them.

Fukasaku
 trained Jiraiya in their ways, most prominently
senjutsu
. While he was at Mount Myōboku, the
Great Toad Sage
 made a prediction about Jiraiya: that he would travel the world and during that time meet the
Child of the Prophecy
, a student who would grow up to either save or destroy the world depending upon how Jiraiya taught them.

At some point Jiraiya was made a
jōnin
 and led his genin students in
Team 6
. He started to suspect that one of them,
Minato Namikaze
, might be the Child of the Prophecy because of his natural genius.
 As such, he took Minato as his disciple and taught him many of his skills; Jiraiya also contributed to Minato's development of the
Rasengan
.






Hanzō dubs the Sannin.



Although their team under Hiruzen's leadership had disbanded, Jiraiya, Orochimaru, and Tsunade continued fighting together during the
Second Shinobi World War
. During one such fight in
Amegakure
, they were the only three to survive an encounter with
Hanzō
, for which accomplishment Hanzō dubbed them Konoha's "Legendary
Sannin
".
 After the battle,
three war orphans
 approached them and asked to be taught
ninjutsu
. Jiraiya, guilty for his involvement in the war, decided to stay in Ame for a time in order to look after them.
 Shortly after he joined them, he discovered that one of the orphans,
Nagato
, possessed the
Rinnegan
, once used by the
Sage of the Six Paths
 to save the world. Jiraiya decided that Nagato was the Child of the Prophecy, and as such agreed to teach the orphans ninjutsu so that he might guide Nagato towards the world's salvation.






Jiraiya training the Ame Orphans.



Nagato was a kind child, torn between his desire to not hurt others and his wish to protect
Yahiko
 and
Konan
. Jiraiya comforted Nagato that it was enough to want to protect people one holds to be important, as the world is plagued with seemingly endless conflict. Nagato decided that it was possible to end the constant bloodshed and, though he didn't know how, that he would someday find the path to peace. Jiraiya was inspired by Nagato's words and started writing what would become
The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi
. After three years of training the orphans, Jiraiya decided they were ready to forge out on their own and he returned to Konoha; he left them a finished copy of
Gutsy Shinobi
, dedicated to Nagato.
 News of the orphans' deeds would reach him from time to time, but eventually he heard that they'd all died.

Eventually, Jiraiya published his first novel,
The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi
. However, it did not sell well when released. Jiraiya found his writing style when he created the adult novels called
Icha Icha
. The novels were based on his personal experiences in love - particularly his rejections by Tsunade - retold in a comical way. The books were wildly popular, giving his chequebook a balance that is "filled with zeroes". Minato - selected as Konoha's Fourth
Hokage
 after Jiraiya refused the position
 - enjoyed Jiraiya's first book, finding the main character very much like Jiraiya. He decided to name his and
Kushina Uzumaki
's then-unborn son "
Naruto
" after the main character, hoping that their Naruto would be just as determined as the character (and thus its author). Jiraiya tried to convince them not to since that would make him Naruto's godfather, but Minato and Kushina insisted this was a good thing.
 Minato died during the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
, giving his life to
seal
 the
Nine-Tails
 into the newborn Naruto; as one of his last acts, Minato sent Jiraiya
Gerotora
, on whose stomach he wrote the key to Naruto's seal. Jiraiya guessed that Minato wanted him to help Naruto gain control of the Nine-Tails' power, though he couldn't guess what that power would be needed for.

Although Orochimaru had always been his better, someone that Hiruzen pointed to as an example for Jiraiya to live up to, Jiraiya considered Orochimaru to be one of his closest friends. For this reason, when Orochimaru eventually defected from Konoha, Jiraiya pursued him and tried to convince him to return. Orochimaru refused and attacked Jiraiya in order to secure his escape.
 For a time, Jiraiya tried to find a deeper meaning in Orochimaru's betrayal, something that, if changed, would bring Orochimaru back. He could ultimately come up with nothing.
 Orochimaru accused Jiraiya of being unable to understand him as his parents weren't killed.
 From that point onward, Jiraiya started following Orochimaru's movements as well as those of
Akatsuki
, an organisation which Orochimaru eventually joined. His investigations often took him away from the village, preventing Jiraiya from becoming Fifth Hokage like Hiruzen wanted him to.

In the anime, one night, Jiraiya entered the
Nadeshiko Village
 to do his "research" for his next novel only to be pursued by the
village leader
 who challenged him to a duel for his hand in marriage. As the match dragged on into the next day, Jiraiya called for the match to be postponed, as neither party was making headway against the other, to which the village leader grudgingly agreed. Jiraiya promised that
their

students
 instead should one day seek each other out and fight if the two never met again.

Personality






Jiraiya posing.



Jiraiya was generally light-hearted and gregarious, making jokes at his own expense and giving a mirthful laugh about it afterwards. In his interactions with others, he liked to pretend to be smug or selfish, upsetting them so that he could further rile them up with his humour.
 Even when entering combat he did not miss an opportunity to be flashy and over-the-top, striking
kabuki
 poses and giving dramatic self-introductions; these intros were often interrupted in some way, and Jiraiya was quick to express his annoyance at whoever was responsible. Friends and foes alike were fond of Jiraiya for his eccentricities, admiring that somebody so seemingly irreverent could in actuality be an extremely competent shinobi: he was deeply loyal to Konoha despite how often he is away from it, not hesitating to threaten to kill Tsunade if she betrayed the village, despite their long history. Jiraiya also demonstrated no hesitation in attempting to destroy his former best friend Orochimaru in retribution for the death of their teacher, nor in attempting to dispatch his former pupil Nagato when he learned Nagato was the true leader of Akatsuki, despite the pain it brought him. Jiraiya felt that his personality quirks render him incapable of being Hokage, as he either lacked the responsibility for the position or he had, through his past infractions and failures, proven unworthy of such an honour.

Despite being seen as an eccentric troublemaker in his youth, Jiraiya proved to be an exemplary and competent Shinobi. Jiraiya would establish a vast information network across the countries and in battle demonstrated the ability to both recognise and analyse threats and danger on short notice. Jiraiya was also capable of coming up with quick gambits and new strategies in the middle of battle based on his keen observations.

Jiraiya was a self-proclaimed super-pervert with no equal.
 His favourite hobby was spying on women while they bathe, a passion he flaunted openly and in fact took pride in because of how infrequently he was caught. Despite this, Jiraiya disliked it when
Naruto Uzumaki
 referred to him as the "Perverted Hermit" (
エロ仙人
,
Ero-sennin
,
English TV:
 Pervy Sage) in front of others. With the "research" from his peeping, he would use it as inspiriation for his novels. Despite his high-success as a novelist, this fact did not stop him from taking Naruto's money when he got the chance and spending it on alcohol and women. In the anime, Naruto ghost-writes an
Icha Icha
 book without anybody noticing, suggesting that either Naruto can write like an adult, or that Jiraiya's writing abilities were no better than a child's. Tsunade suspected it was the latter, as she notes that a report Jiraiya wrote when he was younger was poorly written and accompanied by crude crayon illustrations.






Jiraiya's perverted nature.



Jiraiya's perversion has backfired on him a number of times. When he first meets Naruto, he has no interest in training him. Naruto convinces him to change his mind by using the
Sexy Technique
, which Jiraiya so strongly approves of that he asks Naruto to continue to use it for the duration of their training.
Itachi Uchiha
 and
Kisame
 of
Akatsuki
 later hypnotise an attractive woman to lure Jiraiya away from Naruto so that they can try to capture him; though it works at first, Jiraiya quickly realises that women aren't usually attracted to him, allowing him to return to Naruto in time to rescue him. When he was younger, he spied on Tsunade while she was bathing and, when she caught him, she broke both of his arms, six of his ribs, and ruptured a number of organs as punishment. Ever since, he's used greater discretion in expressing his interests in Tsunade, careful to make his advances come off only as playful. Jiraiya considers his inability to win Tsunade's heart to be one of the greatest failures of his life. Despite his boisterous nature, Jiraiya was plagued by doubts and insecurities that his life was nothing more than a series of failures. Being unable to save Orochimaru weighed heavily on him, as did the deaths of his sensei the Third Hokage, and his student the Fourth Hokage. Jiraiya considered his achievements paltry things next to the previous four Hokage and desired a death as glorious as their own. In his final moments, Jiraiya expressed his pride in realising a heroic death that was "
just barely glorious, but glorious indeed
".

Despite his self-deprecation, one of Jiraiya's defining feature was his indomitable spirit and drive to never give up. Despite the multitude of failures he suffered in life, he never succumbed to despair, always forging ahead as he felt a shinobi must. Against Orochimaru, Jiraiya revealed his belief that the truest essence of the shinobi was one who endured and fought on no matter what they faced, regardless of inborn talent or genius. Even mortally wounded, Jiraiya's willpower was so powerful that he willed his own heart to begin beating again in order to impart a final message to Konoha and more importantly Naruto. He would pass these beliefs and drive on to his pupils.

Perhaps Jiraiya's greatest contribution to the world was his abilities as a teacher, something even he felt he failed in. Driven by the prophecy he would one day find the world's saviour, Jiraiya would mentor three of the most powerful shinobi in history, Nagato, Minato and Naruto, imparting his belief in the spirit of a shinobi to all three. While he could be harsh and distant to Naruto at first, Jiraiya held a genuine love for the boy and took time to make certain he acted like a parental figure as opposed to merely teacher and student, even buying ice cream to share with him when Naruto was depressed at his lack of a family. Even in death, Jiraiya's last thoughts were of Naruto, who he entrusted the world's salvation to. In the anime, before departing for the afterlife, Jiraiya's spirit would use its final moments to clap Naruto on the shoulder in a final show of affection.

While he rarely revealed it outwardly, Jiraiya was a great believer in peace and held a deep longing to change the hatred inherent in the world. While he desired to find an answer to the cycle of hatred that plagued the world, he was never been able to come up with a way to do so. He never had children of his own, for which reason he thought of Minato Namikaze as his son and, by extension, thought of Naruto as his grandson. Jiraiya stated simply that to be happy was not his fate;
 Tsunade doubted he believed his own words. Under his bluster, Jiraiya remained a fundamentally kind man who treasured those close to him, maintaining a strong faith in the next generation, especially those he personally trained and Naruto in particular, believing that Naruto would be able to create and enjoy the world that Jiraiya could only dream of. When he died, Jiraiya decided that, despite his numerous failures, the successes of his time with Naruto made everything worthwhile.

Appearance

Jiraiya's appearance for most of the series.
1/4

Jiraiya was a tall and well-built man in adulthood with fair skin. He had waist-length, spiky white hair that he usually ties back into a pony tail, with two shoulder-length bangs framing his face. There were red lines under his eyes which extended further down his face as he got older, going all the way to the bottom by the time he was an adult. By the time he was middle-aged, he developed wrinkles around the corners of his mouth and a wart (possibly a piercing in the manga
) on the left side of his nose. Following an encounter with Naruto's
Version 2
 form, he received a large scar that permanently remained in the centre of his chest.
 His usual attire consisted of a green short shirt kimono and matching pants, under which he wore mesh armour that is visible at his wrists and ankles. He also wore hand guards, a black belt, traditional Japanese
wooden sandals
, and a red
haori
 with two yellow circles on each side. He often carried a large scroll on his back, and had a tattoo on his left palm, and he wore a horned
forehead protector
 with the kanji for "oil" (
油
,
abura
), which denoted his affiliation with
Mount Myōboku
.

Abilities






Jiraiya attacks Pain with one of his strongest techniques.



Jiraiya was an exceptionally powerful shinobi, hailed as one of the greatest ninja of his generation and that Konoha ever produced. His true recognition came during the
Second Shinobi World War
 when proved able to compete against
Hanzō
 and his giant salamander
Ibuse
, and was dubbed a
Sannin
. Jiraiya's strength and fame were such that renowned groups like the
Uchiha Clan
 and
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
 would hesitate to confront him in direct combat.
Kisame Hoshigaki
 and
Itachi Uchiha
 both admitted that together, even with assistance, they would at best reach a stalemate.
 He was offered to become
Hokage
 three times,
 and would have been offered a fourth one had he lived longer.
 Kakashi, also among the most powerful shinobi Konoha ever produced, found the idea of Jiraiya being single-handedly defeated absurd. In truth, the assumed Akatsuki leader Nagato openly admitted that he would have lost if Jiraiya had prior knowledge of the
Six Paths of Pain
,
 which
Tobi
 felt is a major testament to the Sannin's abilities.
 Upon death, he became one of the individuals
Kabuto Yakushi
 most wanted to
reincarnate
 for war.
 Decades later, Jiraiya's might was still revered as a
clone
 was made of him.

Chakra and Physical Prowess

Jiraiya had
chakra
 reserves large enough to
summon

Gamabunta
 and chakra potent enough to use
senjutsu
. He was masterful with his chakra control, able to perform a
Rasengan
 in both hands at the same time, or even carve messages with his chakra despite it being
disrupted
. He also was knowledgeable enough of genjutsu to teach others how to break free from it. His raw might is also considerable, able to fling Naruto several metres with a single finger tap.
 In the anime, he was shown lifting and throwing large boulders,
 as well as kicking away some of the
Giant Multi-Headed Dogs
.

Jiraiya was also remarkably resilient, able to withstand a lot of damage before going down. He could survive a full on kick from
Might Guy
 with barely a scratch, and even attacks from summons as big as
Gamabunta
.
 Due to this resilience, he had only been brought to the brink of death twice: against
Naruto Uzumaki
's
Four-Tailed Form
 and
Tsunade
's monster strength, and even
Nagato
 had a difficult time inflicting lethal damage on his old master using the
Six Paths of Pain
.

Ninjutsu






Jiraiya spewing oil.



Jiraiya was a
ninjutsu
 master,
 that was feared across many different shinobi nations ever since the
Second Shinobi World War
.
 He was famed as the "Toad Sage" (
蝦蟇仙人
,
Gama Sennin
) because of his affiliation with the
toads
 of
Mount Myōboku
. This affiliation was most commonly displayed through the
Summoning Technique
 which Jiraiya was extremely proficient at. He could summon toads, either to fight alongside him in battle or simply summoning a special
toad's œsophagus
 to cover an area and restrict the movements of his enemies, it's considered nearly impossible to escape and over time the toad's œsophagus will contract around and digest its victims.
 Other toad-based skills include
spitting oil from his mouth
,
hiding himself
 within a target's shadow to control their actions undetected, and using toads to
infiltrate sensitive areas
.
Apart from his toad-based techniques, he was equally skilled in a variety of other styles. He could grow and manipulate his hair, either to
bind and destroy
 targets or to
surround him as a defence
, injuring any who comes into contact with him. He was also able to use the
Rasengan
 — a destructive ball of compressed chakra — as well as its improved version, the
Big Ball Rasengan
. His prowess with the Rasengan was shown to be comparable to the creator, Minato.






Jiraiya erecting a dome around himself.



Jiraiya was highly skilled at
fūinjutsu
, able to deduce the workings of Naruto's
Eight Trigrams Sealing Style
 within moments of seeing the seal's design. He also quickly notices the seal is being restricted by the
Five Elements Seal
, and as such
easily removes
 the restriction which
Orochimaru
 states would require someone as skilled as him or
Hiruzen Sarutobi
 to accomplish.
. He could create seals for others that they can use to suppress the chakra of those who have been applied with
Jiraiya's seal
. He also displayed a certain skill for
barrier ninjutsu
, erecting barriers to either
detect all movements
 within a wide radius or
toad-themed barriers
 for him to take shelter in. In the anime, he could also apply a seal on people that acts as a powerful protection from chakra-absorbing techniques.

Nature Transformation

Jiraiya could utilise
Fire
,
Earth
,
Water
,
Wind
,
Yin
 and
Yang Release
.
 He seemed to favour
Fire Release which he used to fight at range by shooting a powerful
blast of fire
,
 that he could combine with his toad's oil to make for an even more devastating
attack
.
 With Earth Release, he could create a
swamp
 that could sink massive snakes.
 He could also make
massive defensive walls
.

Senjutsu






Jiraiya in Sage Mode.



Jiraiya was taught how to use
senjutsu
 by
Fukasaku
, which he can use to increase his speed, durability, and physical strength.
 This enabled Jiraiya to utilize
Frog Kata
 style of
Taijutsu
 and it also empowered his
ninjutsu
, such as the
Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan
 or his
Fire Release: Big Flame Bullet
. Before he can gain these benefits, Jiraiya must enter
Sage Mode
, which he does not have complete mastery of. This causes his Sage Mode form to make him more toad-like in appearance, such as warts and elongated hands and feet, although his frog-like legs enable him to jump better. Using Sage Mode requires his supply of
natural energy
 be constantly replenished, something that is difficult to do while in combat. For this reason, Jiraiya summons Fukasaku and
Shima
 and
fuses them to his body
, having them gather natural energy for him. As an added bonus, Fukasaku and Shima can combine attacks with Jiraiya's, as with the
Sage Art: Goemon
, or they can perform jutsu that he can't, as with
genjutsu
.

Intelligence

Despite his goofy and eccentric nature, Jiraiya was actually very shrewd in the field. His specialty is intelligence gathering, having a spy network that runs throughout the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 that he can use to gain information about a particular person or group to be used to his or his allies' advantage. In combat, he is very perceptive; Jiraiya observes all of the opponents' various actions, forms a theory about the how and why, and uses that theory to try and capitalise in the battle.
 He has repeatedly proven to be a very talented teacher, as all his students went on to become very powerful and well-known shinobi. His memory is very good; as he was dying, he was able to craft a coded message using the page numbers of
Icha Icha Tactics
, with the first word on each page serving as his message.

Jiraiya defends his "research".



During an unannounced return to
Konoha
, Jiraiya visits the
Konoha Hot Springs
 in order to spy on the women bathing there. He is discovered by
Ebisu
 who, not realising who Jiraiya is at first, tries to stop him and reprimand him. Jiraiya uses a
toad
 to knock Ebisu out so that he won't interfere in his "research". Jiraiya is immediately confronted by
Naruto Uzumaki
, who Ebisu was training to improve his
chakra
 control and who now, because Ebisu is unconscious, needs somebody else to teach him. Jiraiya refuses to be that somebody until Naruto demonstrates his
Sexy Technique
, at which point Jiraiya eagerly agrees.






Jiraiya removes Orochimaru's seal from Naruto.



While watching Naruto struggle with his training, Jiraiya notices two things: Naruto is the
jinchūriki
 of the
Nine-Tails
; his access to the Nine-Tails' chakra is being restricted by the
Five Elements Seal
, which Jiraiya correctly guesses was placed by
Orochimaru
. Jiraiya removes the seal, making it easier for Naruto to control his chakra, and offers to start teaching him to use the Nine-Tails' power the next day. He informs Ebisu of this decision later that night. Ebisu doesn't mind, but asks that Jiraiya meet with the
Third Hokage
 so that, together, they can stop whatever Orochimaru is planning against Konoha. Jiraiya is unwilling to get involved.

In order to teach Naruto how to take advantage of the Nine-Tails' large chakra reserves, Jiraiya teaches Naruto the
Summoning Technique
, expecting him to use the Nine-Tails to summon bigger and bigger toads. Naruto is not only unable to tap into the Nine-Tails' chakra, but makes poor use of his own chakra, only managing to summon tadpoles. From talking to Naruto about his previous uses of the Nine-Tails, Jiraiya gathers that he needs to be in a life-or-death situation in order to instinctively draw on the Nine-Tails. When, after a month, Naruto is still only summoning tadpoles, Jiraiya puts Naruto in a life-or-death situation: he throws him into a ravine. Jiraiya is impressed when Naruto summons
Gamabunta
 to save himself, but decides to return to his "research" before Gamabunta notices him.

Orochimaru launches an
invasion of Konoha
, using
snakes
 to break through the village's defences and destroy its infrastructure. Jiraiya stops them with
Summoning: Food Cart Destroyer Technique
, crushing the snakes with
Gamahiro
. He then seeks out the Third Hokage to lend assistance in his fight with Orochimaru, but by the time he arrives the Third is dead and Orochimaru has fled. Jiraiya does not attend the Third's funeral a few days later, instead visiting the
Third Training Ground
 and crying over memories of the Third.

Search for Tsunade

Main article:
Search for Tsunade






Jiraiya is asked to become the Fifth Hokage.



Jiraiya was approached by the
Konoha Council
, who informed him that, due to the dire straits the villages had been left in following the invasion of Konoha, the
Land of Fire
's
daimyō
 had already approved Jiraiya's selection as Fifth
Hokage
. Jiraiya declined, but offered to find
Tsunade
 to have her take the position, which the councillors agreed with. Jiraiya asked to be allowed to take Naruto with him; as he explained it to Naruto's teacher,
Kakashi Hatake
, the organisation called
Akatsuki
 has been collecting
tailed beasts
 like Naruto's Nine-Tails. Jiraiya planned to look after Naruto and further teach him to exploit the Nine-Tails' powers. He did not share any of this with Naruto, who therefore doesn't see much reason to accompany Jiraiya on his search for Tsunade. Jiraiya offered to teach him a jutsu stronger than
Sasuke Uchiha
's
Chidori
, which instantly wins Naruto's interest.






Jiraiya confronts Kisame and Itachi.



After leaving Konoha, Jiraiya and Naruto stop in
Shukuba Town
. While they check into a room to rest in, an
attractive woman
 starts flirting with Jiraiya; Jiraiya sends Naruto to their room while he and the woman spend time together. It quickly occurs to him, however, that women are not usually drawn to him, at which point he realises that the woman is under the influence of a
genjutsu
 so that she could be used to lure Jiraiya away from Naruto. He returns to Naruto and finds him about to be captured by Akatsuki's
Itachi Uchiha
 and
Kisame Hoshigaki
; Sasuke is also there, wishing to fight Itachi. Itachi and Kisame decide to flee rather than fight Jiraiya, which he tries to stop with his
Toad Mouth Bind
, but this fails. Jiraiya collects a sample of the
Amaterasu
 flames that Itachi used to escape and returns to Naruto and Sasuke, at which point he is
attacked
 by
Might Guy
.

Guy apologises for attacking Jiraiya, explaining that he didn't get a good look because he was trying to avoid Itachi's
Sharingan
. Jiraiya asks Guy to go back to Konoha with Sasuke, who has been rendered unconscious by Itachi's Sharingan. Guy informs him and Naruto that the same thing happened to Kakashi, and that only Tsunade may be able to cure them; to that end, he asks that they be sure to find her. Afterwards, Jiraiya explains to Naruto why Akatsuki is after him. Naruto decides that he'll need to become stronger so that he can better face them next time, which Jiraiya decides to help with by teaching him the
Rasengan
. As they travel around the country trying to track Tsunade's location, Jiraiya instructs Naruto in the Rasengan's usage, providing him training aids where needed. Although Naruto relies on some unconventional workarounds and his developments often interrupt Jiraiya's rest, he masters the first two of Rasengan's three learning steps.






Jiraiya informs Tsunade she's been chosen as the Fifth Hokage.



Jiraiya and Naruto eventually learn that Tsunade is in
Tanzaku Quarters
. When they arrive at where she's supposed to be, however, she isn't there. What's more, there's evidence that Orochimaru has been there. They find a place to eat to decide what to do next, only to find Tsunade there with her attendant,
Shizune
. Tsunade is surprised to see Jiraiya, having just met Orochimaru, though she refuses to say anything about the nature of their meeting. Jiraiya informs her that Konoha would like her to become the Fifth Hokage; Tsunade is surprised - having thought Orochimaru was lying when he said he killed the Third Hokage - as is Naruto, who didn't realise Tsunade was being offered the Hokage position. Tsunade refuses to offer, ridiculing those who've been held the title, including the Third and
Fourth Hokage
, and dismissing the job as fitting only for fools. Naruto, who has his own dreams of being Hokage, is enraged and tries to attack Tsunade. Jiraiya holds him back, but Tsunade agrees to fight with him.






Jiraiya's drink is spiked by Tsunade.



Tsunade easily defeats Naruto, but not before he tries to use his imperfect Rasengan. She berates Jiraiya for teaching Naruto the Rasengan at all, declaring it cruel to let someone as untalented as him believe he can master something so complicated. Naruto makes a bet with her that he can master the Rasengan in a week and goes off to start training. Jiraiya invites Tsunade to drinks afterwards and guesses that Tsunade's bet with Naruto has something to do with the offer Orochimaru made her. He doesn't ask for details about the offer, but he promises to personally kill her if she does anything to endanger Konoha. She claims not to care about the village, so Jiraiya remarks how similar Naruto is to Tsunade's dead brother,
Nawaki
, who treasured Konoha. He invites her out to drinks again the night before the bet expires, planning to ask her more about what Orochimaru wants, but she's able to drug his drink without him noticing.






Jiraiya, Naruto, Shizune, and Tonton chase Tsunade.



When Jiraiya wakes up the next morning he has difficulty moving and using his chakra. He goes looking for Tsunade, but can only find Naruto and Shizune. He notices
Kabuto Yakushi
 watching them, so asks Shizune what Tsunade's deal with Orochimaru is. Shizune reveals that, in exchange for healing the damage to Orochimaru's arms caused by the Third Hokage, Orochimaru will
revive
 Nawaki and also Tsunade's dead lover,
Dan Katō
. As they try to find Tsunade in order to stop her from helping Orochimaru, Jiraiya worries that he may actually need to follow through on his promise to kill her. When they locate her, however, they find that she is already trying to kill Orochimaru. Jiraiya instructs Shizune to help deal with Kabuto while he fights Orochimaru by himself. He asks Tsunade to give him an antidote for the drug she gave him, but Kabuto has been able to trigger her
fear of blood
, rendering her unable to do anything.






Jiraiya battling Orochimaru.



Jiraiya's inability to control his chakra and Orochimaru's inability to use his arms means they can't do much against each other. Jiraiya is able to create a
Swamp of the Underworld
, but it is too shallow to defeat Orochimaru's snake, only managing to stop it from moving. Nevertheless, Orochimaru is confident that Jiraiya will lose, proven by his "wasting" time with Naruto. He contrasts Naruto with Sasuke: Sasuke is an
Uchiha
, naturally gifted and capable of learning every
ninjutsu
; Naruto is mediocre, struggling to learn even one ninjutsu and thus failing to live up to the title of shinobi. Jiraiya rebuts: a shinobi is not someone who can learn all ninjutsu, but rather someone who refuses to give up. They watch as Naruto uses a completed Rasengan to defeat Kabuto, which Orochimaru decides is a problem. He goes to kill Naruto, parrying Jiraiya's attempt to stop him.






Jiraiya teaming up with Gamabunta.



Tsunade is able to protect Naruto and overcomes her phobia so that she can return to the fight. She summons
Katsuyu
 to fight Orochimaru's
Manda
, with Jiraiya joining in by summoning Gamabunta. After they save Katsuyu from Manda, Jiraiya and Gambunta attack Manda with
Fire Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet
. Manda avoids it and attacks them from behind, but they are saved by Tsunade, who defeats both him and Orochimaru. Orochimaru escapes with Kabuto; before he leaves, he warns that he has
other ways
 of fixing his arms. Tsunade heals Jiraiya's broken bones, restores his chakra, and, having accepted the Hokage position, returns with him and Naruto to Konoha.

Sasuke Recovery Mission

Sasuke Recovery Mission






Jiraiya and Kakashi discuss Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry.



When they get back to Konoha, Jiraiya has Tsunade heal the mental damage done to Sasuke and Kakashi, as well as ask her to look at
Rock Lee
 on behalf of Guy. Naruto goes around the village to visit his friends, with Jiraiya secretly watching him. Naruto gets into a fight with Sasuke shortly after Tsunade heals him, which Kakashi interrupts in time to stop them from using their Chidori and Rasengan against each other. Kakashi notices Jiraiya and asks him if it was a good idea to teach Naruto the Rasengan; Jiraiya asks the same about teaching Sasuke the Chidori. Jiraiya admits to being surprised that Naruto would use the Rasengan against a friend and asks about his relationship with Sasuke. Kakashi explains that Sasuke is a rival that Naruto wants to live up to, just as Jiraiya once did with Orochimaru. Now understanding things, Jiraiya decides to speak with Naruto about it.






Jiraiya tells Naruto to give up on Sasuke.



Sasuke ends up defecting to Orochimaru and Naruto ends up in the
Konoha Hospital
 in his failed attempt to stop him. Jiraiya visits him there and informs Naruto that he's going to take him away from Konoha for three years of training; both Akatsuki and Orochimaru will be unable to move forward with their plans for three years, meaning this is the perfect opportunity to prepare Naruto for the next time he faces them. Naruto declines, believing it's essential that he go after Sasuke immediately. Jiraiya tries to convince him to give up on Sasuke, drawing on his own experience with Orochimaru and pointing to Naruto's contemporary condition as proof that Sasuke no longer considers him a friend. These facts, coupled with the many more important challenges Naruto must face someday, causes Jiraiya to conclude that going after Sasuke would be foolish. Naruto replies simply that he'd rather be a fool. Jiraiya is satisfied by this and tells Naruto to be ready to go once he's discharged from the hospital.

Fūma clan
 from Orochimaru's control. When they return to Konoha, Jiraiya asks Tsunade to keep Naruto busy until he returns from some investigations he needs to do, fearing Naruto may go after Sasuke by himself if he isn't kept preoccupied.

Interlude

In the anime, shortly after leaving Konoha, they discuss the fact that Naruto will need to learn how to counter genjutsu if he hopes to be a match against Sasuke the next time they meet. Jiraiya summons
Gamariki
 to help him practise dispelling genjutsu, but Naruto struggles with it and his chakra keeps hitting Gamariki, who doesn't appreciate it. Jiraiya takes Naruto to the
Genjutsu Tree Village
 to try a different approach, but they discover the village has been taken over by
Kandachi
.
 They free the villagers and then attack Kandachi, who Naruto defeats with his newly-created
Big Ball Rasengan
. As they leave afterwards, Jiraiya is pleased by how similar Naruto is to Minato and hugs him, which Naruto is bothered by.

In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths

In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths






Jiraiya critically wounded.



Two years into their training, Naruto's control of the Nine-Tails' chakra has improved significantly. Jiraiya tries to give him more access to the Nine-Tails' power and uses
Gerotora
 to weaken Naruto's
Eight Trigrams Sealing Style
. This causes Naruto to enter a
version 2
 form with four tails; not in control of his body, Naruto attacks Jiraiya and nearly kills him before he manages to suppress the Nine-Tails. Naruto has no memory of what happened and Jiraiya doesn't tell him, instead shifting Naruto's training to other pursuits, including keeping his anger in check so that the Nine-Tails won't flare up again.

Kazekage Rescue Mission

Jiraiya returns Naruto to Konoha after two-and-a-half years. Kakashi greets them when they arrive and Naruto gives him a copy of
Icha Icha Tactics
, which Jiraiya wrote during their time together. He entrusts Naruto to Kakashi's care, warning that Akatsuki will likely be making a move soon; he sends the same warning to
Sunagakure
, whose
Kazekage
 is a jinchūriki like Naruto. Jiraiya leaves Konoha to start investigating Akatsuki, but returns shortly afterwards to inform Tsunade that the Kazekage has been captured. She already knows this and is about to send Naruto and his team to Suna to lend assistance. He warns Naruto to keep his temper and to not use "
that technique
". He also tells Kakashi to keep an eye on Naruto, giving him a
seal
 that can be used to suppress the Nine-Tails if Naruto starts losing control of it.

Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission

When the Kazekage is successfully rescued, Jiraiya and Tsunade meet with Kakashi to discuss Naruto's display of the Nine-Tails' power during the mission, a sign of his worsening control. Jiraiya explains his own experience with Naruto's version 2 form and his observations about how Naruto's transformations work. Because Naruto can be as much a risk to himself as he is to others in these states, they task
Yamato
 with keeping him in check.

Three-Tails' Appearance

Main article:
Three-Tails' Appearance






Jiraiya demonstrates cooperation ninjutsu to Naruto.



In the anime, Jiraiya returns to Konoha to congratulate Naruto on defeating Akatsuki's
Kakuzu
. Because Kakashi is about to take
Team 8
 on a mission to investigate one of Orochimaru's bases, Jiraiya distracts Naruto from this potential opportunity to find Sasuke by taking him to
Yugakure
 for training. Because Naruto doesn't have any long-range jutsu in his repertoire, Jiraiya recommends that he use
cooperation ninjutsu
, synchronising with his toad summons to make up for this deficiency. He has Naruto try to perform the
Water Release: Water Gun
 with
Gamariki
, but their personalises clash, preventing them from cooperating. Naruto instead summons
Gamatatsu
, with whom he's able to synchronise with
Gamakichi
's guidance.

Jiraiya applauds Naruto's progress, but is called away to look into news on Akatsuki before he can see Naruto's training completed. He leaves Naruto to finish the training himself, though, before he goes, he convinces
Tsunade
 to let Naruto help on Team 8's mission.

Itachi Pursuit Mission

Main article:
Itachi Pursuit Mission

Jiraiya visits Tsunade and reports rumours that Orochimaru has been killed by Sasuke. They share these rumours with Naruto and Sakura Haruno, who suspect that Sasuke is making moves against his brother,
Itachi Uchiha
 of Akatsuki. Naruto proposes that they try to locate Itachi so that they can, in turn, find Sasuke. An
Eight Man Squad
 is organised for this purpose, which, in the anime, Jiraiya and Tsunade see off as they leave Konoha.

Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant

Main article:
Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant






Jiraiya talks with Tsunade.



While the Eight Man Squad is still on their mission, Jiraiya visits Tsunade with news that he's discovered the location of Akatsuki's leader, though he refuses to go into more detail until she meets him for drinks. While having saké, Jiraiya shares news of Amegakure's ongoing civil war, which the Akatsuki leader is rumoured to be behind. Because Amegakure is in a delicate political situation, Jiraiya must infiltrate the village by himself to confirm before Konoha can take direct action. Tsunade feels guilty for always relying on him to do dangerous work like this and offers to help him if he needs it. He reminds her that she, the Hokage, can't just leave the village, but she replies that Naruto will inevitably replace her anyway. While they discuss Naruto, Jiraiya reflects that, because he thought of Minato as a son, being with Naruto feels like being with his grandson. Jiraiya departs, but warns Tsunade about
Danzō Shimura
 before he goes.






Jiraiya infiltrates Amegakure.



Jiraiya is able to successfully
infiltrate
 Amegakure and quickly captures two Ame-nin,
Ryūsui
 and
Yūdachi
. He tries using tickle torture to get them to reveal information about
Pain
, but it's only after using the
Turning into a Frog Technique
 on Yūdachi that Ryūsui is forthcoming: Pain is the mysterious leader and god-figure of Ame, who brought the rebelling faction to victory in the civil war by personally killing Ame's former leader,
Hanzō
. Jiraiya is unsettled by news that Pain killed Hanzō, having assumed from his own past encounter with Hanzō that he was unbeatable. He takes a precaution by removing
Gerotora
 from his body and instructing him to go to Naruto if anything happens to him. Gerotora warns him against this, feeling Naruto is unprepared for full access to the Nine-Tails' power. Jiraiya shares his suspicions that
Madara Uchiha
 is somehow moving behind the scenes which, if true, would mean Naruto will need to master the Nine-Tails sooner rather than later.






Jiraiya fighting Konan.



Jiraiya has one of his toads take Yūdachi to Konoha to be interrogated by
Ibiki Morino
 while he
controls
 Ryūsui in order to further explore Ame. He is quickly discovered and confronted by Pain's "angel", who Jiraiya recognises as
Konan
, one of the orphans he trained decades ago. Jiraiya is surprised to see her and guesses that Pain must also be one of the orphans, though she refuses to confirm and instead attacks him. He quickly captures her, but Pain rescues her and sends her away. Although Jiraiya does not recognise the body, Jiraiya assumes that Pain is
Nagato
 because of his
Rinnegan
. Jiraiya expresses his disappointment that Nagato has turned away from his once-righteous path towards peace by leading a criminal organisation like Akatsuki. Pain asserts that, as a god, his plan to liberate the world through destruction is the definition of righteousness.






Jiraiya enters Sage Mode.



Deciding that he must stop Pain before the world is destroyed, Jiraiya summons
Gamaken
 to fight Pain while he prepares to enter
Sage Mode
. Pain counters with his own various
summons
 and nothing else, which Jiraiya finds odd considering the huge arsenal of ninjutsu Nagato learned during their time together. Despite the constant attacks by Pain's summons, Jiraiya is able to enter Sage Mode with
help
 from
Fukasaku
 and
Shima
. Both are surprised that Jiraiya would call on him, so he informs them that Pain is the apparent
Child of the Prophecy
; they immediately understand, seeking out and destroying the
chameleon
 Pain is hiding in. Pain responds by summoning two more bodies, each with their own Rinnegan and neither of which Jiraiya recognises. Though confused by this, Jiraiya, Fukasaku, and Shima team up with
Sage Art: Goemon
.






The Preta Path absorbing Jiraiya's attack.



One of the Pains (the
Preta Path
) absorbs their Sage Art: Goemon as well as Jiraiya's followup
Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan
, but Jiraiya succeeds in blinding another Pain (the
Human Path
). He tries to attack this blinded Pain from behind, but it mysteriously blocks him. Fukasaku notices that one of the other Pains saw him attacking the blind one and guesses that they share vision. Outmatched, they decide to retreat so that they can discuss tactics; they decide that their only hope is to split up the Pains and fight them one at a time, something they likely won't be able to do accomplish without genjutsu. Since Jiraiya isn't good with genjutsu, Fukasaku and Shima ready their
Toad Confrontation Singing
, which draws the Pains to their location. Jiraiya holds them off while the genjutsu is prepared: he obscures the Preta Path's sight; he
binds
 the Human Path to the wall; he attacks the first Pain, the
Animal Path
, uninhibited until the genjutsu is finally cast.






Jiraiya defeats the three Paths.



While the Pains are caught, Jiraiya stabs them with
Stone Swords
 and believes they, and by extension Nagato, are dead. As he leaves, Pain's
Asura Path
 attacks him from behind, catching Jiraiya off-guard while also severing his left arm. The full
Six Paths of Pain
 - with the three he defeated restored by the
Naraka Path
 - face Jiraiya. He recognises the
Deva Path
 as
Yahiko
, causing him to question his assumption that Pain is Nagato. When asked, Pain assures him that Yahiko is dead, then attacks to kill Jiraiya as well. After a prolonged battle, Jiraiya retreats into his
Barrier: Toad Gourd Prison
. The Animal Path follows him, but he's able to capture it. From looking at the Animal Path up close, Jiraiya realises that he met it once before years ago. Jiraiya, remembering the
Great Toad Sage
's prediction that Jiraiya would travel the world, starts to suspect why he knows the Animal Path. Fukasaku and Shima recommend he return to Konoha to report what he's discovered, but he refuses, believing this is the best chance to figure out who Pain is. He has Shima deliver the Animal Path to Konoha while he and Fukasaku confront Pain again.






Jiraiya mortally wounded by Pain.



The other five Pains quickly surround Jiraiya when he returns to the battlefield, but he's able to confirm his theory: each of the Pains is somebody he met during his travels. Before he can communicate this to Fukasaku, his throat is crushed and he is stabbed by the Pains's
black receivers
. As his life starts to fade, Jiraiya reflects on his failures: his failure to win the heart of Tsunade; his failure to redeem Orochimaru; his failure to protect Minato or the
Third Hokage
; and now his failure to have a meaningful death. His thoughts turn to Naruto, who Jiraiya knows wouldn't submit to failure like this and would keep fighting for as long as he could. Jiraiya decides that he, as Naruto's teacher, should demonstrate the same resolve. As such, he forces himself back to consciousness and uses the last of his energy to
etch
 a coded message into Fukasaku's back.






Jiraiya dying with a smile.



Despite Pain's attempt to stop him, Fukasaku is able to escape to Konoha. Jiraiya, meanwhile, is thrown into the sea by Pain's attack and starts sinking into its depths. Jiraiya spends his final moments continuing to think about Naruto, and decides that it is he, not Nagato, who is the Child of the Prophecy. Jiraiya is confident the world is in good hands if Naruto is to be its salvation. Satisfied with how this final chapter of his life has turned out, Jiraiya officially ends what he titles the
Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant
. Before he dies, Jiraiya decides that the sequel should be called the
Tale of Naruto Uzumaki
, and smiles at how good the title is.

New Era

Time Slip Arc

Main article:
Time Slip Arc






Jiraiya fleeing from pursuers after his "research".



In the anime, when a grown-up Sasuke and Naruto's future son
Boruto
 were sent back in time to shortly after Sasuke's defection, the two bumped into Jiraiya and Naruto. Jiraiya handed Boruto his binoculars, framing him for his discovered peeping, but Tsunade arrived and resolved the situation. Tsunade asked about Boruto and Sasuke's arrival, and Sasuke claimed they were travelling performers who utilised
ninjutsu
 during their performances. Still somewhat suspicious, Tsunade ordered Naruto and Jiraiya to guard Boruto and Sasuke, proclaiming that
a recently defected genin
, as well as Konoha still recovering from
an assault during the Chūnin Exams
, they needed to remain on their guard at all times, and couldn't afford to let strangers walk into their village. However, as soon as Tsunade left, Jiraiya left Naruto to take care of Boruto and Sasuke, much to Naruto's annoyance.






Jiraiya talking with Sasuke.



Later while checking on Naruto, he was shocked to see Naruto captured by a
new stranger
 with odd powers and even more surprised to see Boruto performing a Rasengan on the foe. When the foe retreated with Naruto, he sealed off Jiraiya with Sasuke and Boruto inside a stone prison. Sasuke explained that he and Boruto were really ninja from a distant village on a mission to stop Urashiki from stealing the Nine-Tails' chakra. Sasuke also explained that Urashiki had ties to Akatsuki. While realising that the two strangers were still hiding something, he decided to trust them work together to save Naruto, freeing them by summoning giant toad. Soon, Sasuke locked onto Naruto's location from detecting the tailed beast's chakra beginning to leak out.

Along the way, having realised that the
Eight Trigrams Sealing Style
 was stopping Urashiki from stealing the Nine-Tail's chakra, Jiraiya placed powerful seals on Boruto and Sasuke to protect them as well. Upon finding Naruto, Urashiki's actions forced the boy into his Version 1 state. While Sasuke engaged Urashiki, Jiraiya went to deal with the rampaging Naruto. He was surprised to see Boruto's kindness initially reaching Naruto, realising that their chakra was compatible with each other and by extension, realising they were somehow related to each other. After subduing the demon chakra in Naruto and Urashiki retreated, Jiraiya suggested training Naruto and Boruto together, knowing the foe would return. Jiraiya realised at this point Boruto and Sasuke are actually from the future and that Boruto is Naruto's son due to their chakra compatibility (meaning they are related) and knowing Naruto's family well enough to know he currently has no living relatives.

The following day, Jiraiya began explain to the two boys the nature of their training: to synchronise their chakra and create a new cooperation ninjutsu. Pointing out the difficult nature behind such a task, he insisted that their similar chakra would make it possible. As Naruto and Boruto continued to work on the technique, relying on their respective Rasengan training, Jiraiya decided to confirm another suspicion: that the adult is actually Sasuke Uchiha. He later met with adult Sasuke and asked him to deliver food to Naruto while he took care of a task. In reality, he spied on Sasuke to see how he would interact with Naruto. Jiraiya saw the feeling Sasuke had when he was renewing Naruto's conviction, so after Naruto left, he met with Sasuke again. Jiraiya thanked Sasuke for his genuine, but unusual kindness to Naruto since he was supposed to be a stranger. Sasuke explained that Naruto looked like someone he knew in the past, which solidified Jiraiya's suspicions and before Sasuke could leave, Jiraiya asked the traveller if he was Sasuke Uchiha, leaving the time-traveller shocked.






Jiraiya gets stabbed by Urashiki.



Taking Sasuke's shocked reaction as a confirmation of his identity, Jiraiya quickly relieved the pressure by dryly laughing off his accusation. Since Jiraiya could tell that Sasuke and Boruto's desire to protect Naruto was genuine (due to the fact Sasuke offered to distract Urashiki while Boruto and Jiraiya took Naruto to safety rather than having Jiraiya be the distraction) and that they had their reasons for keeping secrets, he made a deal with Sasuke not to delve deeper into their true identities provided that Sasuke reveals all he knows about Urashiki. Sasuke then explained all he knew about his abilities. After hearing all this, Jiraiya deemed that the best course of action would be to seal away Urashiki. Before they could formulate a proper plan, however, Sasuke detected Urashiki's return near Naruto and Boruto's location, speeding off with Jiraiya to help Boruto and Naruto. With Sasuke still drained from Urashiki's theft of his chakra, their efforts were easily repelled by Urashiki, resulting in Jiraiya being impaled in the shoulder. Urashiki then smugly told them that he can perceive the future.






Jiraiya hits Urashiki with Rasengan.



Deciding the foe's newest technique was too dangerous, Sasuke tackled himself and Urashiki over the ledge and into a river to let his allies escape. While tending to Jiraiya's wounds, the group tried to figure out how to deal with Urashiki. Boruto then realised that in the fight, the blood splattered on Urashiki was drying much faster than Boruto's. After engaging the foe again to test a theory, they concluded that Urashiki's technique lets him
warp into the past
 by several seconds, giving him a pseudo-clairvoyance from his experiences. Urashiki then attack the Konoha-nin again, where Jiraiya then contained everyone in his
Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind
. During which, Naruto unleashed a continued barrage of clones on Urashiki. While he easily countered the assault with his technique, Urashiki inadvertently poisoned himself from the acidic vapors of the great toad's belly far sooner than the Konoha-nin due to his repeated time-warp. Once Jiraiya released the summoning, Naruto and Boruto then proceeded to knockout Urashiki with a
Rasengan
 assault.






Jiraiya takes Urashiki's attack for Naruto.



Still defiant, Urashiki managed to get up. Battered and too weak to continue fighting as he was, he decided to consume all his accumulated chakra. Concluding that it wasn't enough, he smugly ripped out both his eyes and ate them as well. The final result transformed him into a fiendish being of immense physical might. Jiraiya and the two genin were quickly overwhelmed by Urashiki's continued assaults, even with the aid of the returning Sasuke. Urashiki's efforts ultimately enraged Naruto enough to unleash the Nine-Tails' chakra. Jiraiya watched in shock as Boruto decided to make use of Naruto's Nine-Tails Rasengan. As Boruto managed to reach Naruto's consciousness, they were able to perfect their
new collaboration technique
. With the combined effort of Jiraiya and Sasuke, the two kids were able to plough through Urashiki's final attack and obliterate him. Afterwards, Jiraiya dryly noted how troublesome their apprentices were, which Sasuke agreed.






Jiraiya and Naruto's memories are erased by Sasuke.



Days later, after everyone recovered from the battle, it was decided by Sasuke and Boruto that they should leave soon as their mission was done. They were then approached by Sakura, who demanded for Sasuke to reveal how he knew her and what the contents of his letter were about. While Sasuke struggled to answer, Jiraiya gave a convincing alibi that Sasuke and Boruto were in fact such avid fans of his, they studied up on his entire life and wished to train under him, which Boruto and Sasuke awkwardly agreed to. The following day, as Boruto and Sasuke prepare to leave, the Sannin confronted Sasuke about his true identity, feeling it would be best if he and Naruto had no memories of the recent events. Sasuke agreed, having already erased the memories of everyone else he and Boruto had come in contact with since arriving. Sasuke then revealed his Sharingan, which Jiraiya smiled at as it confirmed his suspicions about Sasuke's identity (and that Naruto would succeed in returning Sasuke to the village in the future) before his and Naruto's memories were erased.

Legacy






Jiraiya's dying message.



Deciphering Jiraiya's dying message becomes Konoha's top priority, though Jiraiya's code is not recognisable to the
Konoha Cryptanalysis Team
. Only Naruto, one of the people closest to Jiraiya, is able to identify the code's key:
Icha Icha Tactics
. By taking the first word on each page that Jiraiya specifies, they produce the message, "the real one isn't among them." It isn't until the examination of the Animal Path and the interrogation of the Ame ninja are completed that Jiraiya's message makes sense: the Six Paths of Pain are controlled remotely by a main intelligence, Nagato.
Pain's Assault
 on Konoha is already underway by the time this is figured out, but Naruto, after defeating all six Pains, is able to use the information to find and meet with Nagato. It is also only by using Jiraiya's legacy and teachings that Naruto makes Nagato see his own impact on their former teacher.

Naruto is very depressed when he first learns of Jiraiya's death and tries blaming it on Tsunade since she let him fight Pain alone. It eventually occurs to Naruto that Jiraiya, by fighting Pain, has bought him time for his own fight with Pain; he uses this time to learn
senjutsu
 which, in combination with what Fukasaku is able to report about Pain's abilities, allows him to defeat the Six Paths of Pain. When he meets Nagato, Naruto wants to take vengeance for Jiraiya's death, but he decides instead to forgive Nagato, thereby ending the cycle of hatred that the main character of Jiraiya's book,
The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi
, spoke against. Nagato realises that this same idea that Naruto got from Jiraiya, Jiraiya in turn got from him, and that his actions in Akatsuki therefore contradict both himself and Jiraiya. He
gives his life
 to revive those killed during his attack on Konoha, the only atonement he can offer. Nagato later observes that if Jiraiya's was the first story in a trilogy and Naruto's will be the last, his own is the better-forgotten middle volume. Upon his final sealing in the war, Nagato tells Naruto that he will return to Jiraiya's side and they will watch together as Naruto brings the story to a close, referring to Jiraiya's life as a true masterpiece.






Naruto's memorial to Jiraiya.



After observing Naruto's confrontation with Nagato, the
Great Toad Sage
 discovers that his prophecy was somewhat incorrect: Jiraiya would not train the
Child
 of the Prophecy, he would train the
Children
 of the Prophecy, Nagato and Naruto, both of whose actions steer the world towards peace because of Jiraiya's influence.
Obito Uchiha
, after plunging the world into the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, blames the actions of Naruto and Nagato for the failure of his
Eye of the Moon Plan
; because Jiraiya was their teacher, Obito decides that, in a sense, it was Jiraiya who defeated him in the end.
 For Jiraiya's influence, Naruto creates
a memorial
 to him in the woods near Konoha after Pain's Assault ends. The memorial itself is a rock with the kanji for "teacher" (
師
,
shi
) carved into it; Naruto also leaves a copy of
Gutsy Shinobi
 and "never-dying flowers of hope" given to him by
Konan
. In later years, Tsunade would visit the memorial to toast her childhood comrade, doing so on the day Naruto became Hokage.

Tsunade is just as sad as Naruto when she finds out about Jiraiya's death, and it provides her with yet another reason to keep Konoha safe from Pain, so that his sacrifice isn't wasted. She is rendered comatose in her effort to protect the villagers, at which point the
Fire Daimyō
 voices his regrets that Jiraiya, being dead, cannot replace Tsunade as Sixth
Hokage
. When the Fourth Shinobi World War starts,
Kabuto Yakushi
 expresses interest in
reincarnating
 Jiraiya to have him fight for Akatsuki, but unfortunately is unable to reach him as his body rests in the lower depths of the sea.

Orochimaru
, his death having been misreported, reemerges during the war with a reformed outlook. Tsunade argues that this change in him might have saved Jiraiya had it happened sooner, but Orochimaru believes it was better for Jiraiya to die as he was rather than risk his changing because of Orochimaru's change.
 After Naruto shares his memories with the Shinobi Alliance, Tsunade and Orochimaru are shown solemnly remembering their former comrade, after which Orochimaru joins the fight on the side of the alliance. When bidding farewell to his father, Naruto mentions that of all the shinobi he has met, Jiraiya is the one he respects the most.






Koji Kashin revealed to be a clone of Jiraiya.



Jiraiya's legacy of good was even spread to the new generations which included
Boruto Uzumaki
,
Sarada Uchiha
, Chōchō Akimichi, and the
Konoha 11
 members where it encouraged those new generations to someday be better and share the goodness in life. At some point,
Amado Sanzu
 managed to obtain some of Jiraiya's DNA and cloned him, naming the clone
Koji Kashin
, whose sole mission was to eliminate
Jigen
, the vessel of
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
.
 Naruto found Koji's style to be a great reminder of Jiraiya's, and could not help but feel concerned for Koji's safety despite being unable to discern why. Isshiki, reading Koji's mind upon resurrecting through Jigen, understood that Amado wanted to cling onto the mighty fate that Jiraiya bore, hence his reason to create Koji.

Jiraiya in the video games often gains extra abilities, such as being able to use his elongate his hair in various ways, as well as his taijutsu's motions being theatrical in appearance, reminiscent of a kabukimono.

Creation and Conception






An early design of Jiraiya, with toads riding on his shoulders.



Masashi Kishimoto
 had several different designs for the Jiraiya character. In one such design, Jiraiya would change into an ugly but powerful form during moments of passion, such as anger or when seeing a beautiful woman. This version of Jiraiya had a married toad couple riding on his shoulders, who would periodically tell jokes. Kishimoto abandoned the idea because it was too complicated, but integrated some aspects when he entered his Sage Mode.

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Jiraiya






Jiraiya's autograph.



Jiraiya and the other Sannin are named after the characters in the Japanese folktale
Jiraiya Goketsu Monogatari
; Jiraiya references the story before his death. The Jiraiya of that story excels in toad magic.

"Jiraiya" (
自来也
), roughly translated can mean "I came", whereas from the derived story the name holds the meaning "Young Thunder" or "Young Lightning".

Jiraiya's autograph is featured in the real version of
The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi
.

In the
Live Spectacle Naruto
, the role of Jiraiya was played by Yoshiaki Umegaki.

Jiraiya is given no rank in the manga or its databooks, but the anime classifies him as a
jōnin
.

Jiraiya had a penmanship quirk: when he would write the katakana "ta" (
タ
), he would shorten his first stroke, so that the first and third strokes would get connected, while rounding the second stroke. People tend to mistake this as the number "9". As Naruto was made to review many of Jiraiya's novel drafts, he would eventually differentiate the two.

Studio Pierrot's Settei sheets of Jiraiya show that he was 153 cm when he was part of Hiruzen's genin team. They also show that as an adult his sandals add 7 cm on to his height.

According to the databook(s):

Jiraiya's hobby was sneaking a peek into a Women's Bathing House.

Jiraiya wished to fight
Naruto Uzumaki
.

His favourite foods were garlic chives pickled with
Japanese basil
 (AKA shiso garlic) and chicken
karaage
, while his least favourites were
kiwifruit
 and
gratin
.

Jiraiya completed 1,839 official missions in total: 58 D-rank, 345 C-rank, 684 B-rank, 614 A-rank, 138 S-rank. With this rating of mission completion by Jiraiya, he has the most completed missions of all characters in the entire
Naruto
 series.

Jiraiya's favourite phrase was "Free and uninhibited" (
自由奔放
,
Jiyū honpō
).

Jiraiya shares the same blood type with his former team-mates,
Tsunade
 and
Orochimaru
, as well as his former apprentices, Naruto Uzumaki and
Minato Namikaze
.

Jiraiya is tied with
Itachi Uchiha
 as having the highest stats total in the databook.

Jiraiya's last words are based off of a Japanese proverb:
"A frog in a well does not know the great ocean"
 (
井の中の蛙大海を知らず
,
I no naka no kawazu taikai o shirazu
).

Quotes

(To
Tsunade
) "
Yo! I'm Jiraiya! You can send me the love letter later!
"

(To
Nagato
) "
When people get hurt, they learn to hate… when people hurt others, they become hated and racked with guilt. But knowing that pain allows people to be kind. Pain allows people to grow… and how you grow is up to you.
"

(To
Naruto
) "
I'm not a pervert… I'm a
super
 pervert!
"

(To
Orochimaru
) "
You're wrong, that's not what makes a shinobi. You never did get it, a real ninja is one who endures no matter what gets thrown at him… Let me explain something to you, there is only one thing that matters if you are a shinobi, and it isn't the number of techniques you possess. All you do need, is the guts to never give up.
"

(To Naruto) "
Even I can tell that hatred is spreading. I wanted to do something about it … but I don't know what … but I believe… that someday the day will come when people truly understand one another!! If I can't find the answer, it will be up to you to do it!!
"

(To Tsunade) "
Now my job is to help the next generation, and set a good example for them. And for that I'll gladly lay down my life, and I'll be smiling the whole time. It's what makes us old guys cool, you see.
"

(To Tsunade) "
A person who feels nothing at the death of those close to him is no different than a butcher.
"

(To Naruto) "
Never go back on your word… and never give up. That's your ninja way… and as your mentor… I have no business whining! Because… the student's ninja way should be the master's too! Isn't that so, Naruto?!
"

(Last words) "
There, that ending… was a little better. The frog at the bottom of the well drifts off into the great ocean. Heh heh… yep… pretty damn honourable… pretty damn honourable… I guess it's time to put down my pen. Right… I need a title for the next book… let's see… Ah, got it…
The Tale of Naruto Uzumaki
… perfect.
