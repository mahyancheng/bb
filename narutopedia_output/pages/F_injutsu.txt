An example of a fūinjutsu.



Fūinjutsu
 (
封印術
,
English TV:
 Sealing Jutsu,
literally meaning:
 Sealing Techniques) are a type of
jutsu
 that seal objects, living beings,
chakra
, along with a wide variety of other things within another object. Fūinjutsu can also be used to restrict movement or unseal objects either from within something or someone.

The presence of a seal is marked by the appearance of formations of technique formulae, kanji, or else other kinds of symbols (likewise with
Summoning Techniques
).

A unison of
barrier ninjutsu
 and fūinjutsu is referred to as a "Sealing Barrier" (
封印結界
,
Fūin Kekkai
).

In a similar fashion to
genjutsu
, fūinjutsu can be undone by combining specific
seals
 with a Fūinjutsu: Release (
封印術・解
,
Fūinjutsu: Kai
,
literally meaning:
 Sealing Technique: Release) command.

Trivia

An imbalance is created when an odd-numbered seal is placed on top of an even-numbered seal and vice-versa.

The shinobi from
Uzushiogakure
 in the
Land of Whirlpools
 were specialists in the art of fūinjutsu, to the point that their nation was eventually destroyed due to the fear others had of these techniques.

In the anime, a precursor of fūinjutsu predated ninjutsu itself in the form of the
Secret Treasure of the Toads
, which stored a massive amount of
natural energy
.

Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
 utilised a seal that will kill anything sealed within if it's broken open in anyway except if undone by himself. However, the seal can be bypassed by
Space–Time Ninjutsu
.
