"
Shino vs. Torune!
" (
シノVSトルネ!!
,
Shino tai Torune!!
) is episode 317 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

After escaping from the
Shinobi Alliance
, a
reincarnated

Torune
 finds a place far enough to execute a unique
kinjutsu
 to his abilities. However,
Shino
 is able to find him with his
kikaichū
. Notified from Torune's position, Shino starts a battle in order to stop Torune's kinjutsu. Once face to face with him, Torune asks if Shino made any friends, thinking back about their shared past. When they were little,
Shibi
 was Torune's guardian after
Shikuro
 died, leaving Torune and Shino growing to act as siblings. Torune showed him his insects, and saved him from going to the
Root
 by volunteering himself. Torune explains that he never thought he would get a friend like he did in the Root,
Fū Yamanaka
. In the battle, Torune takes advantage from his
taijutsu
 learned at Root, unleashing an accurate kick to Shino's stomach.
 One of
Naruto
's clones appears and saves Shino from falling into Torune's kinjutsu. Shino shares his knowledge about the opponent's abilities, warning Naruto to not touch Torune's skin, thinking that as the only way his insects could spread their poison. Torune uses his
Poison Cloud Technique
 to attack them from a distance, but it is blocked by Shino's insects. With the warning to not touch Torune's skin, Naruto starts fighting the reincarnated opponent, who tries to use kenjutsu against him, though Naruto succeeds in breaking his sword. Naruto manages to land a
Rasengan
, and Torune almost lands a punch on him, failing due to Shino putting himself in between them, taking the hit. Torune is confused that Shino isn't suffering the effects of his
rinkaichū
, and Shino reveals that his punch hit Shino's insects, which Shino has bred with Torune's own insects after he was recruited into Root. This allowed them to build up a resistance against their venom. Shino uses these insects to paralyse Torune, and applies a
sealing tag
, stopping him and his kinjutsu.
