The
Third
Mizukage
 (
三代目水影
,
Sandaime Mizukage
,
literally meaning:
 Third Water Shadow) was the third leader of
Kirigakure
.

Background






The first ever summit of the Kage is convened.



He accompanied the
First Mizukage
 to the first ever
Five Kage Summit
. There he stood behind the First watching diligently as the proceedings unfolded.

He would later succeed
Gengetsu Hōzuki
 as Mizukage after his death in battle against
Tsuchikage

Mū
.

Appearance

He was a tall man with black sclerae, no visible pupils, and long, black hair which reached down to his back with what appeared to be pearl-shaped objects encircling his head. He wore the standard Kirigakure attire complete with pinstriped arm and leg-guards over which he wore a sleeveless haori with ragged ends and a poncho-like scarf around his neck. At the time of his death, he had aged considerably, with notable creases, visible frown lines around his mouth, and much lighter-coloured hair.

Abilities

Though the Third Mizukage's abilities remain mostly unknown, the fact that he was chosen as the
Kage
 of his village, suggests that he was the most powerful shinobi of Kirigakure in his time, as the village chooses only the strongest warrior as its leader. Even before becoming the Mizukage, his power was such that he was chosen to be the bodyguard of the First Mizukage.

Part II

Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes






The deceased Kage summoning Team 7 and the tailed beasts.



Subsequent to
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 being
sealed
 by
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Sasuke Uchiha
, he and the other deceased Kage were summoned from the
Pure Land
 by
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 to aid him and the
Hokage
 in
summoning

Team 7
, the
tailed beasts
, and
Madara Uchiha
 from
Kaguya's dimension
. Later, his and the other Kage's souls were returned to the Pure Land.

Trivia

He was the only bodyguard of the first Kage during the First Five Kage Summit that didn't become the Second Kage of his village, although he did eventually become the Third.
