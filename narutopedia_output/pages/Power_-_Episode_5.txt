 anime.

Synopsis

While the
Saezuri
 is revealed, learning that
Disonasu
 employed
Kabuto Yakushi
 to wipe out the residents of
Tonika Village
,
Dokku
 tried to attack Disonasu, but stopped by a
reincarnated
 puppet and restrained by a resurrected
Takigakure
 shinobi. Disonasu also praised
Naruto
 about defeating
Pain
, the one who scarred him and left him powerless, before kicking the boy repeatedly.
Miina
 and the orphans came to
The Hole
 to give the iron bars, but Kabuto's clone intercepted them. Meanwhile, the rest of
Konoha 11
, along with
Kakashi
,
Shiseru
,
Yamato
 and
Sai
 moved out to the area.

Disonasu prepares the summoning of the "power" by putting the remaining iron bars while Naruto enters
Sage Mode
. Miina hums to the sound as the Saezuri is activated, causing the area Naruto is on, the Ama no Hoko, to rise above ground. Kakashi arrived on the scene, revealing Disonasu's past as a bloodthirsty murderer and former
Akatsuki
 subordinate whose specialty is the field of
Summoning Technique
, having researched
Impure World Reincarnation
 with
Orochimaru
. Kabuto summons his puppets, the
Nine-Tailed Naruto Clone
,
Hidan
, and
Deidara
. Naruto faces off with the clone, while Deidara uses
Explosive Clay
 to create a diversion and chase Naruto. Disonasu escapes and Hidan faces
Shikamaru
. Deidara activates the Explosive Clay on the bodies of the resurrected individuals, as Hidan uses his ritual against
Team Asuma
, and
Sakura
 got restrained by
Hayate
 and the others. While Naruto relentlessly attacked the clone, he learned there is more than power.

As Yamato restrained Disonasu, he activated the Saezuri, opening the area where Naruto faces the clone, draining the lake as an obelisk rises and creates a storm. After Hidan's clone body breaks down due to the shorten life spans of the snakes composing his body, Deidara is controlled by Kabuto to escape Kakashi. A lightning hit the area where the orphans are running, Miina pointing to the obelisk. When the storm expands towards
Konoha
,
Tsunade
 goes out as the storm engulfs the
Land of Fire
. Naruto tried to stop Disonasu from ascending the tower, only to face his clone after he absorbed some of the tower's power and transformed into a Hydra-tailed fox monster.
