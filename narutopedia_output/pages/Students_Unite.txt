Synopsis

Having seemingly killed
Kae
,
Hana
 gets off the bridge and
burns
 it, separating herself from
Kawaki
 and
Himawari
. Despite Kawaki's assertions, Himawari refuses to believe Hana was deceiving them the whole time. The rest of the class arrives, drawn by the noise, and Kawaki tells them that Hana killed Kae. The class is in disbelief. Kawaki wants to pursue Hana, and tells his class-mates to leave. Himawari believes Kae might still be alive, questioning why Hana would do what she did in front of them. The other students point out that without
Kikuchiyo
 and
Neon
's drone, they wouldn't be able to search for them.
Osuka
 suggests Hana actually means to use Kae as a hostage. Himawari attempts to look for them with her
Byakugan
, but doesn't have enough stamina left. Despite the danger, the class wants to save Kae. Hidden in a cave, Kae struggles against her restraints and asks Hana why she's doing it. She tells Kae she's meeting associates, and orders her to be quiet. Kae tries convincing Hana to go back, to no avail, Hana landing a kunai near head. Hana explains she was embedded in the village for missions like this. Tears well up in one of Assassin-Hana's eyes, and she determines Teacher-Hana is sad inside her. Instead of killing Kae, Hana is waiting for the imprisoned
minister
's subordinate to arrive by ship, they can return to the
Land of Bamboo
 with Kae as a hostage.
 Kae is confident that Kawaki and the others will save her, but Hana doesn't think they can find her before the ship arrives.
Kura
 produces a length of rope that
Eiki
 is able to stretch over the destroyed bridge so everyone can cross. Kawaki thinks both he and Hana underestimated the students.
Harika
 tries using
kikaichū
 to gather information, but still can't control them over wide ranges.
Sōsha
 recalls an article from the
Academy
 newspaper about a couple who lived on the island, but doesn't recall the details. Kura has the article, having intended to read on her free time. From it, they discover Hana is likely to go to the west coast, so she can leave by boat.
Konashi
 recognises the smell of the sweet he gave Kae, finding crumbs nearby, left as a trail by Kae, which Harika's kikaichū can follow. Kawaki doesn't know what to do with Hana when Himawari asks him about it. They find the cave where Kae is. Kawaki doesn't want the class to continue, and reveals he's a shinobi. The class thinks Kawaki finds them to be dead weight, but he assures them he made it this far because of them. Himawari follows Kawaki to the cave, reminding him she's his partner. The class is frustrated there's nothing they can do, but Eiki says there is something they can do. Kae uses the kunai Hana landed near her to cut through her restraints, and flees. Having left the kunai on purpose, Hana attacks Kae, surprised she actually tried to escape. She needs Kae as a hostage, but she can hurt her and break her spirit. Kae attempts to fight Hana anyway. Kawaki and Himawari arrive, Kawaki telling Hana his classmates helped find her.
