"
The Third Kazekage
" (
三代目風影
,
Sandaime Kazekage
) is episode 24 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Sasori
 has formed the
Iron Sand
 into a
giant pyramid and rectangular prism
, which he uses it to attack
Sakura
. Recalling her training with
Tsunade
, in which the Slug Princess taught her to evade an enemy's attacks and read their movements, Sakura is able to anticipate Sasori's movements, impressing
Chiyo
, and the former uses her
Chakra Enhanced Strength
 to punch and kick the pyramid and rectangular prism around the cave. This causes the entire roof of the hideout to collapse.

Impressed by Sakura's strength and realising she could continue to repel his attacks, Sasori decides to expend more of the
Third Kazekage puppet
's
chakra
 by creating more Iron Sand, which he manipulates into a
gigantic sphere of branching spikes
. Sakura finds herself unable to block or evade the attack, and is helpless as the attack rains down on her. Although she manages to avoid severe physical injury, it turns out Sasori had infused the Iron Sand with his special brand of
poison
, and that the Iron Sand's branches managed to cut Sakura; she collapses due to the poison. Sasori states that while Sakura would die in three days if left alone, he would rather finish her off right now. Revealing a blade hidden within the Third Kazekage puppet, he sends it towards Sakura to personally finish her off, only for Sakura to leap up and destroy the entire puppet in a single punch.

Outside the cave,
Team Guy
 continues to fight their
clones
, though to no avail. All of them notice the rumbling around them, and
Neji
 notifies them that the hide-out is collapsing;
Lee
 praises Sakura's ability to hold her own. Elsewhere,
Kakashi
 notices the sound of the cave-in, but is out of range of everyone else and continues to follow
Naruto
, who is pursuing
Deidara
.

Trivia

During Sakura's flashback to her training with
Tsunade
, an animation error occurs, which shows Sakura with long hair before she took
part
 in the
Chūnin Exams
 again. This is impossible, because Sakura had already cut her hair short during her first Chūnin Exams, which was before Tsunade returned to
Konoha
.
