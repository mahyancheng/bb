Trivia

In terms of the Gentle Fist art being derived off of a Chinese martial art, the term Zesshō (
literally meaning:
 Suppressed Approaching) is derived off of the
Zesshō Hohō
 technique in the same vein (which is also another technique commonly used by Chinese martial arts in video games).

In
Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 2
, Neji's Team Special with Hinata involves him using the final strike of the technique as the finisher.
