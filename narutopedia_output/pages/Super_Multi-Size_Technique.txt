This is a heightened version of the
Akimichi clan
's
Multi-Size Technique
. It is essentially the same as the base version, though the user becomes significantly larger, on a scale comparable to a mountain. Because of their huge size, any physical attacks the user makes are by default extremely powerful and cover a wide area. Such a drastic increase in size places a great strain on the user's body.
 The
chakra
 requirements to perform this technique are also quite steep; in Part I,
Chōji Akimichi
 must take one of the
Three Coloured Pills
 in order to have enough chakra.

Trivia

In
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2
, Chōji uses this technique under the name "Chubby Dive" (
ポッチャリダイブ
,
Potchari Daibu
).
