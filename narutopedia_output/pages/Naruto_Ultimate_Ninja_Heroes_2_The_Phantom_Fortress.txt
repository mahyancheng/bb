Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 2: The Phantom Fortress
 is the first
Naruto
 instalment of the
PlayStation Portable
 as well as the sequel to
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes
 in the English version. Unlike the previous game, this game has a game-exclusive
Mugen Castle Arc
 which is the after events of previous arcs.

Gameplay

In this video game, the player can equip skills and items to four characters of any choice. This release is the full non-modified version of
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes
, and contains the three characters that were removed, which includes The Third Hokage, Shizune and Kabuto. Both removed stages and the game's Story Mode are now present as well. Additionally, movesets have been updated. Gamers can also select the characters to use Japanese or English voices. Jiraiya and Naruto can use Rasengan, Kakashi can use Lightning Cutter and Sasuke can use Chidori without the use of a secret technique.

While some characters retain their old techniques, others, such as Neji, have theirs upgraded. The game contains an original storyline involving moving up a haunted castle through the eyes of Naruto, and for a certain amount of floors, Gaara, called the
Mugen Castle
 in the sky and has a hundred floors. Each floor has several "unstable" rooms where the users place randomly generated scrolls to determine the type of action that will take place in the room. The scrolls include Battle (a player vs. CPU fight) and five mini game scrolls: Tree Climbing (Naruto dashes up a tree and dodges broken branches), Shadow Possession (style button pressing), Amusement (slot machines), Riddle (
Naruto
 trivia) and Clone (the shell game while trying to follow the real clone). Stable rooms include Treasure Rooms, Healing Rooms and Drama rooms (where the story progresses and cut scenes take place). Hidden Mugen Castle Mode is unlocked after completing Mugen Castle Mode. It involves viewing through the eyes of Jiraiya who is accompanied by Tsunade, Shizune, and Kakashi (temporarily) and going down Mugen Castle 30 floors (from the stairs leading below that were hidden in the first floor by a
False Surroundings Technique
) to the cauldron where the vitality is stored. Previously, Jiraiya couldn't make it alone due to a seal that required at least four ninja to release. Other game modes include Vs. CPU and a wireless battle mode where the player can fight against a friend using only one UMD (but two PSPs).
