Sealing Technique: Octopus Hold

generate

clones made of ink

Usage

A fūinjutsu made for large military affairs, it can instantly seal up to 1,000 enemies. The clones, when they flank and entangle the enemy, begin to bind them. Within three seconds, the target's entire body is dyed by ink, completely sealing their movements; escape is impossible.
