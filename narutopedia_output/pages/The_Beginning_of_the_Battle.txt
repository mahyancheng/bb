Summary

After gathering his things,
Sasuke
 heads for

Sakura
 waiting for him there. He tells her to go home. She does not, instead asking why, after all they've been through together, he always ignores her. Sasuke responds that she can't understand him, but Sakura insists that, because she loves him, she's willing to try. She offers to help him take revenge and to accompany him in leaving Konoha, anything so long as she can be with him. He leaves so she threatens to scream. He knocks her out after thanking her. The
