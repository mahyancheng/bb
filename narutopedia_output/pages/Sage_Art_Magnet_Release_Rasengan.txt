A technique that's available to Naruto after inheriting the
Sage of the Six Paths
' powers. By combining his
Rasengan
 with
Shukaku
's
Magnet Release
 to reinforce its suction power, he creates a Rasengan with the beast's
cursed seal
 markings. He then smashes the sphere into his opponent in the same manner as a normal Rasengan. Upon being struck with this technique, the markings quickly spread across the target's body and immobilises them.

Trivia






The technique depicted in the manga.



In the
coloured manga
 release of the chapter, the Magnet Release Rasengan is coloured similar to Shukaku's body, giving it the appearance of a sand-sphere. In the anime, it was depicted as being made of chakra, while in the manga, the Rasengan is solid.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
, Naruto refers to this technique just as the "Rasengan", rather than the full name.
