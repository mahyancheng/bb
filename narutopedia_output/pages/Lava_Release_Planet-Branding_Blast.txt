Using Lava Release, the user can either expel acid from their mouth as a projectile,
 or create the substance from beneath the ground to erupt as a large explosion. The liquid is capable of melting objects.

Trivia

In
Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
, while the projectile variation retains the name, the stream variation is referred to as
Lava Release: Muddy Stream Wave
 (
溶遁・濁流波
), despite both sharing the same name in the manga and anime.
