"
A Place to Return To
" (
帰るべき場所
,
Kaerubeki Basho
) is episode 112 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Sakura
 heals
Ino
's wounds,
Shizune
 and
Hinata
 tend to
Yūkimaru
, whose
Chakra Pathway System
 has been severely disrupted, causing him to lose the power over the
Three-Tails
 permanently.
Katsuyu
, using her
Slug Great Division
 to have one body in
Tsunade
's office and the other at the
Orochimaru Search Team
's hideout, relays Tsunade's orders that they are to return to
Konoha
 the following morning as she sends an
Anbu
 team to relieve them. As Yūkimaru sleeps that night, he has a vision of
Guren
 being rescued by
Gozu
; during his time as one of
Orochimaru
's failed experiments, the
sannin
 had left him to die until Guren had given him a ladle of water, hence explaining his loyalty and gratefulness towards her. In the middle of the night, Yūkimaru gets up and leaves the hideout in order to be with them.
Naruto
 wakes up to see Yūkimaru gone and chases after him, while
Yamato
 and
Kakashi
 decide not to follow him. Naruto spots Guren's crystallised camellia and realises that there are no cracks in it, meaning that Guren is alive. Knowing that Yūkimaru is with her, Naruto uncharacteristically voices his opinion towards the team that they have no need to find Yūkimaru as he is fine;
Shino
 and
Kakashi
 add that Yūkimaru's importance to Konoha has been dissolved after he lost his ability to control the Three-Tails and that it is not their job to go after runaways.

Kabuto
 returns back home, where he tells Orochimaru that Guren has been killed and that Yūkimaru has lost his powers, apologising for not securing the Three-Tails. As Orochimaru begins to cough relentlessly, Kabuto rushes off to retrieve his medicine while musing that Orochimaru's
current host
 has reached its limits; Orochimaru smiles as he relishes the thought of finally being able to
take over

Sasuke
's body. Meanwhile,
Deidara
 overhears the Anbu mentioning that the
mist
 caused by the Three-Tails can induce hallucinations. Thanking them for the tip, he proceeds to kill them all with his
Explosive Clay
. He then flies over the lake on his clay bird while dropping his detonating clay spiders into the lake to disrupt and summon the
tailed beast
. As the Three-Tails emerges, Deidara tasks Tobi with the duty of acquiring it, which Tobi is unable to do. As Tobi is taken underwater by Deidara, Deidara uses his
C1
 to flip the turtle on its back and knock it out. Having defeated the turtle, Deidara uses two clay birds and ropes to tow the tailed beast back to the
Akatsuki
's hideout.
