While one is already boasted as an
absolute defense
, the user — without the need of
hand seals
 — instantly summons five
Rashōmon
 gates to neutralise incoming attacks. The user can alter the positioning of all five gates, even if it is to change the trajectory of an attack. Not only were the combination of these gates able to redirect an attack as powerful as a
Tailed Beast Ball

equipped
 with a
Susanoo
 sword, but they remained standing upon impact.
