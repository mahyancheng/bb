"
Chiyo's Secret Skills
" (
チヨの奥の手
,
Chiyo no Oku no Te
) is episode 22 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 continues to follow
Deidara
, who considers himself lucky that will have taken down not one but two
jinchūriki
. Only wanting to take on Naruto, he attempts to ditch
Kakashi
 using his
Explosive Clay
, but Kakashi prevails. As his supply of clay is running low, he realises that he must face Kakashi along with Naruto at the same time. Kakashi continues to follow as he is already too far from the others, even noting that he is about to be out of range of the wireless radio's transmission.

Sakura
 manages to escape the
poison
 gas cloud by using an
explosive tag
, the blast dissipating the gas. She tells
Sasori
 that he will be taken down by her, but Sasori responds by sending multiple
kunai
 her way.
Chiyo
 blocks the move by using the
"Mother" and "Father" puppets
, that Sasori had modelled out of his dead
parents
 as a child. Sasori finds the idea absurd, as he designed those puppets and knows how they work. Nonetheless, Chiyo has the Mother and Father puppets pull out wire string and have them charge at Sasori. The puppets manage to slice through the
Third Kazekage puppet's

Thousand Hands Manipulation Force
. Sasori detaches the left arm of the puppet before Chiyo's could slice through them. The left arm is revealed to have a
buzzsaw
, but the Mother and Father puppets have hidden weapons of their own. After going through an intense puppet battle, Chiyo manages to destroy the buzzsaw while Sasori destroys the Mother's sword and the Father's club. Deciding to use his trump card, Sasori unveils the Third Kazekage's
secret
 technique:
Iron Sand
, touted to be the most dangerous technique in
Sunagakure
 history.

Meanwhile,
Team Guy
 are having trouble fighting their
clones
, exhausted from their efforts and no one except
Guy
 being able to land a blow on their counterparts.
