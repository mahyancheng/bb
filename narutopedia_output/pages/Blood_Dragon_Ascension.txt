Blood Dragon Ascension
 is a technique that involves the ability of manipulating blood, exclusive of the members of the
Chinoike Clan
. Through this ability, the user forms a dragon of blood with eight heads similar to the "Yamata no Orochi", which all have the ability to regenerate. In addition to the regeneration, the heads of the dragon also have the capacity to release steam after biting a target. The dragon formed is strong enough to restrict the movements of
Sasuke Uchiha
's
Susanoo
 and was able to withstand his
Lightning Release
, when Chino used it in conjunction with the iron-rich hot-springs of the
Valley of Hell
, in the
Land of Hot Water
.

Trivia

The technique appears to be a reference to the Japanese tale of
Susanoo
 who slew an
eight-headed dragon
.

Unlike its novel counterpart, the blood dragon in the anime didn't seem to possess the ability to regenerate its heads.
