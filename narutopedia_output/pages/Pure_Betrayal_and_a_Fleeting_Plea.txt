Synopsis

The three servants of Orochimaru from the same clan as Sasame attack Naruto and Sakura with the spider webs. Naruto tries using shadow clones but the enemy brings down the whole arena and Naruto and his clones fall beneath the sand. Jiraiya arrives, summons a big toad and takes Naruto away to safety along with Sakura and Sasame. Later, when Jiraiya decides to halt for a lunch rest,

 drugs
Naruto

Sakura
 and
Jiraiya
, by giving them a sleeping potion mixed in the tea. She prepares to let them be given to
Orochimaru
 in order for her to be led to
Arashi
. When she discovers that they were to be killed, she begs the ones about to do so to stop. Naruto reveals that he and the others faked being put to sleep, and attack.

powerful technique that shortens her life
, then escapes with

Trivia

When Naruto uses the
Rasengan
 at the beginning of the episode, he calls it by both the rōmaji and the literal English. This is likely a dubbing error as this is the only episode where this occurs.
