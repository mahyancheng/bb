With his
Rinnegan
,

Sasuke
 can use an unspecified
Space–Time Ninjutsu
 to travel to different dimensions.

Usage

The technique creates a dark spiralling portal that people can enter with ease. With it, Sasuke can travel to and from different dimensions that he can locate.

This technique requires a large amount of chakra, and extended usage leaves Sasuke incapable of using this technique, his
Mangekyō Sharingan
, and his Rinnegan's full power, for some time.
 Sasuke also stated that the number of people who could enter the portal was limited: only the four
Kage
 and
Boruto Uzumaki
 joined him on the rescue mission to save
Naruto
; however, they were secretly followed through the portal by
two

people
.

Trivia

Despite the limited use Sasuke has on this technique, its refinement and might appears to exceed that of
Kamui
. Whereas Obito's accessing of another dimension required both his Mangekyō and additional
chakra
 from
Sakura
, which still severely strained his body and sight, Sasuke showed no visible strain besides brief exhaustion from multiple uses.

In
Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker
, this technique, called "
Time Space Hop
" (
時空間移動
,
Jikūmaidō
), is equated with
a similar space-time ninjutsu
, which, however, does not require the Rinnegan and therefore cannot be the same.
 However, since Sasuke's Rinnegan is mistakenly referred to as the
Rinne Sharingan
 in this game, it is not entirely clear whether Madara's version of this technique is due to his third eye or to his two Rinnegan (which in this case would have received a power upgrade through
the power of the Ten-Tails
 and the
Six Paths Senjutsu
).
