Chūnin Exams

Main article:
Chūnin Exams

He sits next to
Sakura
 during the first phase of the
Chūnin Exams
. He asks
Ibiki
 how many teams will be allowed to pass, but withdraws his question when he realises the answer won't do him any good.

Trivia

"Nejiri" (
捩じり
) means "torsion".

In the anime, Nejiri is merely surprised when Ibiki explains that points will be deducted for each failed cheating attempt. His hair is also different, and his forehead protector indicates him as a
Konoha
 genin instead of Suna.
