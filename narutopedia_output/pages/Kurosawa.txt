Kurosawa
 (
黒澤
,
literally meaning:
 Black Swamp) is the name of Mifune's
sword
. The sword is fairly long and thin, and has a rectangular hand-guard and a long hilt wrapped in bandages. Mifune has shown great skill and dexterity in wielding the sword, performing
Iaidō
 with the blade. He also used it to
slash
 open
Ibuse
's head when the salamander swallowed him. From Mifune's various exploits with this blade, Kurosawa became a very revered weapon.

Sometime after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Mifune began training many disciples, including
Sazanka
 and
Tsubaki Kurogane
, and eventually decided to have a tournament where the winner would have the right to bear Kurosawa after Mifune's retirement. Tsubaki ultimately won, leading Sazanka, in a fit of jealousy, to kill all the other disciples before escaping. After becoming a mercenary and honing his power, Sazanka claimed he lost interest in Kurosawa.

Trivia

Mifune refers to his sword as a Meitō (
名刀
,
literally meaning:
 Famous/Excellent Sword), which means that Kurosawa has a history and a legendary status, having become part of the identity of its owner.

The name of the sword is probably derived from the name of the famed samurai film director,
Akira Kurosawa
, who also directed the film
Yōjinbō
, where Mifune's name also comes from.
