"
A New Formation: Ino–Shika–Chō!
" (
炸裂!ニューフォーメーションいのシカチョウ
,
Sakuretsu! Nyū Fōmēshon Ino–Shika–Chō
) is episode 145 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Team 10
 tells
Naruto
 that they will take care of the
brothers
, and use their combined skills to immobilise them. Naruto leaves to catch up to
Iruka
, who is fighting
Mizuki
 in a building used to test
Academy
 instructors. It is revealed that Iruka and Mizuki are childhood friends, although Mizuki only hoped to get close to the
Hokage
. Mizuki reveals that he has become stronger and learned new techniques while in prison. Meanwhile
Ino
,
Shikamaru
 and
Chōji
 form a new formation. Mizuki sets
exploding tags
 on the building and blows it up with Iruka inside.

Trivia

There is some inconsistency in this episode concerning Shikamaru's
Shadow Imitation Technique
, as Ino takes control of Raijin and punches Fūjin with Shikamaru being left unaffected (it is previously stated as Shikamaru has control of
Gaara
 and Naruto punches Gaara in the face that punching Gaara while Shikamaru has hold of him with the shadow position will also affect him).
