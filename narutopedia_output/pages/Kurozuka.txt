Kurozuka
 (
クロヅカ
) was an
Anbu
 and one of the last remaining members of the
Land of Woods
'
Prajñā Group
.

Personality

Kurozuka was loyal to his comrades, fearlessly attacking high-ranking
shinobi
 as an act of revenge. In the anime, he also refused to answer any questions from
Danzō Shimura
, ordering him to kill him instead.

Appearance

Kurozuka had short brown hair and wore the standard attire of the shinobi from his country: a high-collared
flak jacket
 and a white demon-like mask with three prominent horns and an open mouth to conceal his identity.

Abilities

As an Anbu, Kurozuka was probably a very skilled shinobi. He was also confident in close-range combat, as seen when he charged at Danzō and his escorts head on.

Part II

Kurozuka was part of the initial attack launched against Danzō Shimura to avenge the destruction of their group, but Danzō easily
cut them down
. Lying vulnerably in front of Danzō, he refused to answer his questions and was killed by him using one of his comrades'
swords
. Danzō then used Kurozuka's body to block the second wave of attacks and to find out his enemies' positions, ultimately killing them all.
