 The Seal Destroyed) is volume 47 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 433

"
Senjutsu Failed…!?
" (
仙術失敗…!?
,
Senjutsu Shippai…!?
)

With
Naruto
 no longer in
Sage Mode
, the
Deva Path
 attacks him. While the two spar,
Fukasaku

summons
 one of Naruto's
shadow clones
 that has been gathering
natural energy
. When it disperses its natural energy, it is then transferred to Naruto. In Sage Mode once again, Naruto throws another
Rasenshuriken
 at the Deva Path, which the
Preta Path

absorbs
. Seeing that the
Naraka Path
 has restored the Preta Path, Naruto focuses his efforts on it. He distracts the Deva and Preta Paths, allowing him to destroy the Naraka Path in one decisive hit.

Chapter 434

"
Naruto vs. Deva Path!!
" (
ナルトVS天道!!
,
Naruto Bāsasu Tendō!!
)

Although the
Naraka Path
 has been destroyed, the
Deva Path
's gravitational abilities, which it has been unable to use since destroying
Konoha
, has returned. It first sends Naruto's
toad
 allies out of the village, and then pulls Naruto into the
Preta Path
's grasp. The Preta Path
absorbs
 his
chakra
 to keep him from moving.

Chapter 435

"
Banshō Ten'in
" (
万象天引
,
Banshō Ten'in
)

While the
Preta Path
 is
absorbing

Naruto
's
chakra
, it also absorbs the natural energy he was storing. Unable to control it, the Preta Path turns into a stone
toad
 that Naruto is able to break free from.
Fukasaku
 and
Shima
, meanwhile, have been preparing the
genjutsu
 that helped
Jiraiya
 defeat three of the
Six Paths of Pain
. Not wanting to be defeated by the same technique again, the
Deva Path
 kills Fukasaku. It then pins and captures Naruto.

Chapter 436

"
Peace
" (
平和
,
Heiwa
)

Even though
Konoha
 has been destroyed, its
ninja
 continue the investigation into
Pain
.
Inoichi
 hypothesises that the
Six Paths of Pain
 are being controlled remotely from one of the highest points around the village. All able-bodied ninja are sent to look for Pain's base mind. Meanwhile, the
Deva Path
 encourages the captured
Naruto
 not to struggle, as his death and, subsequently, a world living in constant fear of destruction will help achieve
Jiraiya
's dreams of peace. Naruto vows to stop it and achieve peace in his own way. The Deva Path explains how a life of tragedy and hate drove it to its ideas for peace and asks how Naruto, having never known either, can have a better solution. Naruto has no answer.

Chapter 437

"
Confession
" (
告白
,
Kokuhaku
)

Naruto
 repeats that
Jiraiya
 would not have condoned
Pain
's ideas on how to attain world peace. The
Deva Path
 responds that both Naruto and Jiraiya are foolish and that their deaths will create the only peace it is possible to have. When
Shima
 tries to encourage Naruto, the Deva Path pushes her away. Before it can take Naruto away,
Hinata
 attacks the Deva Path. Naruto tells her to run since she can't win. Hinata knows this, but says that after watching Naruto for so long and wishing to be with him, she can't help but want to protect him now. She tells Naruto that she loves him. Before he had time to even process what she had said, Hinata attacks the Deva Path but is quickly struck down and apparently killed. Enraged by the "murder" that was witnessed first-hand, Naruto breaks free of his restraints and enters a
six-tailed form
.

Chapter 438

"
The Seal Destroyed!!
" (
封印破壊!!
,
Fūin Hakai!!
)

When
Naruto
 has entered a
six-tailed form
, the
First Hokage's necklace
 tries to restrain him. Naruto destroys it.
Yamato
, elsewhere on a mission, senses this and rushes back to
Konoha
 to subdue the
Nine-Tails
' influence.
Ninja
 around the village sense the fox too and try to escape the area. Naruto and the
Deva Path
 begin fighting, but the Deva Path realises it lacks the raw power to be a match for him. It retreats to a location closer to the base Pain,
Nagato
, allowing it to use
Chibaku Tensei
.

Chapter 439

"
Chibaku Tensei
" (
地爆天星
,
Chibaku Tensei
)

Over
Konan
's objections,
Nagato
 uses
Chibaku Tensei
 through the
Deva Path
, further weakening his already frail body.
Naruto
, in a
six-tailed form
, is caught in a giant sphere of debris. He enters an
eight-tailed form
 to escape, but even then he has difficulty. Frustrated, Naruto, within his subconscious, cries out for help. The
Nine-Tails
 offers to destroy Naruto's enemies if he lets it go. Naruto prepares to remove the seal keeping the Nine-Tails contained, but is stopped by the
Fourth Hokage
, who thanks the Nine-Tails and its bad influence for giving him a chance to see his son.

Chapter 440

"
A Conversation with the Fourth!!
" (
四代目との会話!!
,
Yondaime to no Kaiwa!!
)

Naruto
 picks up on the
Fourth Hokage
's claim that he is his son. Naruto is overjoyed and follows his father to a part of his subconscious where the
Nine-Tails
 is not threatening to kill them both. The Fourth explains that he had designed Naruto's seal to produce an imprint of him if ever the seal was about to break. Naruto asks why the Fourth would seal the Nine-Tails within his own son. The Fourth responds that he trusted only his son to master the Nine-Tails in order to defeat the
masked man
 responsible for
its attack
 on
Konoha
 sixteen years earlier. They discuss
Pain
's ideas about peace and the Fourth suggests that he is a product of the war-torn era he grew up in, something the masked man is likely taking advantage of. The Fourth encourages Naruto to find his own solutions about peace and Pain. After restoring the seal, he disappears.

Chapter 441

"
Rasenshuriken vs. Shinra Tensei!!
" (
螺旋手裏剣VS神羅天征!!
,
Rasenshuriken Bāsasu Shinra Tensei!!
)

Nagato
 is not able to maintain his
Chibaku Tensei
 any longer. It falls apart and
Naruto
, in
Sage Mode
, lands on the ground. Naruto is confused about how he got here, so
Katsuyu
 explains that he succumbed to the
Nine-Tails
 and went on a rampage. Katsuyu assures him that he did not harm anyone and that
Hinata
 is all right. Seeing the
Deva Path
, he asks it to take him to Nagato. It refuses, so Naruto takes one of its
black receivers
 and tracks Nagato's location. He then attacks the Deva Path with a
Rasenshuriken
, trying to hit it while its repulsion powers are recharging.

Chapter 442

"
The Final Gamble!!
" (
最後の賭け!!
,
Saigo no Kake!!
)

The
Deva Path
 leaps out of the way of
Naruto
's
Rasenshuriken
. It then finds itself in the middle of a horde of
shadow clones
, which surround him and try to attack during the five-second window that it cannot use
Shinra Tensei
. They fail and are repelled, but the combined shadow clones are able to provide enough support for Naruto to resist the repulsive effects. He attacks again with
Rasengan
, finally managing to hit the Deva Path when it is defenceless.
