This is a
barrier technique
 of the highest calibre, surpassing the
Four Red Yang Formation
 in terms of both scale and durability. It is a barrier created by oneself that is impossible for anyone to step past, though it can only be used by those blessed with
Six Paths Power
.
 When
Obito Uchiha
 uses this technique, the
Truth-Seeking Ball
 floating behind his right hand is engulfed in red flame-like chakra, at which point he launches six black rods from his hand, each surrounded by the same red chakra. The rods strike the ground at six points in his surroundings, and once the necessary
hand seals
 are performed, they serve as the origin points for a gigantic red barrier.

Like its smaller counterpart, the barrier is highly malleable, being capable of withstanding the explosion of
four enormous

Tailed Beast Balls
 derived from the power of the
Ten-Tails
 by dispersing their force upwards and into the sky.
 However, as with similar techniques, the barrier can still be bypassed through the use of
space–time ninjutsu
 such as the
Flying Thunder God Technique
.
 The barrier's creator can also deactivate it at will, as well as apparently reactivate it at a later time if necessary.

Trivia

When Obito used this technique in the manga, the Truth-Seeking Ball behind his right hand permanently disappeared, implying it was converted into the black rods used to form the barrier.
 However, in the anime, the orb remained after this technique's activation.

The
fourth databook
 makes no mention of this technique involving a Truth-Seeking Ball, instead stating that it utilises the
Rinnegan
's trademark
black receivers
.
