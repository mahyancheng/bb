The bridge in the manga.
The bridge in the anime.
1/2

This unnamed bridge is located in the
Land of Iron
. It is built out of blue (grey in the anime) stones and features a large gate at one end, somewhat resembling a
torii
, emblazoned with the kanji for
samurai
 (
侍
). On top of the gate is a large stone statue of a sheathed sword with weights hanging on both ends.

Tobi
 confronts
Danzō Shimura
 on this bridge after the
Five Kage Summit
. He captures Danzō's escorts:
Fū Yamanaka
 and
Torune Aburame
 and then
brings out

Sasuke Uchiha
 to fight Danzō. The bridge receives only light damage during the battle and then, after Danzō's defeat, has much of its centre sealed by Danzō's
Reverse Four Symbols Sealing
.
 Sasuke briefly fights with the members of
Team Kakashi
 beneath the bridge shortly afterwards, but the bridge receives no further damage.

Trivia

According to
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations
, the bridge is located on the outskirts of the Land of Iron.
