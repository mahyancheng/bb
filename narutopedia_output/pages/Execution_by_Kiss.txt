This ability allows Fūka to absorb all of an opponent's
chakra
 and
techniques
 by kissing them, giving her multiple
elemental affinities
, as well as enforcing the ones she already has and gaining access to all of her victim's elemental techniques. After absorbing her opponent's chakra, she could steal their soul. This technique could also be used to determine what elemental affinities the target has by licking them. Due to one body being unable to handle so much chakra, Fūka distributes the chakra she absorbed into multiple bodies, and uses
Colour Course Change
 to switch to another if needed.

When she tried using this against
Naruto Uzumaki
 however, she began absorbing the chakra of the
Nine-Tails
, but the pure rage and malice in its chakra proved too much for her that she stopped the technique.

Trivia

In the
Disney XD
 edited version, instead of licking the victim, Fūka smelled her opponents to determine their nature.
