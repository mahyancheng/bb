Tayuya
 plays a melody - her "finale" - with the
Demonic Flute
, causing many-mouthed, worm-like spirits made of
chakra
 to emerge from the mouths of the
Doki
. The chakra of the spirits is almost entirely
spiritual energy
, causing them to ravenously seek out
physical energy
 in order to achieve balance. Tayuya's melody directs the spirits at her targets, who they pursue in so complicated a pattern as to resemble dancing. When the spirits pass through the targets, they take bites of physical energy.
 Because of their immaterial form, the spirits are impervious to direct attack. As such, the target's only chance of stopping the spirits is to either prevent Tayuya from playing her flute or to neutralise the Doki.

Trivia

This technique being primarily composed of spiritual energy implies it may be
Yin Release
. Shikamaru also suggests it uses the same "special chakra" as his clan's
Yin techniques
.

The full name of this technique is Finale, Ninth Movement: Revolt of the Demon World (
終曲第九節・魔境の乱
,
Shūkyoku Daikyūsetsu: Makyō no Ran
).

Shikamaru Nara
 believes this technique is
hiden
 because of the special chakra it uses.

Tō no Sho
 does not label it so.

Tayuya's entry in
Tō no Sho
 mistakenly refers to this technique as "Revolt of the Demon Mirror" (
魔鏡の乱
,
Makyō no Ran
).
