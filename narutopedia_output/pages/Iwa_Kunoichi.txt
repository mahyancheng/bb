Personality

Appearance

She has long brown-coloured hair which she ties in such a fashion as to form a ball on top of her head, using what appears to be a knitting-needle, while two large locks with darkened tips frame the remainder of her face. Her typical attire consists of a short sleeveless dress, further adorned by the presence of numerous bandages that encircle various portions of her body, including her waist and thighs.

Abilities

Like most Iwagakure ninja, she uses
Earth Release
, which she employs in the form of
dragons
 and
landslides
. She also wields a
sword
, meaning she is possibly skilled in
kenjutsu

Land of Fire

genin
, she confronted
Kosuke
 and was surprised to hear that the genin took out so many of her men. After this, she threatened to kill the elderly man. However,

Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique

earthen dragon
.
