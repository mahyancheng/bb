Before this technique can be performed, the user's body must first be modified to increase its flexibility and elasticity. Once this is done, the user can stretch and bend their body however and whenever they please, extending it to great lengths and retracting it again.
 This is done by dislocating their joints and then using
chakra
 to manipulate their body's shape. The technique was originally developed for intelligence gathering so that users could squeeze into smalls spaces.
 In combat, users can wrap around targets to restrain or constrict them, or strike at them with their limbs, the limbs' length making them similar to
whips
.

Trivia

Rokurokubi
 (
ろくろ首
) are yōkai that were originally humans, but broke the precepts or doctrines of Buddhism. Cursed, these monsters had infinitely extendable necks and used them to spy on mortals. The worst of these preyed on humans or bit them and drank their blood (much like how Orochimaru gives his
cursed seals
).
