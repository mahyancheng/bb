Ruka
 (
ルカ
) is a
kunoichi
 of
Kirigakure
.

Personality

While having a quiet, reserved demeanour, Ruka is fiercely loyal to her village and equally so to her comrades as she spoke out against Pakura's tirade against Kirigakure telling her that the
Fifth Mizukage
 would usher in a new era for the village while worrying about the safety of her comrades.

Appearance

Ruka is a slim woman with fair skin, black eyes, and shoulder-length brown hair. She sports the standard attire of
Kirigakure
 with a skirt and an
Allied Shinobi Forces
 forehead protector.

Abilities

Ruka is quite capable at using
Water Release
 techniques, as she was able to counter
Pakura
's
Scorch Release
 using a mixture of the
Water Release: Water Formation Wall
 technique and a stream of water. She can also readily change the amount of water she employs in her techniques.

As a
medical-nin
, Ruka has basic knowledge of medical treatments and ninjutsu, as well as good chakra control.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

As the
reincarnated
 shinobi reappeared on the battlefield, most of the Third Division is scattered into small squads. Ruka is part of a squad led by
Monga
. Ruka promised Monga that she would also put her life on the line to save his, if something were to happen to him.
Gari
 appears before the squad and after a short fight, is blown up by Monga. Ruka and the squad look in shock when Monga is
mummified
 by
Pakura
.
Maki
 explains to Ruka that she was once the kunoichi's student. After revealing her death at the hands of
Kirigakure
, Ruka explains to Pakura that the "Bloody Mist" was no longer the murderous village it used to be thanks to the
Fifth

Mizukage
, however Pakura notes that it would not erase the past. Pakura launched another attack on the squad and
incinerates
 the area to find the hiding shinobi. The squad protect themselves from the blast with Maki's
Cloth Binding Technique
 and Ruka's
Water Release
. Pakura finds the squad and prepares to kill them until the arrival of
Omoi
 and
Zaji
. As Gari's regeneration is finished, he joins Pakura in fighting the shinobi but having a change of heart, Pakura allows the squad to flee while halting Gari's movements.

Trivia

Ruka being the Japanese pronunciation of
"Luke"
, her name may be a reference to
St. Luke
 who was the patron saint of physicians and surgeons.
