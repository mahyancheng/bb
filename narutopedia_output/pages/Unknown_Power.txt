"
Unknown Power…!!
" (
未知の能力…!!
,
Michi no Chikara…!!
) is chapter 271 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Kakashi
 tries to get
Naruto
 to calm down so that they can team-up against
Deidara
, suggesting a plan that will utilise both of their strengths. Meanwhile,
Sasori
 cannot understand how
Sakura
 is able to move after being
poisoned
. When he sees her healing her injuries he realises that she is a
medical-nin
 and that she has perhaps created an antidote. Since this would mean she is no ordinary opponent, Sasori gives up on other
puppets
 and removes his robe, revealing that
his body
 is a puppet too. He attacks Sakura and separates her from
Chiyo
, and then turns his attention to the defenceless Chiyo.
