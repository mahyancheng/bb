) is chapter 700+9 of the
Naruto Gaiden
 mini-series.

Summary

Shin
 creates a makeshift arm out of scalpels and prepares to engage
Sakura
 in battle. As
Naruto
,
Sasuke
,
Sarada
, and
Chōchō
 fly to Shin's location in Sasuke's
Susanoo
, Sarada thinks about Sakura, Sasuke, and
Karin
, and what Sasuke's relationship with his wife really is like only to be comforted by Naruto and regains her composure. Shin uses his scalpels to form a large shuriken and throws it at Sakura, but it is intercepted by Sasuke's
Susanoo Sword
. Sasuke then
crushes
 Shin's bones, removes the scalpels from Sakura's arm, and burns them with
Amaterasu
 while Sarada smiles with delight that there is love between husband and wife.
 The group prepares to capture Shin so he can be interrogated at
Konohagakure
, but
Shin's clones
 stab him with their kunai, much to everyone's shock. The clones declare that Shin's genes have become weak and that they will become strong and evolve instead of him. An army of Shin clones appears and starts fighting Naruto and Sasuke. While his enemies are distracted, Shin attempts to
warp
 away from the battlefield and take the girls with him using his
creature
. However, Sarada intervenes and
kills
 the creature with a single punch. More clones of Shin arrive and Naruto suggests they retreat. Sakura tells Sarada to stand back, but Sarada instead charges at the clone army. Dodging a kunai and stating her desire to protect her mother, Sarada
attacks
 the clones.
