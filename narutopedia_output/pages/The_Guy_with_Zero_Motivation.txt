Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Shikamaru
 hides from
Temari
 in a patch of trees.
Ino
 yells to him to end the fight quickly, but
Chōji
 predicts that Shikamaru will find some reason to forfeit. Temari gets increasingly annoyed because Shikamaru is hiding and not fighting in a conventional way. Shikamaru tries to catch Temari with his shadow but she, while dodging it, realises that it has a limited range. She also reasons that he is hiding in the trees to take advantage of the trees' shadows to extend his range. Knowing that he will only gain more shadows as the battle progresses, Temari tries to end the fight quickly. After meditating on the factors of fight, Shikamaru comes up with a plan and, after avoiding her attacks, tries to catch her again, but she stays out of its range once more.
