Pain, the former village head of Amegakure.



The
village head
 (
里長
,
sato-osa
) is the highest-ranking, and usually the most powerful
shinobi
, of their respective village. The village head is the main representative of their village, and is in charge of administrative and military activities. Although each village usually has only one village head, the actual day-to-day governing is generally shared with various councillors and top-ranking shinobi. Each village has their own way of deciding on the village leader, using methods as diverse as democratic elections and hereditary succession.

The head of shinobi villages from the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 wield the greatest power, and are particularly respected. They are the only village heads allowed to bear the name of
Kage
.
