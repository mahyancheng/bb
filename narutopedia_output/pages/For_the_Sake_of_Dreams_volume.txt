 approaches Inari and tells him about Naruto's background; how he grew up without family or friends, but chose to not feel sorry for himself and solve problems his own way. The next day, the rest of

Supīdo!!

Sasuke
 and
Haku
 begin fighting. Although Haku is a skilled opponent, Sasuke is able to make good use of what he learned during his training and pushes Haku to his limits. Irritated that Sasuke is doing so well, Haku uses his trump card:
Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals

 attempts to come to his aid but is stopped by
Zabuza

Naruto
 appears and lands a sneak attack on Haku.

Chapter 25

"
For the Sake of Dreams…!!
" (
夢の為に…!!
,
Yume no Tame ni…!!
)

Zabuza
 tries to kill
Naruto
 but is stopped by
Haku
, who asks that he be allowed to fight him by himself. Zabuza agrees. Naruto, planning to help
Sasuke
, enters the ice prison, in the process becoming trapped just like Sasuke. The two try to attack Haku but their efforts are quickly neutralised because of Haku's extreme speed. Haku asks that they stop trying to escape since he has no interest in killing them. He will if he needs to if it means preserving his dreams of being useful to Zabuza. Worried about what will happen to Naruto and Sasuke, Kakashi prepares to fight Zabuza so that he can provide assistance.

Chapter 26

"
The Sharingan Crumbles…!!
" (
写輪眼崩し…!!
,
Sharingan Kuzushi…!!
)

Zabuza
 attacks
Kakashi
 before he has a chance to reveal his
Sharingan
. Kakashi blocks the attack but Zabuza is unconcerned, having learned from their previous encounter.
Haku
 had watched their battle and realised that the Sharingan's apparent mind reading abilities were only an illusion. To avoid falling prey to the same trick twice, Zabuza coats the area in a thick mist to reduce visibility and also fights with his eyes closed, both factors making it impossible for the Sharingan to hypnotise him. Kakashi having lost his advantage, Zabuza takes the opportunity to try and kill Tazuna. Kakashi appears before
Tazuna
 at the last second to block the attack.

Chapter 27

"
Awakening…!!
" (
覚醒…!!
,
Mezame…!!
)

Sasuke
 and
Naruto
 are becoming exhausted by
Haku
's relentless attacks. However, the attacks are becoming increasingly less successful, with Sasuke slowly being able to not only follow Haku's fast movements but to react and avoid the attacks entirely. Realising that this is because Sasuke has awakened his own
Sharingan
 eyes, Haku moves to kill Naruto so that he will have an easier time fighting Sasuke. Meanwhile,
Kakashi
 has been badly wounded by
Zabuza
. Zabuza points out that he will soon die just like Sasuke and Naruto, but Kakashi has faith in them in their survival. Elsewhere, Naruto finds that Sasuke has used himself as a shield against Haku's attack. Naruto asks why Sasuke would do that, but Sasuke does not know why. He laments that he did not have a chance to kill
his brother
 before seeming to die. Enraged by the loss of Sasuke, Naruto vows to kill Haku.

Naruto

Naruto
!
