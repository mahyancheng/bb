The
Flower-Fruit Mountain
 is a
Lava Release
 technique utilised by Son Gokū and its jinchuriki Rōshi. While in his
transformed
 state, Rōshi creates a volcano which then explodes violently, sending molten rock flying up in all directions the effects of which resemble a giant flower. The lava produced is said to be able to melt anything in its path.

Trivia

The summit of the
Mountain of Flowers and Fruits
 (
花果山
,
Ja: Kakazan, Ch: Huāguǒshān
) is the birthplace of Sūn Wùkōng, the main character of the Chinese novel
Journey to the West
. The mountain is located on a volcanic island. The Four-Tails, of course, is based on Sūn Wùkōng and the
Dragon Ball
 series, which in turn is also based on
Journey to the West
.

When written as 火山, kazan means 'volcano'.

In an anime exclusive sequence, Rōshi, while offscreen, used what appears to be this technique when colliding with
Kisame
's
Water Release: Great Exploding Water Colliding Wave
 technique.
