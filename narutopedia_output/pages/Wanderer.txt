Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

On a cliff, a young lady named
Hotaru
 sits on the edge overlooking the mountain when she is approached by a young man named
Utakata
. Hotaru's servant,
Tonbee
, tells them that there are enemies out there triggering their traps and are most likely invading
Mount Katsuragi
 in order to get their hands on Hotaru's grandfather's
forbidden technique
. Tonbee decides to protect the fort as Utakata and Hotaru escape. Tonbee, however, manages to send word out to
Konohagakure
 for help.

In her office,
Tsunade
 is given the request by
Shizune
, and the former explains that long ago,
En no Gyōja
, the leader of the
Tsuchigumo Clan
, had developed a
technique
 that was capable of destroying an entire village. The
Third Hokage
 had then requested that En no Gyōja classify it as a kinjutsu; in return, Konoha would provide them with assistance whenever they would need it. In order to protect
Naruto
 from the
Akatsuki
, Tsunade decides to send Naruto amongst the squad that is to be dispatched to Mount Katsuragi.

After having failed to complete the
Itachi Pursuit Mission
, the
Eight Man Squad
 make their way back home when they are stopped by
Katsuyu
, the personal summon of Tsunade herself. Katsuyu relays the situation at Mount Katsuragi to Kakashi, who decides to send
Team 7
, under
Yamato
's command, to deal with the crisis. Meanwhile, the
four bandits
 manage to
shatter the barrier
 and infiltrate the fort, only to find Tonbee and no forbidden scroll. They
attack
 the old man, who does not divulge any information. Of one of the bandits,
Akaboshi
, manages to deduce that En no Gyōja's granddaughter must possess the scroll with the kinjutsu and decides that they should leave, as he senses Team 7's impending arrival.

As they get there,
Sai
 finds the hidden path that Hotaru and Utakata had used to escape. Yamato orders
Sakura
 to stay with Tonbee and heal him while the other three follow the hidden path. On the path, Hotaru asks Utakata to teach her more techniques, with Utakata stating that he has taught her nothing. She asks whether he remembers the first time he met and he had saved her life, using his
Soap Bubble Ninjutsu
 to
kill
 enemy
shinobi
 who were after her. Utakata reveals that they were after him, as he is a wanted man, and that he was only saving himself; his only reason for coming with her to their fort was to throw off his trail. Hotaru does not care, and cries for her "master" to train her. Angered at being called master, Utakata lashes out, only for Naruto to interfere. Using his
shadow clones
, Naruto attempts to defeat Utakata, who uses his
Drowning Bubble Technique
 to take out the shadow clones. However, Hotaru tells Naruto that Utakata is her protector, not her enemy.

As Yamato and Sai catch up, Naruto apologises for attacking him. Utakata, however, tells him that he is leaving Hotaru under Team 7's care and begins to walk away. Hotaru runs up to Utakata, pleading for him to stay, but he merely creates a bubble and
drifts
 away.
