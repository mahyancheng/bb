I Don't Care Any More

どうでもいいんだよ
,
Dō Demo Īn da yo
,
Viz:
 It Doesn't Matter to Me) is chapter 607 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Upon hearing who the man claims to be,
Yahiko
 declares him to either be a criminal or an idiot for using the legend's name.
Nagato
, on the other hand, is eager to meet someone who knows more about the
Rinnegan
, but before he can approach
Obito
 and
Zetsu
, a wary Yahiko escorts him and
Konan
 away, telling the masked man not to approach them again. Before they leave, however, Obito tells Nagato that he would reappear at the same time and place everyday until Nagato realised that his words were true. Some time later, Obito returns to
Konohagakure
 clad in his flame-patterned mask, and heads to the
Konoha Cemetery
, where he watches on as
Kakashi Hatake
 stands over
Rin Nohara
's grave. Eventually the young man leaves to visit the
Memorial Stone
, leaving flowers on her grave, and mentioning highly classified information, that their sensei's son would be born soon. Obito, spying on Kakashi from afar, approaches Rin's grave and angrily throws aside the flowers. Later, Obito subsequently
utilises this information to his advantage
, and when confronted by his
former sensei
, he remembers his first encounter with his
team
 and then states that he no longer cared about this world. In present time,
Naruto
 declares to
Madara
 that he was Minato's son and would not be persuaded by him. Noting that he was being lenient because Naruto was a true
jinchūriki
, he declares that now, he would not hold back. Creating an enormous
Wood Dragon
, he notes that it had been used by
Hashirama Senju
 in the past to bind the
Nine-Tails
, which prompts Naruto to manifest Kurama's body in
Tailed Beast Mode
 to fight it. Kakashi asks Obito why he chose to follow someone like Madara, but the
Uchiha
 notes that all that was left was for him and Kakashi to have their final fight as he had nothing left to say to him.
