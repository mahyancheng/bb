Synopsis

Lee
's speed proved too much for
Gaara
, and his sand was no longer able to form a shield fast enough to be of use. Lee opened the Fifth Gate, and used his most powerful attack,
Reverse Lotus
. Gaara survived this final blow due to him softening his fall by turning his gourd into sand, and used the sand to crush Lee's left arm and leg. Gaara moved his sand to finish Lee, but
Guy
 jumped in to protect his student. Lee, although unconscious due to the pain, rose to continue the battle, his desire to win fuelling his broken body. Guy wept at Lee's dedication, and Lee was taken away to recover. The medical ninja announced that Lee's injuries were too severe to be completely healed, and that he would never be able to fight as a ninja again. Guy regretted teaching Lee such dangerous techniques, and vacated the ring for the final match between
Chōji Akimichi
 and
Dosu Kinuta
.
