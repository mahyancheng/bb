The
Naka Shrine
 (
南賀ノ神社
,
Naka no Jinja
,
Viz:
 Nakano Shrine,
literally meaning:
 Shintō Shrine of Southern Joy) is a shrine that the
Uchiha clan
 originated from.
 It's located in
Konohagakure
's Uchiha District, and is the home to the clan's patron deity.
 In the main hall, beneath the seventh tatami mat from the far right, is a secret meeting place of the Uchiha clan. There stood a
stone monument
 which contains the clan's secrets and can only be read with specific
dōjutsu
.

The upper level of the shrine was destroyed during
Pain
's
assault
 on Konoha, though the secrets hidden below remained untouched and was later accessed by
Taka
 and
Orochimaru
 during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. In order to access the main hall,
Sasuke Uchiha
 had to use a
sequence of seals
 to remove the sealing stone that lays atop the entranceway. The seal itself has the Sharingan in the middle.

Trivia

This location appeared in
Naruto: The Broken Bond
, which also provided an achievement for
Xbox 360
 and was called "Path of Darkness". The Naka shrine was regarded in the game as Sasuke's Hide Away or Sasuke's Secret Room; it is, however, unknown if at the time the producers of the game knew what this shrine was since it was only shown to be a location that Sasuke was seen while grieving because of the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
 and the thoughts of revenge against
Itachi Uchiha
. This site can be found in Konoha in-game, but it is underneath the island in the south-west area of the village instead of under the main hall in the manga.

This location was also used as an unlockable stage in
Naruto: Gekitō Ninja Taisen! 4
.
