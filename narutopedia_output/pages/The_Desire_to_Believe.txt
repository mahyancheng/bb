Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Sarada
 informs
Boruto
 and
Mitsuki
 that she heard that
Chōjūrō
 immediately went to sea after the
Funato
's broadcast. The ship they arrived on was destroyed, so they need a new one. She asks Boruto if he really thinks he can stop the war. From his encounter with
Kobuna
, Boruto hopes to get through to both Chōjūrō and
Ikada
. They ask for help at a shipyard, but they refuse to set sail during the war, or to lend them a ship.
Kajiki
 calls out to them, and Boruto asks to take them on his ship. Kajiki obliges, having heard the broadcast, not expecting it from Ikada, though Boruto feels he doesn't look surprised. Kajiki explains he comes from a family of fisherman, and he doesn't care much for how either the Funato or
Kirigakure
 do things, and asks Boruto to tell both Ikada and the
Mizukage
 that. He has faith that Boruto's words will reach Ikada. Boruto is impressed by Kajiki's ability to navigate the rough sea. Ikada takes the Funato fleet through enormous waves, impressing everyone.
Araumi
 recalls how Ikada struggled with training when he was a little child, and wishes
Tenma
 and
Seiren
 could see him now.
 He also recalls how
Jibiki
 informed him of
Isari
's plans, and instructed him to go along, while also instructing the
Marlin Harpoon
 to kill Isari. Chōjūrō reflects on the losses caused by the Funato, vowing to end them. Kajiki drops
Team 7
 at the Mizukage's ship, Boruto identifying himself with
Hiramekarei
. He returns it to Chōjūrō, who asks why they're there. He appreciates it if they want to avenge
Kagura
, but thinks the situation has escalated too much for them to remain involved. Boruto says he wants the conflict to stop to avoid more casualties.
Misuno
 is incensed by the suggestion, and though Chōjūrō understands Boruto, he can't do nothing and let the Funato destroy the
Shinonome 1
 station. They point out some people are against the station, and ask if they ever discussed it with the Funato. Misuno recounts how Isari came to talk to them about peace, but was killed by his own weapon as they began discussions, believing it to be a failed attempt to assassinate Chōjūrō. He asks what would be the point at talking at this point. Boruto instead asks time to talk to Ikada, explaining what they've been through together before learning he was a Funato. Chōjūrō has no faith in that, but Boruto points out how Kagura trusted
Buntan
 and the others until the end, who eventually worked hard to meet Kagura's expectations. Chōjūrō agrees to give them some time to try getting the Funato to back off, but they refuse to take a guard with them. He asks Boruto what he'll do if he's unable to get the Funato to stop fighting, and Boruto says he'll cross that bridge when he comes to it. Ikada continues to use his power to navigate the furious waters, parting waves so their fleet can go through it. They get in sight of the Shinonome station and the Kirigakure fleet.
Denki
 and
Iwabee
 struggle to keep
Kyohō
 and Buntan from going after Team 7, while
Metal
 just wants them all the stop.
Yamame
 and
Iwana
 update the village on the upcoming clash between the Funato and Kirigakure. They agree to stop fighting and go after Boruto as allies for now. Sarada pilots Kajiki's ship. Misuno asks Chōjūrō why he's taking such a risk with Boruto, and he explains that Boruto was able to change Kagura's mind in the past, so he's hoping he can pull it off again. Sarada and Mitsuki ask Boruto how he'll get through to Ikada, who seemed so different in the broadcast. Boruto considers himself to be the reason why Ikada changed, and asks Sarada and Mitsuki to trust and watch over him. Kirigakure and the Funato rally their forces in anticipation for an all-out battle. Team 7 sail towards the Funato.
