"
Forbidden Secret Technique: Dead Demon Consuming Seal!
" (
禁術奥義!『屍鬼封尽』
,
Kinjutsu Ōgi! "Shiki Fūjin"
) is episode 73 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

As the battles across
Konoha
 rage on, the
Third Hokage
's shadow clones use the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
 to seal away the souls of the
First Hokage
 and
Second Hokage
. The Third is outraged when he realises that the bodies sacrifices to reanimate the First and Second were none other than
Orochimaru
's students,
Zaku Abumi
 and
Kin Tsuchi
. The Third then rushes at Orochimaru, ready to seal away his soul as well, though he is stopped as Orochimaru's
Kusanagi
 stabs him in the back, which
Enma
 fails to prevent. As Orochimaru wonders why the Third did not move out of the way, the Third reveals that the Dead Demon Consuming Seal is a self-sacrificial technique and that he would have died anyway. Meanwhile,
Sasuke
 again catches up with
Gaara
, and
Kankurō
 prepares to hold Sasuke off while Gaara escapes with Temari. Before they can begin,
Shino Aburame
 arrives to fight Kankurō, telling Sasuke that he has unfinished business with Kankurō since their match never happened, thus allowing Sasuke to proceed pursuing Gaara.
