Nagato
 (
長門
) was a
shinobi
 of
Amegakure
 and descendant of the
Uzumaki clan
. Forming
Akatsuki
 alongside his friends (and fellow war orphans)
Yahiko
 and
Konan
, Nagato dreamed of bringing peace to the violent shinobi world. However, following Yahiko's death, Nagato adopted the alias of
Pain
 (
ペイン
,
Pein
) and, along with Konan, began leading the Akatsuki — an organisation that would force the world into peace using any means necessary.

Background

Nagato lived with his parents:
Fusō
 and
Ise
 on the outskirts of
Amegakure
. When he was very young,
Madara Uchiha
 secretly transplanted his
Rinnegan
 into Nagato without his or his parents' knowledge.
 Sometime later, during the
Second Shinobi World War
, Nagato and his parents took shelter in their home to avoid the fighting going on around them. One day, two
Konoha
 shinobi broke into their home looking for food and Nagato and his parents tried to sneak out unnoticed. When they were discovered, his parents attacked the shinobi so that Nagato could escape. The Konoha ninja killed his parents in self-defence and, upon realising they were only civilians, tried apologising to Nagato. Overcome with grief, Nagato used Madara's Rinnegan for the first time to kill them and avenge his parents.






Nagato as a child.



After burying his parents, Nagato, now an orphan, was forced to leave home and begin wandering in search of food and shelter. With resources scarce due to the ongoing war, no one he met would help him until Nagato, who had collapsed from hunger, was found by
Konan
 and
Yahiko
, fellow orphans. They banded together, acquired food to survive through any means, and shared dreams of a future where they were in charge and could use their power to eliminate war. Yahiko was particularly passionate about this point, which inspired Nagato to adopt the same goal.
 In order to accomplish this, the three would need to become ninja. With few options to choose from, they approached Konoha's Legendary
Sannin
 and asked to be taught
ninjutsu
.
Orochimaru
 offered to kill them in order to end their suffering, but
Jiraiya
, guilty over his participation in the war, offered to teach them how to look out for themselves.

Jiraiya found a place for them to live and taught them how to fish, but he would not teach them ninjutsu. While the orphans were out one day, they were found and assaulted by an
Iwagakure

chūnin
. Fearing for his friends' lives, Nagato used his Rinnegan to kill the Iwa-nin. When Jiraiya arrived on the scene to help them, he noticed Nagato's eyes for the first time and was reminded of the legends of the
Sage of the Six Paths
, the original possessor of the Rinnegan. Because of this, Jiraiya changed his mind and began teaching them ninjutsu.
 Nagato was remorseful for killing the Iwa-nin, but Jiraiya convinced him that sometimes violence and personal pain was necessary to protect others. In time he even shared his belief that Nagato was the Sage of Six Paths' reincarnation and that, like the original Sage, Nagato would use his Rinnegan to
usher in a world of peace
.






Nagato summons the Statue for the first time.



Jiraiya trained the orphans for three years. Because of his Rinnegan, Nagato easily mastered everything he was taught.
 Once they were able to defeat one of his
shadow clones
 in a fight, Jiraiya decided they were ready to forge out on their own and he returned to Konoha, confident they would bring reform to the country.
 The three formed an organisation they called
Akatsuki
, with Yahiko as its leader, and began advocating an end to war. Their message proved popular and they gathered many followers;
 even Jiraiya would sometimes hear news of their exploits.
 During the
Third Shinobi World War
, they were approached by a disguised
Obito Uchiha
. Introducing himself as Madara Uchiha, he offered to help them in their pursuits and show Nagato how to unlock the full potential of his Rinnegan. Yahiko refused the offer, suspecting Tobi only meant to use them.






Nagato wounded following his fight with Hanzō.



Throughout their quest for peace, Akatsuki's ranks swelled and became known throughout Amegakure, so much so that
Hanzō
 of the Salamander, the village's leader, began to feel Akatsuki threatened his rule. He approached Akatsuki, offering to work together with them to help negotiate with the other warring villages. The next day, at a meeting to finalise the arrangement, Yahiko and Nagato were ambushed by Hanzō and his men, with support from Konoha's
Danzō Shimura
. Using Konan as a hostage, Hanzō threatened to kill her if Nagato did not kill Yahiko. Unwilling to let Nagato have that on his conscience, Yahiko impaled himself on Nagato's kunai, using his dying breath to state his faith that Nagato would change the world.
 Enraged by Yahiko's death, Nagato took Konan back from Hanzō, though his legs were
badly damaged
 in the process. He then
summoned
 the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 and, upon
linking with it
, used it to slaughter Hanzō's men, though Hanzō himself escaped.
 Afterwards, Nagato severed his ties with Amegakure by slashing the village's symbol on his
forehead protector
, no longer wishing to be affiliated with Hanzō's village.






Now crippled, Nagato turns Yahiko's body into the Deva Path.



Yahiko's death ultimately convinced Nagato that his philosophies about achieving peace were foolish; the world would never willingly end the cycle of death and hatred it had operated on for so long. Only through direct experience of war and all the losses and agonies it brought could anyone truly desire peace. Intending to personally bring that level of despair to the world, Nagato took on the name of "Pain". As the damage he'd received from Hanzō's attack and the link with the Demonic Statue left him frail and immobile, Nagato created the
Six Paths of Pain
 out of corpses that he controlled remotely. For the
Deva Path
 he used Yahiko's body — still wanting him to lead the organisation in spirit — and for the other five he used the corpses of other miscellaneous shinobi that, without his knowing it, had met Jiraiya when they were alive. Pain began leading Akatsuki in a new direction, secretly accepting Obito's earlier offer of support. Akatsuki composed itself with
S-rank

missing-nin
 and started offering its services as a mercenary group to ninja villages, earning the money necessary to fund its long-term plans.






Pain confronting Hanzō.



Years later and still loyal to his own version of Amegakure, Pain and Konan began a civil war in the village to overthrow Hanzō.
 Much of the village rallied behind Pain, believing him to be a god because of his immense power. The Six Paths of Pain eventually cornered and killed Hanzō, earning control of the village, but not before expressing his disgust with how Hanzō had fallen from the man he admired and the fact he cannot even understand how, in his self-preservation, his skill and conviction have diminished. In order to prevent anyone from challenging him, Pain proceeded to eliminate everyone even remotely connected to Hanzō, from members of his family to distant acquaintances.
 Because of Amegakure's already secretive nature, news of Hanzō's death never made it outside of Amegakure and the village was believed to still be divided by the civil war. Pain embraced the villagers' idea of his being God and single-handedly crushing remnants loyal to Hanzō whenever they surfaced. Every Sunday, Pain would make it rain within Amegakure or if he had to be away.

Personality

Nagato was a sensitive child, prone to crying over the sufferings of himself and others. When he met
Yahiko
 he tried to break this habit by following Yahiko's philosophy that crying wouldn't change anything, but the attempt was unsuccessful.
Jiraiya
 later pointed out to him that his sensitivity was actually a strength, as it allowed him to understand pain better and, in turn, be kinder to others. This view resonated with Nagato and caused him to realise that he wanted to take on all of his friends' pain so that they wouldn't have to. It also finally succeeded in ending his crying; when Jiraiya left their group it was Yahiko who cried to see him go, while Nagato only thanked him for all the guidance he'd provided.

In one form or another, Nagato spent his entire life placing the needs of others before his own: his main motivation for becoming a ninja in the first place was so that he could protect Yahiko and
Konan
; he viewed his role in the original Akatsuki as a powerful tool meant to help Yahiko bring peace to their country; as leader of his own version of Akatsuki, he felt it was his responsibility to save the world from itself, inflicting pains of such magnitude that nobody would ever harm anyone else ever again. While this indicates a growing self-importance Nagato regarded himself with, it was encouraged by the similarly growing esteem others regarded him with due to his
Rinnegan
: Jiraiya believed he was the reincarnation of the
Sage of the Six Paths
; Yahiko and the rest of Akatsuki believed he was the "
Saviour of the World
"; the villagers of Amegakure believed in him as if he were a "God".

As a child that grew up in the middle of other countries' wars, Nagato did not like killing and was horrified by his early acts of violence against those who had harmed his friends and family. He supported Yahiko's Akatsuki because it wanted to end the wars and deaths that he hated so much. After Yahiko's death, Nagato compromised his aversion to killing to a large extent, believing the deaths of specific individuals or even hundreds at a time could be justified if it served a greater and/or long-term purpose. But Nagato remains very clear in this distinction, as he shows mercy to those willing to cooperate with him and discourages others from defying him because it will only force him to strike them down.
Minato Namikaze
 believes that, at some point along the way, Nagato's views were corrupted and subsequently manipulated by Tobi.

As leader of Akatsuki, Nagato projected a great charisma through his public mask of the Deva Path so that even Akatsuki held him in great awe. Despite his power and self-appointed divinity, Nagato was incredibly patient with defiance from the group, likening Hidan's open threats against him to those of a child who needed guidance. Utterly confident in his own abilities, Nagato showed no hesitation in fighting even the strongest opponents, nor in asserting himself against powerful Akatsuki members when need be. When speaking of Akatsuki's goals, Nagato demonstrated a contemplative side as to the nature of war and peace, matching his belief that war was the inevitable result of the nature of humanity. While he declared his godhood to his enemies, Nagato would privately admit that he was never anything more than an ordinary man who was seeking peace through the best means he knew how. When encountering enemies who disagreed with his philosophy, Nagato would often request their own solution to the problems of the world before almost inevitably being dissatisfied with the response due to his low opinion of human beings as a whole. Despite this, Nagato is stated to have gone as far as kill anyone from Amegakure who even questioned his ideals and even went as far as to kill infants of people who were even remotely associated to Hanzō, and in the anime, antagonised him even in death, preventing his remains from being given a proper burial.

When leading the Akatsuki, Nagato could also be possessed of a cold, wrathful side. He showed no hesitation in attempting to kill his former teacher Jiraiya, stating that all love for Jiraiya had long since died. When he attacked Konoha, Nagato demonstrated cold fury at Tsunade for defying his proclamations as to the justice of his attack on the Leaf. Believing that the only way humans could understand one another was through shared pain, Nagato showed no hesitation in obliterating the Leaf village or attempting to kill Hinata Hyūga when she came to Naruto's defence in order to demonstrate a lesson on pain and the inability of human beings to understand one another. Despite this, he had a high value in comrades as he chastised Kisame for speaking ill of Hidan and Kakuzu.

One further constant in Nagato's life was the esteem he placed in his childhood friends. Nagato viewed himself as having inherited Yahiko's will to change the world and kept Yahiko's corpse as his most treasured and powerful Path of Pain. Konan, his partner and childhood friend, remained his most ardent supporter. Nagato likewise demonstrated equal esteem and concern for her, with Konan as one of the few who could sway or influence his decisions to the extent that Tobi confided in Zetsu a fear of what Nagato might do without Konan's calming influence on him.

Despite the number of personal changes Nagato went through during his life, he always remained fundamentally kind and respectful. With his fellow members of Akatsuki, he mourns those who die in the pursuit of Akatsuki's goals
 and disapproves of name-calling amongst peers.
 He extends similar courtesies to his opponents, being honoured to meet one so strong as
Kakashi Hatake
,
 despite also being determined to kill Kakashi because that very same strength would inevitably interfere with Akatsuki's plans. For all his kindness, Nagato has a certain prejudice against
Konoha
 because its ninja have played a role in a number of his life's tragedies. He tried to change this opinion because of Jiraiya's positive influence, but ultimately decided that Konoha's successes were predicated on the misfortunes of others.

Despite his conviction in Akatsuki's goals, Nagato is re-convinced of his former pacifism by
Naruto Uzumaki
, who believes the struggle for peace is worth any personal cost to the point of sacrificing his life to atone for his actions. Recognising the person he once was, Nagato decides to believe in Naruto's answer for peace, also regaining his faith in Jiraiya. Upon his revival, Nagato demonstrates a far friendlier side, joking with and praising Naruto. Before he is sealed away, Nagato reveals that he has gone from viewing himself as a god to viewing himself as the failed middle volume of a trilogy started by Jiraiya and ended with Naruto. He also regains his high regard for Jiraiya as he referred to Jiraiya was the "perfect first volume".

Nagato had pale white skin with straight red hair, a sign of his Uzumaki heritage. When he was very young, his eyes were covered by his hair, preventing his Rinnegan from being visible. When he started training to be a ninja he parted his hair so that only his right eye was covered. Linking with the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 left a number of
black receivers
 embedded in his back and caused his body to become very emaciated, limiting his mobility. For this reason he spent most of his adult life in a mechanical walker from which he controlled the Six Paths of Pain. He likewise did not personally wear any of the typical Akatsuki clothing, having his Paths wear it instead.

After he performs
Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 his hair turns white as a side-effect of the jutsu, and it remains that colour after Nagato is
reincarnated
, during which he is donned with a maroon long sleeved cloak. From
absorbing
 some of the
Eight-Tails
'
chakra
, his hair became red again, as well as his frail body reverting to his fit self.

Abilities






Nagato overwhelming Naruto and Killer B.



Nagato's position as the leader of Akatsuki was well-deserved, being regarded as its most powerful member. Despite his fragile state and damaged legs,
Kabuto Yakushi
 regarded Nagato as a powerful
reincarnated shinobi
. Upon restoring and rejuvenating his body using the
Tailed Beast

chakra
 he absorbed from B, he simultaneously overwhelmed and immobilised the
Eight
 and
Nine-Tails

jinchūriki
 with ease although his legs remained weakened. Despite his effectiveness being reduced due to Kabuto Yakushi's direct control, it still required a combined effort of Naruto, Killer B, and
Itachi Uchiha
 to defeat and
seal
 him. As Pain, he was regarded as unbeatable by various individuals,
 and his strength allowed him to defeat and kill
Hanzō
, though Hanzō's skills had long since diminished.
 He was also able to defeat
Jiraiya
, his former teacher, though he notes that he may have lost if Jiraiya knew his true identity. Not only that, he could face the entire village of
Konohagakure
 and destroy it single-handedly, only losing one of his Paths in the various battles with Konoha ninja. Before he faced Naruto, Nagato had never lost a single battle, still pushing Naruto to employ the most powerful abilities he had at his disposal.

Chakra and Physical Prowess






Nagato exerts his chakra through the Deva Path.



As a descendant of the
Uzumaki clan
, Nagato's chakra was naturally resilient. His actual chakra reserves were unusually vast, enough that he could perform
various
,
chakra-taxing

techniques
 all in the same day. Upon exerting his chakra in the form of a shockwave, one of the
Fifth Hokage
's
Anbu
 bodyguards suspected that his already powerful chakra was enhanced by his
Rinnegan
.
 Nagato also had remarkable control over his chakra and could alter its frequency constantly, negating the possibility of a
sensor
 pinpointing his location when he controls the Six Paths of Pain unless they stab themselves with one of his chakra rods.

Following his first fight with Hanzō, Nagato's legs were badly damaged and his body was left frail. This limited his mobility for the rest of his life and rendered his original body largely defenceless. He regained some of his former mobility after being reincarnated and restoring his body and legs with some of the
Eight-Tails
' chakra. When not handicapped, Nagato could rapidly move around a battlefield, closing the gap between himself and his opponents fast enough to force them to retreat.

Ninjutsu

During his training with Jiraiya, Nagato mastered every technique he was taught, covering numerous styles, all of the basic
nature transformations
, and
Yang Release
,
 accomplishments extremely rare even for adults, let alone ten year-olds.
 Many of the miscellaneous techniques he was seen performing were used to facilitate Akatsuki's meetings, such as allowing members to
meet astrally across great distances
,
protecting the site of their meetings
, and
distracting opposing forces
. Adept with the
Shadow Clone Technique
, he was even capable of cloning his summoned creatures.
 One of his more noteworthy techniques was the
Rain Tiger at Will Technique
, which allowed him to create perpetual rainfall to monitor everyone moving within Amegakure.

Nagato was also an adept
sensor
, able to pinpoint the location of others across great distances, even penetrating beyond
barriers
 erected for the express purpose of blocking detection.

Rinnegan






Nagato's Rinnegan.



Nagato's skill in so many types of ninjutsu was due in large part to his
Rinnegan
.
 Though he was not the eyes' original owner, being an Uzumaki allowed Nagato to wield both eyes without drawbacks even while still an untrained child, whereas Obito could barely handle a single eye despite his various modifications and in-depth knowledge of the dōjutsu. Ultimately, Nagato's skill was great enough to earn recognition as the "Third Six Paths" (
三人目の六道
,
Sanninme no Rikudō
); a title which he inherited after
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 and
Madara Uchiha
.

The greatest advantage of the Rinnegan was that it gave Nagato access to all of the
Six Paths Techniques
: the gravitational powers of the
Deva Path
; the menagerie of
summons
 available to the
Animal Path
; the limitless energy absorption of the
Preta Path
; the control over souls with the
Human Path
; the various mechanisations in the
Asura Path
; access to the
King of Hell
 through the
Naraka Path
. Because of the limitations of his real body, Nagato had few chances to use any of these abilities directly. When the opportunity arose, though, he could shift between the different Paths seamlessly and instantly, performing the many abilities on a level he wasn't capable of when using them through others.

The one branch of Six Paths Techniques that Nagato reserved for himself was that of the
Outer Path
. As the Outer Path, Nagato could summon and control the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
,
 produce
black receivers
 into which he can channel his chakra,
 and use the
Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 to revive the dead.

Six Paths of Pain






The Six Paths of Pain.



With the Outer Path, Nagato could form what he calls his "
Six Paths of Pain
". By embedding black receivers throughout the bodies of six corpses – arranged to resemble body piercings – Nagato was able to control all of them remotely as though they were his own. He could control the Paths across great distances, but for more chakra-demanding techniques, it was necessary for the Path to first be brought closer to his position. An alternative to this was cutting off control of five of the Paths and focusing all of his chakra into one. The Paths can be used to react to threats in mere seconds and, because they are corpses, the bodies are unfazed by all but the most debilitating types of damage.

In theory, each of the Six Paths of Pain could be used to perform any technique that Nagato himself was capable of. In practice, however, he limited each body to one branch of the Six Paths Techniques, the exception being the Deva Path through which he performed a number of miscellaneous jutsu. Each Path served a specific purpose, be it offensive, defensive, reconnaissance or repair. None of the Paths specifically specialised in
taijutsu
, but all were able to keep pace during hand-to-hand combat with even the most practised opponent. Though he considered all six Paths to be part of the Pain identity he gave himself, Nagato still regarded them as separate entities from himself, referring to them by whichever Path they embody.

Although the Six Paths were individually strong, they were at their most formidable when used together, with the simultaneous use of all six being the primary reason for Pain's infamous invincibility.
 This was because the six Paths, as well as the Animal Path's summons and the King of Hell, let Nagato share their vision,
 allowing him to coordinate their movements with maximum efficiency. They could attack from multiple angles and dodge attacks they couldn't have seen but that occurred within another Path's field of vision. During his attack on Konoha, when the Six Paths were dispersed throughout the village to act strategically, they managed to wreak devastation and kill many powerful shinobi, effectively allowing Nagato to almost singlehandedly overpower the village. Each of the Paths had its own importance in a fight – the Naraka Path's ability to restore all the other Paths, making it the most valuable – and therefore, Nagato would sacrifice other Paths to protect those further up the hierarchy.

Despite the advantages the six bodies granted him in a fight, Nagato tried to limit his usage to as few bodies as possible to reduce the likelihood of anyone discovering the secret of how the Six Paths of Pain work. When Konoha began to understand the idiosyncrasies of the ability, he destroyed the village in an effort to kill anyone who might know that none of the six Paths were the real one.

Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant

Main article:
Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant






Pain prepares to stop rainfall to search for intruder.



Before he can set out in search of Naruto, Pain senses an intruder arriving in Amegakure. He cannot identify who it is, but from their chakra signature he can tell they are powerful. He sends Konan to track down whoever it is while he deploys the
Animal Path
. A short while later, Konan sends a report that the intruder is
Jiraiya
. Surprised, Pain bids her to kill him if she can while he moves the Animal Path to intercept. On arrival, he frees Konan from the restraints Jiraiya has placed her under and sends her away. Although Jiraiya does not recognise the body, Jiraiya assumes that Pain is Nagato because of his
Rinnegan
. Jiraiya expresses his disappointment that Nagato has turned away from his once-righteous path towards peace by leading a criminal organisation like Akatsuki. Pain asserts that, as a god, his plan to liberate the world through destruction is the definition of righteousness.






The Preta Path facing Jiraiya.



In response to all of the Animal Path's
summons
, Jiraiya summons
Gamaken
 to hold them off while he prepares himself. From the safety of his
chameleon
, Pain sends a
multi-headed dog
,
drill-beaked bird
, and
giant ox
 at them, but Jiraiya is able to successfully enter
Sage Mode
 with the help of
Shima
 and
Fukasaku
. Shima locates and neutralises the chameleon, forcing Pain to summon the
Preta Path
 and
Human Path
 to the fray. Jiraiya quickly blinds the Human Path then attacks with
Sage Art: Goemon
, which the Preta Path absorbs. He makes separate attempts to attack the Human Path and Animal Path from behind, but both block him. Suspecting their shared vision, Jiraiya withdraws.

The three Paths pursue Jiraiya. They eventually hear the signing of Shima and Fukasaku as they ready a
genjutsu
. The Paths track them down and try to stop them, but Jiraiya is ready for them. After confirming that they do indeed share vision, Jiraiya distracts the Preta Path and immobilises the Human Path, allowing him to fight the Animal Path one-on-one long enough for Shima and Fukasaku to cast
Toad Confrontation Singing
. While the Paths are caught, Jiraiya stabs them with
Stone Swords
 and believes they, and by extension Nagato, are dead. As he leaves, the
Asura Path
 attacks him from behind, severing his arm. The full
Six Paths of Pain
 – with the three he defeated restored by the
Naraka Path
 – face Jiraiya. He recognises the
Deva Path
 as
Yahiko
, causing him to question his assumption that Pain is Nagato.






Pain finishes off Jiraiya.



After a prolonged battle, Jiraiya retreats into his
Barrier: Toad Gourd Prison
. The Animal Path follows him, but ends up getting captured; as its last act it stabs him with a
black receiver
. Jiraiya contemplates returning to Konoha with what he's learned, but decides this is his only chance to discover the secret of Pain. He returns to the battlefield with Fukasaku and draws the remaining Paths' attention, and in doing so figures it out. The Asura Path crushes his throat before he can tell Fukasaku what he's learned and the other Paths stab him. Believing him dead they start to leave, but Jiraiya uses the last of his energy to
etch
 a coded message into Fukasaku's back. The Paths try to stop him, but Fukasaku escapes and Jiraiya's body sinks into the sea. Pain holds a moment of silence for his passing.

Six-Tails Unleashed

The Six Paths of Pain confront Utakata.



Pain replaces the Animal Path Jiraiya captured with a new body in preparation for finally going after Naruto. In the anime, he is first sent to
Kirigakure
 to capture the
Six-Tails
. The new Animal Path summons the multi-headed dog to scout the area where the Six-Tails' jinchūriki,
Utakata
, was last seen. When it comes across a group of
hunter-nin
 led by
Tsurugi
, it slaughters them all. Utakata eventually comes looking for Tsurugi, but instead finds Pain, who quickly captures him. The Six-Tails is later extracted from Utakata's body.

Pain's Assault

Main article:
Pain's Assault






The Six Paths infiltrate Konoha.



The Six Paths of Pain and Konan arrive on the outskirts of Konoha and eliminate all the border guards. Pain explains the plan of attack: the Asura, Animal, and Preta Paths will destroy the village's infrastructure and draw the attention of its ninja while Konan and the Deva, Human, and Naraka Paths try to find information on Naruto's location. The Animal Path infiltrates the village by itself so that Konoha's sensors will think there's only one intruder, and once inside it summons Konan and the others. They scatter immediately afterwards and begin fulfilling their assigned roles.






Pain fighting Kakashi.



Early in the Deva Path's search it is found by
Kakashi Hatake
, who has guessed the misdirection Pain is employing. Knowing by reputation that Kakashi poses a threat to Akatsuki's plans, the Asura Path arrives to help the Deva Path fight him. The two nearly defeat Kakashi, but Konoha reinforcements arrive in time. Kakashi has already discovered the recharge time the Deva Path needs between attacks and coordinates Konoha's forces to create a window for him to strike. The Asura Path uses itself as a shield to take the attack, creating an opportunity for the Deva Path to level everything and everyone in the area. The Deva Path leaves, victorious. After it's gone, a badly-injured Kakashi sends
Chōji Akimichi
 to the
Fifth Hokage
 to tell her what they've learned about the Deva Path. The still-functioning Asura Path attempts to stop Chōji, but Kakashi intercepts it with
Kamui
 in time, dying from exhaustion in the process.






The Deva Path preparing to destroy Konoha.



Across the village, the remaining Paths continue their tasks: the Preta Path locates the Animal Path that Jiraiya captured and collects its black receivers; the Deva Path locates the Hokage and encourages her to surrender Naruto; the Animal Path assaults the building where a
prisoner
 Jiraiya captured is being interrogated, killing him in the process; the Human Path discovers
Shizune
 and, from reading her mind, finally learns that Naruto is at
Mount Myōboku
. Though their mission is complete, Pain is frustrated by the Hokage's refusal to cooperate. Combined with the numerous examples that Konoha's ninja are starting to understand how the Six Paths of Pain work, Pain decides to destroy the village and show it true pain. He has the Animal Path summon Konan and all but the Deva Path to a safe distance while the Deva Path performs a large-scale
Shinra Tensei
.

As the smoke clears, the Deva Path finds Naruto has arrived in the village with several
toad
 allies. After the Naraka Path restores the Asura Path, the other Paths join the Deva Path; Konan withdraws to attend to Nagato. When the Hokage angrily confronts Pain for destroying the village, the Asura Path moves to kill her, but is destroyed by Naruto before it can land a blow. The remaining Paths take formation around the Deva Path during its prolonged recharge. The Animal Path sends its summons to attack Naruto, but the toads confront them instead. Using Sage Mode, Naruto quickly
neutralises
 the Preta Path, the Human Path is destroyed getting the Animal Path out of the way of Naruto's
Rasenshuriken
, and the Animal Path is shortly afterwards trapped within
Gamabunta
's mouth and defeated with
Spiralling Serial Spheres
.






Pain pins Naruto down.



Naruto begins focusing on the Deva Path. He nearly succeeds in hitting it with another Rasenshuriken, but a restored Preta Path absorbs it. Seeing what the Naraka Path can do, Naruto prioritises it, distracting the Deva and Preta Paths while he hits it with another Spiralling Serial Spheres. Although the Naraka Path is gone, the Deva Path's powers are restored. It expels the larger toads from the village and helps the Preta Path capture Naruto. As the Preta Path absorbs his
senjutsu
 chakra to immobilise him, it finds itself unable to balance the
natural energy
 and turns to stone. Shima and Fukasaku, meanwhile, prepare to cast a genjutsu like they did before. The Deva Path kills Fukasaku and, in the same motion, pins Naruto down with black receivers.

With Naruto no longer able to offer resistance, Pain lectures him on the cycle of hatred the world suffers under and the endless conflict that produces. His plans to gather the
tailed beasts
 will be used to cause overwhelming destruction and achieve peace through fear. Because peace is what Jiraiya, who both of them trained under, always wanted, Pain asks if Naruto has a better solution, but Naruto does not respond. As they talk, Pain is attacked by
Hinata Hyūga
, who makes a desperate attempt to save Naruto. The Deva Path deals with her easily and apparently kills her. Her seeming death enrages Naruto, causing him to enter a
version 2
 state. Unprepared to fight Naruto in this state, the Deva Path leads Naruto closer to Nagato's location so that it can use
Chibaku Tensei
. Naruto enters a nearly full
Tailed Beast Mode
 and escapes its confines, forcing Pain to let the Chibaku Tensei dissolve.






Naruto defeats the last of the Six Paths of Pain.



Having regained his senses, Naruto attacks the Deva Path. He takes one of its black receivers and briefly interfaces with it in order to trace Nagato's location. As his attack continues, he has numerous disguised
shadow clones
 emerge from the rubble of Chibaku Tensei and attack during the Deva Path's short cooldown, but they don't make it in time and it repels them. With so many clones, however, the Narutos are able to resist the Shinra Tensei, enabling Naruto to strike with a
Rasengan
. Now that all of his Six Paths are defeated, Nagato permits Naruto to come meet with him. He shoots Naruto with a black receiver as soon as he arrives and tries to control his body, but Naruto successfully resists him.






Nagato and Konan meet Naruto.



Naruto has been thinking about the question he was asked earlier, about how he would accomplish peace. He thinks he has an answer finally, but first wants to hear more about Nagato, especially since they both trained under Jiraiya yet turned out very differently. Curious, Nagato indulges him and tells him about the tragedies he experienced in his life and how they drove him to seek peace through pain. Naruto understands Nagato's logic and even sees some merit to his conclusion, but rejects it. His method to achieve peace is to no longer continue the cycle of revenge that fuels the shinobi world. Although he is angry with Nagato for killing Jiraiya and destroying Konoha, Naruto will not harm him, as that would only cause others to seek revenge against him and repeat the cycle.






Nagato dying with a smile.



Nagato is amazed by Naruto's answer, and is reminded of not only Jiraiya but himself when he was younger. He does not know if Naruto's solution can succeed, but Nagato decides that he will place his faith in it. As a sign of this faith, Nagato uses
Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 over Konan's protests to revive everyone that died during his attack. As his life fades from performing the technique, Nagato cautions Naruto over the challenges he will face on the path he has chosen, but wishes him all possible luck. Nagato dies with a smile on his face, wondering if perhaps all the circumstances that led him to this end were the work of a real god.

In the anime,
Kabuto Yakushi

reincarnates
 Nagato to be used against
Team 7
. The summon fails almost immediately afterwards, causing Kabuto to wonder if the Impure World Reincarnation was still incomplete.

When the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 looms, Kabuto approaches Tobi offering to join forces. To that end he reincarnates Nagato and four other dead members of Akatsuki as offerings for Tobi's war plans.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Nagato and Itachi mobilised.



When the Fourth Shinobi World War begins, Nagato is mobilised with the rest of Kabuto's collection of reincarnated ninja. Still unable to move even in his reincarnated state, Nagato is carried by Itachi Uchiha. They discuss Akatsuki and how little they, particularly Nagato, actually knew about the organisation; both were only pawns kept by Tobi because of their
dōjutsu
, and now they've been revived so Kabuto can use them for the same reason. Nagato is at least able to sense where Kabuto is controlling them from, which he communicates to Itachi.






Nagato clashes with Naruto.



Nagato and Itachi are found by Naruto and
Killer B
. Nagato is glad to see Naruto has finally gained control of the Nine-Tails, but is not actually surprised since they both trained under Jiraiya. Kabuto forces Nagato and Itachi to attack them, with Nagato summoning various animals to help him move around. Because their personalities are intact, Nagato gives Naruto and B advice about how to counter his summons and jutsu and warns them about Itachi's own. Itachi is able to implement a fail-safe he left on Naruto before his death, which frees him from Kabuto's control. Fearful that Nagato may also break his control, Kabuto suppresses his personality and sends him into battle against the trio.






A revitalised Nagato trying to remove Naruto's soul.



Itachi joins forces with Naruto and B against Nagato. Nagato hides within his chameleon so he can move around undetected and attacks B with Shinra Tensei. B immediately counters with a version 2
Lariat
, resulting in Nagato absorbing B's version 2 chakra. The
Eight-Tails
' chakra he absorbs has a rejuvenating effect on him, restoring his mobility. He begins removing Naruto's soul, prepares to kill B, and readies the
King of Hell
 to restore them to life when Kabuto is ready for them. Itachi interrupts him with
Susanoo
, releasing Naruto and B.






Nagato pierced by the Sword of Totsuka.



Needing to deal with all three at once, Kabuto has Nagato use Chibaku Tensei. Itachi, Naruto, and B simultaneously use their strongest long-range attacks to destroy the growing planetoid. As Kabuto's attentions are distracted by its destruction, Itachi stabs him with Susanoo's
Sword of Totsuka
, which also restores his consciousness to him. Nagato apologises to Naruto for not only this fight after death, but his actions during life, believing his story was unworthy of following Jiraiya's. He expresses his hope that Naruto's story will conclude so spectacularly that nobody will remember the disappointment of his own. He bids farewell as his body is sealed.

Legacy






The shrine where Nagato and Yahiko's bodies lay.



Tobi
 feels personally betrayed when he learns that Nagato gave his life to revive the villagers of Konoha, believing the
Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 should have been reserved exclusively for his
Eye of the Moon Plan
. He is also confused, believing Nagato to have been very firm in his convictions and thus not likely to give up so willingly. He tracks down
Naruto
 not long after Nagato's death and asks him what he could have said to sway Nagato, but is unmoved by Naruto's claim that Nagato truly did desire peace. With Nagato gone, Tobi is forced to seek out his corpse and take his
Rinnegan
 to fulfil his ultimate plans. When he finds Nagato smiling at him, he interprets it as if Nagato is continuing to mock him even in death.

Konan
 followed through with Nagato's change of heart, vowing hers and Amegakure's cooperation with Naruto in his future pursuits of peace. She takes Nagato's and Yahiko's bodies back to Amegakure and creates a secret
shrine
 for them, laying their bodies on beds of flowers. She breaks away from the Akatsuki that Tobi has corrupted, trying to fight for the ideals that the organisation originally represented. She tries to kill Tobi when he comes looking for Nagato's Rinnegan, only to die herself after being forced to reveal the location of Nagato's body.

Naruto is deeply affected by his encounter with Nagato and is compelled to start trying to achieve peace and end the ongoing desires for revenge between ninja. He forgives Nagato for all the missteps he took during his life, thinking of him with as high a regard as he thinks of
Jiraiya
.

Creation and Conception






Sketches and unused concept designs for Pain, by Masashi Kishimoto.



In
Sha no Sho
, Kishimoto briefly explains the philosophy behind Pain's design, stating, "He's Akatsuki's leader, so he has to look fairly cool, but I still wanted him to look dangerous. Since his name is 'Pain', I decided to add some piercings to his body, like he's the kind of guy who would inflict pain upon himself". Notable among the few unused concept designs is a small sketch in which Pain appears to wear a partial mask and feather, or horn-like accessories fitted to his forehead protector.

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Nagato
,
Pain

The name "Nagato" means "long-lasting gate" (
長門
). He may be named after the famous ninja Fujibayashi Nagato who, in the 16th century, was considered to be one of three greatest Iga jōnin. The other two were Hattori Hanzō (
Hanzō
's supposed namesake) and Momochi Sandayū (
Zabuza Momochi
's supposed namesake). In line with
his

parents
, Nagato is also named after a World War II Japanese battleship.

Studio Pierrot's Settei sheets of Nagato show that he was 149 cm around the time he killed the Iwa chūnin to protect Yahiko, and 163 cm when Jiraiya left Amegakure.

During
Kazekage Rescue Mission
, Nagato's Rinnegan were depicted with wrong colours due to the Rinnegan not having been illustrated with colours in the manga yet.

In keeping with his "God" theme, his theme-song is "Girei" — a haunting theme that consists of holy chanting.

According to the databook(s):

His hobby was practising
ninjutsu
.

His desired opponent was anyone in order to protect his friends.

His favourite food was grilled fish and stew.

Nagato's favourite phrase was "The stars are hidden on a rainy night" (
雨夜の星
,
Yuya no hoshi
). As a child, it was "Growing up".

As Pain, he wished to fight
Naruto Uzumaki
 (or more specifically the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
).

Quotes

(To
Jiraiya
) "
Peace… I don't know how to get there… but… but someday I'll break the curse. If there's such a thing as peace, I will find it!
"

(To
Akatsuki
) "
We're both of the same breed, after all… motives for war are of no concern. Religion, ideology, resources, land, grudges, love, or just because… No matter how pathetic the reason, it's enough to start a war. War will never cease to exist… Reasons can be thought up after the fact. Human nature pursues strife.
"

(To
Jiraiya
) "
Even a foolish child can grow up in a right way, when he learns what pain is. Knowing pain controls ones thoughts and decisions.
"

(To
Tsunade
) "
You think you're the only ones who matter. You think you can put off death. But that peace made you foolish and thoughtless. If you kill someone, someone else will kill you… this hatred binds us together. I want you to feel pain, to think about pain, to accept pain, to know pain.
"

(To Naruto) "
We are both ordinary men, driven to seek vengeance in the name of justice. However, if there is justice in vengeance, then justice will breed only more vengeance. And trigger a cycle of hatred.
"

(To Naruto) "
To create short these periods of peace through pain that interrupt the endless cycle of hatred… that is my dream.
"

(Last words to
Naruto
 before dying) "
Dying like trash… never ending hatred… pain that never heals… that is war… Naruto… this… is what you must face… The book… and you… It's like… someone… set this all up… Or… maybe… this… is… the hand of the real God… My role is over now… Naruto… you… can really—
"

(Last words to Naruto before being sealed) "
Naruto… I'll be returning to where our master is, so I can see your story… If you ask me… You're the third part that concludes the series… The first part was Jiraiya… He was flawless… But… The second part was me, an almost complete failure… I couldn't even get our master to acknowledge me… Ending the series is the third part… The final work will settle it all! Become such a masterpiece that that failure will be like it was cancelled altogether… Naruto!
" (
「ナルト………オレは師匠の所へ戻ってお前の物語を見ておくと…するよ…オレから言わせりゃ…お前は三部作目の完結編だ…一部が自来也…完ペキだった…だが…二部作目ってのはたいがい駄作になるオレのようにな……師にも認めてもらってない……シリーズの出来ってのは三作目…完結編で決まる!駄作を帳消しにするぐらいの最高傑作になってくれよ…ナルト!」
,
"Naruto… Ore wa shishō no tokoro modotte omae no monogatari o mite oku to… suru yo… Ore kara iwaserya… Omae was Anbusakume no kanketsuhen de… Ichibu ga Jiraiya… Kanpeki datta… Daga… Nibusakume tte no wa taigai dasaku ni naru ore no yō ni na…… Shi ni mo mitomete morattenai ……Shirīzu no deki tte no wa sansakume… Kanketsuhen de kimaru!
