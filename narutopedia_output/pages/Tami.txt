Tami
 (
たみ
) is a young citizen of
Konohagakure
.

Personality

Tami is a sweet, young girl that was very thankful to
Sakura Haruno
 for
healing
 her abrasion. Over the years, Tami's gratitude towards Sakura has not diminished, leading her to make her store available for secret meetings with Sakura and her comrades.

Appearance

She has short, brown hair that mostly hangs around her face with the rest tied into a bun on top of her head, covered by a hair-cloth. She wears a short, green and blue dress with shorts and a pair of sandals.

As she grew up, Tami began wearing the cherry-coloured haori that all her store employees wore, as well as a large dango-shaped hair clip on her head.

Part II

Pain's Assault

Tami was seen telling her grandmother to hurry as she ran through the streets of Konoha. When
Pain
's
assault
 began, a
giant centipede
 summoned by the
Animal Path
 began rampaging through the village. After trying to run away, Tami tripped and the centipede sets its sight upon the young girl and her grandmother. As the creature moved in to attack, she was saved by Sakura Haruno, who kills the centipede with a single blow then healed her scraped knee. After expressing her fear to Sakura, she was comforted after Sakura reminded her that
Tsunade
 would protect them.

New Era

Years after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Tami would eventually open up a shop that sells sweets, which was used as a frequent meet-up spot for
Sakura Uchiha
 and
Ino Yamanaka
 to catch-up and engage in casual conversation.
