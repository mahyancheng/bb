Kakashi uses Lightning Release: Lightning Beast Tracking Fang to impale the opponent, then throws multiple chakra kunai. He activates his Kamui to teleport some kunai to the hound, which turns into a shadow clone, where he throws the rest. The two waves of kunai clash while Kakashi charges the Lightning Cutter and attacks from the air.
