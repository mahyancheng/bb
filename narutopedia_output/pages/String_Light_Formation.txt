This barrier is designed to prevent anyone from leaving its confines. Once within a certain range of the target, the user erects the barrier underfoot, rendering anyone within the seal formula incapable of escaping. Despite its strength, it can be overpowered as demonstrated when
Naruto Uzumaki
 was able to easily break the seal by entering his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
.

In the anime, it was shown that several people can combine their efforts to increase the strength of the technique.

Trivia

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
, this technique is incorrectly called "Barrier Method Formation" (
結界法陣
,
Kekkai Hōjin
), sharing name with an already
named technique
. It causes an explosion if the opponent is caught up in it, and explodes on its own after a while if no opponent triggers it.
