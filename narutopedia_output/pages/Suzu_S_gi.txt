New Era

Kawaki & Himawari Academy Arc

Main article:
Kawaki & Himawari Academy Arc

Suzu attended the Academy opening ceremony as part of a new class. Her classroom was put under the care of new teacher
Hana Kaka
. Her class included many children of famous people, including the daughter of an
acting

duo
, the daughter of the
Seventh Hokage
, and
Kae Yukiwari
, the princess of the
Land of Bamboo
. The class also included
Kawaki
, a noticeably older student.

Later, she attended a tea party at Kae's home. After Kae angrily scolded
Osuka Kamakura
 for forcing
her friend
 to ruin the tea party, Suzu and the other classmates openly applauded Kae, finding her true outspoken side more enjoyable than the prim and proper demeanour she had been hiding behind.






Suzu teams up with Eiki and Neon.



Days later, Suzu and Ran joined a group of students who wanted to investigate the Academy's Seven Mysteries at night. They fled the group when Batora faked one of the mysteries using Water Release and red pain in a bathroom. The following day, Suzu and Ran told their other class-mates about their experiences. During a practical lesson, Suzu was placed in a team led by Eiki alongside Neon, their team placing first during a Tree Climbing Practice relay race.

Suzu's class had to put on a play about the
Sannin
. When
Eiki
's struggle with Kawaki damaged the stage, Suzu joined in the repair efforts.

The day of the festival, the twins made use of their experience with the Seven Mysteries to create a great haunted house booth along Harika and Neon. When the festival received a terrorist threat, they stayed inside.

Later, following Hana being hospitalised from the terrorist attack, Suzu joined her class in welcoming back their teacher. To make up for the festival being cancelled, Hana arranged for the class to undergo survival training on an uninhabited island. However,
Kikuchiyo
 was injured and their food supplies vanished, stoking fear about a rumour of killer missing-nin settling on the island. Everyone formed groups to scavenge food, and later to look for Neon's damaged drone. By night, everyone enjoyed their food.






Suzu and her classmates decide to rescue Kae.



Attracted by an explosion, the class encountered Kawaki and Himawari, who revealed that Hana, actually an assassin, had killed Kae. Himawari pointed out that her actions made more sense if Hana wanted to keep Kae as a hostage. Working together, the students tracked Kae and Hana to a cave. Finding the situation too dangerous for the students, Kawaki revealed himself as a shinobi, and credited them for helping find Kae. Eiki still believed there was something they could do, leading them to the docks, hoping to get word of the situation out. They came across Sai, who came to the island with Team 25 after discovering Hana's Land of Bamboo background. Upon finding Hana defeated, her teacher personality struggled against the assassin one, eventually prevailing with the encouragement of her students and regaining control. As Kae had to return home, the class finally put on the Sannin play, and later saw her off at the train station.
