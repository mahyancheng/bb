"
An Opening
" (
突破口
,
Toppakō
) is episode 379 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Tobirama
 saves
Naruto
,
Sasuke
, and Minato by teleporting the
Truth-Seeking Ball
 about to explode back at
Obito
, having previously tagged him for his
Flying Thunder God Technique
. Naruto praises Tobirama for using his father's technique so well, and Tobirama explains that the technique is his. Elsewhere,
Madara
 and
Hashirama
 battle, leaving other
Allied shinobi
 struck in awe by their powers.
Shikamaru
 raises the shinobi's morale, assuring them they will be needed. Madara declares to Hashirama that this battle will have a different outcome from their last battle. Minato intends to create an opening with his technique, and Tobirama berates him on his technique naming. Sasuke uses
Amaterasu
, but Obito deflects the attack, having sensed the chakra gathering in Sasuke's left eye. Tobirama and Minato mark each other. Naruto and Sasuke charge at Obito, combining their
Rasenshuriken
 and
Kagutsuchi
. Tobirama teleports behind Obito and Minato teleports in front of Naruto and Sasuke's attack. They switch positions, and Naruto and Sasuke's attack connects with Obito, who is left without his Truth-Seeking Balls.
Sakura
 sees the black flames from the attack and asks
Hinata
 what happened, and she tells the latter Naruto and Sasuke are smiling.
 However, the Truth-Seeking Balls return to Obito, dispelling the attack and revealing Obito with no lasting damage. Tobirama notices Minato's arm isn't regenerating, and Obito's comments lead him to believe the orbs employ
Yin–Yang Release
 to nullify ninjutsu. Naruto needs more time to enter his Tailed Beast transformation. With the summoning time nearly over,
Gamakichi
 launches one last attack at Obito, who defends himself. Minato tries to appeal to Obito's dream of becoming
Hokage
, but Obito decries his previous dream, saying that Minato's failures made it easy to give up on it. Naruto tells Obito, that as someone who didn't become Hokage, he has no right to make fun of someone who did. He readies a Rasengan and Tobirama teleports Naruto behind Obito, landing a senjutsu Rasengan, which damages Obito, confirming their hypothesis based on Gamakichi's last attack. Minato observes Naruto's
Sage Mode
, comparing it to
Jiraiya
's, and the Yin half of
Kurama
 inside Minato praises Naruto, impressed that he got Yang Kurama to cooperate with him.
