"
The Vessel
" (
器
,
Utsuwa
) is episode 181 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Jigen
 informs the other Inners of the Vessel's loss. They argue about the delay it causes to their plans, and who's to blame for the incident. Most of them blame
Victor
, who tries to deflect it to
Amado
, whose absence in the meeting he questions. Jigen says that Amado is busy with matters that no longer concern Victor.
Koji Kashin
 offers to retrieve the Vessel, as the airship carrying it did so in an area under his jurisdiction. The rest of the other Inners present agree to let him handle it and Koji says he will contact the
Outer
 agent to assist. After the meeting is over, Victor considers retrieving the Vessel himself, and is glad his theft of the Vessel's data hasn't been discovered. He disparages Koji, who answers back, revealing he was in the same room as Victor since the beginning of the meeting.
 Victor moves to attack him, but Koji strikes first. Victor maintains someone tampered with his airship, but Koji
incinerates
 him, his jutsu strong enough to overcome Victor's
regeneration
. Koji also destroys the drone with the stolen data. Amado has informed Jigen of what
Deepa
 knew, having regenerated his head and brain enough for him to report back. Having no further use for Deepa, Jigen has Amado dispose of his head. Koji reports having dealt with Victor to Jigen, who in turn informs him of the precise coordinates of the airship crash, and orders him to kill anyone who has seen the airship.
Konohamaru
 and
Mugino
 approach the crash site. Several genin gather to watch the sparring between
Boruto
 and
Naruto
.
Mitsuki
 helps Boruto prepare. Boruto is happy his father managed to keep a promise, and is glad to have an opportunity to make up for past mistakes and show him that his grown from his training.
Shikamaru
 confirms with Naruto he hasn't told Boruto he'll be testing a new prosthetic hand. The sparring begins with Boruto using
shadow clones
 as decoys to attack Naruto from behind. He throws a
Rasengan
, which Naruto extinguishes. Boruto uses
electrified shuriken
 to blind him, so he only spots the Rasengan when it's near him, but Naruto extinguishes it again. Boruto wants to clash their Rasengan, and uses shadow clones to propel himself at Naruto. The Boruto who has the Rasengan is a shadow clone, and real one attacks from afar with a
Water Release
 and
Lightning Release
 combo. Naruto blocks it with an
Earth Release wall
. He punches through the wall and absorbs Boruto's jutsu. Boruto heads to the wall, but Naruto kicks him from behind, knocking him down, ending the match. Naruto acknowledges Boruto's growth. Later, Naruto confirms to Boruto his prosthetic hand was a
scientific ninja weapon
, explaining that
Katasuke
 developed it based on
Momoshiki
's ability, though it isn't capable of releasing the jutsu it absorbs. Boruto admonishes Naruto for using it when he chastised Boruto for using them before.
Sasuke
 arrives and points out the difference is in how they're used.
Sarada
 asks when he came back, and he says he just returned from investigating
Kara
. Konohamaru and Mugino enter the crashed airship and find an empty container. Something approaches them from outside the airship.
