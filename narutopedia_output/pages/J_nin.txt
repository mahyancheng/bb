Three Konoha jōnin:
Asuma
,
Kurenai
, and
Kakashi
.



Jōnin
 (
上忍
,
literally meaning:
 High Ninja,
meaning (Viz):
 Elite Ninja) are generally highly experienced and highly skilled shinobi who serve as military captains, whose abilities are considered superhuman.
 Jōnin are generally able to use at least two types of
elemental chakra
.
 It is not unusual for jōnin to go on missions alone. They are often sent on
A-rank
 missions, and if experienced enough,
S-rank
 missions as well (which are considered to be the greatest difficulty).

To become a jōnin, one may be recommended. If enough villagers and the respective
Kage
 deem the shinobi to be fitting to the rank, they will be promoted.
 In the anime, another way to become a jōnin is to participate in the Jōnin Exam.

When a ninja becomes a jōnin, they may be assigned to supervise a three-man
genin
 team. Their duty will be to instruct and train them to become competent ninja. They also can decide when the genin are ready to participate in the
Chūnin Exams
.

In
Konohagakure
, it is up to the jōnin to decide whether a candidate
Hokage
 would be given the position permanently. They also have a special rank known as
Jōnin Commander
. Shinobi who have jōnin-level skills in only a specialised area are classified as
Tokubetsu Jōnin
.

Trivia

In the anime,
Aoi Rokushō
 attained the rank of jōnin in
Amegakure
 mainly by selling confidential information of his former village, Konohagakure, where he was originally a
chūnin
.

In the anime, Shikamaru states the
Sound Four
's skills were that of jōnin-level.

In the anime,
Kosuke Maruboshi
 easily qualifies as a jōnin, a promotion he repeatedly declines as a self-punishment for costing his comrades' lives during his youth.
