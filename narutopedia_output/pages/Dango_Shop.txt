 Dumpling Shop) is a popular, well-known shop in
Konohagakure
 that's famous for its
dango
.

 here.

The shop serves many other desserts that use dango in them, such as

, a popular Japanese dessert that is served in a bowl consisting of red bean paste, small cubes of agar jelly, and pieces of fruit served with syrup, as seen when

 went there and ate anmitsu.

Appearance

The shop's sign is in a form of a stick with white-coloured dango run through it. The hiragana for dango (

Trivia

The most frequently shown dango in the series is hanami dango, the pink, white, and green dango associated with the
