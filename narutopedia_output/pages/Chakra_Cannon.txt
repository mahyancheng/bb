Types

Chakra Diffusion Cannon

The main purpose of this
cannon
 was to destroy the
meteorites
 formed from the falling Moon. This weapon is fired when the chakra capacity is at hundred percent. This utilised the two twin muzzles on the bottom of the cannon that would fire a joint blue beam of chakra, which would diffuse into a multitude of beams in order to counter and destroy all of the falling meteorites.

Chakra Transportation Cannon

This was the more powerful cannon, and it consisted of the top muzzle and had the ability to transport any target into another dimension, essentially causing the destruction of the entire Moon. This cannon glowed a large, yellow orb of chakra when activated. However, it was never fired despite A's orders, due to
Killer B
 refusing to kill
Naruto
, who was on the moon at the time, as well as Naruto and the others finishing the mission and saving the Earth in time before the cannon could be used.
