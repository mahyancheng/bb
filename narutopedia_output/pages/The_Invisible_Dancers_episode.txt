Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Having arrived at
Konohagakure
,
Taka
 and
Orochimaru
 sense
Naruto
's
chakra
. Everyone at the battlefield notices the chakra cloak surrounding
Hinata
. Naruto creates a few shadow clones and begins distributing Kurama's chakra to every member of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, each one gaining the same chakra shroud. The
Ten-Tails
 tries attacking, but is countered by Hinata's newly-empowered attack.
Obito
 sends more of attacks with other tails, but they're blocked by enlarged
Akimichi
.
Ino
 and
Shikamaru
 remember their fathers' last words and proceed with their strategy. Ino takes control of Obito again to redirect an attack aimed at
Chōji
, while Shikamaru and other
Nara
 bind the Ten-Tails with their shadows. Lee mourns
Neji
, and
Kakashi
 and Naruto decry Obito's statements, that as shinobi, they must endure the loss of their friends, even if it is painful.

Lee
 remembers Neji while empowered by Naruto. Kakashi recalls his last conversation with
Shikaku
.
Kurama
 admires Naruto while comparing him to his parents. Madara aids Obito by breaking the Nara's hold of the Ten-Tails, but their next attack is foiled by a barrage of attacks. The Alliance is surrounded by the Ten-Tails' tails as Obito mocks
Hiashi
, pointing out the irony of the
Hyūga
's own branch family system. Naruto cuts through a couple tails with a
Rasenshuriken
, and the Alliance moves as one towards the Ten-Tails. Hinata fixes Naruto's shoulder, and he throws a second Rasenshuriken, which phases through Obito, but severs his connection to the beast, Lee doing the same by kicking through
Madara
. The two retreat. In the outskirts of Konohagakure, Orochimaru and Taka reach the
Uzumaki Clan's Mask Storage Temple
, where Orochimaru retrieves a mask. Sasuke takes in the village's view, and Orochimaru comments on Sasuke's feelings. Sasuke unseals a passage to the Uchiha's secret room in the
Naka Shrine
. Inside, Orochimaru dons the mask, invokes the Shinigami, and has it cut its stomach open, releasing its contents. The souls of Orochimaru's arms return to him, but the Shinigami's injury is reflected on him. He has
Jūgo
 flow natural energy into Sasuke, forcing out the six White Zetsu spores on him. Jūgo absorbs one,
Suigetsu
 holds another, to which Orochimaru transfers his being to escape the injury, and the other four are sacrificed for the Impure World Reincarnation, as Orochimaru brings back the first four
Hokage
.

Trivia

The cloaks that Naruto hands to the Shinobi Alliance are depicted with red colour unlike in the manga where they are depicted with yellowish-orange.

There is an animation error when Lee mourns Neji's death. When he closes Neji's eyes, Neji's eyebrows suddenly disappear.

When Shikamaru uses his
Shadow Imitation Technique
 to stop the Ten-Tails' movement, the eye of the Ten-Tails is missing its pupil.

Naruto had a similar scene as Sasuke except Naruto commented the village hadn't change at all while Sasuke commented the village had changed a lot. This symbolised how much they themselves had changed after returning to the village since they left at the end of Part I. Naruto, having changed little, if at all, commented the village had changed little if at all. Sasuke, having changed a great deal, commented the village had also changed a great deal.
