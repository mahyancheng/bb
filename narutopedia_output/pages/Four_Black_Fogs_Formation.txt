The members of the
Sound Four
 stand at four directions around their target as they, in unison, perform this technique. They create a dark, dense fog high in the air that descends on the target, engulfing them and creating a powerful
barrier
 that
seals
 them off from all outside forces, even death. The Sound Four use this technique to counter the effects of the
Mind Awakening Pill
,
 which kills those who ingest it in order to advance their
cursed seal
 to its second level.
 The
Dark Sealing Method
 can be used to contain the fog within a confined space, such as a coffin.
