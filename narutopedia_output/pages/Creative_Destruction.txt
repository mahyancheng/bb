While riding a giant clay bird, Deidara releases an ocean of spiders that approach the opponent. Much to the opponent's surprise, Deidara has also released enough birds that form a dome. With a hand sign from Deidara, each clay figure explodes in rythmic order until they all explode at once, creating a large dome of flame.
