, who is also written as his primary love interest. Inspired by

, the character is
Naruto Uzumaki
's namesake.

Background

When Naruto was young, his father, whom he never met, was killed in the First Shinobi World War. Upon hearing stories about his father from the Second Kokage, Naruto decided to live up to his father's example of a shinobi as "one who endures".

At age six, Naruto graduated from the Shuku Academy and was placed on Team Shū under Shū's leadership alongside Tsuyu and
Renge Momoashi
. Naruto almost immediately developed romantic feelings for Tsuyu, but she was uninterested in him, much to his grief. He started a bitter rivalry with Renge during the course of their training. At one point, Naruto tried to spy on Tsuyu changing into her swimsuit, and she nearly killed him in retaliation.

During the Second Shinobi World War, Naruto and the rest of Team Shū rose to the rank of jōnin and became involved in many battles. One battle in particular where they managed to hold their own against rival village leader Maei Yagyū, who bestowed the three the title "The Three Ninja of Shuku".

At some point, Naruto was trained by Grand Master Fūtenso, the Rat Sage, in order to become a Sage. He succeeded in mastering senjutsu and the Sage Mode.

Personality

Naruto is determined, good-natured, hard-working, and has a dedicated personality that forces him to never give up. Tsuyu also describes him as dumb and an idiot for his antics.

Appearance

Naruto's appearance is currently left mostly up to reader interpretation, but he normally wears the jōnin uniform throughout the novel.

Abilities

Naruto is a powerful and skilled shinobi having attained jōnin rank and being declared one of "The Three Ninja of Shuku".

Naruto had the ability to summon giant mice to aid him in battle and his senjutsu. Three of the mice are

,
Miki
, and
Mini
.

The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi

When his teammate Renge defects from Shuku and becomes a missing-nin right after the village of Ton has been destroyed, Naruto and Tsuyu are ordered to chase after him.

Trivia

Much of Naruto's character appear to be inspired by Jiraiya himself, something
Minato Namikaze
 and
Kushina Uzumaki
 noticed. This is most notable in Naruto's perverse personality and his mainly one-sided strong romantic feelings for his teammate, Tsuyu. A good deal more of his personality appears to be inspired by Jiraiya's former student
Nagato
, to whom the novel is dedicated.

Two of Naruto's mice summons, Miki and Mini, were inspired by Jiraiya's own summons:
Fukusaku
 and
Shima
. Their names are a reference to
Disney
's mascots
Mickey
 and
Minnie Mouse
.

The surname "Musasabi" means "Japanese giant flying squirrel" (鼯鼠).
