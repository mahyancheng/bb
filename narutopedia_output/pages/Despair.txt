" (

Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 and
Asuma
 arrive just in time to witness
Sora
 giving in to the nature of the
Nine-Tailed Fox
. Asuma realises that Furido is none other than Sora's father,
Kazuma
, whom he thought he had killed years ago. Kazuma explains to Naruto that some of the Nine-Tails' leaked chakra was sealed and suppressed inside of Sora, but now that the seal had been removed, the fox's chakra was taking over Sora's body, all part of Kazuma's plan to sic a miniature Nine-tails' on
Konoha
.
Sakura
 and
Yamato
 arrive as well, surprised to see Sora possessing the Nine-Tails' Cloak. As Asuma and Kazuma begin their bout, Naruto attempts to sympathise with Sora, who uses his roar towards Sakura. Naruto protects Sakura, telling Sora that he had once used the power of the Nine-Tailed Fox to hurt Sakura and that he wouldn't allow the same to happen again. Using his
Wood Release
, Yamato binds Sora, although he is unable to suppress his
chakra
 due to Sora not possessing the
First Hokage's Necklace
. Sora enters into his
one-tailed form
, but
Team Asuma
 arrives at the nick of time, with
Shikamaru
 using his
Shadow Imitation Technique
 to trap Sora in place. He has
Chōji
 use his
Partial Multi-Size Technique
 to grab a hold onto Sora. Naruto tells Sora that he cannot allow Sora to use their power for evil. When Sora asks what he means, Naruto explains that he is the
jinchūriki
 of the Nine-Tailed Fox.

Sora does not believe him, as he claims those with
tailed beast
 spirits within them are meant to be outcasts for life, and questions how Naruto could have friends. Naruto explains that when he was younger he was just like Sora, receiving the hateful, angry glares from adults; however, he had always pulled stunts for attention to distract himself from his loneliness and in the process ended up making friends. When Sora cries that he never had any friends, Naruto tells him that he and the others are his friends.
Ino
 uses her
Mind Body Switch Technique
 on Sora, but Sora gives in to the fox spirit within him, causing Ino pain and dispelling her. The burning sensation caused by the fox's chakra burns Chōji's hands, and Shikamaru's chakra runs out, freeing Sora. Sora then succumbs to his rage and enters into his three-tailed form.
