Using her
Giant Folding Fan
,
Temari
 causes many currents of
wind
 to collide with each other, creating vacuum pockets. As the wind moves outward from her, it cuts up whatever it comes into contact with and deflects any attacks coming towards her, even sound-based
genjutsu
. Because of how far the winds travel, this technique is especially useful against opponents that attack from long ranges.
