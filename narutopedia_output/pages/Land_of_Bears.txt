Land of Bears.



The
Land of Bears
 (
熊の国
,
Kuma no Kuni
) is a heavily forested country, which is exclusive to the anime, lying west of the
Land of Earth
 over the mountains, and only lightly settled. Its ninja village,
Hoshigakure
, is located in the middle of the country surrounded by a canyon filled with poisonous gas which the locals call the
Devil's Ravine
 (
English TV:
 Valley of Death). The canyon serves as a natural barrier to prevent raids on the village. A
meteorite
 crashed near the site of the village 200 years before the start of the series.
