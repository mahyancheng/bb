Lyrics

Rōmaji

Oh life is fireworks

From inside to the outside

(Wow wow)

(Wow wow)

Kotae wa mitsukaranai mama

Chiheisen no hate

I was born in this world itsuka no

Mada yoake mae

Kurayami o kakiwakete hashiru

Ashidori wa doko e yuku no

Dare mo inai michi no saki ni

The sun also rises again

Hey! Wake up! Kagayake

Kokoro o moyase

Don't look back! Yoru o koero

Bokura koso freedom

Sakasou yozora ni (Wow wow)

Oh life is fireworks

Kokoro o moyase

Today is a new day mezashi haruka ue

Donna toki mo mae ni susumu dake

Ashi wa tomezu ni Run it up

Kotae wa jibun no naka Keep it up

Life is fireworks (Wow wow)

Life is fireworks (Wow wow)

Kanji

Oh Life is Fireworks

From the inside to the outside

(Wow)　(Wow)

答えは見つからないまま

地平線の果て

I was born into this world いつかの

まだ夜明け前

暗闇をかき分けて走る

足取りは何処へ行くの

誰もいない道の先に

The sun also rises again

Hey! Wake up! 輝け

心を燃やせ

Don’t look back! 夜を超えろ

僕らこそ フリーダム

咲かそう夜空に (Wow)

Oh Life is Fireworks

心を燃やせ

Today is a New day 目指し遥か上

どんなときも前に進むだけ

足は止めずに Run it up

答えは自分の中 Keep it up

Life is Fireworks (Wow)

Life is Fireworks (Wow)

English

Oh, life is fireworks

From the inside to the outside

I can't find the answer,

At the end of the horizon

I was born in this world, someday

It's still before dawn

Run and break through the darkness

Where are your steps going?

At the end of the road with no one on it,

The sun also rises again

Hey! Wake up! Shine

Set your heart ablaze

Don't look back! Go beyond the night

We are the freedom

Let's bloom in the night sky

Oh, life is fireworks

Set your heart ablaze

Today is a new day, aim far above

No matter what, just keep moving forward

Without stopping, run it up

The answer is inside you, keep it up

Life is fireworks

Life is fireworks

Rōmaji (Full Version)

Oh life is fireworks

From inside to the outside

Kotae wa mitsukaranai mama

Chiheisen no hate

I was born in this world itsuka no

Mada yoake mae

Kurayami o kakiwakete hashiru

Ashidori wa doko e yuku no

Dare mo inai michi no saki ni

The sun also rises again

Hey! Wake up! Kagayake

Kokoro o moyase

Don't look back! Yoru o koero

Bokura koso freedom

Sakasou yozora ni

Oh life is fireworks

Kokoro o moyase

Hey you brought me back to the light

And I got the land to fight

Jinsei hakanaku mijikai

Dou tsukau ka jibun shidai Isn't that all right

Tatoe kujikesou ni narou tomo

Kienai you ni hi o tomose

Cause I never want to give it up with you

The sun also rises again

Hey! Wake up! Kagayake

Kokoro o moyase

Don't look back! Yoru o koero

Bokura koso freedom

Sakasou yozora ni

Oh life is fireworks

Kokoro o moyase

When you hit the bottom

Then it goes up

Climb to the top with you

Sara ni tooku

Come on!

Miageta hoshi no umi ni

I wonder kotae wa saisho kara

Inside of me

Samenai yume wa tsuzuku never stop

My heart will keep it burning

The sun also rises again

Hey! Stand up! Just be yourself!

Hikari o hanate

Come with me! Asu o kaero

Dokomademo freedom

Tsukame sono te de

Oh life is fireworks

Kokoro o moyase

Today is a new day mezashi haruka ue

Donna toki mo mae ni susumu dake

Ashi wa tomezu ni Run it up

Kotae wa jibun no naka Keep it up

Life is fireworks

Life is fireworks
