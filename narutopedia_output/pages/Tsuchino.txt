Tsuchino
 (
ツチノ
) is a former
academy student
 of
Sunagakure
.

Background

He was the leader of his group of friends, which consisted of
Abiru
,
Kashike
, and
Tomari
. When
Gaara
 tried to play with them one day, they ran away in fear. Gaara accidentally attacked them while trying to stop them with his
sand
, breaking Tsuchino's leg. Only the sudden appearance of
Yashamaru
 saved Tsuchino and his friends from being completely crushed by Gaara's sand. Another time, Tsuchino and his friends threw rocks at
Shira
 and made fun of him for not being able to enter the academy due to his lack of skills in
ninjutsu
 and
genjutsu
.

Personality

Tsuchino enjoyed playing with his friends very much and was terrified of people like Gaara. In the anime, he behaves very unfriendly towards unskilled persons, discriminating them because of their lack in ninja arts.

Appearance

Tsuchino has short spiky black hair and black-coloured eyes.

Trivia

A young boy sharing Tsuchino's character design makes a cameo appearance in the original anime episode 212,
To Each His Own Path
.
