Fukasaku
 (
フカサク
), often referred to as "Boss" (
頭
,
Kashira
) is an elder toad over eight hundred years old that resides on
Mount Myōboku
. As the heirs of the
Great Toad Sage
, he and his wife
Shima
 are revered as the "
Two Great Sage Toads
" (
二大仙蝦蟇
,
Nidaisengama
).

Background

When
Jiraiya
 accidentally
reverse-summoned
 himself to
Mount Myōboku
, Fukasaku greeted the young
shinobi
 and stated that the
Great Toad Sage
 was expecting him. Some time after this, Fukasaku taught Jiraiya
senjutsu
.

Fukasaku was later present when the Great Toad Sage called for Jiraiya to tell him about his prophecy.

Personality

Fukasaku, like his wife Shima, is considered very wise and is greatly respected by all who know them well enough. In reality, he constantly bickers with Shima over small things when they should focus on the bigger picture, such as the fact that a battle will cause them to miss dinner.
 They are still close, as Shima is heartbroken after Fukasaku is killed by
Pain
.
 Though Fukasaku remains serious in even the worst situation, he and his wife will constantly find a reason to bicker with each other. He also has a tendency to call the Great Toad Sage, "senile" for constantly forgetting everything.

Fukasaku and Shima both seem fond of Naruto. Fukasaku met Naruto for the first time when he brought the news of
Jiraiya
's death to
Konoha
. He found Naruto's nickname for Jiraiya ("
Perverted Hermit
") to be both very fitting and very funny, but observed that Naruto, as he was, would not stand a chance against Pain, and offered to take Naruto away to learn
senjutsu
 at
Mount Myōboku
. After what was (for Naruto) a confusing introduction to sensing natural energy and drawing it in to blend
senjutsu chakra
, Fukasaku, in light of Naruto's rapid progress, believed that Naruto would surpass Jiraiya in power.

Appearance

Fukasaku is a green toad with white hair styled in somewhat of a mohawk, very thick eyebrows and a small goatee. He has been seen wearing two capes: a high-collared one and a simpler version. On his back is a message that Jiraiya left before he died regarding
Pain
: "the real one isn't among them"; because it was burned into his flesh, it cannot be removed.

Abilities

In battle, Fukasaku and Shima are extremely formidable. After Shima extends a serpent-like creature from her stomach to seek out the opponent, Fukasaku can quickly strike with his tongue. Both are capable of exerting powerful gusts of wind. Also, they are highly intelligent, as they quickly determined a weakness in the way Pain used his
Rinnegan
.

Genjutsu






Fukasaku and Shima using the Demonic Illusion: Toad Confrontation Chant.



Shima and Fukasaku are capable of using a very powerful genjutsu called
Demonic Illusion: Toad Confrontation Chant
. This ability cancelled out Jiraiya's lack of aptitude for genjutsu, making their combination much stronger. However, this genjutsu takes time. Also, in order to use this technique, both Shima and Fukasaku must adjust their voices and
harmonise with each other
 (something neither of them seems happy about doing). When finally applied, it attacks the opponent's sense of hearing, and will completely paralyse the target(s) body. It gives Shima and Fukasaku a sore throat afterwards, meaning it cannot be used repeatedly.

Ninjutsu

Nature Transformation

Fukasaku has
Wind Release
, and in anime also
Water Release

chakra natures
. He used a Wind Release technique as collabaration of ninjutsu with Shima and Jiraiya. In the anime he also uses Water Release techniques of high ranks. With one of the water techniques, it allowed him to pierce through walls and flesh by increasing the force of water through his mouth and reducing the opening of his mouth. He used this technique to cut one of Pain's summons in half.

Senjutsu






Fukasaku using the Fighting Tongue Slash.



Shima and Fukasaku are extremely skilled and experienced in
senjutsu
, a specialised field of techniques that allows the user to sense and then gather the natural energy around a person and draw it inside them, then blending it with their own chakra to create senjutsu chakra. This natural energy-empowered state grants the practitioner a high amount of a type of chakra which is stronger than other types of chakra. Other benefits include an unnaturally high level of raw strength, incredible speed, and huge resistance to physical attacks. With it, he is able to raise a giant frog statue much heavier than himself, and even throw
Gamabunta
 a long distance. According to Gamakichi, Fukasaku can amass large amount of natural energy with complete control in an instant. He is also a capable teacher, having taught it to Jiraiya and later Naruto.

Part II

Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant

Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant






The encrypted message that Jiraiya left.



Jiraiya summoned Shima and Fukasaku during his fight with Pain to help him enter
Sage Mode
. In addition to sitting on his shoulders to provide him with natural energy, they gave him advice, and attacked Pain when necessary. Their combined efforts were enough to combat three of Pain's bodies on equal terms. Shima and Fukasaku then created a
genjutsu
 that allowed them to kill the three bodies, but they were soon overwhelmed by the appearance of three more.

Knowing the battle was lost, Jiraiya had Shima take the
Animal Path
 he had captured back to
Konoha
. While she did that, Fukasaku accompanied him during his final confrontation with Pain. When he discovered Pain's secret, he
carved
 a message into Fukasaku's back, and sent him away before dying of his injuries.

Pain's Assault

Main article:
Pain's Assault

Fukasaku informed Konoha and
Naruto Uzumaki
 of Jiraiya's death, telling them what he could of Pain, and allowing them to photograph the message on his back. Knowing that Naruto wanted revenge, and that he was currently ill-prepared for a battle with Pain, Fukasaku took him to Mount Myōboku to teach him
senjutsu
. While Naruto practised tuning in with nature, Fukasaku beat him (and his
shadow clones
) with a staff to keep him from taking in too much natural energy.






Fukasaku attempts to fuse with Naruto.



Naruto rapidly progressed through the training stages, earning praise from Fukasaku for so quickly catching up to Jiraiya. Once Naruto attained Sage Mode, he taught him
Frog Kata
. After Naruto mastered the
fighting style
, Fukasaku began the final step of trying to fuse with Naruto as he had done with Jiraiya, something that proved impossible because of the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 sealed within Naruto. Worried that all his training would go to waste, Naruto tried to find a way to achieve Sage Mode without Fukasaku.






Fukasaku and Shima using the Sage Art: Frog Call.



While Naruto continued trying to find an alternative, Fukasaku was informed of
Kōsuke
's death, indicating something was happening in Konoha. Shima, who was shopping near Konoha, also noticed that something was wrong in the village. She summoned Naruto, Fukasaku,
Gamaken
,
Gamabunta
,
Gamakichi
, and
Gamahiro
 to Konoha's centre moments after Pain destroyed the village. As Naruto engaged Pain, Shima and Fukasaku provided assistance, dealing with the
Animal Path
's summons. They were amazed by his perfected
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
, something he had not shown them during his training, but were again forced to deal with the Animal Path.

Knowing that the Animal Path must be got rid of, Shima coated the area in a dust cloud while Fukasaku threw Gamabunta at the path, giving Naruto an opportunity to finish it off. Pain was soon left with only one body, and Shima and Fukasaku tried once again to use a genjutsu to defeat it. Pain killed Fukasaku and knocks Shima away before they had a chance. Their bodies were later found and Shima, once healed, wept for Fukasaku. When Pain was defeated, and subsequently chose to revive everyone he had killed, Fukasaku was brought back to life, to Shima's shock and surprise. Later, Shima and Fukasaku were both seen together, standing atop
Gamakichi
's head and watching from a distance as the population of Konoha welcomed Naruto back.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown

Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown

Fukasaku summoned Naruto again to Mount Myōboku from the Great Toad Sage's order. He is present during the conversation between the two. When Naruto had trouble swallowing
Gerotora
 as part of their contract, Fukasaku kicked Gerotora to give him a boost. The elder toad then
reverse-summoned
 Naruto back to
Ramen Ichiraku
.

Trivia






An early design of Jiraiya, with toads riding on his shoulders.



Masashi Kishimoto
 had several different designs for the Jiraiya character. In one such design, Jiraiya would change into an ugly but powerful form during moments of passion, such as anger or when seeing a beautiful woman. This version of Jiraiya had a married toad couple riding on his shoulders, who would periodically tell jokes. Kishimoto abandoned the idea because it was too complicated.

Naruto addresses him as "Grandpa Sage" (
仙人じいちゃん
,
Sennin Jīchan
,
English TV:
 Geezer Sage).

Fukasaku's name comes from the legendary film-maker
Kinji Fukasaku
, best known for the WWII film
Tora! Tora! Tora!
 and the ground-breaking yakuza film
Battles Without Honour and Humanity
 (
仁義なき戦い
,
Jingi Naki Tatakai
). The latter film starred the famous actor
Bunta Sugawara
, who gave
Gamabunta
 his name.

In the anime, he stated that his favourite food is
onigiri
 made from larvae.
