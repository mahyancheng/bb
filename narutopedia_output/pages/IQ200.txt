Shikamaru throws a myriad of
kunai
, all but one of which have
wire strings
 attached to them, with a single one having explosive grenades instead, at the opponent. He then pulls on the strings, creating a
friction
 that cuts down a bunch of tree branches, creating a debris that triggers the grenades, causing an explosion.
