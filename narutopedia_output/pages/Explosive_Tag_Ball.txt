This is simply a group of
explosive tags
 wrapped into a ball and used in the same manner as a
cannonball
 with the added explosive effect. They are fired from cannons and are capable of dealing heavy damage. There is also the special variant used as
underwater mines
.

Trivia

The Explosive Tag Ball appears in the
Ultimate Ninja Storm
 series as one of the default ninja tools for several characters. In the games, the ball is thrown, bouncing and then rolling on the ground before stopping. The ball will automatically explode if it comes in contact with an opponent or after a certain amount of time has passed.
