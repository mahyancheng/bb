Sukune
 (
スクネ

Genjutsu Tree Village
.

Background

Sukune was a brave man who never gave up hope of defending his village against
Kandachi
. He died trying to defend his village. His son
Tanishi
 at first detested him, but when he saw the meaning of his death, began to love him. He was buried in the village's graveyard.

Personality

He is known to be respected in his village. He was a brave individual who died defending his village.
Jiraiya
 noted that Sukune was a kind man.

Appearance

Sukune had long black hair and dark-coloured eyes. His bangs hung over his forehead and he wore a blue V-neck type shirt with the V-neck being green-coloured.

Abilities






Sukune using Chilli Pepper Bombs.



He is shown to be fairly strong from the civilian's standpoint, capable of decent accuracy with the
Chilli Pepper Bombs
 and able to endure several attacks by the
Conch King
, but his skills were not nearly equal to those of a ninja. Due to his use of a
kama
 in his confrontation with Kandachi it can be assumed he was proficient in its use.

Part II

Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha

Jiraiya mentions that Sukune and his family were very kind to him when he visited the
Genjutsu Tree Village
 the first time, and is sad to hear of his death when he returns with
Naruto
 later.

Trivia

Written as 宿禰, Sukune is the third-highest of the eight hereditary titles designated by
Emperor Tenmu
.

Sukune's attitudes and the way he died are similar to
Kaiza
's from the
Land of Waves
. Both of them resisted the invaders of their country, and therefore they were killed.
