Sasuke pierces his opponent with
Amaterasu
 flames while simultaneously capturing them inside a
Chibaku Tensei
 which is enveloped by the black flames. Sasuke then jumps high in the air and activates his Complete Body
Susanoo
 and proceeds to fly towards the Chibaku Tensei. He creates a
Chidori
 through his Susanoo and covers it in Amaterasu flames as well before charging towards the opponent still caught inside the Chibaku Tensei. The impact results in a massive explosion which blows the Chibaku Tensei into smithereens.
