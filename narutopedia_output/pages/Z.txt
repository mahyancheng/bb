Zō and the others discover Hiruzen's body.



Zō and seven other Anbu members were stationed in the
Chūnin Exams
 arena during the final rounds of the Chūnin Exams. When
Orochimaru
 launched the
Konoha Crush
, Zō and his team rushed to help the
Third Hokage
. However, before they could reach him, the
Sound Four
 put up a barrier that kept them from helping. He and his men were forced to watch the battle between the Third Hokage and Orochimaru. In the end, the Third Hokage died due to using the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
 and Orochimaru stabbing him with the
Sword of Kusanagi: Longsword of the Sky
. When Orochimaru retreated, Zō and his men tried to prevent them from escaping, but
Kidōmaru
 prevented them from following with
his webs
. At the Third Hokage's funeral, Zō cursed his inability to help the Hokage, saying "In the end, all we could do was watch".

Zō was later seen during
Pain's assault
 on Konoha, staying by
Tsunade
's side in order to protect her, as she healed the villagers, and later accompanied
Ino
 when she went to aid
her father
 and
Ibiki Morino
. Zō defeated one of
Pain
's summons using
Lightning Release: Four Pillar Bind
 with the aid of
two

other
 unnamed Anbu captains.

Trivia

Zō has been given the name
Otomatsu
 by fans and the closed captioning. He has also been called Raidō, possibly because he was confused with
Raidō Namiashi
.

In the anime, a similar-looking Anbu captain was badly wounded by
Kabuto
 on a mission trying to find the location of one of Orochimaru's hideouts. He sent a
messenger bird
 back to Konoha with information about his mission before destroying his body.

There have been several appearances of an unnamed
Anbu
 captain from
Konohagakure
, wearing white robes and a cat-like mask. It is unknown if any of these appearance are the same person. In the anime, there are at least two of them, as the second to appear died shortly afterwards.
