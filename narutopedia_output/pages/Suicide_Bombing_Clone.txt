After creating a
shadow clone
, it will then ingest some explosive clay and explode, creating a diversion that can be used to escape. With a "suicide bombing announcement" the enemy's wariness is heightened and this opportunity is used to switch places with a shadow clone. The explosion is said to be strong enough to destroy an entire forest. This technique requires an adept usage of verbal tricks; with this foundation of using many "arts" to trifle with the enemy, it certainly fulfils its purpose.
