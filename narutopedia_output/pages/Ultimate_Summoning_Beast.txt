The
Ultimate Summoning Beast
 (
究極の口寄せ獣
,
Kyūkyoku no Kuchiyosejū
) was a mixture of different summoning animals that inhabited the animal summoning facility. It was created to be a perfect counter against other shinobi.

Background

The researchers of the facility created the creature to be the ultimate summoning. When
Honoka
 tried to
seal
 it, the creature started devouring the researchers and killed Honoka. The creature afterwards started absorbing the other summoning animals on the
island
 and went into a chrysalis state.

Appearance






The Ultimate Summoning Beast as it takes flight.



In its initial form, it resembled a regular
pupa
 with a large body mass and tentacles and small arms. After emerging from its chrysalis, it grew feet as its body gained a more humanoid shape. It also had a mouth on its stomach through which it fed and had tentacles in the area where a mouth would usually be. It was also shown to be able to partially morph its own body into that of the animals it absorbed such as growing wings to fly.

Abilities






The beast using a genjutsu.



Having been created as a counter towards shinobi, the Ultimate Summoning Beast displays a variety of abilities. It can consume other summons in order to gain their abilities, and it's capable of using
genjutsu
, which it channels towards its eyes, and ninjutsu, as demonstrated with a
Lightning Release
 attack. The creature could also flap sharp
wind
 that was able to cut Guy's cheek. As the "perfect counter against shinobi" it had the ability to absorb chakra, as witnessed when Yamato tried to restrain him using his
Wood Release
.

The Ultimate Summoning Beast while asleep.



When
Might Guy
 is taken by bird summon, the crew sails to the island he was taken to.
Aoba Yamashiro
 finds the ghost of Honoka there and shows him the ruined facility. Aoba finds the Ultimate Animal Summoning sleeping and
reads its mind
 to learn more of its origins. When Guy,
Yamato
 and
Naruto
 find Aoba, the creature awakens and absorbs the animal summons that followed the others. The creature emerges, now out of its cocoon and attacks the
Konoha
 shinobi with the abilities it has acquired as well as
Lightning Release
 ninjutsu and genjutsu. Guy uses the fifth of his
Eight Gates
 to stall the creature while Naruto prepares for
Sage Mode
. Guy kicks the creature into the volcano outside the lab; the creature attempts to escape but the bird that captured Guy, along with the other animal summons, prevent it from doing so. Honoka's ghost helps restrain the creature while Naruto tosses
Rasenshuriken
 at the creature, slicing it in half and sending it plummeting into the lava.
