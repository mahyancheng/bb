Suzumebachi
 (
スズメバチ
) was an
Iwagakure

kunoichi
 and the leader of the
Kamizuru Clan
.

Background

Sometime after her clan fell from grace due to conflict with the
Aburame Clan
 of
Konohagakure
, Suzumebachi and her siblings sought their grandfather's, the
First Tsuchikage
 secret scroll of forbidden Kamizuru techniques in the hopes of revitalising their clan's reputation.

Personality

Suzumebachi has no qualms about using underhanded techniques to get what she desires. This is shown when seeing Konoha shinobi searching for the bikōchū. Upon their arrival she determines that they are genin lacking power enough to stop her. She then decides that they should let genin do the work for them and steal the beetle from them afterwards.

Suzumebachi has a great deal of hatred for the Aburame clan stating that they were the catalyst for the downfall of their clan. She plans to kill all those involved with Shino and him regardless whether or not they find the beetle because of this hatred.

She is very driven and will stop at nothing to fulfil her goal of bringing honour to her clan, even kidnapping Hinata and using her as bait for a trap. Even so, she does appear to value hard work and determination. This is seen when she spies on Shino's group during the genin squad's first night she sees Hinata continuing to practice, and mentally admitting it was quite admirable "to come all this way and continue training".

Appearance

Suzumebachi had shoulder-length brown hair with a single lock falling onto the right side of her face and going over her right eye just a little bit. She had steel-grey eyes with orange markings in the corner. She wore what appeared to be an altered, purple kimono dress with red trimmings. She wore a yellow sash around her waist and thigh-length stockings that merged into her sandals. She also had very small eyebrows.

Abilities






Suzumebachi uses the Bee Honey Technique.



Suzumebachi was a very strong and knowledgeable kunoichi, which was the reason she became the leader of her small group while searching for the bikōchū. She is shown to be very deceptive, cleverly using
clones made out of honey
 and
explosive tags
 to trap and kill her clueless opponents.

Ninjutsu






Suzumebachi summoning the Giant Bee.



As a member of the Kamizuru clan, Suzumebachi's fighting style resolved around the usage of bees. She was well-versed in her clan's techniques, such as a technique that
summons

bees
, which
burst
 into sticky honey when killed, and a technique that fires the
bees' stingers
 at opponents. Suzumebachi is also able to summon a
giant queen bee
 that can spit honey at her enemies. She could also use her insects to perform an
explosive attack
. The stings of her bees were
poisonous
 and force the victim to fall asleep in seconds. She could also use the
Hiding with Camouflage Technique
. Being an
Iwagakure
 shinobi, Suzumebachi has a natural affinity for
Earth Release
 and could create a
bee hive made out of rock
 to lure her enemies inside.

Bikōchū Search Mission






Suzumebachi puts her trap into motion.



In their quest to find their grandfather's scroll, Suzumebachi and her two brothers,
Jibachi
 and
Kurobachi
, travelled to a forest to capture a
bikōchū
 to track the scroll by scent. Once they spotted
Shino Aburame
,
Kiba Inuzuka
,
Hinata Hyūga
, and
Naruto Uzumaki
, they decided to let them find the beetle first, and then take it from them. To do this, she kidnapped Hinata. But when her
Giant Bee
 was defeated by Hinata's
Protecting Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
, she was the only one to survive being crushed. Suzumebachi then attempted one last attempt to avenge her clan by
summoning
 a
Giant Bee
, but she was promptly defeated by
Naruto Uzumaki
's
Rasengan
.

Trivia

"Suzumebachi" can be translated to literally mean "sparrow bee" (by breaking down the name, with "suzume" being "sparrow" and "hachi" being "bee") - the name for the
Asian giant hornet
, the most dangerous wasp in the world. It is also can be translated to "hornet", which is hinted by the way her techniques revolve around hornets.

Suzumebachi and her siblings didn't wear Iwagakure
forehead protectors
 because they longed for recognition from their village after their clan's loss against the Aburame clan.

She made an omake appearance in
episode 161
. She was seen standing next to
Ibiki Morino
 as the
Might Guy
 and
Rock Lee
 impersonators,
Potcha
 and
Mondai
, entered the village.
