While having the target under the effects of the
Odourless Poison Mist
, Karenbana releases flower petals, before casting the illusion that she had turned into a multitude of flower petals herself, which flow through the air and circle the target. With the target hindered, she can freely move through the flower petals and attack the target without being seen.

Drawbacks

The downside to this illusion is that it only hides Karenbana visually. Meaning the target is still able to interact with the outside world, as seen when
Naruto
 released a widespread shock wave to knock her back, and when
Sakura
 was able to pinpoint her location after hearing her step on broken glass.

Trivia

Though unnamed in the movie, this technique was named in the
Naruto Collectible Card Game
.
