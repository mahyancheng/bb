Seals
 (
印
,
In
,
English TV:
 Hand Signs) are used to perform many
ninjutsu
,
genjutsu
, and other secret arts other than
taijutsu
. Invented by
Indra Ōtsutsuki
 in the anime, they are designed to aid people in properly summoning and moulding
chakra
 necessary to perform a technique.
 There are different sequences of hand seals for every technique, requiring memorisation.

While techniques may require a number of hand seals to work, a skilled ninja can use less or even just one hand seal to perform the same technique. An example of this is the
Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique
, which requires a total of 44 hand seals to activate.

Tobirama Senju
, the Second
Hokage
, only needed to use one hand seal to complete the technique, a testament to his skill.
 It is even possible for individuals to perform techniques without the need of hand seals at all, as by Part II,
Sasuke Uchiha
 learned to do so with his
Chidori
 and other related techniques. By reading the hand seals of the opponent, a ninja can predict the nature of the technique to be performed, which is virtually unavoidable if read by the
Sharingan
.

Although rare, it is possible for a shinobi to be able to do hand seals with just one hand. Shinobi seen capable of this include
Haku
,

Fudō
,

Guren
,

Itachi Uchiha
,

Minato Namikaze
,

Naruto Uzumaki
,

Sasuke Uchiha
,

Shojoji
,

Koji Kashin
,

Kawaki
,
 and
Boruto Uzumaki
.

It is also possible for shinobi to form hand seals with one of their hands while using the hand of another person as a substitute for the opposite one. This can happen voluntarily, like when Naruto and Sasuke joined hands to dispel the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
,
 or forcefully, such as
Anko Mitarashi
 using
Orochimaru
's hand for the
Twin Snakes Mutual Death Technique
,
 or (in the anime)
Obito Uchiha
 using
Kakashi Hatake
's for the
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
 and Sasuke using Naruto's hand for the same technique

Even rarer than one-handed hand seals, are shinobi who have abandoned this traditional practice altogether, usually because their
fighting style
 revolve around speed and quick reflexes and have developed
techniques that require no hand seals
 to complement this fighting style.

Certain elemental releases often end in the hand seals they are affiliated with. For example, Fire Release often ends with Tiger, Earth and Wood Releases often end with the Snake hand seals.

Other Hand Seals

Besides the twelve basic hand seals, there are unique hand seals used for certain techniques. These hand seals are rarely seen, and can be considered unique to specific techniques.

Elemental Hand Seals





The five one-handed elemental seals.



To use an elemental technique through the
Kote
, one must seal the technique in a
scroll
 and put it inside the device.
 Depending on the technique's chakra nature, the user must then form one of five one-handed seals to release the technique. These seals are:

Fire Release
: A flat hand with all fingers extended.

Water Release
: A flat hand with all fingers extended except the index finger, which is put under the thumb.

Wind Release
: Thumb and pinky are extended, the other fingers lie on the palm.

Earth Release
: Index and middle finger are extended, the other fingers are curled into the palm. Known as Seal of Confrontation.

Lightning Release
: Index and little finger are extended, the middle and ring finger are held down with the thumb.

Seal of Confrontation

The
Seal of Confrontation
 (
対立の印
,
Tairitsu no In
,
English TV:
 Spar Sign), which looks like a half-tiger/ram, is the symbol of combat and is a universal sign of engagement between shinobi. It represents half of a seal that might be used to activate a ninjutsu. This motion is often used to concentrate chakra, and many shinobi are seen initiating simple, basic techniques as well as few complex ones after making this seal. Deidara also often used this when he detonated his
explosive clay
, and
Sai
 and
Inojin
 used it for their
Super Beast Imitating Drawing
.
Madara Uchiha
's and
Hashirama Senju
's statues at the
Valley of the End
 are both forming the Seal of Confrontation whilst facing each other.

Seal of Reconciliation

The
Seal of Reconciliation
 (
和解の印
,
Wakai no In
,
English TV:
 Unison Sign) while not used in battle or for techniques, is used in
Traditional Shinobi Sparring
 as a demonstration that the two opponents are still comrades after sparring.

Manga Hand Seals

Clone Seal

This seal is most commonly associated with the creation of clones using techniques such as the
Shadow Clone Technique
, its
derivative
 and the
Multiple Wood Release Clone Technique
, separate from the basic twelve seals, where index and middle fingers from both hands are crossed.
 This hand seal is also used in performing the
Water Release: Water Shark Bullet Technique
. In
Kakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy Sky
, prior to receiving his prosthetic arm, Naruto adapted this seal for one-handed use, creating the seal's cross with his left hand's index and middle fingers.

Clap Hands

This is more of an initiation of a technique rather than a hand seal where the user simply claps their hands together as exemplified when
Naruto Uzumaki
, for example, summons chakra or is breaking
genjutsu
. The hand seal sequence for powerful summoning
kinjutsu
 like the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 and the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
 end with this motion; similarly,
Jiraiya
 prepares to enter
Sage Mode
 (summoning
Shima
 and
Fukasaku
) by performing this motion and sustaining it,
Hashirama
 uses it to enter Sage Mode as well,
Gaara
 uses it for
Quicksand Waterfall Flow
 at his fight against
Kimimaro
. It is also used to perform the
Chibaku Tensei
 technique. Once the seal sequence is completed, the user's hands are held in this position until the desired effect is achieved. While entering its third transformation, the
Ten-Tails
 has been observed to make this particular seal.

Slam Surface

Used in techniques such as the
Summoning Technique
 and several
Earth Release
 techniques, this is also more of an initiation of a technique than a seal. The user presses their hand to the surface that is affected.

Haku's Seals

The seals used for
Haku
's
Thousand Flying Water Needles of Death
, are quite different than the basic twelve seals, and are also performed with one hand.

Crossed Tiger

Haku's
Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals
 technique can be done with a special seal, which resembles Tiger with middle fingers crossed over the index fingers. Interestingly, Orochimaru also uses this seal when giving the
Cursed Seal of Heaven
 to an individual.

Mirrored Ram

The basic Ram seal is mirrored. To form the seal, the hands are joined together where the right hand thumb is on top of left hand, and the forefinger and middle fingers are facing vertically. This seal is used by Obito and Madara for
Six Paths Ten-Tails Coffin Seal
,
 and also for
Sage Art: Yin Release Lightning Dispatch
.

Jin Seal

This is another one of the seals that are used in normal techniques, yet isn't one of the basic twelve seals. The "Yang Water" (
壬
,
Jin
) seal is used in techniques such as the
Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique
 and the
Shrine Seal
. In the anime, this seal is formed similar to the Dog seal, but the left hand is under the right, and the left's palm is facing up.

Five Elements' Seal

The fūinjutsu
Five Elements Seal
 used by Orochimaru uses a single special seal, which consists in both hands' thumbs and little fingers touching each other tips, with left index and middle fingers and right index finger raised, with the latter touching the left middle. The left ring finger is placed over the right ring finger, with both the latter and the right middle folded down (just like the Ox seal in the left hand).

Akimichi Seal

The
Akimichi clan
 use a certain seal in their
Multi-Size Technique
, which also resembles the Bird seal from frontal view. However, it is confirmed that this is a different seal, as the Bird seal has been seen in a side view in techniques such as
Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique
. The index and little fingers are raised up, the middle and ring fingers are each folded on top of the hand opposite itself and interlocked with each another, and the thumbs are pressed together at their end segments.

In the anime, there are several "variations" to this seal, likely mistakes. Sometimes, it is formed like the Half Tiger, with the little fingers also raised. Other times, it is formed more similarly in fashion to the Bird seal instead, with index and little fingers raised, and with the thumb and middle and ring fingers are folded in and pressed against each other.

This seal is therefore very controversial, as this seal was used instead of the Bird seal multiple times in the anime or in movies, likely a mistake.

Shikamaru's Bird Seal

When casting the seals for the
Shadow Sewing Technique
, Shikamaru does an alternative version of the Bird seal, also similar to the Akimichi clan's Seal. In this version Shikamaru has his pinky and ring fingers pointed up, his middle and index finger interlocked as in the regular Bird seal and his thumbs pointing to himself.
 The shape of the hands resembles a "reversed Tiger seal" of sorts with the last two fingers raised and the others interlocked instead of the other way round.

Yamanaka Seals





The Yamanaka clan's Mind Body Switch Technique.



The
Yamanaka clan
 uses different seals to activate their techniques, such as the
Mind Body Switch Technique
 and the
Mind Body Disturbance Technique
.
 Another seal was used to release the Mind Body Switch Technique and return to the original body. This seal resembled both hands' fingers straightened and crossed into an "X", similar to the Ox seal (however not a "+"), but without the left middle and ring fingers down.

Twin Snakes Mutual Death Seal

A hand seal involving both the user and the enemy is used in the kinjutsu
Twin Snakes Mutual Death
.

Mangekyō Sharingan Activation Seal

Probably another seal used to gather and focus chakra, it was used by
Kakashi
 in his first battle with
Deidara
, when he activated his
Mangekyō Sharingan
 to use
Kamui
 for the first time seen in the series. It is formed like the Tiger seal, except with the index fingers' end segments pushed down against each other, forming a house-like shape in the user's point of view. When Kakashi used it, he positioned it in front of
his left eye
.

Sasuke's Snake Seal

Sasuke used a seal, similar to the Akimichi seal, in his battle with Deidara, when he used either
Hidden Shadow Snake Hands
 or
Binding Snake Glare Spell
.

As with the Akimichi seal, this technique also draws controversy with the Bird seal, as it seems similar from a frontal view. However, side view comparisons of this seal and the Bird seal in
Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique
 and/or
Shadow Sewing Technique
 show that this is a different seal.

Daytime Tiger Seal

This seal is used in
Daytime Tiger
. It does not release chakra, but rather keeps it inside the body to use as energy and strength. This creates a missile type of technique which is not a body of chakra. This seal is actually based off one of the original Kuji-In seals, the seal of the Outer Lion. In this case, the hands are meant to resemble a tiger. The index fingers (the "eyes" of the Tiger) glow green with the evaporating green sweat of the user (result of releasing the Gate of Wonder).

Great Shark Bullet Seal

Kisame
's
Water Release: Great Shark Bullet Technique
 requires this seal. Possibly a comparison to Guy's Daytime Tiger seal, which resembles a tiger, this hand seal is a thrust, but with both hands touching at the wrist and right hand above the left. The fingers are also folded in a way that vaguely resembles shark's teeth. This overall placement of the hands resembles a shark with an open jaw.

Tearing Earth Turning Palm Hand Seal

When
Sumashi
 uses
Earth Release: Tearing Earth Turning Palm
, he uses a special seal that is formed by cupping the left hand and turning it so that it faces the ground and placing the right hand next to it with the index and middle fingers raised.

Other Hand Seals

Hoshigakure Hand Seal

The signature technique of Hoshigakure
Mysterious Peacock Method
 uses a hand seal that has the middle and ring finger pushed down and touching, with the index finger and pinkie touching together to form an arch.

This seal looks similar to the Bird hand sign on a frontal view, but is in fact a different hand sign from opposite angles.

Byakugan Seals

In the anime, certain variant seals to aid in the activation of the
Byakugan
 are seen. Most are some of the basic twelve seals, but several are different. In the manga, seals are indeed used several times, but of course, they cannot be seen with detail.

Water Formation Wall Seal

In the anime, a special seal is used instead of what is seen in the manga for the
Water Release: Water Formation Wall
 Technique.

Fūma Curse Mandala Seals

In the anime, the
Fūma clan
 used various unknown hand seals for their
secret
 techniques, the
Curse Mandala
.

Guren's Unknown Crystal Seals

Several "unknown" seals are used in
Crystal Release: Crystal Encampment Wall
.

Curved Tiger

In the anime, the
Moon Shadow Technique
 is performed with a seal that resembles the Tiger seal, but with the right index and middle fingers curving in front of the left index and middle fingers, also curved the same way.

Covered Snake

In the anime, some jutsu feature a seal similar to the Snake seal, but with the right hand fingers all on top of the left instead of interlocking.

Tornado Lightning Seal

In
Naruto the Movie: Legend of the Stone of Gelel
,
Ranke
 uses an unknown hand seal to activate her
Tornado Lightning
. However, considering that neither she nor her comrades knew what chakra is, her technique is unlikely to be ninjutsu, and her "hand seal" is likely merely an attack gesture.

Land of the Sky's Seal

In
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: Bonds
, an unknown seal is used to focus chakra in preparation for attacking from the
Flying Destruction Machine
. The seal is formed by pressing the knuckles of each hand together, with the back of the hands facing outwards.

Land of Demons' Seals

In
Naruto Shippūden the Movie
, the shinobi affiliated with the
Land of Demons
 use unique seals unused by the usual shinobi seen throughout the series.

Taruho
 used the
Shadow Mirror Body Changing Method
, which used hand seals like:

Tiger, but with little fingers pressed inwards instead

Tiger/Ram with left hand, and right hand with thumb up "punching" the left

Boar, but with left hand pointed upwards instead

Right hand facing down above left, left hand facing up below right; Each hand's index and middle fingers folded, and ring and little fingers straight.

Also, the
Shrine Seal
 used by
Shion
 (
Yomi
 also used a technique by repeating the same seal names, although he only held his palm forward the whole time) uses a numerous amount of different seals with different names as followed:

Hatsu: Right palm facing forward, fingertips directing to the right

Jin: Right hand Tiger/Ram facing down, placed under the eyes pointing towards the left

Kai: Right hand Tiger/Ram, pointing up with arm straight, facing forward

After completing the first three seals, Shion begins to levitate, the seal lights up, a barrier is formed around the seal, and the spheres inside the seal move around the circle (
Yomi
 did not have to do this)

Min: Both palms pushed forward, fingertips pointing about 45 degrees up/forward

Shin: Both palms pressed together (like a clap)

Gan: Left fist "punching" right palm

Reppyō: "Rep" seems identical to the Snake/Earth seal. "Pyō" Each hand in half Tiger/Ram, arms stretched with fingertips pointing forward

Shōzen: Both hands in fists, left above right; looks similar to the Rat seal

Mika: Seems identical to Min

Dan: Each hands revolves around one another into Tiger/Ram, right hand behind left

Raku: Left hand raised up facing down with middle and ring fingers folded and index and little fingers straight pointing towards the left, right palm pushed down facing down pointing forward

Shō: Left palm facing down in front with fingertips pointing right, right fist punching left palm from below

After completing these 9 seals, the stone tablets in the shrine will arise in front of Shion.

Fu: Hold Shō

Sai: Hold Shō

Dan: Hold Shō

Gika: Hold Shō

Ragu: Left hand pointing diagonally up/right 45 degrees, right hand middle and ring fingers folded index and little fingers straight pointing diagonally up/left placed in front of left forearm

Bagi: Right palm facing left with fingertips pointing up in front of user, left forearm behind right seal and left fist placed above right elbow

The first four of these are unseen and it may be that she only shouts these words while holding Shō. Yomi did not use these last six seals.

Hiruko's Storm Release Seal

In
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
, Hiruko uses a special seal for the
Storm Release: Thunder Cloud Inner Wave
, which resembles Tiger, but only with the middle fingers raised.

Trivia

Hand seal usage is not limited to shinobi.
Shima
 and
Fukasaku
 as well as the
Ten-Tails
 have been observed to make hand seals, and
Madara Uchiha
's
Susanoo
 has also been seen making seals while
pulling a meteorite
 toward the earth.

In the anime, a kunoichi known as
Hanare
 could use a
mind reading technique that required the use of her eye
 by "weaving seals" with her right eye. How she does this exactly is unknown. This was not a
dōjutsu
 kekkei genkai as it could be copied with the
Sharingan
.

In the
tenth
Naruto: Shippūden
 opening sequence
, Naruto,
Sakura
, and Sai perform a technique using three-handed seals.

In Hinduism and Buddhism, hand seals are called
mudrā
 (
印相
, Sanskrit: मुद्रा) and are used in everyday life, but also in religious practices and even in dances. The one most significant with synonymous association with ninja would be the Kuji-In set of Mudra.

The usage of hand seals in the arts of ninjutsu in
Naruto
 is likely a reference to the powers of Hōriki, being fantastical powers said to be gained in esoteric Japanese Mikkyō Buddhism through intense meditation to become in tune with one's Buddhahood. In the lore of ninja and ninjutsu, the secrets of Hōriki were said to be gained from its beginnings in ancient Hei'an era nobility, then revived in practice and was responsible for their mythical powers.
