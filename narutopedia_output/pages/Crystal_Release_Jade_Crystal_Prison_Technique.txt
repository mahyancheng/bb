This technique, which seems to be
Crystal Release: Crystal Pentagonal Prison
 on a smaller scale or a minor version of it, allows
Guren
 to completely encase a single target in a compact mass of pink crystals. If the crystals are shattered, the victim disintegrates along with the crystal particles. However,
Hinata
 was able to surround her body with
chakra
 before she was completely encased, thereby avoiding the fatal disintegration effect. Therefore, this
jutsu
 has no effect on chakra.

Trivia

Although the technique is called "Jade Crystal Prison", the crystal prison itself is
pink
 in colouration, and not
jade-green
.
