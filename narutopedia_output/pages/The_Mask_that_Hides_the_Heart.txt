The Mask that Hides the Heart
" (
心を隠す面
,
Kokoro o Kakusu Men
) is episode 349 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

The
Ino–Shika–Chō
 trio are sent on a mission to deliver a treaty to
Iwagakure
. However, the exchange almost turns into an altercation until the
Fourth Kazekage
 arrives to intervene, much to the Iwa-nin's surprise which causes them to flee. The treaty is brought before the
Third Tsuchikage
 and his council who discuss the future. Meanwhile,
Kakashi
 is still plagued by nightmares of
Rin
's death, leading the young man to become even more sullen and withdrawn. Meeting with the
Konoha Council
 and
Danzō Shimura
,
Hiruzen
 discusses the village's future and his decision to step down as
Hokage
 and allow the next Hokage to usher in a new era for the village.
 At the meeting with the
Fire Daimyō
, Hiruzen rejects Danzō's nomination of
Orochimaru
 to the position in favour of
Minato Namikaze
 who had distinguished himself in the last war. As Danzō and Orochimaru plot their next move, Minato ultimately accepts the post and is installed as the Hokage, much to his wife
Kushina
's joy. As Hokage, he sends Kakashi on a mission to transport a
scroll
, however, the young
jōnin
's trauma affects the mission and he is almost killed by his pursuer.
Might Guy
, however, intervenes and later reports this occurrence to Minato who relates that he was glad he had sent Guy along covertly as well. Meeting Kakashi while he was in the hospital, Minato informs Kakashi that he would like him to enlist in the
Anbu
 under his personal control as his right-hand-man. Heading to the equipment stores for his gear, Kakashi dons his Anbu attire along with his mask, thus beginning his tenure as an Anbu operative.

Trivia

During the
Iwa Council
 meeting, Kitsuchi is mistakenly shown wearing the
Konohagakure
's forehead protector.
