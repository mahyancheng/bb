By placing a
sealing tag
 on an opponent or object, a substantial seal is generated that prevents the article in question from being summoned, as long as the originating tag remains intact. The seal generated will then spread across the target and intersect on the opposite side of where the tag is placed, where it will then knot itself in place, effectively sealing the opponent.
 They can be applied to various mediums such as doors, cloth and even
sand
, as demonstrated by Gaara. These tags can also be linked together to make the effect stronger. They can also be thrown from a great distance by attaching them to
kunai
.
 The tags can be removed if the sealing process is incomplete,
 but once complete, removing the tag seems to be extremely difficult through normal means by anyone who doesn't know how to remove it.

During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Maki, as well as the other
shinobi tasked with sealing
 the
reincarnated shinobi
 using the
Cloth Binding Technique
, used these tags in an effort to ensure that they could not simply be recalled and then re-summoned to the battlefield.
