) is episode 70 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Pakkun
,
Naruto
,
Sakura
 and
Shikamaru
 are in the forest, attempting to catch up to
Sasuke
 as per
Kakashi
's orders. Pakkun notices that there are nine
Oto
-nin following them. To distract the opponent, Pakkun tells them to step on their footprints and jump into the trees (so that it looks like that their prints had stopped) to buy them some time. Knowing an ambush is necessary, Shikamaru volunteers to be the decoy, since his
Shadow Imitation Technique
 is designed to restrain people, while Naruto, Sakura and Pakkun continue their mission. Shikamaru's technique succeeds in stopping eight Oto-nin following them, but Shikamaru quickly remembers Pakkun telling him that there were nine. Realising that the ninth one purposely stayed behind the others in order to prevent a complete ambush, and that his chakra is still limited from his fight with
Temari
, Shikamaru contemplates on his life and seems to accept his upcoming death. However,
Asuma
 arrives to defeat all the enemies without even breaking a sweat, saving Shikamaru. Temari,
Kankurō
, and
Gaara
 are in the forest as well, with Temari noticing that there are more people pursuing them. Meanwhile, the fight between the
Third Hokage
 and the
reincarnated

First
 and
Second Hokage
, controlled by
Orochimaru
, is about to begin.
