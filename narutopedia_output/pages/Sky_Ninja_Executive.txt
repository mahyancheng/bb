Appearance

He had grey-brown eyes, flat brown hair, bushy brown eyebrows, and a mole near his left eye. He wore the standard Sky shinobi outfit complete with
forehead protector
, mask, sandals and
flak jacket
.

Abilities

While little is seen of his abilities, the fact that he was in charge of the many shinobi attacking Konohagakure, points towards outstanding leadership qualities as well as strategic insight. As a Sky shinobi, it also stands to reason that he had good chakra control, being capable of moulding it into mist, which enabled him to fly using the
Winged Mechanical Device
.

Plot Overview

He was first seen in one of the Sky ninja aircraft carrier sailing in the sea, giving the order to launch the assault on Konoha. He was seen later, coming back from the attack, warned by a Sky ninja that a Konoha intruder is in the vicinity and he send a four-man pursuit team after
Sai
. After the small troop was defeated, the captain continued to send troops but Sai easily dispatches them. Once
Shikamaru
's plan reaches its next phase, he and
Kakashi
 show up next to Sai and reveal themselves from hiding. The captain then ordered his men to stop the attack on them and focus on the preparations for another air raid, with the intent of defeating the three Konoha ninja when the army sets out to destroy Konoha once and for all. Unfortunately for the Sky brigade,
Shino
 had snuck on board of their ships, as per Shikamaru's plan, and released his
insects
 to destroy the aircraft carriers and the Sky ninja. The captain was seized with despair and incomprehension as his subordinates panicked and were sent plummeting into the sea. He then saw, to his horror, the insects devouring the ship and causing damage to their structure, and then he was killed by the collapsing ship.
