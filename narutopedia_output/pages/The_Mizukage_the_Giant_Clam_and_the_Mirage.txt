"
The Mizukage, the Giant Clam, and the Mirage
" (
水影と蜃と蜃気楼
,
Mizukage to Ōhamaguri to Shinkirō
) is episode 300 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Before
Gaara
 can completely seal the
Second Mizukage
 and the
Third Raikage
,
they

escape
 and begin ruthlessly attacking the
Fourth Division
. Meanwhile, the battle between
Ōnoki
 and
Mū
 drags on with none being able to get the upper hand on the other using the
Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique
. Mū warns his pupil to call for assistance as the situation did not look good for his aged disciple. As the Mizukage and Raikage reveal their abilities and how to counter them, the Mizukage summons his
Giant Clam
 and the Third Raikage breaks away from him with a group inclusive of
Temari
 follow him. Gaara leaves the sealing of the Mizukage up to the members of his division and opts to go after Mū instead, greatly offending the Mizukage.

During the battle with the Tsuchikage,
Naruto
 arrives and uses his
Planetary Rasengan
, and with Gaara's assistance is able to land a hit on Mū sending the Tsuchikage flying. Ōnoki quickly uses his
Earth Release: Added-Weight Rock Technique
 to weigh Mū down to the point that he cannot move at all, and Gaara subsequently seals him. Gaara immediately questions Naruto as to why he is on the battlefield just as
Shikaku

speaks to them
 and explains why Naruto was there. Gaara asks Naruto if he can handle using the
Nine-Tails
'
chakra
 so easily, and he answers that he doesn't plan to die until becoming the
Hokage
, and  just because Gaara is
Kazekage
 does not give him the right to be patronising.

Mobilising to where the Third Raikage was, the two Kage head over to confront the Second Mizukage. The shinobi there are still struggling to defeat the Second's
Demonic Illusion: Steaming Multistoried Building
, and are attacked by his
Water Balloon Technique
 before Gaara rescues them. However, the oil in the technique keeps weakening his sand as Gaara engages the Second. Elsewhere his
sensory sand
 locates the real Giant Clam which Ōnoki then tries to destroy, but he doesn't have enough chakra to use his
Dust Release
. He instead uses a
weighted

stone fist
 to break the clam's shell thus dispelling the mist. However, Ōnoki strains his back, allowing the Second Mizukage to use his
Water Gun Technique
 to shoot the Tsuchikage before he can escape.

Trivia

The shinobi who insulted the Mizukage's facial hair for the second time bears a striking resemblance to
Kurotsuchi
.
