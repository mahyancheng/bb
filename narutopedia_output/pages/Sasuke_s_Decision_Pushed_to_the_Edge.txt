 anime.

Synopsis

Gaara
, who has partially transformed into
Shukaku
, has dramatically increased his strength and speed, as well as the level of difficulty
Sasuke
 faces fighting him. Sasuke uses his
Chidori
 to slice the Shukaku arm off; however, the sand reassembles his arm. Wounded once more and in pain, Gaara only becomes more determined to kill Sasuke. Unable to use the Chidori on his own anymore, as he can only use it twice per day, Sasuke resorts to using
Fire Release: Phoenix Sage Fire Technique
 along with a
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
, but the attacks do no damage to Gaara. Realising that his Chidori is the only technique in his arsenal capable of taking down Gaara, Sasuke is forced to use his
cursed seal
, which grants him additional chakra, so that he can attack Gaara with another Chidori. However, the Chidori again only manages to destroy the Shukaku arm, which Gaara is able to regenerate using the sand. Sasuke collapses due to the use of the cursed seal, unable to move. As Gaara rushes forward, prepared to kill Sasuke,
Naruto
 arrives, kicking Gaara in the face.
Sakura
 and
Pakkun
 also arrive.
