A
chakra blade
 is a type of weapon that a user can
flow
 their
chakra
 into, giving the weapon additional properties. There have been different types of chakra blades wielded by different ninja.

Variants

Asuma Sarutobi
's style of combat specialises in the use of chakra blades. His are uniquely-designed
trench knives
 worn like
brass knuckles
, with a zigzag-shape blade to give them "teeth". Asuma often uses them to augment his
taijutsu
 skills, enabling him to defeat nine
Oto
-nin in a matter of seconds. The blades are made of a unique metal that can be imbued with the user's
chakra nature
 and can act as an origin of their techniques.
 Asuma most commonly does this for his
Flying Swallow
, where he channels
wind
 chakra into the blades to increase their sharpness and effective length. After Asuma's death,
Shikamaru Nara
 uses the blades for his
Shadow Imitation Shuriken Technique
, where he flows his
yin
 chakra into them so he can have a long-range version of his
Shadow Imitation Technique
.
 In
Konoha Shinden
, Shikamaru gives these blades to Asuma's daughter,
Mirai
, and she uses them in the same way that her father did.

In the anime,
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Sora
 briefly train with Asuma's chakra blades.

In the anime,
Konohamaru Sarutobi
 wields chakra blades with the same design after becoming a
jōnin
.

The
White Light Chakra Sabre
 wielded by
Sakumo
, and later
Kakashi Hatake
, had the ability to absorb chakra and release a white streak of light whenever they swung it.

In the anime, Sora uses
Chakra Enhanced Triple-Bladed Claw
, a type of chakra blade.

In the anime,
Tenten
 owns a chakra blade that's able to cut through
Fū
's
Cocoon
, and in fact it's one of the few ways to overcome the Cocoon's ability to
absorb
 chakra.

In the anime,
Nowaki
 kept a large number of uniquely designed chakra blades that he used to channel his
wind
-natured chakra. These blades were able to create explosions on impact when hitting targets while infused with his
Typhoon Release
-chakra.

Katasuke Tōno
 of
Konohagakure
's
Scientific Ninja Weapons Team
 invents a chakra blade that uses the wielder's chakra to generate a makeshift blade (but has the downside of draining too much chakra too quickly), and allows
Boruto Uzumaki
 to handle a prototype.

Mecha-Naruto
 wielded chakra blades similar to those developed by Katasuke Tōno. They were located inside his head, with the tips of Mecha-Naruto's hair serving as handles. By grabbing his hair, he could pull out the chakra blades and attack with them.

Trivia

In
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower
,
Konohagakure
 is shown to have a
standard chakra blade
 that is used by some shinobi.

Aside from his brief usage of Katasuke’s prototype chakra blade,
Ao
 has a similar weapon in his possession, albeit a two-bladed one, which is hidden within his prosthetic left arm.
