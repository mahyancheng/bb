The
Dakō
 (
蛇行
) is a prototype weapon that was created by
Iō
 of
Konohagakure
. It is a cross-shaped spear that can stretch, contract and bend in various directions. When stretching, it can be launched with enough force to pierce stone and can even change directions mid-attack. The spear's malleability can also aid the wielder in manoeuvring.

Trivia

"Dakō" (
