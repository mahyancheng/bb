The Tsuchikage's hat.



The
Tsuchikage
 (
土影
,
literally meaning:
 Earth Shadow) is the
Kage
 of
Iwagakure
, a title bestowed on the village's leader. The Tsuchikage is generally regarded as the strongest shinobi in the village. There have been four Tsuchikage in the village's history.

Overview

The Tsuchikage position was created after the formation of Iwa by
Ishikawa
, the village's founder, that in anime was the third of the five Kage to emerge.
 The manner in which the Tsuchikage is chosen is not known, but three of the four Tsuchikage are linked by the same family: the First was the grandfather of the
Third
 and the
Fourth
 was the granddaughter of the Third and descendant of the First. Although it is unclear whether the
Second
 was related to the First, he had been his personal bodyguard and the Third's teacher. The Tsuchikage resides in the tallest building in Iwa: a stone building with a cone-shaped roof that bears the kanji for
Tsuchi
 (
土
,
literally meaning:
 Earth).

The Tsuchikage are known for the realisation of true authority, having their shinobi obeying all commands without hesitation.
 Over time, because the governments of the Second and Third Tsuchikage employed unfair tactics such as taking advantage of alliances, even in peacetime, earned the post and its village a bad reputation among other villages.
 It was not until the time of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 and afterwards conflict that the infamy of both position and village would end.
