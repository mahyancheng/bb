"
Under the Starry Sky
" (
星空の下で
,
Hoshizora no Moto de
) is episode 74 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Tsunade
 deploys the
Nijū Shōtai
, twenty teams composed of four ninja each, to deal with and exterminate the
Akatsuki
 members in the
Land of Fire
.
Asuma
 is shocked to find out how
Chiriku
 had been killed and reminisces on their past friendship as two of the
Twelve Guardian Ninja
.
Shikamaru
 is paired with Asuma,
Izumo
 and
Kotetsu
, whereas
Ino
 and
Chōji
 left with
Raidō
 and
Aoba
. All the teams except for Asuma's report to Tsunade that their locations are clear, with no sign of the Akatsuki, prompting Tsunade to wonder where they are.

Meanwhile,
Naruto
 is forced to take a break at night due to the fact that
Yamato
, who has been on standby the entire time, is extremely tired. At home,
Sakura
 looks back fondly at the old photo of
Team 7
 and recalls when she was able to perform the
Tree Climbing Practice
 while Naruto and
Sasuke
 could not, and how the two have surpassed her. At the waterfall, Naruto attempts to sleep, but sees a shooting star and ponders back to the old Team 7 days. Not wanting to take a rest, he gets up and uses his
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 to continue his training. By daytime, much to Yamato's surprise, Naruto manages to use his
chakra
 to cut the flow of the waterfall in two, successfully passing the second stage.
