The user
shapes
 their
Susanoo
 into an armour for
Kurama
, enhancing its defence and preventing its
chakra
 from being
suppressed
. Kurama can wield Susanoo's bladed weaponry as well as combine it with its own
Tailed Beast Balls
 to give the latter cutting power, making them impossible to catch.

Trivia

In adulthood, Sasuke retained the ability to manifest a partial armour similar to the form his Complete Body — Susanoo took after it absorbed the Tailed Beast chakra.

In
Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
,
Merz
 was able to copy this armour of Susanoo with his
artificial Mangekyō Sharingan
 without the need for Kurama. This version instead has dark flames on its back that resemble tails.
