Chōza Akimichi
 (
秋道チョウザ
,
Akimichi Chōza
) is a
jōnin
 of
Konohagakure
 and former teammate of
Shikaku Nara
 and
Inoichi Yamanaka
. Together they were the
previous Ino–Shika–Chō
 trio. He is also the fifteenth head of the
Akimichi clan
 (
秋道15代目当主
,
Akimichi Jūgodaime Tōshu
).

Background

When he became a genin, Chōza was partnered with Shikaku Nara and Inoichi Yamanaka. In the anime during the
Third Shinobi World War
, Chōza became responsible for his own
genin team
, consisting of
Ebisu
,
Genma Shiranui
 and
Might Guy
.
 Nearing the end of the war,
his team
 was assigned to deliver a request for a peace treaty between Konoha and Iwagakure. Anticipating the Iwa shinobi to turn hostile, the meeting was strategically held at the borderline of the Land of Wind, knowing that the
Fourth Kazekage
 would oversee the meeting should a battle break out nearing Suna territory.

A few years later, Chōza learned that Chōji was treated as an outcast because of his weight and that he was being told by other children that the Akimichi were useless ninja. Chōza told him that one day, he would have true friends that would realise that wasn't the true Chōji. Chōza is the head of the Akimichi clan, and was part of an "Ino–Shika–Chō Trio" alongside Shikaku Nara and Inoichi Yamanaka, his name being the Chō part of the group name. At some point in time before Chōji became a genin, he took him to the
Yamanaka, Nara, and Akimichi Clan Memorial
 where he told him about the three clan's special bond and his future as the next head of the Akimichi.

Personality

He is a gentle and caring man with seemingly great wisdom and understanding of the world, and has deep love for his son,
Chōji
. He is not, however, above reprimanding his son for his actions, especially when they put others in danger. This was seen during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 when he told Chōji to take what was happening around him seriously, and as the future head of the Akimichi, he should not act so cowardly.
 Like the rest of his clan, he has a large appetite, and is prone to eating everything a menu's page.

Appearance

Chōza is a tall, plump man with naturally brown hair, but seems to wear a long, spiky red hair-piece. He has purple markings on his cheeks — a common trait in the
Akimichi clan
. He wears a samurai like outfit which entails a black suit completed with armour that has the kanji for "food" (
食
,
shoku
) on it. He also wears a rope belt, hand-guards, and instead of a forehead protector — a
hachimaki
 tied around his head. At some point in time, he also wore a pair of silver, hooped earrings before passing them down to his son. After they were returned to him when Chōji became a chūnin and swore his oath, he has not been seen wearing them.

When he uses the
Multi-Size Technique
 two markings appear under his eyes; these markings disappear when he reverts to his normal size.

Abilities






Chōza and Chōji attacking Pain.



Like his son and the rest of his clan, Chōza uses the special technique that allows him to change calories into chakra. As the leader of his clan, it is highly logical that he is very skilled in all of his clan's secret techniques. He was able to provide assistance to
Kakashi Hatake
 against the
Deva Path
, as well as put the
Asura Path
 out of commission for most of the battle with a single
hit
 after it was paralysed by Kakashi's
Lightning Release: Shadow Clone Technique
. Like most members of his clan, he also wields a
bō
 in battle that has the ability to lengthen in proportion to him when he grows in size, with great proficiency. In the anime, he could use the bō to create a massive whirlwind that is strong enough to not only send dozens of enemies flying, but also Chōza himself while he uses his Multi-Size Technique. While hovering, his shadow covers almost the entire battlefield, which supports the techniques of his comrade Shikaku Nara.

Physical Prowess

Chōza has an incredible amount of physical strength, displayed when he was able to stop
Kinkaku
's
massive tail
,
 as well as stop the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 with his bō, creating an opening for his son to attack it.
 Chōza is also very durable and resistant to pain, using his body to shield his comrades from Asuma's
explosive attack
.

Akimichi Clan Techniques






Chōza using the Multi-Size Technique.



As the head of his clan, he is probably well versed in most, if not all, of his clan's techniques. He has demonstrated skill with the
Multi-Size Technique
 able to stay in this form for an extended period of time without any noticeable strain on him or his chakra reserves and the
Human Bullet Tank
 which he used
alongside
 his son during their battle with Pain.
 He has also used the
Partial Multi-Size Technique
 to crush the
Asura Path
. All of these revolve around the clan's special ability to increase the size of their various body parts.

In the anime, he made his official appearance during the Chūnin Exam Festival, sitting alongside his former team-mates who were talking about the fact that Inoichi had a daughter, and how troublesome that was, according to Shikaku, while Chōza was looking at the menu only to order everything on the page that he was looking at. When Shikamaru came to pick up his father, Chōza invited him to come and eat with them.

He made his next appearance during the end of the Konoha Crush, using the

 to trample some Otogakure Shinobi, and later met up with Inoichi and Shikaku to reunite the original
Ino–Shika–Chō Trio
.

Pain's Assault






Chōza and Chōji enacting Kakashi's strategy.



When
Pain's assault
 on Konoha begins, Chōza forms a team that includes Chōji to scout the village in search of enemies. They are drawn to the site of
Kakashi
's battle with
Pain
. Chōza and Chōji crush the
Asura Path
 as they arrive and then turn their attention to the
Deva Path
. The Deva Path defeats much of the team with its
Shinra Tensei
, but its brief display allows Chōza, Chōji, and Kakashi to discern how its abilities work and formulate an attack plan. Kakashi buries a chain underground while Chōza and Chōji attack it with
Double Human Bullet Tank
, taking hold of the chain as they are flung back to immobilise the Deva Path while Kakashi attacks. The still-active Asura Path blocks his attack, buying enough time for the Deva Path to counter.

In the aftermath, Chōza is apparently killed. A mini-
Katsuyu
 soon latches onto him, allowing
Tsunade
 to monitor him remotely and determine that he is still alive. She tells Chōji this and advises him to take Chōza to the hospital. Chōji stays with Chōza for the remainder of the invasion. He later watches on in disbelief as Kakashi is
revived
, wondering what was happening.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Chōza fighting during the war.



When the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 began, Chōza was placed in the
First Division
 which was sent to the border of the
Land of Lightning
 to defend against an approaching
Akatsuki
 coalition. After using the
Multi-Size Technique
, Chōza engaged a
reincarnated

Asuma Sarutobi
 and
Dan Katō
 — the latter of whom remarks that Chōza had grown since the last time they saw each other. As the battle ensued, Chōza distracted Dan while other members of the Division prepared to trap him in the
Four Violet Flames Formation
.






Chōza stops Kinkaku's tail.



In the middle of his fight with Dan, Chōza was also drawn into other battles occurring on the battlefield. After
Kinkaku

transformed
, Chōza blocked a swing from Kinkaku's extended tail. When Chōji later had difficulty fighting Asuma, Chōza dived in front of Asuma's
Fire Release: Ash Pile Burning
 to protect them. He reminded Chōji of his duty as the next Akimichi head, giving his son the resolve he needed to face his teacher. Chōza then watched with pride as Chōji used the clan's
calorie control
 technique along with the
Butterfly Bullet Bombing
 technique to defeat Asuma.






Chōza and Chōji attack the Demonic Statue.



By nightfall, Dan had been contained and Chōji had defeated the other reincarnated ninja still in play. The apparent victory was short-lived however, as
Tobi
 soon appeared on the battlefield and summoned the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
. Rallying his son to his side, Chōza used the
Super Multi-Size Technique
 and attacked the statue alongside Chōji, but it ultimately defeated them both and he later took cover as the statue rampaged across the battlefield.

After Tobi retreated, he and the rest of the shinobi present stood in circles as per Shikamaru's instructions. This was done until Naruto arrived at their location and differentiated amongst the real shinobi from the
White Zetsu Army

imposters
. When Naruto's
shadow clone
 finally arrives, he thanked him for coming an informed him that headquarters had already told them everything.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

As Chōza continued his conversation with Dan while guarding the barrier, he informed him that
Madara Uchiha
 had been reincarnated as well and that Tsunade — in the capacity of
Hokage
 — and the other
Kage
 were facing him on the battlefield which shocked Dan. Although Chōza praised Tsunade as a Hokage, Dan told Chōza that only
Hashirama
 could ever defeat Madara, and implored him to head out to find the caster of the Impure World Reincarnation technique and stop them instead of guarding the barrier — seeing this as the only way to stop Madara leaving Chōza to wonder whether Madara was really that invincible.

With the Impure World Reincarnation released, Chōza watched in shock as Dan was enveloped in a light of sorts before beginning to deconstruct. As Dan regained dominion over his own movements, Dan requested that Chōza have them remove the barrier, to which Chōza agreed. Realising his intentions when Dan used the
Spirit Transformation Technique
 to take control of his ascending spirit, Chōza implored him to hurry and see
Tsunade
 as his time was limited. After Dan left, Chōza happily explained the mechanisms behind Dan's technique to an awestruck Konoha-nin.

The day after Konoha's
Parent and Child Day
, Chōza was part of a crowd of people who gather outside the
Seventh Hokage
's office. Because he was not able to see his granddaughter,
Chōchō
, at all during the holiday, he requested a "Grandparent and Grandchild Day" so that he'll get to spend time with her; he was joined by
Hiashi Hyūga
, who wanted to spend time with his own grandchildren. The Hokage ultimately approved their request.

Trivia

An early concept of Chōza can be seen in the first chapter of the series. However, in this depiction, he had three
tomoe
 on his armour instead of his clan's obligatory "food" kanji, and he had a piece of rope around his head instead of cloth.

Curiously, in most instances in the anime, the parts of Chōza's hair closer to his ears are depicted as brown in colour while the rest of his hair is red as if he were wearing a headdress.
 In the manga, however, there is no indication of this.

According to the databook(s):

Chōza's hobby is visiting all-you-can-eat shops.

Quotes

(To
Chōji
) "
Chōji, you've got a kinder heart than anyone I know. There will be someone who will see that in you, and become your friend. If you meet him, treat him as your best friend, and become comrades who will trust in each other more than anything else.
"

(To
Ino
) "
Tsunade's return to Konoha utterly saved us. If she hadn't come, Chōji would now be…
"

(To Chōji) "
Don't get soft on me Chōji! You're a 16th generation Akimichi, act like it!
"

(To
Shikamaru
) "
Sorry Chōji's been such a pain to deal with… but that's all over. He's now worthy of being the 16th head of the Akimichi.
"
