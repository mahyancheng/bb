"
Revived Souls
" (
黄泉がえる魂
,
Yomigaeru Tamashii
) is episode 66 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Team Asuma
 recognises the reanimated corpses fighting them as those of the
Kohaku Clan
 as well as the citizens of all the villages attacked by
Furido's 4-Man Team
.
Shikamaru
, meanwhile, is in a meeting with
Tsunade
 and
Shizune
 discussing defensive countermeasures.
Asuma
 tells
Team Ebisu
 to send any
shinobi
 of
chūnin
 rank or higher to the power station, and heads off in that direction. When he arrives there, he finds the reanimated corpses of
Kitane
,
Nauma
,
Tōu
 and
Seito
, the four strongest members of the
Twelve Guardian Ninja
. Unlike the members of the Kohaku clan, these four have been reanimated completely, along with their original personalities and abilities, albeit forced to obey their caster's commands.
Yamato
 and
Sakura
 join Asuma at the power station and Asuma tells them that the four are attempting to use
Limelight
, a technique that causes complete destruction within a contained radius. He tells them that all four of them need to be in north, south, east and west positions and to prevent at least one of them from reaching their direction. In the meantime, he promises to deal with Kitane.

Naruto
 manages to catch up to
Sora
, asking why Sora would try to kill
Tsunade
 and why he is aligned with those who are attacking the village. Sora tells Naruto that he simply wanted to take down Konoha's
Hokage
 due to the fact that he believes it was the
Third Hokage
 who told his son Asuma to kill
Kazuma
, Sora's father. Sora decides to flee once more, but before Naruto can pursue him, he is blocked by
Fūka
, who wishes to pick up where they left off.
Fuen
 traps Sakura, but shows disdain in trapping a female and asks where
Sai
 is;
Fudō
 manages to ensnare Yamato, and after coating himself with his
Rock Armour
, hits the captain with his
Chakra Enhanced Strength
.

On the outskirts of the village, Sora finds Furido, who confirms that Konoha will be burned down for the benefit of the
Land of Fire
, much to Sora's horror.
