This technique is the
wind
-natured upgrade of the
Toad Oil Bullet
 technique, similar in principle to the
Water Release: Water Gun
. It was ad-libbed from Naruto's and Gamatatsu's
Wind Release: Toad Gun
 technique, using toad oil instead of water. Naruto moulds his wind-natured chakra, while Gamatatsu moulds his own chakra into the oil in his mouth. On command Gamatatsu will
expel the oil
 from his mouth, and combine it with the wind chakra that Naruto channels into Gamatatsu's body, creating a powerful and fast stream of toad oil, which spreads to cover a much larger area but maintaining a powerful striking force due to the wind-natured chakra.

This technique sets up for
Gamakichi
's
Fire Release: Flame Bullet
 technique, which combine to produce the
Wind Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet
 technique.
