Basic Power

Here, this is the basic powers that each ninja have and by increasing it, the more powerful your team is.

Life - This is how much of max health your characters are started within each battle.

Attack - Attack is the potential of increasing your Taijutsu damage to your opponents. The attack power you have, the more Taijutsu damage you are dealing.

Defence - Defence is the potential of reducing Taijutsu damage from your opponent and by having more defence, the more damage is reduced.

Ninjutsu - Ninjutsu is the potential of increasing your Ninjutsu damage. The more Ninjutsu damage you have, the more damage you are dealing

Resistance - Resistance is the potential of reducing Ninjutsu damage from your opponent. The more Resistance you have, the more Ninjutsu damage you are reducing.

Additional Power

This is the additional power your ninjas can have

Initiative - Initiative is where which is the one that attacks first in the battle. The more Initiative you have, the more chances of attacking first increase.

Critical Hit/Injury - Injury is how much Critical Hit damage you are dealing. The more Critical Hit power you have, the more damge you are dealing and reducing Critical Hit damage from your opponent.

COMBO Rate - COMBO Rate are the chances you can do a combo to your opponent. The more you have, the better the chances of getting a combo and reduces the chances of your opponent.

Control - Sometimes while attacking and that it can cause additional status, it can sometimes fail whereas the more Control you have the better of succeeding and also reduces the success of your opponent.

Battle System

Here, the game has a simple navigation of controlling Naruto in the game field, triggering an encounter system and subsequently fighting enemies. With the combination of party members and formation in a turn-based battle, Naruto is set.

Chakra

"
Chakra
" exists as the key in a battle and a gauge is displayed at the bottom of the screen during combat, which rises when damage is received. As you accumulate chakra, you will be able to use the skills of each character.
A necessary amount of chakra will be used depending on various skills. Therefore, it's a tactic of deciding whose skills and when to use it that makes the game interesting. For example, for Sakura, a small amount of chakra can heal the entire party. For Rock Lee, a huge amount of chakra is needed to deal great damage to the enemy.

Causes/Chases and Combos

Causes are set in every character in the game which is set as High Float, Low Float, Knockdown, and Repulse. To make a combo, for example, Naruto can attack his opponent and cause Low Float, where Sasuke can go in and chase the Low-Floated and causes Repulse where Sakura goes in and chases the Repulsed causing High Float. By doing so, you will get an indicator of how many hits the combo was. While doing causes, it can also have additional statuses which are:

Immobile - The character cannot move or do anything.

Choas - Same for Immobile, but can also attack their own teammates.

Tag - Reduces the character's Defence and Resistance by 30%.

Ignition - Characters under this status will be suffered by damage at the end of the round.

Paralysis - Characters under this status cannot perform any chases.

Acupuncture - Characters can't use any chakra for their skills.

Slow - Character will be the last to attack at the end of the round.

Sleep - Same for Immobile, but if the character is hit, there may be a chance they will wake up.

Blindness - Character will not be able to attack but can do everything else.

Poison - Same as Ignition, character gets damaged at the end of the round.

High-Combo - Can cause multiple hits to the character.

Cut-In Scenes

The climax of the demo debuts when Gaara summons Shukaku. A cut-in movie will play where Naruto summons Gamabunta. Things get interesting as the giant monsters appear and closes when Naruto manages to stop Gaara. Rich content like movie cut-in scenes are used for this browser game.
