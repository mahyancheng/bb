"
The Man Named Kisame
" (
鬼鮫という男
,
Kisame Toiu Otoko
) is episode 251 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

The after effects of
Guy
's
Daytime Tiger
 are felt through the island; after explaining his technique to
Kisame
, Guy punches him. He brings the subdued Kisame back to land, where
Yamato

restrains
 him so that
Aoba
 can gather intel on the
Akatsuki
. Using his
Psycho Mind Transmission
 technique, Aoba sifts through Kisame's memories.

Back when Kisame was a
Kirigakure

shinobi
, he was instructed by his superior,
Fuguki Suikazan
, who was one of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
, to serve as a bodyguard for Kiri's
Cypher Division
. Fuguki explicitly instructed him to do whatever was necessary to prevent their intelligence and secret codes from being leaked to any enemies. Whilst serving as their guard,
Miru
, a
kunoichi
 from the Cypher Division, asked him to come and eat with the others, while the rest rebuffed him as a cold, callous individual. Shortly after, Kisame sensed the presence of enemies, who were revealed to be the
Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force
, led by
Ibiki Morino
. As Ibiki's team began capturing wounded Kiri-nin alive, Kisame dropped
explosive tags
 near them or impaled them with his sword to kill them, in order to prevent
Konoha
 from gathering intelligence. After being cornered on a cliff, Kisame killed the remaining three, including Miru. With her dying breath, Miru asked why Kisame would do such a thing, and he explained that he had to do what was necessary to prevent an intelligence leak and that killing his comrades was his specialty. Kisame then jumped off the cliff to elude his own capture.

After reporting back to the village, Kisame discovered that Fuguki himself was leaking intelligence to their enemies and killed his own master as a result, as it was his duty to kill fellow Kiri-nin in order to prevent leaks. After killing Fuguki, he took the swordsman's
Samehada
 blade for his own. The murder was witnessed by
Yagura
, the
Mizukage
, who commended him for his efforts. Kisame, however, was wary as he believed that Yagura would simply kill him whenever his usefulness ended and mused that he had no sense of identity and wondered what he could do to achieve peace, instead of being stuck in a cycle of killing and deceit. To his surprise, a
man
 emerged from behind Yagura and offered him the chance to join him as a comrade in order to obtain true peace. Kisame was shocked to see that the man possessed a
Sharingan
, which he had been using to control Yagura. Knowing that the shinobi in front of him must be quite formidable to not only control a
kage
 but also a
jinchūriki
, as Yagura held the
Three-Tails
 within him, Kisame demanded to know who the man was. The man declared himself to be none other than
Madara Uchiha
, and emerged from the shadows in order to show his face and prove it.

Wanting to protect his leader's identity, Kisame bites through his tongue, disrupting Aoba's technique, and proceeds to break out of his wooden restraints. Knowing he is too weak to fight the shinobi before him, Kisame traps himself inside his
Water Prison Technique
 and recalls when he first met
Itachi
 when they were partnered together, and how Itachi told him that a man does not know his true nature until he reaches the end of his life. Realising that he would rather die in order to protect the Akatsuki, Kisame
summons
 three sharks and commits suicide by allowing the sharks to devour him. Naruto and Yamato are shocked, while
Killer B
 confirms via Samehada that it is not a trick and that Kisame has actually died. Remembering
Nagato
 and
Konan
,
Naruto
 states that even in the Akatsuki, shinobi would sacrifice their lives in order to protect their comrades. Guy remarks that it is an honourable thing for a shinobi to do so, and declares he would never forget Kisame so long as he lives.

Guy picks up the scroll containing the intel Kisame had gathered and opens it, only for it to be rigged. Naruto, Yamato, B, Guy, and
Motoi
 are trapped in a water prison containing sharks while one of the sharks grabs the scroll and flees to the ocean, escaping.
