Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
 is the sixth instalment of the
Ultimate Ninja Storm
 series developed by CyberConnect2 and published by Namco-Bandai games for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Steam. It was released in February on the 4th in Japan, 5th in Europe and the 9th in North America. An enhanced edition called "
Road to Boruto
" was released in February 3, 2017 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Steam. A Nintendo Switch port was released on April 24, 2020.

Gameplay

Returning to this game from previous instalments is the "Wall Running" feature where two
shinobi
 are able to fight while climbing the walls of the selected stage. Unlike previous instalments however, where if one player ran up the wall the other player was forced to fight on the wall as well, in this game it is implied that if one character runs up the wall the other character can still fight on the ground.

A new feature was introduced in the game called "Leader Swap", where you can switch out the main on-point character you're fighting as to fight against your opponent with your support characters, which can be cancelled into and out of a large majority of various actions. To add balance, the character switched in will share the same life bar as the main character, as well as still maintaining an Awakening state. As a result of the new feature, support only characters from previous entries in the series have been omitted, albeit Leader Swaps can easily disengage attacks landed on the user which can invalidate offence further if used correctly (essentially allowing skilled users to maintain both offence and defence simultaneously). A new version of Naruto and Sasuke will share a
unique Combination Awakening
 when played together.

The option to select one of the three fighting types from
Storm Revolution
 (Ultimate, Awakening, and Drive) is removed. Just like its other predecessors, the player can use all three types at once during a single and/or team battle.
 Before starting a battle, you are able to choose between multiple jutsus and Ultimate Jutsus to use in battle, a feature that has been in previous entries of the Ultimate Ninja series, but now makes its return.

The game is more realistic than its predecessors where an outfit can be damaged if it is hit and even worn off. Jutsu will have long-term effects on the outfits. For example, if a fireball hits the character, it will remain ignited for a while, but water can reverse that effect. Stage destruction will take place as well in boss battles and free battle, and there will be more details showing particles as they get worn off from an attack.

Other mechanics changed involve:

The ability to cancel into ninja tool throws off of close-range attacks or mid-range attacks no longer being possible, effectively further nerfing projectile-moveset-based characters.

The Body Replacement metre once more recharges slightly faster than in
Generations
,
3
 and
Revolution
, which when combined with Leader Swap effectively allows players to conserve the metre across team members with ease.

The air chakra dash has been severely nerfed in travel speed and startup, making it a mere shell of how it used to work.

Trivia

The opening theme for this game is titled as "
Spiral
" performed by
KANA-BOON
.

A new opening is added in the
Road to Boruto
 expansion/DLC. Interestingly, this new opening lacks the original opening theme completely.

As the manga/anime storyline has ended, this was the last main
Ultimate Ninja Storm
 series game.

After the fight against Kaguya, Yagura and Mū were excluded for unknown reasons when the Kage summoned Team 7, the tailed beasts and Madara Uchiha from Kaguya's dimension.

During the final Naruto Vs. Sasuke fight, the scene where Naruto is in the water is a reference to the opening
Diver
.

After the fight in Valley of the End, Naruto and Sasuke's arms were censored to avoid gore.

During the cutscene where Madara had his right arm severed by the Tailed Beasts'
Tailed Beast Full Charge
, Madara replaces his right arm with the white Zetsu right arm. However, in this game, he still has his original right arm left intact.

During the cutscene when Madara explained the defeat of the Kage, they were not present after the Infinite Tsukuyomi.

During the cutscene when Minato had his arms severed by Obito and then Madara, he still retained his arms in the game.

A unique feature discovered within the competitive scene that débuted in this game known as "Right Stick Moves" (R-Moves for short) allows the user to time the movement of their right thumbstick correctly (frame-perfect even) upon tagging in one of their supports to be able to momentarily control both characters at once before the on-point perspective shifts to the latest tagged-in character. While it was often debated to be a bug, the feature itself was never touched throughout the game's patch history, which often sparked the argument that it was an intentional feature.
