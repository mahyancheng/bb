The user places a hallucinatory darkness on a target's eyesight, causing them to see nothing but black;
Tō no Sho
 likens the sensation to being at the bottom of a deep hole. Because the target cannot see, they are very vulnerable to attack. Although this handicap is dangerous even to the likes of the
Third Hokage
,
 it is not insurmountable, as the Third is able to sense attacks to try to defend himself and smell his attackers in order to stage a counterattack. When the Third finally captures the user and begins
removing their soul
, the darkness disperses, something that
Orochimaru
, an onlooker, immediately notices.
