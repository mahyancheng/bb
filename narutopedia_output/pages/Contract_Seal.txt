When the user implements this
fūinjutsu
 on a summoner, it removes any direct control the summoner has over a summoned creature. Close contact appears to be required for the implementation of the seal.
Minato Namikaze
 used this technique to wrest a
Sharingan
-controlled
Kurama
 from
Tobi
's control. Though the Contract Seal removes the summoner's ability to control its summon, it does not give the user of the fūinjutsu the ability to control the summon in turn. Doing this however, seems to negate the time limit that a controlled summoning creature is in the present place.
