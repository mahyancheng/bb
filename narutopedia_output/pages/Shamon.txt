Shamon
 (
沙門
) was the
Second
Kazekage
 (
二代目風影
,
Nidaime Kazekage
,
literally meaning:
 Second Wind Shadow) of
Sunagakure
. He was the first to research the
jinchūriki
 in an attempt to enhance the power of the village.

Background






The first ever summit of the Kage is convened.



Shamon accompanied the
First Kazekage
 to the first ever Five
Kage Summit
. There, he listened on as the meeting proceeded and later to the other allied villages, as well as
Hashirama Senju
's plea for cooperation between the five hidden villages.

Upon Reto being assassinated, Shamon succeeded him and became Kazekage. During his reign, he focused all his efforts on strengthening Suna's military power through the use of
puppets
 as a replacement for shinobi. Shamon took advantage of the surrounding desert terrain and the village's development of new ninjutsu, and developed a way for shinobi to fight with
multiple partners
. Shamon also researched the
Tailed Beasts
 with the intent of controlling
Shukaku
. As a result of his military expansion, Sunagakure achieved ground breaking advancement.
 Shamon would later be killed at the hands of assassins, a fate that many people considered to stem from the lineage of the Kazekage being cursed.

Personality

Shamon is described as a shinobi who desired improvement.

Appearance






Shamon's statue with ceremonial robes in the Kazekage's Office.



Shamon was a seemingly bald man though he had locks of brown hair at the back of his head. His most distinctive feature was an intricate green dragon-shaped tattoo which was tattooed around the top head, with a black claw covering his right eye. His attire consisted of a dark-coloured kimono held close by a light-coloured sash over which he wore a plain, long-sleeved haori.

At the time of his death, he had aged slightly, gaining visible frown lines at the corners of his mouth.

Abilities

Aside from the fact that he
deployed

puppets
 during battle, very little is known of his skill with them and any other skills he possessed. However, the fact that he was appointed the Second Kazekage indicates he was undoubtedly a powerful shinobi. Even before becoming a Kage, he was presumably skilled enough to accompany the First to the Summit of the
Kage
. Shamon was apparently a very knowledgeable and tactical shinobi, as he was the first Sunagakure shinobi to do research on the jinchūriki.
