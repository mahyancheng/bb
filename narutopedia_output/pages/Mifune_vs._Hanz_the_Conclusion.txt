Summary

Mifune
 reminds
Hanzō
 of what Hanzō had told him during their prior fight as Mifune lay there dying from the poison he received from Hanzō's
kusarigama
 strike. As Mifune laid there dying, Hanzō appreciated his bravery and gave him an antidote for the poison. Reminded of his prior life and in a tremendous demonstration of will, Hanzō places his faith in Mifune and overcoming the talisman that governs him, he commits "
seppuku
" (
切腹
,
literally meaning:
 stomach-cutting) with his broken kusarigama. Piercing the internal venom gland located within his body in the process, an enormous
poisonous
 cloud is released that paralyses the entirety of Hanzō's movements, creating an opening for the
Fifth Division
 to exploit in order to
seal
 him away for the remainder of the
war
.

In the battle between
Asuma
 and his former students,
Shikamaru
 was able to use his
Shadow Imitation Technique
 to herd Asuma close enough to
Chōji
 for him to strike. But as Chōji uses his
Partial Multi-Size Technique
 on his arm to strike at Asuma, he holds back and stops. This gives Asuma the chance to strike Chōji and prepare to use
Wind Release: Dust Cloud Technique
, warning his students to run away.
