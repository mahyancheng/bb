The Five Kage.



Kage
 (
影
,
literally meaning:
 Shadow) is a title reserved for the leader of one of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
'
hidden villages
. They are collectively known as the
Five Kage
 (
五影
,
Gokage
,
literally meaning:
 Five Shadows). A Kage oversees the activities of their village, from sending ninja on
missions
 to making the hard decisions regarding the safety of their people. A village's Kage is generally acknowledged as its most powerful ninja.
 The Kage are renowned as the top
shinobi
 of the continent.

Background

The title was originally created by
Hashirama Senju
 soon after the formation of
Konohagakure
, making him the first Kage to exist after being elected by the population of his village and country. After the creation of the position, other nations praised the innovative system that had been created and soon began to imitate.

Overview

Each village has its own name for its Kage:

The
Hokage
 (
火影
,
literally meaning:
 Fire Shadow) of
Konohagakure
.

The
Kazekage
 (
風影
,
literally meaning:
 Wind Shadow) of
Sunagakure
.

The
Mizukage
 (
水影
,
literally meaning:
 Water Shadow) of
Kirigakure
.

The
Raikage
 (
雷影
,
literally meaning:
 Lightning Shadow) of
Kumogakure
.

The
Tsuchikage
 (
土影
,
literally meaning:
 Earth Shadow) of
Iwagakure
.

As a Kage's primary concern is their village, interaction between the Kage is rare; only during treaty-signing ceremonies or shared public events has a Kage been seen to interact with one of his or her peers. The only time that all five Kage are together is during a
Kage Summit
, which can be convened by any of the five to discuss topics that apply to all of their villages.





The most recent generation of the five Kage.



How a Kage is appointed appears to differ from village to village. In Konoha, the Hokage typically appoints their successor. If the Hokage dies or is otherwise incapacitated before they can choose a successor, the selection falls to the
Land of Fire
's
daimyō
 who is advised by his committee as well as the
village's elders
, the
Jōnin Commander
 and a representative of the
Anbu
. This appointment must then be approved by Konoha's
jōnin
. In Kumo, after the
Third Raikage
 died, his son automatically became
Fourth Raikage
, a decision made many years earlier.
 If a Kage should ever choose to retire they will keep their title for the rest of their life, and can assist the new Kage with decision-making and other responsibilities. A retired Kage can even return to full-time leadership if their successor dies, as the
Third Hokage
 did when the
Fourth Hokage
 gave his life to save Konoha, being unable to find anyone both suitable and willing to take on the title of Fifth Hokage at the time.

Despite a Kage being the most powerful shinobi in their respective village and their importance in leading them to prosperity, they were not immune from criticisation for any controversial decision or birthright, as the
Third Hokage
 was frequently looked down on by his
council
 for being too inclined to negotiations over more forceful measures, and the more prejudiced (and corrupt) members of the
Suna Council
 against
Gaara
 taking the position of Fifth Kazekage. The most extreme example of a village being against a Kage was the despotic
Fourth Mizukage
, who ruled over Kirigakure tyrannically, leading to his subjects demanding him to be executed, and resulting in an unusually high number of shinobi defecting or even tried to assassinate him.

Because
jinchūriki
 were so important to their village, it was a tradition for a jinchūriki to be a relative of the current Kage, both to strengthen the jinchūriki's loyalties to the village and to display the Kage's might.
 For example,
Killer B
 is the adoptive brother of the Fourth Raikage and
Gaara
 is the son of the
Fourth Kazekage
.

Trivia

The
Third Hokage
 was considered to be the strongest of the Five Kage of his time.
 Years later, the
Seventh Hokage
 was also recognised in the same way.

In the anime, the
Village Heads
 of
Amegakure
,
Takigakure
 and
Kusagakure
, are acknowledged as Kage.

Hoshigakure
 has unofficially dubbed each of its leaders the
Hoshikage
 (
星影
,
literally meaning:
 Star Shadow), signifying their ambition for Hoshigakure to be recognised as an equal to the hidden villages of the Five Great Shinobi Nations. Therefore, Hoshikage can be considered as a pseudo-Kage.

In
Jiraiya
's novel
The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi
, the village leader of Shuku is called the Kokage as an obvious homage to the Hokage position.

In the
anime
, according to
Hashirama
, soon after the creation of the title Hokage came the Raikage, Tsuchikage, Mizukage and Kazekage, in that order.

In the anime, despite being Kage, a shinobi maintains their previous ranking. As such, Naruto, admitted that despite being Hokage, he was technically still a
genin
 due to never finishing the
Chūnin Exams
, the circumstances of him training away from the village and having to fight the
Akatsuki
 after returning.

In the years after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
,
Sasuke Uchiha
 dedicated himself to aiding Naruto protect Konohagakure and its inhabitants, eventually coming to be known as the "Supporting Kage".
