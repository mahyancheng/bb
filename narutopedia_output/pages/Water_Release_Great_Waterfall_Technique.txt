A large volume of
water
 is directed from a preexisting source or expelled high into the air from the mouth; to manipulate so much water at once requires a great deal of
chakra
. Once high enough, it cascades down onto the targeted area, resembling a giant waterfall. The force of this waterfall is great enough to hollow out the ground, washing away everything in the area. In the aftermath, whatever remains will appear devastated, as though some sort of natural disaster has just occurred.
