Hamaki Mimura
 (
美村ハマキ
,
Mimura Hamaki
) is a
jōnin
 of
Konohagakure
.

Background

During the
Third Shinobi World War
, Hamaki's battalion was reduced to a mere four shinobi by their
Iwagakure
 opponents; however, when all apparent hope was seemingly lost,
Minato Namikaze
 arrived. He briefed Minato on the situation and then he, and the other three shinobi, subsequently helped Minato wipe out about fifty opposing Iwa-nin by throwing his
Flying Thunder God Kunai
 behind enemy lines.

Appearance

Hamaki has short dark hair and a beard. He wears the standard attire of the Konoha shinobi inclusive of
flak jacket
, and
forehead protector
 that he wears like a bandanna along with a pair of fingerless gloves. He also carries a
tantō
 strapped to his lower back.

Abilities

Hamaki was presumably a very powerful shinobi considering he was one of the final four survivors from fighting an army of fifty Iwa shinobi. The fact that he carries a sword, implies that he is skilled in
kenjutsu
.

Trivia

When translated, Mimura can mean "beautiful village" and Hamaki, when written as 葉巻, means "
cigar
".
