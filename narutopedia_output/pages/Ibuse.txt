Ibuse
 (
イブセ
) was a venomous
salamander
 and
Hanzō
's signature
summon
. He was large enough for his summoner to stand on top of his head and when battling alongside Ibuse, Hanzō was powerful enough to fight, and eventually, overpower all three of the
Sannin
.

Appearance

Ibuse is a giant brown salamander with a lighter coloured underside, and seemingly no eyes.

Background

Ibuse took part in Hanzō's fight with
Jiraiya
,
Orochimaru
 and
Tsunade
.
 He has also fought against
Chiyo
 numerous times, alongside Hanzō.

Abilities

Ibuse was a powerful summon, shown from his participation in combat against several powerful shinobi and emerging unharmed. In the anime, Ibuse has shown a great amount of raw strength, being capable of easily toppling trees with a single leg.

Poison

Ibuse was able to release a
Poison Mist
 from his mouth, which was capable of making the entirety of a victim's body numb just moments after inhalation and may eventually prove fatal, although these effects can be counteracted with the correct antidote.
 The poison must first be generated and then stored for a total of five minutes within Ibuse's body before it can be expelled again.

Ibuse was also capable of concealing himself and navigating underground. He could then resurface beneath Hanzō's enemies and swallow them, trapping them in his mouth until they have succumbed to the fatal effects of the poison.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Ibuse swallows Mifune.



While pursuing the
Surprise Attack Division
, Hanzō summoned Ibuse, who immediately exhaled a large quantity of
poison
 in order to immobilise the fleeing shinobi. Hanzō then leaped off of Ibuse to finish them off but they are saved by a
group
 of
samurai
.
Chiyo
 then divulged to
Kankurō
 and the samurai that Ibuse's poison needed at least five minutes to replenish. Because of this, Hanzō ordered him to hide underground. He later emerged beneath
Mifune
, swallowing him in an attempt to kill the samurai; however, Mifune
slashed
 through Ibuse's head and escaped, presumably killing him in the process.

Trivia

Ibuse is named after the Japanese author
Masuji Ibuse
, who penned the book
Salamander and Other Stories
.

Despite initially portrayed as being green in colour, during Ibuse's later appearance in the anime, he is depicted as being a brown colour.
