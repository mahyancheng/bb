Kabuto
 analyses an opponent's facial expression, movements, and the properties of their
jutsu
 to anticipate where and how he will be attacked.
 He then gathers
chakra
 to the area of his body where the attack will strike,
 preemptively starting medical treatment in order to minimise the damage he'll receive.
 The more extensive the damage, the more chakra it takes to heal; the damage from
Rasengan
 is so great that Kabuto lacks enough chakra to fully recover.
 In addition to needing to correctly read the opponent and react in time, users require great resilience in order to perform the jutsu, traits that only Kabuto possesses.

Trivia

Kabuto stated that it was because of this technique that he is so favoured by
Orochimaru
, as his ability to activate and reproduce cells makes him invaluable for Orochimaru's experiments.

In the anime,
Tsunade
, after having seen Kabuto perform it, took inspiration from this technique to develop a
similar procedure
 which she uses  to increase the survival rate of
Rock Lee
's spinal surgery from 50% to 58%.
