Saiken
 (
犀犬
), more commonly known as the
Six-Tails
 (
六尾
,
Rokubi
), is one of the nine
tailed beasts
. It was last sealed within
Utakata
 of
Kirigakure
.

Background






The young tailed beasts with their creator Hagoromo.



Saiken and the tailed beasts first came into being in the waning days of
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
, who used his
Creation of All Things Technique
 to divide the
Ten-Tails
' chakra into nine separate bodies and giving each a name. Some time after being created, the Sage explained to the young tailed beasts that a link existed between them despite their separation. He also foretold of a day when they would be brought together again - though not as they were - and that at that time someone would emerge to show them what true power is.
 In the anime, before his death, Hagoromo sent Saiken to live in a temple built for the purpose of protecting it in a humid cavernous region.

During the
First Shinobi World War
,
Hashirama Senju
 captured eight of the tailed beasts and sold Saiken and
Isobu
 to Kirigakure at the
Five Kage Summit
, as a sign of friendship and to ensure a balance of power amongst their new villages. The tailed beast would end up being sealed within Utakata decades later. In the anime,
Harusame
 tried and failed to remove Saiken from within his student, intending to save his Utakata from being a living weapon for their village. Utakata, however, having not heard what his master had said to him, later came under the assumption after the incident that his master had tried to kill him. This failed removal resulted in Utakata transforming into Saiken and killing Harusame.

Personality

Though much has not been seen of Saiken's personality, the giant slug uses "ore" (
オレ
) when referring to itself, "ore" being a boastful way of saying "I". It also speaks with a dialect which may possibly be
Ōsakaben
 in origin. In the anime, Saiken also seemed to be kinder and not as self-serving and malicious as most other tailed beasts, as when Utakata asked for its help to save Hotaru it seemed to willingly comply; and later it simply receded back into Utakata without trying to take him over. However, it was not above killing for self-preservation, as seen when it killed
Harusame
 when he attempted to extract it from its jinchūriki. In the anime, it speaks with a high pitched voice and appears to be very energetic.

Appearance






A young Saiken.



Saiken is an enormous white — with a light blueish tint  — bipedal
slug
 with stubby arms, feet and six long tails. It has two prominent optical tentacles (eyes) and hole-like openings as a mouth. Its entire body is covered in a thick, slimy substance.

When seen during the last days of the Sage of Six Paths' life, Saiken was much smaller than its present-day self, but was still much larger than the Sage.

As a
tailed beast
, Saiken has a massive amount of
chakra
 that it can freely
share with others
. It also has powerful healing capacities, able to mend injuries in themselves and others in seconds.
 Likewise, Saiken is effectively immortal, as when it dies, it will eventually revive, albeit in a younger form. Saiken has shown the ability to emit corrosive substances that can instantly disintegrate its target on contact in the form of
liquid
 or
gas
.

Saiken is seen having a great deal of tremendous durability, able to withstand being thrown a great distance by Kurama. Saiken possesses an affinity for
Water Release
. It can expel a
sticky, adhesive substance
 from its mouth, which is capable of trapping its targets. In the anime, it can use
Soap Bubble Ninjutsu
. Like the rest of its kind, Saiken can create a
Tailed Beast Ball
.

Six-Tails Unleashed

Six-Tails Unleashed

In the anime, in an attempt to stop the
Fury
 technique from causing untold destruction, Utakata went into his full Six-Tails form to shield the blast. Later, Utakata was confronted and captured by
Nagato
's
Six Paths of Pain
. Afterwards, Saiken was extracted from Utakata's body, being sealed into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, thus killing the jinchūriki in the process.

Saiken being forced by Tobi to attack Kakashi and Guy.



After Utakata's full transformation into Six-Tails, he attacks
Kakashi
 and
Guy
, emitting a corrosive alkali from its mouth, which Kakashi warned Guy not to touch. After Guy dissipated the gas with his
Morning Peacock
 technique, the Six-Tails prepared to attack him again. After
Son Gokū
 was resealed into the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, Tobi, who was intent on going all-out from that point on, forced Utakata to fully transform into the Six-Tails. The opposing tailed beasts prepared to attack the shinobi, but they were
rebuffed
 by a fully-transformed Naruto.






The tailed beasts and jinchūriki encounter Naruto.



Wasting no time in their attacks, the Six-Tails incapacitated Naruto and
Kurama
 by swallowing the arm, but the slug was slammed into the
Two-Tails
, sending them both flying away. The opposing beasts regrouped and then prepared a collaborative Tailed Beast Ball, which was met by one from Naruto and Kurama. As Naruto entered a deeper plain of the tailed beasts' consciousness, Saiken introduced itself to the young shinobi. Later, as Saiken was freed from the
chakra receiver
, it affirmed Kurama's belief that Naruto was the person the
Sage of the Six Paths
 had spoken about so long ago before being resealed back into the Demonic Statue.

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki






The tailed beasts being freed from Obito.



Saiken appeared alongside with the other tailed beasts with the exception of
Gyūki
 and
Shukaku
 when the
Ten-Tails
 looked down at Naruto. The image of the tailed beasts, along with a silhouette of the
Sage of the Six Paths
, drove the Ten-Tails to a fit as it evolved further. Later on, the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 managed to pull the tailed beasts out of Obito, thereby freeing them, including Saiken. When Madara ran towards the tailed beasts, both Shukaku and
Gaara
 conjured
numerous sand bullets
 and were able to restrain the Uchiha's movements.






The tailed beasts working together to attack Madara.



Using the opportunity to attack, the tailed beasts each took a swing at their opponent, giving sand-manipulating duo an opening to use their
Desert Layered Imperial Funeral Seal
, but Madara managed to escape the sand pyramid with his Susanoo. As Naruto in
Tailed Beast Mode
 pinned Madara down with a tail, Saiken and the other tailed beasts joined in and did the same to increase the damage, but the Uchiha survived their attacks and retreated to a safe distance. After he received his own right Rinnegan eye from a White Zetsu clone, Madara quickly summoned the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path from Obito's body, and used the Rinnegan to
repel
 the tailed beasts. With the tailed beasts stunned, Madara then
chained
 them up and sealed them back into the Demonic Statue.






The tailed beasts reunite with Hagoromo and Naruto.



Later, the chakra Saiken transferred to Naruto earlier, manifested within Naruto's subconscious along with the other tailed beasts to speak with the young jinchūriki and the spirit of Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki. There, they all voiced their shared belief to the Sage that Naruto was the child of prophecy.

The tailed beasts being freed from the Ten-Tails.



After Madara's ambitions were cut short by
Black Zetsu
, who revealed to be the silent manipulator of shinobi history since it was first created by
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
, the black entity used Madara's body as a medium to resurrect its creator. During the battle against the tyrannical princess, Saiken and the other tailed beasts continued to support Naruto by giving him
their combined power
 to overwhelm her. Ultimately, Kaguya was defeated by Naruto and
Sasuke
, who used the
Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei
 to eject all the tailed beasts from her and seal her away inside a newly-created
moon
 within her own
dimension
.

After the spirits of Hagoromo and the past Kage summoned both the tailed beasts and
Team 7
 back to the real world, the tailed beasts began to discuss their plans for the future since they were finally free. Sasuke, however, made his own intentions known: removing as many people as possible who could get in the way of his plans of leading the world through a revolution to do away with current shinobi systems, including killing all the current Kage and tailed beasts. Just as Sasuke swiftly
subdued
 the tailed beasts with his Rinnegan and sealed them within his
Chibaku Tensei
, Naruto reassured the tailed beasts that he would save them once again. After Naruto was able to defeat and reform Sasuke, the two dispelled the Infinite Tsukuyomi and Sasuke released Saiken, along with the other tailed beasts, from their prisons.

Chōmei
, who each refused to accept aid from humans in fear of being captured and used again by them, despite their trust in Naruto.
