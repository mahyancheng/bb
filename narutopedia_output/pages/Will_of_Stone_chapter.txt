Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Ōnoki
 attacks
Madara
 with a giant
rock golem
, which Madara
destroys
, creating several flowers.
Tsunade
 recognises the technique as her grandfather's.
Gaara

suspends
 the Kage above the attack, Ōnoki levitating A. The flowers begin releasing a toxic pollen.
Kabuto
 muses on how people who heard of
Hashirama Senju
's strength consider it a myth, just like the
Sage of the Six Paths
, and that he'll show everyone that this is real.
Dodai
,
Genma
, and
Raidō
 give chase to
Mū
. Having steered the Kage's attention towards the flowers, Madara uses
Susanoo
 to knock them down from behind, throwing them at the flowers, and proceeds to
set the forest ablaze
.
Mei
 tries
putting out the fire
, but collapses due to the pollen, as do the other Kage. Ōnoki thinks back to his youth, talking to the
First Tsuchikage
 about the strong will of Iwa shinobi. Ōnoki musters enough strength to
destroy
 the flowers and injure Madara. The other Kage regain consciousness just in time to see the face formed from the DNA of the
First Hokage
 in Madara's chest. Kabuto gushes on how Orochimaru's experiments are nothing compared to his ultimate trump card. Elsewhere,
Sasuke
 detects someone in the woods nearby. Taking out his sword, he goes to investigate it, only to be shocked at seeing
Itachi
.

Trivia

In this chapter while talking to a young  Ōnoki, Madara is seen with his
Mangekyō Sharingan
. According to the timeline of events which stated that Madara transplanted
Izuna
's eyes before the peace treaty between the Uchiha and Senju and as a result, the founding of the first hidden village, however, he should have already had his
Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan
. This was later corrected in the anime.
