"
The Value of Peace
" (
平和な世界の価値
,
Heiwana Sekai no Kachi
) is chapter 14 of the
Konoha Shinden
 manga.

Summary

Mirai
 defends herself from
Tatsumi
's attacks, but is unwilling to do more out for fear of harming Tatsumi.
Kakashi
 and
Guy
 observe that they could free Tatsumi from
Ryūki
's
Body Controlling Manipulated Blood
 by destroying the doll he holds, but are prevented from doing so themselves by the arrival of more
Jashin
 worshipers. While contemplating what to do, Mirai recalls when she learned how to use
Wind Release
 from
Temari
. She combines those lessons with her
Chakra Blades
 to perform the
Wind Release: Whirlwind Fist
: she creates a gust of wind to harmlessly repel Tatsumi and then strikes Ryūki directly, destroying his doll in the process.

Ryūki struggles to get up, determined to achieve immortality despite his defeat. Mirai questions why he wants to emulate
Hidan
 so badly, to which Ryūki responds by bemoaning the peaceful era they now live in and how inferior they've been rendered relative to their predecessors. Mirai realises that this is similar to her own feelings, as she's frequently wondered what purpose a
shinobi
 can serve in a world without conflict. As Ryūki makes one last attempt to kill Tatsumi, Mirai finds some consolation by striking him down in order to protect her.
