Fūma Shuriken
 (
風魔手裏剣
) are large, four-bladed
projectile weapons
 possessing pre-eminent sharpness and lethality. This type of  shuriken is considered characteristic to the famous
Fūma clan
, after whom they were named and who possibly developed them. However, their use is not limited to this clan. The most commonly used ones can be collapsed for easy storage, leading to its nickname
Shadow Windmill
 (
影風車
,
Kage Fūsha
).

Although a Fūma Shuriken is normally characterised by curved blades, the blades can be of any shape, such as the straight-edged ones which cannot be folded, used by
Mizuki
 and
Obito Uchiha
. Even the giant square-shaped ones utilised by
Toroi
 are classified as Fūma Shuriken.

As
Zabuza Momochi
 and Obito demonstrated, the shuriken can be used in melee combat by spinning the blade in one's hand to slash and stab the opponent directly. In
Sasuke Uchiha
's battle with
Itachi Uchiha
, he showed the ability to rig the four blades to disconnect via pulling a connected
wire
 and have them fire at ninety degrees to one another as a surprise attack, as well as
imbuing
 it with
lightning
 to increase its cutting power.
