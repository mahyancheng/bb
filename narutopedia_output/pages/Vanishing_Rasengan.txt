The
Vanishing Rasengan
 is a
Lightning Release
 version of the
Rasengan
, that was created by
Boruto Uzumaki
, and named by
Sasuke Uchiha
.

Usage

After creating a small Rasengan, Boruto subconsciously adds Lightning Release to it, before throwing it. As it glides, the
nature transformation
 abruptly kicks in,
 resulting in the technique disappearing from sight. This adds an element of surprise to the attack, as an opponent may lower their guard, assuming that the technique has dispersed, only to find themselves struck by the invisible attack. The size of Boruto's Vanishing Rasengan has seen a significant increase after the
Mujina Bandits Arc
, where it was shown to be around the size of a regular Rasengan. With enough chakra added to it, the Rasengan can become
giant
.

In the anime,
Kakashi Hatake
 notes that the invisible nature comes by a loss in offensive power, rendering this technique as incomplete.

Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki
 himself later noted that it is too weak to cause a mortal wound, but is quite painful when it strikes a vital point.

Trivia

In the
Boruto: Naruto the Movie
 novelisation, this technique was stated to use a subconscious application of
Wind Release
 instead of Lightning Release.

In the anime,
Naruto
 was able to throw a standard Rasengan, similar to the main function of this technique.

In various media, when Boruto uses this technique, he simply calls it "Rasengan".

In
Boruto OVA
, this technique was depicted as orange in colour, similarly to how the original Rasengan is sometimes depicted being yellow in the manga when used by Naruto, and orange on one Jump cover.
