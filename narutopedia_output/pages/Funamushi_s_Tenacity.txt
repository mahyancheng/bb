 anime.

Synopsis

Having left the village,
Hebiichigo
 keeps telling herself it was her only choice to survive, insisting she didn't make a mistake. She hears
Buntan
 and
Kyohō
 calling out to her, knowing the route she'd have taken. Buntan is annoyed at the moment she chose to defect, Kyohō knows she feels lonely because they didn't go with her. At the ravine,
Kagura
's group discusses the swordsmen's absence. As their traps are finalised, Kagura has
Team 5
 return to protect the village, while he and
Team 7
 deal with the
Funato
 in the ravine.
Metal Lee
 is saddened by Hebiichigo's betrayal. A Funato scout spots them. Hebiichigo tears her clothes on a branch, and pricks her finger with a needle while mending it. She overhears the Funato scouts talking about discovering Kagura's ambush and
Funamushi
's plan to counter it. She feels conflicted between staying on her way, or returning to warn them about it and risk getting involved in the battle. The Funato forces arrive at the ravine, but their scouts trigger traps early, wasting them. The Funato attack Kagura and Team 7.
 Funamushi receives the report about it, and commands his forces to advance while their enemies are distracted. Hebiichigo arrives just in time to protect Kagura from an attack, having informed Buntan and Kyohō, who arrive with her. Kagura decides they have to defeat Funamushi and retreat while the Funato are disoriented by it. Funamushi grows impatient at how long his forces are taking to advance, and joins the battle himself, becoming elated when he notices Kagura, seeing it as an opportunity for payback over
Seiren
's defeat. He attacks them with a large scale
Water Release
, creating and controlling a waterspout. The attack is blocked by a landslide caused by Team 5, who was notified of the emergency by a
snake
 sent by
Mitsuki
. Hebiichigo is embarrassed when Metal is happy about her return. With the ravine passage blocked, they'll have to face the Funato at the village. A Funato advises Funamushi not to pursue them, as they'll have the advantage at the village with fortified defences, but Funamushi wants to avenge Seiren. At the village, Kagura's group seals every water source so Funamushi can't use his jutsu.
Iwana
 and
Yamame
 offer to help evacuate the villagers. The Funato arrive at the village and attack. Buntan and
Sarada
 attack with
Lightning Release
,
Iwabee
 creates
earth walls
 for Kyohō to hammer at the Funato. Hebiichigo creates wire footing for Metal to stand above the Funato and attack. Disappointed with his soldiers' performance, Funamushi takes two of them and
drains the water of their blood
 for his jutsu, having learned it from
Araumi
. He believes it's worth it to avenge Seiren, who he claims will never stand again. The other Funato
imprison
 Kyohō, Metal, and Iwabee with water, putting them on the way of Funamushi's attack, which destroys parts of the village. Kagura channels his
chakra
 into
Hiramekarei
, enlarging it enough to cut through Funamushi's attack. Having separated himself from it at the last second, Funamushi holds a weakened Kagura hostage, forcing everyone else to drop their weapons. He still
stabs
 Kagura through the chest with a water spike.
