Summary

As
Sasuke
 reaches to attack
Sarada
, she calls out to him as her father, and is disappointed that her father didn't recognise her.
Naruto
 and
Chōchō
 arrive, with Chōchō berating Sarada for going off on her own. Sasuke questions Naruto why he brought children with him, and Sarada explains they tailed Naruto to reach Sasuke. Chōchō wonders if Sasuke is her father. Sarada asks Sasuke if
Sakura
 is her real mother.
Shizune
 informs Sakura about Sarada's findings and intentions. Sarada vents her anger at Sasuke's obliviousness and unwillingness to share information about himself, and leaves the room.
 Chōchō concedes Sasuke is Sarada's father. Naruto recalls a Kage meeting where Sasuke revealed a potential
new enemy
 related to
Kaguya
 and the
White Zetsu Army
, and asked to be allowed to investigate the matter in secrecy. Naruto comforts Sarada, as Sakura makes her way to their location.
Shin's father
 proclaims the rebirth of
Akatsuki
 to
Shin
 and several of his copies, revealing his various
Sharingan
 through his head and left arm. He uses his
creature
 to teleport to Naruto's location. While Chōchō suggests Sasuke to use food to reconnect with Sarada, Sasuke detects their enemies' arrival. Shin and his father attack Sarada and Naruto, who parries the attack. As Shin's father rushes to Naruto, Sasuke joins the fray.
