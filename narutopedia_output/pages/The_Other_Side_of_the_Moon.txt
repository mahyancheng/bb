"
The Other Side of the Moon
" (
月の裏側
,
Tsuki no Uragawa
) is episode 73 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

While on the way to Orochimaru's lab,
Sarada
 warns
Boruto
 that it's guarded by
jōnin
, so they have to be careful not to get caught.
Yamato
 informs
Orochimaru
 of Mitsuki's escape, and tells Orochimaru to inform him if
Mitsuki
 makes contact. At Konoha, the leadership discusses the merits of Naruto's decision to allow Mitsuki into the village and to proceed.
Udon
 informs them that Boruto and Sarada have gone missing. As
Shikadai
 is likely to know how Boruto will act,
Shikamaru
 considers having his team go after them.
Konohamaru
 asks to go, as the missing genin are his responsibility. He is conflicted about Mitsuki, and asks
Naruto
 why he placed him on his team. Naruto wanted Konohamaru to get to know Mitsuki without the possible bias of knowing he's Orochimaru's son getting in the way, but regrets that Konohamaru had to find out like this. Shikamaru doesn't allow him to go.
Inojin
 and
Chōchō
 wonder how Boruto and Sarada came to go after Mitsuki. Shikadai is more concerned with the village turning on them.
Moegi
 arrives and they depart to retrieve Boruto and Sarada. Sarada
disguises
 herself as Mitsuki and draws the jōnin away from Orochimaru's lair, allowing Boruto to slip in unnoticed.
 While looking for Orochimaru, Boruto finds a tank with a Mitsuki clone growing in it.
Suigetsu
 finds him, and Orochimaru introduces himself to Boruto. Orochimaru explains to Boruto that all the Mitsuki are his experiments. He isn't worried about Mitsuki's disappearance, as if anyone discovers Mitsuki's nature as his experiment, a cursed seal in him will activate, self-destructing Mitsuki so the secrets of his research will remain safe. Boruto is disconcerted about what Orochimaru is actually worried about. The jōnin trap Sarada in a
barrier
, but
Karin
 rescues her, tells her Boruto is waiting for her, and transforms into Mitsuki to draw the jōnin away from her. Boruto hands Orochimaru the snake Mitsuki left behind and relays the message it gave him. Orochimaru agrees to further examine the snake. Sarada meets up with Boruto, who asks her if she knew about Mitsuki, having been to that lab before, and shows her the Mitsuki clones. Orochimaru discusses Mitsuki with
Log
. Karin reveals her ruse to Yamato and escapes. Orochimaru informs the genin the snake had no other messages, distressing Boruto, who fixates on Mitsuki. Orochimaru explains it was Mitsuki's decision to go to Konoha, and asks him what he'll do if it's also his decision to leave it. Boruto and Sarada discuss how they've treated Mitsuki. Boruto confirms to Orochimaru he still trusts Mitsuki, so Orochimaru instructs them to take the snake to the
White Snake Sage
 at
Ryūchi Cave
 so they can learn from the snake's own thoughts. Yamato returns to Orochimaru's lab, asking him why he sent Karin. Orochimaru denies it, and also denies that Boruto and Sarada were there when Yamato asks it.
Team Moegi
 intercepts Boruto and Sarada.
