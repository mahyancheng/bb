"
Papa's Youth
" (
パパの青春
,
Papa no Seishun
) is episode 419 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

A young
Guy
 questions his father
Might Duy
 on being optimistic despite criticisms from other people in the village. Duy reiterated that becoming strong is not about winning or defeating enemies, but protecting something precious. Guy continues his training and frequently sees
Kakashi
, which inspires him to challenge. However, Duy disagrees with Guy's proposition on challenging Kakashi and suggests to impose a self-rule. Guy follows and exerts his training just not to challenge Kakashi. After hardworking and perseverance, Guy finally graduates from the
Academy
 and starts accepting missions.
 Guy also notices his father taking lousy, low rank missions. Before departing on a mission, Guy overhears a conversation between his father and a
jōnin
 who seems to be dissatisfied with Duy's performance. He also realises that his father's seemingly under-performance is due to his training on the
Eight Gates
 every night, which Duy passes and trains Guy on using the
forbidden
 jutsu. During a mission,
Guy's team
 encounters the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
. Guy felt nervous from the swordsmen, realising the danger it poses until Duy appears and protects his son while using the Eight Gates. Shifting to present time, Guy finally activates the
eighth gate
. Encloaked in red vapour, Guy advances to
Madara
 to unleash the
Evening Elephant
.
