Konohamaru Sarutobi
 and
Sai Yamanaka
 were brought in by
Akari
 to Shirabe and
Tsuzumi
 in order to ask about Boro's whereabouts. Later when Sai and Konohamaru obtained evidence of the
hoax
 that existed in the cult, Shirabe stepped in and explained to all of the other cult followers about Boro's desire of saving people and why they all continue to follow him and his teachings. Before being disintegrated by
Delta
, he noted that he would continue to wait until Boro appeared again.
