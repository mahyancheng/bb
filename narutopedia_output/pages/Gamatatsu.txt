Gamatatsu
 (
ガマ竜
) is one of the toads that inhabit
Mount Myōboku
. He is also the youngest son of
Gamabunta
 and the younger brother of
Gamakichi
.

Personality

From his first appearance, Gamatatsu has shown that he would choose snacks over someone's life; after Naruto was injured whilst fighting
Kabuto Yakushi
, he asked, "
Hey, Gamakichi, do we have to wait for the kid to croak till we get snacks, 'cause I'm getting hungry.
" However, in the anime, Gamatatsu showed that he does care about Naruto's life, as he was ready to rescue him before his older brother
Gamakichi
 talked him out of it. Though he has a somewhat naive and childish personality, Gamatatsu does sometimes make use of his natural curiosity to help Naruto solve puzzles (like the mystery of the Ghost Warrior in the
Cursed Warrior Extermination Mission
).

Gamatatsu's obsession with snacks is so great that he waited a year since his first summon for the snack he had been promised, even though he still didn't get it. He is always hungry and asking his summoner for snacks, and often gets confused by unusual predicaments, in which he counts on his "
big brother Gamakichi
" to help him with. In the English anime, his voice is jocularly high. He also openly refers to his father
Gamabunta
 as "
daddy
", which the older toad either chooses to ignore or simply doesn't mind.

Gamatatsu seems to lack a sense of danger. When
Orochimaru
 summoned
Manda
, Gamatatsu was too busy saying hello to his father to notice that the giant snake was staring at him. The young toad did not seem frightened in the least until Gamakichi told him to run. However, this fearlessness may also have been due to his titanic and overprotective father's presence, or his lack of a sense of endangerment.

Appearance

Gamatatsu is predominantly yellow in colour with orange marking around his eyes and mouth. He also has two markings curving inwards on his stomach. In Part I, he was small enough to fit on Naruto's head, but in Part II, he has grown big enough to have Naruto stand on his head as well as swallow a full grown person. Like his brother, he sports a blue vest.

Abilities

In the anime, Gamatatsu has shown the ability
spew oil
 from his mouth like most toads which he can use in collaboration with Naruto and his
wind
-based chakra to create the
Wind Release: Toad Oil Bullet
. He can also use this technique with his brother to ignite the substance and create a more
devastating effect
.

Gamatatsu is also able to use
Water Release
 to fire a
blast of water
, which he can use it in collaboration with Naruto's wind-based chakra to create the
Wind Release: Toad Gun
, which is powerful enough to break through Guren's highly durable
crystal labyrinth
.

In the anime, Gamatatsu made a short appearance in the
Land of Birds
 when Gamakichi and Naruto needed him. Despite Naruto thinking he would be useless, Gamatatsu, using his curiosity, found a kite that was a clue about how the
Cursed Warrior
 flew. Later, he went down a dark tunnel with Naruto and Gamakichi, and Naruto was caught by
Sagi
 and his guards. These events have led Naruto to believe that Gamatatsu can sometimes be helpful.

Gamakichi and Gamatatsu as seen in Part II.



In the anime, when Naruto proved incapable of synchronising with
Gamariki
 for combination technique, Naruto decided to summon Gamakichi and Gamatatsu, as he had worked well with them before. Naruto was amazed at how much they had both grown, as they were now bigger than him, which Gamatatsu claimed to be due to all the snacks they had eaten. Naruto then learned that neither Gamatatsu or Gamakichi had mastered
water-based abilities
 like their father, but decided to continue working with them regardless, since Naruto found it more preferable to working with Gamariki.

Deciding to try and learn water-based techniques, Gamatatsu began getting trained by
Gamakichi
 with what appeared to be the basics of water chakra learned from their father. After several failed attempts at using water chakra, which involved using already existing water stored in Gamatatsu's mouth, he finally managed a powerful water blast. Later, when
Team Yamato
 found it impossible to break through
Guren
's crystal barrier via conventional means, Naruto summoned Gamakichi and Gamatatsu to help. Gamatatsu used his newly learned
Wind Release: Toad Gun
 technique to break through Guren's crystal, and subsequently helped rescue
Hinata
. After their job was finished, they returned home.

Naruto would later summon them once again to aid him during the mission, an example of this being when Naruto called the two brothers to aid him in crossing a lake and defending the team who were trying to seal the Three-Tails.

Naruto
.
