"
Blockade the A-Un Gate!
" (
あ・んの門を封鎖せよ!!
,
A-n no Mon o Fūsaseyo!!
) is episode 176 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Namida
 learns to play
Extreme: Shinobi Picture Scrolls
 with
Inojin
.
Tsubaki Kurogane
 asks
Boruto
 about his arm.
Teams 7
,
10
, and
15
 catch up with one another.
Denki
 walks by them, lost in thought, and doesn't hear when they call him. At the
Hokage
's office,
Konohamaru
 and
Mugino
 report to the higher ups, including the
Fifth
 and
Sixth Hokage
. They explain they fought
Victor
 and
Deepa
, who wished to cultivate a new
God Tree
 and eat its chakra fruit. At
Naruto
's request,
Sai
 further investigated Victor's facility, and uncovered research on
symbols
 that match the ones they learned about from
Shojoji
, deducing that Victor and Deepa were members of
Kara
. Sai's investigation also indicates they were aware of Naruto's role in defeating
Momoshiki
, which is classified information. Naruto sent messengers to warn other
Kage
. Victor's employees were unable to shed light into Victor's personal research, where the word "vessel" was consistently mentioned. They are surprised to learn that the
doctor
 responsible for the
Fabrications
 was involved in Victor's project.

Kurotsuchi
 mentions they didn't find his body at the time, and wonders if her
grandfather
 was also involved.
Hanabi
 finds it more likely the doctor used him to acquire experimental data.
Konoha
 leadership is concerned that such a wide-reaching organisation had been unknown so far. When Konohamaru recalls Victor's subordinates who were aware of his plan called themselves Outers, Sai recalls his mission with
Sasuke
 in
Amegakure
, and consider that Kara has remained hidden by using outsider collaborators scattered across the nations. They consider the possibility of spies in the village. They weight the protection of the villagers against their freedom of movement. Denki has Team 7 help him take a balloon to the
Hokage Rock
, where they meet
Metal Lee
 and
Iwabee
 and help set it up. Naruto takes a day to decide whether to blockade the village gates. He learns that nowadays, identity checking isn't as thorough as it used to be due to the high amount of people coming and going.
Kōtarō
 supports restricting movement in and out of the village, citing the
Byakuya Gang
 and the
Mujina Bandits
 as examples. Iwabee and Metal Lee go up in Denki's balloon, drawing Naruto's attention. Denki explains it's an experiment to improve the range of wireless transmissions. Metal loses the instructions Denki gave him, but Iwabee soldiers on. Denki manages to speak with his friend in another village, close to the border. Denki's friends celebrate his success, even if the balloon isn't able to maintain altitude to keep communications working for long. The following day, Naruto decides not to blockade the gates, and instead decides to overhaul the sensing system on the village. Victor reports to
Jigen
, placing blame of the incident on Deepa, and assuring him that none of their secrets were exposed, as he recovered Deepa's body. Jigen considers the God Tree plan foolish. Victor decides to claim Jigen's
vessel
.
