Uruchi Uchiha
 (
うちはウルチ
,
Uchiha Uruchi
) was a citizen of
Konohagakure
 and a member of the
Uchiha clan
.

Background

She and her husband
Teyaki
 were renown as
small bakery
 owners located in the Uchiha compound. She was one of the many people in the Uchiha clan who encouraged
Sasuke
 to be like his big brother,
Itachi
. She and her husband were later killed during the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
.

Appearance

She had black hair, tied in a knot on top of her head. She also had small black eyes. She wore a brown full body dress.

Trivia

The owner of the apartment
Gennō
 rents has a striking resemblance to Uruchi Uchiha.

Sasuke refers to Uruchi and her husband as "aunt" and "uncle". Since it is possible that Sasuke used
aunt
 (
おばさん
,
Obasan
) as a gesture of respect, it is uncertain whether Uruchi was really his aunt.
