Summary

Black Zetsu
 begins telling
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 the tale of
Kaguya
. Ages ago, a meteorite crashed. On the site of impact, a
tree
 grew. Years later, locals near the tree witness a glowing object moving through the sky in the distance. A
young emperor
 commands his soldiers to follow the light. In the morning, his soldiers present him Kaguya, who they explain appeared where the light fell. The emperor asks her name, but she remains silent. The soldiers believe Kaguya to be a spy from another country, and as they move to imprison her, they faint. Kaguya introduces herself to emperor Tenji as the protector of the God Tree.
 Kaguya is given a servant to attend her needs. Tenji meets with representatives from
another country
,
Suzaku
 and
Genbu
, to settle a land dispute over a lake. They mention a recently discovered old document, claiming the lake belongs to them, and mention they've heard of Kaguya. After the meeting, Tenji is sure the document is fake, as the country has done so before against other countries to expand their territory through war. Kaguya spends her nights looking at the sky, longing for peace. The Land of That begins stirring conflict at the border. To ensure no one attacks, Tenji decrees anyone who attacks the Land of That will be executed. When a large army approaches, Tenji goes to the front and instructs Kaguya to go in hiding if he does not return. A spy from the Land of That informs them of Kaguya's moving, and attacks her hiding place. When they move in to capture her, Kaguya effortlessly slaughters them, frightening the soldiers from the Land of That. Kaguya and
Aino
 leave. Suzaku brings a
Land of Ancestors
 witness to the peace negotiations, exposing Kaguya's actions, and demanding that per Tenji's decree, she be executed. Tenji gives the order to kill Kaguya. Kaguya and Aino move to the God Tree, and are attacked by the Land of Ancestors' archers. Kaguya deflects their arrows, but can't keep with their numbers, as she is pregnant. Aino attempts to warn Tenji about Kaguya's pregnancy, but is struck down on the way. Kaguya eats the God Tree's chakra fruit, acquiring the
Rinne Sharingan
, casting the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
, and binding those caught in it in the roots of the God Tree.
