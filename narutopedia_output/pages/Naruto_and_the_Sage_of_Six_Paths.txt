Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Informing the unpurturbed
Naruto
 that his son
Asura
's
will
 was reincarnated into him,
Hagoromo
 also notes that
Sasuke
 had inherited
Indra
's
will
 as well. The Sage goes on to explain how
Hashirama
 and
Madara
 were the previous inheritors and explained how the latter had acquired his
own power
 after integrating Hashirama's cells into himself inadvertently mixing Asura and Indra's chakra.
 Delving deeper, he tells Naruto how his mother
Kaguya
 had wielded such power far exceeding that of any human that people came to fear her as a demon who ruled over them with
two

fearsome

dōjutsu
 — something he saw happening with Madara who was attempting to attain the power of the
Ten-Tails
 to achieve power akin to that of Kaguya and Hagoromo. Stating that for too long he had been a bystander of events, the Sage asks Naruto to stop Madara before calling forth the chakra of the nine
tailed beasts
 which
Obito
 had sealed into the young man.  As the beasts readily awaited the fulfilment of their long-time prophecy, it is revealed that the Sage is also having the same conversation with Sasuke in his subconscious — intent on including Indra in changing the world. Calling for both young men to stretch out their hands, the Sage imparts his power to both of them. Meanwhile on the battlefield a haughty Madara boasts that the
Evening Elephant
 was not enough to take him down while a battered
Guy
 notes that he would have to use the
Night Guy
 after all.
