Keisan Chigai…!!
)

Kimimaro
 takes the coffin containing
Sasuke
 from
Shikamaru
 and
Naruto
. While
Tayuya
 is stunned to see him, the former, dying leader of the
Sound Four
, Kimimaro tells her that he won't kill her if she deals with Shikamaru and Naruto. He leaves to take Sasuke to
Orochimaru
. Naruto and Shikamaru team up against Tayuya, but Naruto only pretends to engage her in battle, instead following Kimimaro and finding him in a field. Orochimaru elsewhere mourns having not been able to take Kimimaro as a
host body
,
his

kekkei genkai
 being most desirable.

Chapter 202

"
Three Wishes!!
" (
三つの願い!!
,
Mittsu no Negai!!
)

When questioned by
Naruto
,
Kimimaro
 explains that
Orochimaru
 wishes to take
Sasuke
's body for himself. Enraged at the prospect, Naruto taps into the
Nine-Tails
'
chakra
 and surrounds Kimimaro with hundreds of
shadow clones
. Meanwhile,
Tayuya
 asks
Shikamaru
 about his practice of sacrificing one of his teammates to defeat one member of the
Sound Four
 just to retrieve Sasuke. Shikamaru regrets that he had to, but explains that they all would have risked their lives for Sasuke, a friend, with or without his orders. As they prepare for battle, Tayuya summons her
Doki
. Elsewhere,
Kiba
 and
Akamaru
 believe they have an advantage of numbers over
Sakon
. They find that Sakon is not alone, his brother
Ukon
 fighting alongside him.

Chapter 203

"
Sakon's Secret
" (
左近の秘密
,
Sakon no Himitsu
)

Naruto
's
shadow clones
 attack, but
Kimimaro
, preparing his
kekkei genkai
, is not concerned. Elsewhere,
Sakon
, with the help of his
cursed seal
, and
Ukon
 overpower
Kiba
. Interested in ending the battle quickly, Ukon advances his cursed seal to its second level and forces Sakon to do the same.
Akamaru
 knows they are outmatched so he convinces Kiba to perform a
joint combination
. Taking on the form of a double-headed wolf, Kiba and Akamaru attack the joined brothers with their
new technique
. Meanwhile,
Shikamaru
 struggles to avoid the
Doki
's attacks, but is able to notice that
Tayuya
 controls them with her
Demonic Flute
.

Chapter 204

"
Ukon's Ability
" (
右近の能力
,
Ukon no Nōryoku
)

Sakon
 and
Ukon
 are split apart because of
Kiba
 and
Akamaru
's attack. They believe they have won, only to find that the brothers easily recover from the separation. They try to attack again, but are blocked. When Sakon and Ukon counter-attack Akamaru puts himself in danger to protect Kiba. While Akamaru manages to blind Sakon at the last minute, Ukon is able to join with Kiba's body. He tells Kiba that he will kill Kiba from the inside, destroying his cells and leaving unfazed once Kiba is dead. Needing to help Akamaru, Kiba stabs himself, taking advantage of the fact that Ukon, merged with him, will suffer the same injuries.

Chapter 205

"
Kiba's Determination!!
" (
キバの決意!!
,
Kiba no Ketsui!!
)

Ukon
 is amazed that
Kiba
 would stab himself just to kill him. As Kiba goes for a killing blow, Ukon exits his body to avoid further damage. Kiba takes this time to gather
Akamaru
 and escape. Ukon, exhausted, rejoins with
Sakon
 and demands that, once Sakon has found Kiba and Akamaru, they kill them together. Meanwhile,
Kimimaro
 is able to destroy wave after wave of
Naruto
's
shadow clones
, his dancing, acrobatic movements and his ability to use his own bones as weapons being more than a match.

Chapter 206

"
Trouble…!!
" (
苦境…!!
,
Kukyō…!!
)

Kimimaro
 continues to keep
Naruto
 away from
Sasuke
's coffin, using his dances and
bones
 to prevent any of Naruto's shadow clones from getting through. Elsewhere, an injured
Kiba
 and an incapacitated
Akamaru
 hide from
Sakon
. When he sees that he is leaving a blood trail, allowing Sakon to follow them, Kiba abandons his coat and flees down river with Akamaru. Meanwhile,
Shikamaru
 is given no opportunities to attack,
Tayuya
's control over her
Doki
 allowing her to cover all possibilities. Playing a new tune on her
Demonic Flute
, Tayuya has the Doki attack.

Chapter 207

"
Playing Without Rook and Bishop
" (
飛車角落ち
,
Hishakakuochi
)

The
Doki
 produce spiritual effigies that can pursue
Shikamaru
 beyond their physical range and through physical matter, all in accordance with the music played by
Tayuya
. Shikamaru falls back and formulates a plan. He starts focusing his attacks on Tayuya, the Doki's controller. Tayuya surrounds herself with the Doki to act as shields against the attacks and retaliate towards the attacks' source. Shikamaru then reveals himself, so Tayuya groups the Doki together and has them attack. Having figured out what every finger arrangement on Tayuya's
Demonic Flute
 causes the Doki to do, Shikamaru knows what to expect, allowing him to capture the Doki with his shadow.

Chapter 208

"
The First Move was a Fake-Out!!
" (
一手目はフェイク!!
,
Itteme wa Feiku!!
)

Having lost control of the
Doki
,
Tayuya
 sends them away to keep
Shikamaru
 from using them against her. She once again does as Shikamaru had planned; not only has she got rid of the Doki, something he could not do, but in doing so she did not notice his shadow approaching her, allowing him to catch her. Tayuya activates level two of her
cursed seal
 to escape his control and traps him in a
genjutsu
. Shikamaru
unsuccessfully
 throws a
kunai
 at her. Tayuya picks up the kunai and approaches him to kill him with it, only to be trapped by his shadow again. Having broken the genjutsu, it was revealed that Shikamaru threw the kunai to Tayuya to trick her into coming close enough that she couldn't overpower his shadow again.

It's been a year since I moved into my current apartment and I just recently realised something... I can see
Mt. Fuji
 from my porch. It took me this long to notice!
