Tazuna
 (
タズナ
) is a master bridge builder from the
Land of Waves
.

Personality

Blunt and sometimes harsh, Tazuna has been described as a diligent man. He is also a drinker. Despite deceiving Konoha into believing the mission was less dangerous that it actually was, Tazuna was willing to guilt-trip the shinobi into carrying it through. Even knowing how risky it was to defy
Gatō
, he was willing to build a bridge that would free his village from his influence and was moved when
his grandson
 also came to defy Gatō.

Appearance

Tazuna is a grey-haired, bespectacled man with a large beard and dark eyes. When first introduced, he wore a sleeveless V-neck shirt with an obi, pants, and a pair of sandals. He also carried a towel around his neck and wore a pointed hat on his head that was unique to the Land of Waves.
 When seen in Part II, Tazuna wore the same attire including of the towel, a habit Inari has started to mimic.

Prologue — Land of Waves






Team 7 protecting Tazuna.



He resolved to build a bridge that would connect the
Land of Waves
 to the mainland to help restore its economic stability, which was against Gatō's interest. He knew that Gatō would try to kill him, but couldn't afford proper protection. It was because of this that Tazuna hired
Team 7
 under the false pretence of protecting him from bandits (this was considered a
C-rank
 mission, thus reducing the cost). Unlike most of his fellow citizens, Tazuna was brave enough to defy Gatō's interests, although he was perfectly aware of the consequences.

During Team 7's stay, Tazuna told about a man who appeared in their lives called "
Kaiza
" highlighting that he and Inari were very close but when Gatō arrived he had him executed, he told them and that's why Inari stopped smiling. The next morning, they found the injured workers standing before them, with Haku and Zabuza standing before them. Tazuna simply watched. When he saw Sakura crying and reciting the ninja code through her tears, Tazuna felt sorry for her. He expressed joy when Inari appeared, leading an entire armed village.

In honour of
Naruto Uzumaki
, and for his example of courage, Tazuna named the bridge the "
Great Naruto Bridge
" after its completion. He tended to overuse the word "super", which was not reflected in the English version of the anime.

Tazuna designed the Tobishachimaru, an airborne ship that would revolutionise the transportation industry. Because of the great fortunes that the Tobishachimaru and similar ships would bring to the Land of Waves, the country's carpenters assisted Tazuna in building it. On the day of the Tobishachimaru's maiden voyage, a team of Konoha-nin led by Kakashi provided security. Tazuna chatted with Kakashi about the ship's capabilities until Kakashi must help a
woman
 aboard. Seeing this, Tazuna spoke to Kakashi about finding a woman of his own and becoming
Hokage
, finding the two commitments to be quite similar.
