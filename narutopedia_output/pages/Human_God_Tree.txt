Human God Trees.



The
Human God Trees
 (
人神樹
,
Hitoshinju
) are an evolved race of
Claw Grime
, humanoid soldiers molded from the flesh of the
Ten-Tails
 and
Code
's
shinjutsu

abilities
 that carried
Isshiki
 and
Shibai
‘s influence.
 They are led by
Jura
, the Ten-Tails's direct incarnation.

History





Hidari's Thornsoul.



When Code was entrusted a Ten-Tails seedling, upon
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
's death, he used his Claw Marks to create
fission beings
 he called Claw Grime. Three years later after the
Omnipotence
 struck the world, what remained of the Ten-Tails became the humanoid
God Tree
, Jura. Similarly, when a person is consumed by a Claw Grime, causing it to become a small tree that encases the victim, a new God Tree will emerge. Unlike the Claw Grimes or a Ten-Tails, these God Trees each taking on unique appearances and personalities. Likewise, they are self-aware with intelligence and desires. Those born of Claw Grimes also inherit the appearance and
chakra
 signature of those that were absorbed by their lesser counterparts. To which, they identify themselves as "
sentient God Trees
" (
自我を持つ神樹
,
jiga o motsu Shinju
), as well as incarnations of a
Tailed Beast
.
 The core of their being is the "
Thornsoul
" (
棘魂
,
Togedama
), which persists even if their bodies are destroyed completely. So long as the core remains, they can be resurrected, provided it is done before the bulb rots; the Thornsoul is also required to restore the devoured individual from the God Trees.

Abilities





Ryū using the Kekkei Genkai of his template, Shinki.



The sentient God Trees wield various abilities including flight, morphing their limbs, immense strength and speed, accelerated healing, and can manipulate their own Claw Marks. They are all considered monsters with power well-above their own creator
Code
.
 Being incarnations of the Ten-Tails, they possess
Rinnegan
 and wield the
Wood Release
 and
Tailed Beast Ball
. Also, they can replicate the same techniques as their chakra templates. However, some attributes may not be inherited. Despite being able to use
Sasuke
's
Chidori
,
Hidari
 cannot properly ultilise the
jutsu
 due to its drawback of diminished perception. This is because he apparently lacks the
Sharingan
, the only known means to bypass the jutsu's weakness, even though he also possesses the Rinnegan, the Sharingan's further evolved stage.
