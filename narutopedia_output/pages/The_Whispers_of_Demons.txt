The Whispers of Demons…?!
" (

,
Akuma no Sasayaki…!?
) is chapter 41 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Naruto
 realises that he can't answer a single one of the nine questions that are given. Although
Sakura
 is able to, she recognises that the exam is far too difficult for the average
genin
. Combining this with the fact that they will not be disqualified until they are caught cheating five times,
Sasuke
 and the other participants (except for Naruto) realise that the true object of the test is to gather information without being caught. As the examinees begin using their abilities to look at others' papers, some are eliminated. Naruto begins to grow worried when
Hinata
, who is sitting next to him, offers to let him copy off her paper.
