Yasaka Magatama
 is a technique that
Susanoo
 users can use from any of its hands. Due to its structure, it acts in a similar manner to that of a
shuriken
 when thrown by Susanoo — rapidly spinning towards the intended target — and results in an explosion upon impact. The size of these projectiles are dependent on the user, with smaller variations often used when fighting in close quarters or confined spaces.

Variants

While all operate in a somewhat similar manner, the technique can assume multiple forms that differ slightly both in appearance and use. These range from:

Three magatama bound together by a single, circular thread that are created either between two of Susanoo's hands or from just one,
 which are then propelled towards the target as a single combined projectile.

A considerable number of magatama strung out between two of Susanoo's hands, using an interconnecting thread. These then detach themselves from one another once propelled towards the target, so that each magatama becomes a separate projectile.

Trivia

Itachi Uchiha
 mentions that the Yasaka Magatama is his strongest long-range technique.

The shape of the single projectile variation of the Yasaka Magatama — three magatama bound together by a single circular line — is reminiscent of the completed form of the
Sharingan
.
