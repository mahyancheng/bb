This technique was created by the
hunter-nin
 of
Kirigakure
 and according to
Ao
, they are the only ones who know how to cancel the technique.
 When a specific part of the user's body is targeted, this technique is automatically activated. The talismans move to cover the specific body part and form a barrier to protect it.

Ao wears these talismans as earrings as a precaution should anyone try and target the
Byakugan
 in his right eye socket. These talismans have the kanji for a humble form of "to hear" (
承
,
shō, uketamawa(ru)
) on both sides.
