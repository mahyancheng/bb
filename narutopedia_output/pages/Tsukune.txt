Tsukune, Sansho, and Mibuna perform some vandalism around the village. When Iruka catches them in the act, they claim to only be playing hide-and-seek, but he tricks them into confessing. Iruka remarks that
Naruto Uzumaki
 was a much bigger delinquent when he was a student, which Tsukune and the others don't believe. Later, after finding out that Naruto once stole the
Scroll of Seals
, Tsukune also steals it. Iruka tracks him to the
Hokage Rock
 with help from Sansho and Mibuna. Recognising that Tsukune just wants attention, Iruka apologises for comparing him to previous students. Tsukune promises to try harder in the future.
