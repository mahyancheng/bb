Zangei
 (
ザンゲイ
) was a bounty exchange master who ran one of the
Land of Fire Bounty Stations
.

Personality

Zangei seems to have an amiable relationship with his frequent client,
Kakuzu
, speaking politely with him, and being honest with their business transactions. He does, however, believe that Kakuzu's partner,
Hidan
, is a hindrance in terms of profits, and speaks his opinions about this regard, something Kakuzu heartily agreed on. Zangei is loyal enough to keep his business confidentiality, as he did not give any information on Akatsuki nor Kakuzu.

Appearance

Zangei is a bald man with black eyes, and a black beard and black eyebrows. He has a big scar above his right eyebrow. He wears a light grey cloak, with black buttons.

Akatsuki Suppression Mission

Akatsuki
 member
Kakuzu
 often used Zangei's station to drop off corpses of the bounties he had collected. Zangei would gladly pay Kakuzu for his services, but noted to Kakuzu about
Hidan
 dragging him down in terms of earning profits, something Kakuzu quite agrees on. Shortly after paying Kakuzu 30,000,000
ryō
 for
Chiriku
, Zangei was captured by
Konohagakure
 and taken in for interrogation by
Ibiki Morino
.
 While he was being interrogated, he refused to give Ibiki any information regarding the Akatsuki or Kakuzu.
