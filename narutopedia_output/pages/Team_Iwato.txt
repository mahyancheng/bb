This was a team from
Yugakure
, tasked with delivering a scroll containing secret data. The village leadership knew about the presence of a traitor among the team, but did not know who it was, so one of the team received a second scroll to confuse the traitors.

Team Minato
 was assigned to protect them, accompanying them on the way, while believing that only
Iwato
 had the scroll, and it was he who was the main object of protection. The traitors are eventually revealed to be
Inagi
 and
Babu
, who killed Iwato who had the empty scroll and find an injured
Shinbu
 who had the required data scroll. Although Inagi managed to obtain it,
Kakashi Hatake
 and
Minato Namikaze
 killed the traitors and their accomplices, returning the scroll to Shinbu, who successfully completed the mission.
