"
Unforgivable! A Total Lack of Respect!
" (
怒りバクハツ!許さねーってばよ
,
Ikari Bakuhatsu! Yurusanēttebayo
) is episode 90 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

While
Tsunade
 was having dinner that night,
Jiraiya
 and
Naruto
 arrived at the same bar. Suspicious of Jiraiya's reason for searching for her, Tsunade asked what he wanted, to which he replied that
Konoha
 wanted her to be the new
Hokage
. He even found out that Tsunade and
Shizune
 had already found out about the Third's death and encountered
Orochimaru
 along the way. She immediately rejected the offer, saying that anyone who would willingly take the title was a fool. Naruto, enraged that she would disrespect the title of Hokage and those who had held its position so bluntly, challenged Tsunade to a battle. The two stepped outside, and it was very clear that the Sannin is more powerful, as Tsunade sent Naruto flying by using only her index finger. Then she asked him what made him care about the Hokage so much. Naruto replies to her that his dream is to be Hokage someday. Tsunade then thought of her two most beloved
Nawaki
 and
Dan
 and their hopes of being Hokage as well. Naruto noticed she had lowered her guard, and unwilling to give up, he readied his imperfect
Rasengan
 for an attack.
