The
Sasori puppet
's
puppeteer
 can shoot fire from the pipes in its hands, making them like
flamethrowers
. The flames are fierce enough to melt rocks and incinerate a metal
kunai
 caught in the blast near-instantly. The ammunition is sealed in the first scroll on its back.
 By shooting with his
water cannons
 onto areas that have been previously heated by  the flamethrowers, Sasori can cause even shatter apart via
thermal shock
, enough to send debris flying with great impact.

During Kankurō's use of Sasori's puppet body, the ammunition scroll is nowhere to be seen, implying that the flamethrowers may be used without it.

Trivia

Shura
's
umbrella
 also has a flamethrower installed within it.

In the
Power arc
, a reincarnated
Iwa
-nin uses a flamethrower device in battle.

When Kankurō fights Sasori and Deidara with Sasori's
puppet body
, he uses the puppet's flamethrower on them. In the anime, however, it is not used.

In the anime, the version of
Sasori
 in
Killer B
's
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 dream is able to use this weapon through
Hiruko
.
