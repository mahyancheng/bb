Summary

As a
Anbu
 tends to
Hinata
,
Neji
 explains the cruel background of the
Hyūga clan
 by first revealing the
cursed seal
 on his forehead. When Hinata, the Hyūga heiress, turned three, Neji received the cursed seal to bind him to a life as her protector. Because Neji had much more natural talent than Hinata, his father,
Hizashi
, also a member of the branch house, came to resent this denial of Neji's potential. Soon afterwards, when
Hiashi
, head of the Hyūga clan and Hinata's father, killed a
Kumogakure
 ninja that tried to kidnap Hinata. Hizashi, Hiashi's twin brother, was given to Kumogakure as a body double to ease relations between Kumo and Konoha. Neji concludes that his father was brought into the world so that he could die for the main branch's benefit.
