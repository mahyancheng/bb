"
A Failure's True Power
" (
落ちこぼれの底力!
,
Ochikobore no Sokojikara!
) is episode 62 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

As the fight progresses,
Naruto
 and
Neji
 argue about the outcome of their match fate being predetermined. After that, Neji strikes down Naruto with several hits, and tells the
examiner
 that he should call the match. After having all his own
chakra
 closed off, Naruto manages to access the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
's. They face off once more, now being able to move fast enough to avoid Neji's attacks. The pair then clash, creating a massive explosion in the arena. As the dust settles, two holes are seen in the ground; Neji crawls up out of the first one. Walking to the second hole, he mocks Naruto, who is lying there seemingly unconscious. It turns out to be a shadow clone and the real Naruto, having dug a hole underground, surprises him with an uppercut from below, hitting Neji right in the jaw. This leaves Neji unable to move, and
Genma
 announces Naruto as the winner of the match.

Trivia

Near the end of the episode, Naruto says he failed the Graduation Exam three times because he couldn't use the
Shadow Clone Technique
 properly when he actually couldn't use the
Clone Technique
. This is a dubbing error. The episode before this even has one of the chunin express surprise and shock at Naruto being able to use the Shadow Clone Technique, as it is a jonin level jutsu.

It is also shown in the latter part that a bird was flying into the daylight, with Neji Hyuga staring deeply at it. It wasn't depicted in the episode, but it may be considered symbolism about Naruto's words to him about destiny and freedom, as well as Neji's remarks about how the branch family being marked with a curse seal is the same as a bird being locked in a cage.
