Sasuke starts off by dashing at his opponent with a
Chidori
 in his hand. As he strikes his opponent, he uses
Shape Transformation
 to extend the Chidori into a lightning spear that impales and hurtles the opponent into the air. Sasuke then increases the potency of the lightning, generating a powerful electric explosion at the end of the spear and sending the opponent back to the ground.

Trivia

Shinsō (
真槍
) means "spear", but when the kanji are read separately, it means "true spear". True means that it's a real spear and not one used for training.
