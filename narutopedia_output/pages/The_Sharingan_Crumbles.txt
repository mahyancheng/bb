 manga.

Summary

Zabuza
 attacks
Kakashi
 before he has a chance to reveal his
Sharingan
. Kakashi blocks the attack but Zabuza is unconcerned, having learned from their previous encounter.
Haku
 had watched their battle and realised that the Sharingan's apparent mind reading abilities were only an illusion. To avoid falling prey to the same trick twice, Zabuza coats the area in a thick mist to reduce visibility and also fights with his eyes closed, both factors making it impossible for the Sharingan to hypnotise him. Kakashi having lost his advantage, Zabuza takes the opportunity to try and kill Tazuna. Kakashi appears before
Tazuna
 at the last second to block the attack.
