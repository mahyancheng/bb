"
A Feeling of Yearning, a Flower Full of Hope
" (
切ない想い　願いを込めた一輪
,
Setsunai Omoi Negai o Kometa Ichirin
) is episode 55 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Jiraiya
 continues to peek at women in bikinis playing in a waterfall while
Naruto
 practises the
Summoning Technique
, although he still can't summon a frog, only managing to summon a tiny tadpole.
Sakura
 sits in her bedroom, still worried about
Sasuke
. Meanwhile, the
Third Hokage
 has a meeting with the
jōnin
 regarding
Hayate Gekkō
's body found near
Kikyō Castle
. They discuss
Orochimaru
's involvement, although the
Hokage
 concludes that they do not have any information regarding to the latter. He also expresses his trust to the
shinobi
 that if their enemies invade
Konohagakure
, they would assemble and fight.

Sakura goes to
Yamanaka Flowers
 to buy flowers for Sasuke, where
Ino
 is in charge of running the shop. After deducing that Sakura is there to buy flowers for Sasuke, Ino decides to visit him as well. Ino picks a rose and Sakura picks two daffodils; one for Sasuke and the other for
Rock Lee
. On their way, they hear
Chōji
 eating loudly. Peeking through an open window, they spot
Asuma Sarutobi
 and
Shikamaru
, who are seated with Choji. In exchange for training with Shikamaru everyday, Asuma has been treating Choji to
barbeque
. In the woods,
Neji
 is shown training with
Tenten
. During his training, Neji collapses after having used too much
chakra
.
Team Kurenai
 trains in the woods too, to prepare for
Shino
's match. Elsewhere, The
Three Sand Siblings
 and
Baki
 secretly discuss their invasion plans.

Meanwhile, Naruto continues to practise his Summoning Technique while Jiraiya peeks at the bikini-clad women. At the hospital, the nurse permits Ino and Sakura only five minutes of visitation due of Sasuke's condition; however, Sasuke and his clothes are missing.
Kakashi
 is undergoing the
Cliff Climbing Practice
, and after nearly falling to his death, activates the
First Gate
. Kakashi uses his increased strength to make it to the top of the rock, only to see Sasuke waiting there for him. Back at the hospital, Lee is also missing from his bed. Sakura spots Lee outside, performing his push-ups. Sakura recalls Ino telling her that Lee's injuries were severe to the point that he would never be a shinobi again. After completing 199 out of 200 push-ups, Lee collapses. Sakura then asks Ino why boys push themselves, to which Ino replies that she does not know. Lee later wakes up in his hospital bed and notices a daffodil, realising that someone had come to visit him earlier.

Back at the waterfall, Jiraiya stops peeking once he realises the girls are gone and are not coming back. He tells Naruto to call it a day, but Naruto protests, using his
Sexy Technique
 to convince Jiraiya to continue training him. On his last attempt, Naruto once again summons a tadpole, much to Jiraiya's irritation. However, Naruto claims that he is improving, as this tadpole possesses legs.
