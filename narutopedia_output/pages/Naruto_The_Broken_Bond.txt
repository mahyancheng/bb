Naruto: The Broken Bond
 is an adventure game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft for the
Xbox 360
.

Gameplay

The Broken Bond
 picks up where
Naruto: Rise of a Ninja
 left off, taking place between episodes 81-135 of the anime. It contains the Return of Itachi, Search for Tsunade, Land of Tea, and the Sasuke Retrieval story arcs. There are 30 playable characters, a new tag-team system and original voice acting and music from the original
Naruto
 anime.

Development

The game was first revealed at the E3 2008 Convention, although work on it had started before the release of the first game. According to team member Masao Kobayashi, the developers wanted to bring something new to the franchise but still keeping the same feel of the anime that the first game had. The art direction of the sequel was definitely one of the biggest factors taken into consideration for the development of this new game.

The environments were a big part of the first game and one of the things they wanted to make sure was that the environments in
The Broken Bond
 would support the exploration factor by being very “rich and dense.”
 The lighting of the game was improved to complement the dynamic story, adding a new casting system, allowing the creation of maps with a more watercolour feel. Unlike the previous game, where the cutscenes were 2D,
The Broken Bond
 now has 3D cinematics. There are also a lot more NPCs. Within the adventure mode, there are now over 70 unique character models.

The developers for
The Broken Bond
 have also decided to keep the multiplayer system like
Rise of a Ninja
, but have improved upon it in several ways. The online format has been overhauled with a new ranking system, the fighting system has been greatly tweaked, and there are now 30 characters to choose from, 28 different characters and 2 bonus variations of Naruto and Sasuke.

Trivia

Although the First and Second Hokage have character models, they are not playable.

The player can fight Might Guy in his dōjō, but he is not playable.

Jiraiya cannot use the Rasengan in battle, but uses it in Story Mode. He uses it when he was teaching Naruto and when he fought off
Gantetsu
 and
Chōseki
 in Tanzaku Town.

Aoi has a character model, but is not playable in VS Mode.

Sasuke has extra costumes in Story Mode (i.e, his hospital costume and his original costume with no
forehead protector
.) but they are not usable in VS Mode.

Sasuke's Chūnin Exams costume is available as DLC.

Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, Kakashi, Shikamaru, Chōji, Kiba, Neji, and Guy have extra costumes in Story Mode (i.e., their funeral costumes) but they are not usable in VS Mode.

The game possesses quite a few glitches and bugs in its animations, as well as inconsistent levels of hitstun across attacks mid-combos/strings (which causes them to not connect with each other well).

This game, along with it's predecessor,
Naruto: Rise of a Ninja
, are not made in Japan, but instead made in Canada.

In both the manga and anime,
Sakon and Ukon
 did not meet Kimimaro while they were with Tayuya, but in the game they did.
