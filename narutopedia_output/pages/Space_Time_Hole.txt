The
Space–Time Hole
 is a
distortion in the space-time continuum
 that creates a negative space, which will swallow everything around it.

Overview

The black hole can only be
summoned
 by a member of the royal family in the
chamber
 where the
Book of Gelel
 describes, by offering a small amount of the member's blood, in order to destroy the
Vein of Gelel
, but the summoner will also die, as nothing that has been sucked into the void has ever come back out alive.

Temujin
, a survivor of the royal family, summoned the Space–Time Hole to seal the Vein of Gelel when
Haido
's defeat accidentally destroyed the key, causing the vein to go out of control. He was ready to accept his death, but
Naruto
 saved him from being sucked in as well by using a chain of
shadow clones
. The vein, along with the bodies of Haido,
Fugai
, and
Kamira
, their ship and the
Book of Gelel
, were all devoured by the black hole.
