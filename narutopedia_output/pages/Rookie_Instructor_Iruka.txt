"
Rookie Instructor Iruka
" (
新米教師イルカ
,
Shinmai Kyōshi Iruka
) is episode 176 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Iruka
 watches happily as
Naruto
 is celebrated by
Konoha
,
Zetsu
, who had been observing
Pain's assault
 from afar, decides to notify
Tobi
 of
Pain
's death. At the same time,
Team Samui
 begin their journey towards Konoha, having been sent on their mission by the
Fourth Raikage
. Iruka notices that most of the village has been destroyed but notices that there is a tree that it still intact, smiling as he fondly remembers when Naruto used to sit on the swing of that very same tree.

In the past, Naruto pulled many pranks on the village, including dumping a bucket of red paint on
Hokage Rock
, all as a plea for attention. Because the other teachers did not want him, the
Third Hokage
 had personally summoned Iruka and asked him to be Naruto's teacher, which he reluctantly accepted. Iruka was warned by another teacher that Naruto was an attention-seeking troublemaker and that the key to dealing with him was to ignore him. During a
ninjutsu
 practise session outside,
Sasuke
 showed his mastery of the
Clone Technique
, which Naruto was unable to execute, thus causing Naruto to view Sasuke as his rival. As the classmates laughed at Naruto's failure, Iruka told them not to laugh at Naruto. While Naruto was initially overjoyed that someone was defending him, Iruka added that no one should pay any attention to Naruto, causing him to be saddened. Later that day, Naruto headed to the forest after class and attempted to master the Clone Technique, to no avail. He then passed by
Ramen Ichiraku
, where
Teuchi
 offered him a free bowl of ramen on the house. The next day, after trying to beat Sasuke's proficiency in using
shuriken
, Naruto overheard two students murmuring that Sasuke's entire
clan
 was
killed
 and that he was the only survivor, which led Naruto to realise that Sasuke is an orphan as well.

Trivia

When Naruto closes his apartment, his keys are in a
Pakkun
 key-chain.

Sakura's childhood bullies
Ami
,
Kasumi
 and
Fuki
 appear in this episode.
