Viz:

Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 55

"
All-Out War…!!
" (
全面戦争!!
,
Zenmen Sensō!!
)

Sasuke
 is still unconscious and sees himself young, wishing he had been stronger when his clan was massacred.
Chōji
 doesn't want to fight
Team Dosu
, but changes his mind when he's called fat.
Ino
 tells
Sakura
 to keep a watch on
Naruto
 and Sasuke. Chōji charges at
Zaku
, who fails to damage him.
Dosu
 tries to intervene but is immobilised by
Shikamaru
. Ino takes over
Kin
 and threatens to kill her unless her teammates surrender their scroll and leave. Zaku attacks Ino in Kin's body, injuring her. He announces that they're not there to take the exam. Shikamaru's technique ends just as
Neji
 and
Tenten
 arrive. Neji says Dosu will pay for knocking out their teammate, but then notes he won't have to. Sasuke awakes, with the
cursed seal
 on his body and asks Sakura who hurt her. Zaku says he did.

Chapter 56

"
The Power Granted…!!
" (
与えられし力…!!
,
Ataerareshi Chikara…!!
)

Sakura
 notes the
Cursed Seal
 on
Sasuke
's body. Sasuke says he feels great, and that he understands that he's an avenger, so he must gain power at whatever cost. He turns his attention to
Team Dosu
.
Shikamaru
 gets apprehensive and rushes
Ino
 to leave
Kin
's body, which she does.
Dosu
 is scared by Sasuke's chakra, but
Zaku
 ignores it and attacks Sasuke. He thinks he landed a hit, but Sasuke is behind him, hitting him hard with one arm. Dosu notes to himself how fast Sasuke was, especially since he carried
Naruto
 and Sakura. Sasuke attacks with a Fire Release technique, which Zaku defends against, but is hit by the shuriken hidden inside the flames. Sasuke reaches Zaku and breaks his arms. Ino notes that Sasuke's chakra is very different from when they were at the
Academy
. Sakura remembers
Orochimaru
's words. When Sasuke turns to face Dosu, Sakura stops him, thinking he's not acting like himself. The Cursed Seal of Heaven recedes, and Sasuke falls tired. Dosu surrenders his team's scroll, saying Sasuke is strong. He says he'll retreat for the time being, needing to find something out, but if they should cross paths again, he won't back down. He picks up Zaku and Kin, and Sakura asks about Orochimaru and his intentions with Sasuke. Dosu says he doesn't know, wondering as well.
Neji
 ponders about Sasuke's abnormal chakra.

Chapter 57

"
Ten Hours Earlier
" (
10時間前
,
Jūjikan Mae
)

Naruto
 finally wakes up. Believing that
Orochimaru
 is still around, he warns everyone to hide, but is surprised to find that, not only is Orochimaru gone, but that the members of
Team 10
 and
Team Guy
 are here and that
Sakura
 has cut her hair.
Ino
 offers to even out Sakura's hair and everyone rests from the encounter with
Team Dosu
. Meanwhile,
Anko
 returns to the building in the centre of the
Forest of Death
 to report on her failure to apprehend Orochimaru. Before she can speak with the
Third Hokage
 on the matter, one of her assistants brings her a security tape from ten hours earlier: a
genin

team
 that completed the second phase in only ninety-seven minutes.

Chapter 58

"
Eyewitnesses…!!
" (
目撃者…!!
,
Mokugekisha…!!
)

Anko
 observes that, in addition to completing the
second phase
  in only ninety-seven minutes,
Gaara
 did so without even getting a speck of dust on him, something that would be almost impossible for even veteran ninja. Ten hours earlier,
Team 8
 had already acquired their second scroll and was proceeding to the second phase's ending destination. Along the way they came across
Team Shigure
 facing off with the
Three Sand Siblings
. Despite not knowing if each other had the scroll they needed,
Shigure
 attacked Gaara, but Gaara's
Shield of Sand
 protected him from any injury.

Chapter 59

"
The Tragedy of Suna!!
" (
砂の惨劇!!
,
Suna no Sangeki!!
)

Shigure
's attack was unable to penetrate
Gaara
's
Shield of Sand
, which
Kiba
 noted smelled of blood. Gaara proceeded to capture Shigure and crush him to death, using one of Shigure's umbrellas to prevent any blood from getting on him. Shigure's teammates forfeited their scroll in exchange for their own lives, but Gaara killed them in the same way that he killed Shigure. His blood-lust still not satisfied, Gaara attempted to kill the hiding
Team 8
 too, but was convinced to spare them by his siblings. Team 8 considers themselves fortunate to have survived an encounter with Gaara.

Chapter 60

"
Last Chance…!!
" (
ラストチャンス…!!
,
Rasuto Chansu…!!
)

Four days after the second phase of the
Chūnin Exams
 began,
Team 7
 has recovered from their battles with
Orochimaru
 and
Team Dosu
. With the phase almost over and the team still in need of a second
scroll
,
Naruto
 considers opening the scroll they already have so that they can forge a second. He is stopped by
Kabuto
, who, having taken part in the exams several times before, warns that anyone that opens the scroll before the second phase is over is rendered unconscious. Naruto thanks him for intervening. Having been separated from his
team
, Kabuto begins to leave to go and find them when
Sasuke
 asks to fight him.

Chapter 61

"
The Path That Should Be Followed…!!
" (
進むべき道…!!
,
Susumubeki Michi…!!
)

Because they needed another scroll, and because
Kabuto
 was alone,
Sasuke
 believes that defeating him would be their best chance to finish the second phase. Since Sasuke paid him a courtesy by explaining this instead of outright attacking him, Kabuto offers an alternative. He explains that other teams that are just now finishing are heading for the building in the centre of the
Forest of Death
 with a false sense of security and tired after four days in the forest. Thus, if
Sasuke and his team
 waits near the building, they may be able to take a scroll from one of the opposing teams. Kabuto then accompanies them to the building but finds that they are trapped in a
genjutsu
, victims of another team with the same idea.

Chapter 62

"
Trapped Rats…!!
" (
袋のネズミ…!!
,
Fukuro no Nezumi…!!
)

Team Oboro
 surrounds
Team 7
 and
Kabuto
 with their
mist clones
. Although the clones are apparently able to attack their enemies, all counter-attacks pass through them. With his
Sharingan
,
Sasuke
 realises that the clones are only an illusion and thus are not actually able to attack, the hiding members of Team Oboro merely synchronising their own attacks with that of the clones. Intending to make this a battle of clones,
Naruto
 creates a group of
shadow clones
 that fight the mist clones through out the night. Later that morning, when Team 7 and Kabuto appear exhausted, Team Oboro reveals themselves so that they can take a scroll. The real Sasuke,
Sakura
, and Kabuto then confront them, having switched places with disguised shadow clones during the night so that they could rest.

Chapter 63

"
One More Face
" (
もう一つの顔
,
Mō Hitotsu no Kao
)

Surrounded,
Team Oboro
 creates
haze clones
 to try and avoid attack. While
Team 7
 is preoccupied with determining where the real members of Team Oboro are, Team Oboro tries to finish them off.
Kabuto
 is badly injured while protecting
Naruto
, but he creates an opening for Naruto to defeat Team Oboro. Team 7 takes the scroll they need and goes to the exam destination point. Kabuto regroups with his team and they part ways, Team 7 entering the building through a different door. Kabuto's team reports to
Orochimaru
 on
Sasuke
's development and Kabuto effortlessly heals his injuries. Team 7, having passed, are instructed to finally open their two scrolls.

Author's Note

“

This volume of
Naruto
 is apparently the first to be created entirely digitally. My guess is that in the future, manga production will continue to move further and further into this kind of production and away from the more traditional methods.
Both the backgrounds and the characters themselves are created in software as polygons, and once the initial design and programming is done, any imaginable composition is possible. For action sequences, we use motion capture to create and manipulate the coolest poses we can come up with. It's all done on the computer, without using any paper or ink. Our methods will probably continue to change as the technology evolves... but there's one thing that will never change: the need to invent good stories!
