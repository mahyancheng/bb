Omnipotence
 (

Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 manga.

Chapter 76

"
A Girls' Sanctuary
" (
女子の聖域
,
Joshi no Seiiki
)

Boruto
 is confused by the visions.
Momoshiki
 notes that Boruto saw fragments of the same thing he saw. Recalling Momoshiki's previous words, he wonders if they're visions of the future.
Amado
 confirms what
Naruto
 understood from his goal.
Shikamaru
 asks
Ada
 about
Akebi
's personality, and if she might be hostile to
Konoha
. Ada finds it a strange question, but confirms she seemed normal, and not at all like
Delta
. Amado says he's not even a shinobi, and has no world-toppling goals. Shikamaru finds it anti-climatic, but understands as a parent. Since it doesn't endanger Konoha, Naruto won't interfere in matters between
Kawaki
 and Amado, but asks why Amado said nothing about it before. Amado answers that it was none of their business, and there was nothing they could do to help. He wanted to push things carefully because Kawaki hates
Kāma
. Kawaki confirms this, having wanted to get rid of it because he considered Kāma as the source of all that happened to him, but he now understands the
Ōtsutsuki
 who embedded it into him are the ones to blame. They wouldn't also have threatened Naruto's life. He asks Amado if the process would turn Akebi into an Ōtsutsuki.
 He confesses he doesn't know, and exhausted, considers it his last resort. Ada says she's tired and asks to call it a day. They agree, and she says they'll talk again tomorrow. At night, Boruto thinks about Momoshiki's warning again. The next day, during a meal, Boruto asks why Ada picked Kawaki if he's also an eligible Ōtsutsuki.
Daemon
 teases Boruto, who has to control himself not to trigger Daemon's
ability
. Ada explains she finds Boruto too young for her, Daemon further teasing him. Kawaki asks her about using
Code
 and his partnership to get close to him, understanding that Code didn't go after him in deference to her. He deduces that she sold Boruto out to Code for the agreement. Ada blushes through it all, elated that Kawaki used her name. Daemon gives him a backhanded compliment on his intelligence. Kawaki thinks all those who want things from him are scum, Daemon threatens to attack him, and Boruto thinks his is the worst situation. Ada slams her hands on the table, and declares there aren't enough girls, so she can't express herself properly. She checks with the
Senrigan
, and asks for
Sarada
 and
Sumire
 to join them. Sarada prepares to go, and
Konohamaru
 advises
Mitsuki
 against joining, pointing out how he was strongly affected by Ada's entrancing. Delta tries to join, but Sumire threatens to shut her down again.
Shikadai
 offers to join over his earlier resistance, having gotten permission from his father. When they meet, Shikadai is affected, and Ada asks him to go home. Sarada deduces that his earlier resistance was on account of not seeing her face well. Sarada notices Sumire uneasiness when Ada welcomes them and invites them to talk away from the boys. Boruto watches them from a distance as Daemon and Kawaki trade insults. Ada tells the girls how Kawaki makes her feel. Sarada finds her focus on love stupid, and lies that everyone must feel it when Ada asks her opinion. Sumire asks Ada what she likes about Kawaki, and she answers she doesn't quite know, beyond not being affected by her ability. Through the
mind link
, Sumire asks Sarada not to react, and asks if she's not affected by Ada's entrancing. Looking past the tension, Sarada notices she's not, Sumire adding that she's not affected either, and they wonder why. She warns Sarada not to let Ada realise this, as their immunity means they can attack her, telling her to act as if affected. Ada asks Sarada her opinion about Boruto, and she passes off the hesitation as symptoms of the entrancing. Ada resents her ability even robbing her the possibility of real friends. Sumire contacts Shikamaru, informing him of their discovery. Boruto defeats Daemon in video games. Shikamaru tells Sumire not to let Daemon realise it either, and advises against informing Boruto and Kawaki, making it harder to leak accidentally. Sarada attempts to befriend Ada. If Konoha ever decides that Ada is an enemy, Shikamaru points out they might be necessary to take her down. Boruto hears Momoshiki's thoughts realising the identity of Ada's entrancing ability. Momoshiki refuses to share when Boruto asks for details. Kawaki realises from Boruto's expression that he's communicating with Momoshiki, and addresses Momoshiki himself, telling him to come out.

Chapter 77

"
Time Drawing Near
" (
迫る時
,
Semaru Toki
)

Boruto
 tries acting like
Momoshiki
 isn't around, but
Kawaki
 continues telling to come out. The commotion draws
Sarada
's and
Sumire
's attention, Sumire recalling their conversation from when he killed Boruto. Sarada stresses there should be no infighting during a
mission
, which Kawaki counters that
Ōtsutsuki
 don't care about their mission.
Daemon
 agrees while
Ada
 observes.
Shikamaru
 tells him to stand down. Kawaki assures them his gut is telling him that Momoshiki is up to something. Shikamaru tells him to recall
Naruto
's face when he saw Boruto dead, and consider what he actually needs to do. Kawaki lets go of Boruto and leaves for an errand. Shikamaru orders the
sensors
 to keep track of Kawaki, but he
erases
 his chakra signature. Boruto asks
Mitsuki
 which way Kawaki went, but he saw nothing, Boruto deducing Kawaki
shrank
 himself. Ada decides to go out as well. Shikamaru asks if Boruto can sense Kawaki like he did before. Boruto can sense Kawaki's presence, but can't pinpoint his location.
Konohamaru
 warns Mitsuki against looking for Ada. Ada is unbothered by Kawaki's departure, and asks the girls to go with her.
 She warns Boruto she doesn't want to butt heads. Boruto checks with Shikamaru, who relents and instructs Boruto to accompany her while he and the sensors try looking for Kawaki. In
Kara's Dimension
,
Bug
 drinks, uneasy about
Code
's
Claw Grime
, and regrets learning Code has created over a thousand of them. Code wishes he could launch a surprise attack on
Konoha
, but Ada being there means he has no element of surprise. Ada notifies Shikamaru of the Claw Grime, and explains Code's resentment of Kawaki, why he targets the things Kawaki loves. Ada can't decide on which clothes to buy, Sumire and Sarada agreeing she looks good in everything. Boruto feels out of place waiting on them, and Daemon teases him, finding everyone weak. He asks if there are any strong fighters, and upon feeling something, rushes outside to find
Himawari
, asking who she is. Boruto pulls him off of Himawari, who explains she's buying bread and tea their mother likes. Daemon moves to attack Himawari, but stops, confused when she braces for impact instead of dodging. Boruto explains Himawari isn't even a shinobi, and doesn't know how to fight, which leaves Daemon puzzled by the intensity he felt from her. Boruto concedes that Himawari is scary when she snaps, and immediately disapproves when he thinks Daemon has a crush on her. A
sensor
 keeps watch over Naruto's home while he and
Hinata
 prepare for dinner. Hinata wishes Boruto and Kawaki could join them, and asks how long their mission will take. Naruto think it'll be a while, as they're all stubborn, problem children. Kawaki appears, and asks them not to alert the lookouts. He wants to talk to Naruto. He reiterates how much Naruto has changed him, and how much Naruto means to him. His world revolves around Naruto, but he thinks the world is crap because of the Ōtsutsuki, and good people like Naruto are the first to die because of them. Naruto thinks it's
shinobi
's job to deal with these threats, but Kawaki disagrees, thinking they're just the first to die. Not wanting Naruto to die, Kawaki has decided to use his Ōtsutsuki powers to destroy every last Ōtsutsuki, and came here to properly inform Naruto. He confesses he felt guilty over failing to kill Boruto. Hinata slaps him, accusing him of being insane for thinking that, and he concedes only someone insane would kill their brother. He assures them he's calm and thinking straight, and that since they would never be able to do it, he'll do it even if he has to bear their hate. Naruto says Kawaki would have to kill him before killing Boruto, and asks if he could still do it. He says he's not asking them to understand, and sends them away with a
rift
. They're welcome to kill him after he's done.

Chapter 78

"
Super Idiot
" (
大馬鹿野郎
,
Ōbaka Yarō
)

Shikamaru
 is notified that
Naruto
's and
Hinata
's
chakra
 vanished, and he wonders if
Code
 is involved. One of the investigators mentioned that for a moment,
Kawaki
's chakra signature was registered.
Himawari
 arrives home to find it being investigated.
Boruto
 wonders why Kawaki would do it. Shikamaru asks
Ada
 to
verify
 it, and she confirms Kawaki was responsible, but can't track him while he's shrunk down. Boruto leaves to search for Kawaki. Ada reviews Kawaki's conversation with Naruto, and announces Kawaki might be trying to kill Boruto again.
Sarada
 is shocked to learn that Kawaki killed Boruto before, having thought it was Code. Shikamaru explains to her that Boruto asked for it to protect them from
Momoshiki
, likely the same reason he might try again.
Sumire
 tries to stop her, and Shikamaru warns her that Kawaki can't be reasoned with as he's too unstable. Sarada is frustrated that she only learned Boruto was killed after he was resurrected, unaware he was even in danger. She feels she can't do nothing when she does know, and leaves against Shikamaru's orders. Kawaki intercepts Boruto on his way home on the
Hokage Rock
, trying to send him away as well. Boruto stops it with his
Kāma
.
 He returns to normal size and explains where he sent Naruto and Hinata away with
Daikokuten
, the dimension they're in frozen in time, so they won't die or starve. Kawaki attacks Boruto with the
cubes
 and his
transformed arm
. Boruto tries reasoning with him, but Kawaki is focused on killing him over being an
Ōtsutsuki
. The two continue fighting.
Sai
 updates
Amado
 on the developments,
Sukunahikona
 making it difficult to pin him down, and that Kawaki's noncooperation might require use of extreme measures. Sarada arrives and attacks Kawaki, who absorbs her
Fire Release
. He tells her not to interfere, and Boruto wants her to run. Sarada thinks it's all reason for her to stay, as a shinobi who aims to become
Hokage
. Kawaki thinks shinobi are truly fated to die early and slashes at her. Boruto jumps in front of it, protecting her, but gets his right eye slashed. He wants her to move aside.
Mitsuki

extends his arm
, holding Kawaki's, and Shikamaru
paralyses
 him with his shadow, which prevents Kawaki from shrinking. Mitsuki blocks Kawaki's arm so he can't absorb jutsu with his Kāma.
Sasuke
 holds a
sword
 to Kawaki's neck, warning him against resisting.
Konohamaru
 helps Boruto. Shikamaru asks what Kawaki did to Naruto and Hinata. He says what he had to do for their sake and
Konoha
's. They can't reach an understanding. Momoshiki manifests through Boruto, and absorbs Shikamaru's jutsu, freeing Kawaki to shrink away from Mitsuki. Momoshiki tells Kawaki he can't afford himself to be taken in if he wants to kill Momoshiki. Kawaki is confused by Momoshiki's assistance, who urges him not to waste the opportunity. He shrinks again in time to evade Mitsuki. Shikamaru reasons that Kawaki's extensive shrinking will take a toll on his chakra, and they should strike when he's recovering, ordering the shinobi to look for him. Sasuke wonders why Momoshiki would help Kawaki, who wants him dead. Boruto returns, and Sarada blames herself for his eye. Boruto blames Kawaki, which Mitsuki agrees with. Boruto sees Momoshiki, who tells him he lost one of his blue eyes already, adding that the ending has begun, and can no longer be stopped.

Chapter 79

"
Omnipotence
" (
全能
,
Zennō
)

Boruto
 demands an explanation from
Momoshiki
, but he doesn't elaborate.
Shikamaru
 leads the hunt for
Kawaki
, instructing the sensors to stay sharp for the moment Kawaki exhausts himself and his chakra signature returns.
Team 10
 wants to search for Kawaki before
Moegi
 stops them.
Konohamaru
 orders
Sarada
 and
Mitsuki
 to take Boruto to the hospital while he and
Sasuke
 join the search for Kawaki. After they leave, Mitsuki abandons Sarada to join the search. She recalls Mitsuki's words about what he'd do if someone tried killing Boruto. Boruto tells her not to leave Mitsuki alone as he has lost his cool, making him dangerous. Sarada goes after him. Kawaki no longer has enough chakra to maintain
Sukunahikona
, returning to normal size near a search party.
Ada
 finds him with the
Senrigan
, and flies away after him, leaving
Daemon
 and
Sumire
 behind.
Amado
 contacts Shikamaru, asking him not to kill Kawaki, revealing he can issue a shutdown command, like with
Delta
. Shikamaru admonishes him for still keeping secrets from them, and while sympathetic to Amado's need of Kawaki for
Akebi
, remains firm about considering Kawaki an enemy to be eliminate if he doesn't surrender completely, further distressing Amado.
 Ada finds Kawaki, telling him she's on his side. He complains that by being unable to
erase her presence
, she's broadcasting his. She vows to protect him. He elaborates he doesn't care about himself, just
Naruto
, stressing that if Momoshiki isn't taken out, Naruto and
Konoha
, which Naruto fought to protect, will be eliminated. Kawaki grabs Ada and agonises over Boruto being Momoshiki's vessel, wondering who could bring themselves to kill the Hokage's son, making enemies of so many allies, and wonders why it couldn't have been a nobody, who no one would mourn. Something triggers between them as they float, sending a flash through the entire planet. Everyone notices it, including Daemon, who is out looking for Ada. The search party finds Ada and Kawaki. Momoshiki sneers at Boruto. Kawaki prepares to attack the search party, but Ada holds him back, telling him something's off. Shikamaru is notified of their location, and immediately after of Boruto's location. Sarada finds it strange why Boruto's location would be shared. Momoshiki teases Boruto, and tells him to turn around. Sarada and Mitsuki find him, and he asks Sarada what happened. She's also interested in finding out. Mitsuki tells her to maintain a distance, and enters
Sage Mode
, prepared to attack Boruto, shocking them both. One of the shinobi asks Kawaki about his eye wound, to his confusion. Ada asks about Naruto, referring to him as Kawaki's father. The shinobi answers the only thing they know is that Boruto did something. Boruto doesn't understand when Mitsuki asks what he did to Naruto, and Momoshiki warns him of Mitsuki's attack from below. Sarada doesn't understand how Mitsuki could attack Boruto. Momoshiki tells Boruto everyone is out to kill him, and explains that this is the true nature of Ada's ability to entrance people, the
Omnipotence

shinjutsu
 she can't control herself. He describes it as a programming language gods have used to create worlds, to make anything real. He elaborates that her charm was just a reflection of her desires made real by the shinjutsu, something Amado had no way of truly knowing based on the observable effects. He reveals that through Ada, Kawaki's desire became reality, exchanging their positions in the collective memory. Shikamaru asks Ada for more information on how Naruto and
Hinata
 disappeared, but she doesn't think it'll be useful. Kawaki tells her to say Naruto died by Boruto's hand. Momoshiki continues his explanation, saying that everyone's consciousness is connected by chakra, and a god can meddle with it, and asks if Boruto never wondered if an
Ōtsutsuki
 who achieved godhood may have tampered with humanity's memory before. He adds that Omnipotence doesn't effect those Ōtsutsukified, nor Ada as the user, and notes that Sarada doesn't seem to be affected, noting that those immune to it are the ones who suffer the most. He summarises that now, Kawaki is the Hokage's son who was born and raised in Konoha, and Boruto is the ungrateful outsider being hunted.

Chapter 80

"
What Dad Would Do!
" (
父ちゃんなら…!
,
Tōchan nara...!
)

At
Kawaki
's behest as he threaten her by grabbing her by her collar,
Ada
 lies to
Shikamaru
 that
Boruto
 killed
Naruto
. Shikamaru
relays
 the information to the search party.
Sarada
 tries to convince
Mitsuki
 not to go after Boruto.
Sumire
 suspects the flash of light has something to do with it. Sarada is stunned by the news, and Mitsuki goes searching for Boruto. Ada asks if he had to go this far. Kawaki is glad that now no one will interfere with him killing Boruto, planning to keep Naruto and
Hinata
 sealed until he has killed Boruto and
Code
.
Daemon
 arrives, asking if he did something with his sister, annoying him.
Sasuke
 finds Sarada, asking her if she's ok, noting Mitsuki's absence. She is shocked when Sasuke comments on the situation with Boruto and Kawaki, his perception altered as everyone else's. Sumire contacts her, and asks if she's of sound mind.
Team 10
 ambushes Boruto, admonishing him for killing Naruto. Sarada is confused, but Sumire assures her they are both fine. Sasuke is concerned by Sarada's disposition. Sumire shares her suspicion that Ada is somehow responsible for the change, pointing out that the two of them were likewise not affected, and surmising a
shinjutsu
 was likely involved, a drastic measure to save Kawaki.
 Sarada is deeply anguished by Boruto's predicament. She pleads with Sasuke that everyone is being deceived, but he still believes Boruto killed Naruto, something he can't ignore.
Momoshiki
 taunts Boruto, and offers to take over and kill Team 10 for him, but Boruto dismisses him. Sarada begs Sasuke to trust her, even if he doesn't understand her, and asks him to help Boruto. Sasuke notices she has awakened the
Mangekyō Sharingan
. Momoshiki continues to needle Boruto, trying to convince him to give into despair so he can take over. Sasuke rescues Boruto, confusing Team 10. As they leave the village, Sasuke shares his memories of Kawaki. Ada checks on something with her
Senrigan
, and tells Kawaki to return without her, while she and Daemon go somewhere else. Sasuke and Boruto rest for a bit, beyond the reach of Konoha's sensors, though not Ada. Boruto asks why Sasuke's helping him if he believes he's the enemy. He explains that Boruto has the
forehead protector
 he gave Kawaki, and he can feel Momoshiki's presence in him, despite remembering Momoshiki being in Kawaki. Several of the things bothering are doing so less and less, fearing how undependable his memories might be. Sasuke has decided that if he doesn't trust his own memories, he'll believe Sarada, finding it worth risking his life to help him because she asked him. He tells Boruto to validate Sarada's belief. Momoshiki continues to demean Boruto's situation, stressing that Ada's changes with
Omnipotence
 cannot be undone, even killing her wouldn't revert them. Boruto mocks Momoshiki's panic and desperation, telling him to stay quiet, dead as he is. Ada arrives with Daemon, and apologises to Boruto. She checks what he already knows, and explains that she only wanted to help Kawaki, but something else happened unintentionally. She compares it to when everyone first became captivated by her. Boruto explains what the shinjutsu did, this change reflecting what Kawaki wanted. She notes how calm he is about it, thinking he'd be more depressed. Boruto does feel crushed, but is thinking deeply about Kawaki experienced it all since he was little. He realises he might have angered Kawaki by trying to relate to him before. Ada tells him she thinks Kawaki does think of him as a brother. Sasuke tells Boruto that Naruto had been similarly shunned and had nothing, but turned it around through his actions, so he should do the same. Momoshiki is incensed by Boruto's determination. Boruto addresses him, pointing out he hasn't lost everything, stressing he has the blood his father, his
Hyūga
 mother, and
Hokage

grandfather
 in him, and most importantly, he's a
Konoha
 shinobi with the
Will of Fire
. He considers himself responsible for pushing Kawaki into taking such drastic measures, and is determined to get strong so as to turn their situation into a mere siblings' quarrel, believing it to be what Naruto would do. Ada asks if he's really twelve, and in an attempt to make up for her part in putting him in this situation, she promises not to look for him or Sasuke until they return to Konoha. She thinks it's her fault that Kawaki is acting like a coward, which makes her sick. Boruto thanks her, and asks her to thank Sarada for sending Sasuke to him. Daemon wants Boruto to grow strong enough that he would have to fight at full strength for the first time ever. Boruto doesn't think several lifetimes would be enough for that. Sasuke says they should be going, Konoha unlikely to give up their pursuit. Boruto thanks him, but he credits it to Sarada. Sumire joins Sarada, who wishes Boruto to be safe. Code continues to vow revenge on Boruto for stealing
Jigen
,
Isshiki
, and Ada from him. Kawaki is determined to kill Boruto as long as he's
Ōtsutsuki
. Boruto is determined to prove he is Boruto Uzumaki.
