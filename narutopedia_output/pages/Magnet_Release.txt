Magnet Release
 (
磁遁
,
Jiton
,
Viz:
 Magnet Style) is a
nature transformation

kekkei genkai
,
 suggested to be a combination of
wind
 and
earth
.
 Magnet Release users generate a magnetic force which they apply to other substances for various purposes.

Substances

Iron Sand
 was used by the
Third Kazekage
 of
Sunagakure
. He modelled his use of Iron Sand after the
sand
 controlled by
Shukaku
's
jinchūriki
, moulding it into weapons or crushing targets with it. In
Gaara Hiden
,
Kajūra
 of
Ishigakure
 also uses Iron Sand. In
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
,
Shinki
 of Suna manipulates it as well.

Gold Dust
 was used by the
Fourth Kazekage
. He developed its use specifically to counter Shukaku's jinchūriki, as the Gold Dust is heavier than the jinchūriki's sand.
 When Rasa uses this nature, he gains black rings around his eyes, similar to the ones around
Gaara
's eyes.

Toroi
 from
Kumogakure
 would
magnetise special shuriken
. When the shuriken come into contact with another object, the object becomes magnetised, making it an easier target by causing it to draw other magnetised weapons towards it. However, each time the magnetism is transferred, it weakens.

Shukaku
 uses Magnet Release in conjunction with the
cursed seal
 markings on its body.
Naruto Uzumaki
 was able to incorporate these powers into his
Rasengan
 to create the
Sage Art: Magnet Release Rasengan
, which has the additional effect of binding a target when struck.

In
Gaara Hiden
,
Gaara
 is stated to have inherited Magnet Release from his father. Gaara manipulates a dense "sparkling metallic sand". He can either use it in place of his usual sand or mix it with the sand in order to fortify it.

Trivia

Similar to Magnet Release,
Jiga
 achieved a
human magnetism
 in his youth by ingesting iron.

The magnetisation of Gold Dust and manifestation of rings around the eyes by the Fourth Kazekage may indicate a
diamagnetic
 strain of Magnet Release that magnetises inherently non-magnetic materials like gold and sand.

In Japanese folklore,
tanuki
 are widely known for their ringed eyes. Shukaku is such a creature.

Despite Rasa's eyes turning darker when using magnet release, Gaara was born with the rings around his eyes.
