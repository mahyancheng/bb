Naruto: Konoha Ninpōchō
 is a video game, released in 2003 exclusively in Japan. It is the first ever video game based on
Naruto
. It was the first and only Naruto game to appear on the Bandai WonderSwan Colour.

Gameplay

The game is a RPG where the player selects
Seals
 in a
Scroll
 to use as commands. There is a total of 32 seals (96 counting the three playable character) in the story and 14 exclusive to multiplayer matches, but each character can have only 12 seals on their scroll at a time, having to select which one is to be used in the pause menu when it becomes full. In battles, five of these seals appear randomly, being replaced by other seal from the scroll after usage.

Seals and techniques are divided in four categories:
Ninjutsu
,
Genjutsu
,
Taijutsu
 and Others. When defending, a Ninjutsu seal can avoid a Genjutsu technique, Genjutsu avoids Taijutsu, and Taijutsu avoids Ninjutsu. The character's level depends of the level of each of his seals. The more a seal is used, the better the character will be with it, levelling it up. By charging chakra with the 印 or 練 seals or skipping a turn, two or more seals can be combined to form stronger techniques. For example, combining 火 with 強 will result in the
Fire Release: Dragon Fire Technique
, a stronger fire technique. 火 and 数 results in
Fire Release: Phoenix Sage Fire Technique
, which hits all opponents. 火, 強, and 数 results in
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
, which is both powerful and hits all opponents. Some combinations are exclusive to specific characters, like Naruto being the only one able to use
Sexy Technique
 with 疲 and 変.
