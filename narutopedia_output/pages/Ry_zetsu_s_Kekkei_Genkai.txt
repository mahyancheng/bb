This unnamed
kekkei genkai
 apparently allows the user to perform
Reincarnation Ninjutsu
 as it allowed
Ryūzetsu
 to perform the
Dragon Life Reincarnation
 technique. It was seen only in
Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison
 and Ryūzetsu was the only known user. Other details, such as whether it was common or rare and whether any other technique could be performed using it, are unknown.
