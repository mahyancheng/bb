The
History of Warring States Seals
 is a
scroll
 containing a detailed list of
shinobi
 who were
sealed
 during the
Warring States Period
, as well as the reasons they were sealed, and where they are being held. The original scroll was subsequently stored at the
Konoha Archive Library
, though multiple copies of the scroll exist.

Overview

Prior to the start of the series, the
Senju clan
 came into conflict with their rival, the
Uchiha clan
, during the Warring States Period. Following a defeat at the hands of the Uchiha human weapon,
Nanashi Uchiha
, the Senju made contact with the
Sarutobi clan
 and arranged a joint mission to seal away their common enemy. After a fight, Nanashi was sealed away deep underground near a Senju Hideout in the
Land of Fire
, and the location of her burial site was recorded onto the History of Warring States Seals scroll.

During the events of
Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
,
 one copy of the scroll was stolen by
Teguse
 as he deserted the
Scientific Ninja Weapons Team
 whilst stealing several other items from
Konohagakure
. Coming into contact with
Merz
 and the
Zero
 organisation, the group used this scroll to rediscover and unseal Nanashi Uchiha for their
plans
 involving the
Sharingan
.

A copy of the scroll was given to
Sasuke Uchiha
 by
Naruto Uzumaki
 in order to investigate Zero's actions. Sasuke visited the Senju hideout, but found little information on the contents that were unsealed.

When
Boruto Uzumaki
 travelled back in time to the Warring States Period with the help of
Toneri
, Nanashi's history was changed when Boruto rescued her from captivity. Nanashi was able to live a modest and normal life away from war, and spent the rest of her life in gratitude to Boruto. The information about Nanashi in the History of Warring States Seals scrolls was thus changed to reflect this. Her involvement with the war was replaced with an anecdote reflecting on the horrors of the war and sharing how much Boruto changed her life for the better. Boruto's name was mentioned in the scroll directly, much to Naruto and
Shikamaru
's confusion.
