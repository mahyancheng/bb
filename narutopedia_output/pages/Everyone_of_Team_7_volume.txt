 has. His hatred causes Susanoo to progress to a new level. It dissipates immediately afterwards, Sasuke's eyes finally succumbing to blindness. Sensing this,

Motoi
, the island's caretaker, how he can convince B, claiming that B is too conceited. Motoi grows angry by Naruto's accusations, but lets it go. He tells Naruto that B probably had his reasons and directs him to the
Falls of Truth

Dark Naruto!!
" (

,
Yami Naruto!!

Naruto
 tries to defeat his "inner darkness", the product of his lonely childhood and the lone obstacle in his efforts to tame the
Nine-Tails
. They are equally matched, so the fight does not go anywhere. Since this is an internal struggle, Naruto returns his attention to the real world and asks
Motoi
 how
Killer B
 overcame the evil in his heart but Motoi couldn't. Naruto then requests that Motoi ask B, however, Motoi, weighed down by the guilt of having once tried to kill B stated once again that he could not. He then offers to tell Naruto about B's background so that maybe Naruto could find the answer himself.

Chapter 494

"
Killer B and Motoi
" (
キラービーとモトイ
,
Kirābī to Motoi
)

The
Eight-Tails
 had long been a problem for
Kumogakure
; the village constantly tried to gain control of its power, but when its
previous jinchūriki
 would fail to contain it the village would suffer heavy casualties. Loved ones of those who died would come to hate the Eight-Tails and its jinchūriki, just as
Motoi
 came to hate
Killer B
. Although they were friends, Motoi once tried to kill B, but ultimately could not. He nevertheless felt ashamed, something that became more pronounced as the years went by and B became a village hero. Motoi has long feared that B knew of his attempts on his life and hates him for it. Soon after telling this story to
Naruto
, Motoi's life is saved by B, who in fact did not know and doesn't actually care. Naruto is happy to see them reform their friendship.

Author's Note

“

One member of my family is our pet cat Shū-san. He's quite elderly, so he can't get around much. In fact, he sleeps most of the time. He's always asleep, even during the daytime, but it must get too bright, because he'll cleverly cover both eyes with his arm. That gesture is just so cool.
