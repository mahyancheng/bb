This large
chimera
-like
chameleon
 with a snake for a tail is a summon of
Nagato
.

Appearance






The Giant Chameleon's appearance.



The giant chameleon has a
Rinnegan
 in its left socket. It has four limbs, each ending in four large claws. Its tail is a large snake. Its body is covered in scales and it has bandages wrapped around the centre of its back. It has two wings on its upper back which are porous and badly ripped. It has two oddly shaped horns coming from the back of its head. The right horn is snapped off and wrapped in bandages while its left horn has four
black receivers
 stuck through it.

Abilities

Much like a real-life chameleon, this creature can also blend with its surroundings for camouflage, so perfectly that it renders itself completely invisible to other viewers around. This ability has been used by the
Animal Path
 of Pain to step inside the chameleon's mouth and attack his opponents by surprise. As perfect as it may be, however, this camouflage can be detected by barrier-related techniques, as when
Jiraiya
 tried to use his
Barrier: Canopy Method Formation
 to locate it, Pain had the chameleon distance itself from him, and attacked him with an
offensive summon
. Another reptilian trait that the chameleon shows is the ability to crawl on vertical and inclined surfaces, such as walls. Also, it has exhibited great destruction capabilities, as it could fend off attacks from
Konoha
 ninja and wreck houses and buildings during
Pain's assault
 on Konoha. The snake-tail can be used as a prehensile limb, to be able to grab and capture intended targets for Pain with its tongue, as shown during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.
 Its eyes are linked with Nagato and his other summonings as seen when the revived
Itachi
 and Nagato fought
B
 and
Naruto
. It can use its snake tail's tongue to grab and restrain its opponents. It also has badly damaged wings so it is unknown if it can still fly.

Part II

Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant

It is first summoned during Pain's battle with
Jiraiya
 in
Amegakure
, swallowing Pain's
Animal path
 and turning invisible via camouflage, to conceal the latter and give it stealth-based advantages. After failing to detect it via a barrier technique, Jiraiya summons
Shima
 and
Fukasaku
 to use
Sage Mode
. Analysing the situation, Shima is easily able deduce the creature's location and restrain it with her
Fighting Tongue Bind
 technique, before excreting a corrosive liquid along her tongue's length to disable it's camouflage. Fukasaku then slices the creature in half, with the
Fighting Tongue Slash
.

Pain's Assault

In the anime, the chameleon is summoned again by the second Animal Path during the invasion of Konoha. After causing a rampage along with Pain's other summons, it is de-summoned (along with other animal summons) when Pain decides to concentrate his power solely to the
Deva Path
 for a large-scale
Shinra Tensei
 on Konoha.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, the chameleon is summoned by Nagato, who has been
reincarnated
 by
Kabuto Yakushi
. Nagato, being controlled by Kabuto, uses it to hide within it's mouth, while the creature is invisible, and then unleash a massive Shinra Tensei on his surroundings to obliterate a portion of the forest while battling
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Killer B
. After Nagato revitalises to his youthful appearance by
absorbing
 B's
chakra
, he has the chameleon use his snake-tail to hold Naruto while he
removes his soul
. However, both it and the
King of Hell
 get blinded when Itachi throws several
kunai
 into their eyes, allowing him to save both Naruto and B from Nagato.
