Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Kabuto
 uses the
Power of the White Snake
 to kill three
Takigakure

shinobi
, leaving their corpses for the
Infiltration and Reconnaissance Party
 to find. At
Mount Myōboku
,
Gerotora
 explains that once before,
Jiraiya
 had loosened the seal on Naruto's stomach in order to help him control the
Nine-Tails
; instead, Naruto entered into his
four-tailed
 form and severely wounded Jiraiya. Naruto tells them that he did not mean to, and that it was Jiraiya who goaded it into him, claiming that it was the
Fourth Hokage
's legacy. Gerotora adds that when a
jinchūriki
 uses their
tailed beast
's power, they draw on not just its
chakra
, but its will. The Fourth had used the
Eight Trigrams Sealing Style
 in order to mix Naruto's chakra with the Nine-Tails in order to help him get accustomed to it and to draw on its strength without succumbing to its will.

Naruto muses how he had once purposely drawn on its power during his
fight
 with
Orochimaru
 on the
Tenchi Bridge
, and how after hurting
Sakura
 he told himself he would never use it, only to succumb to the fox voluntarily when he thought
Hinata
 had been killed by
Pain
. However, he remembers his father
telling
 him that he had sealed the fox inside of him because he believed in him to master its power, and remarks to himself that he would do it for his father. Naruto accepts and signs the contract, and
Fukasaku
 uses his
Frog Kata
 to kick Gerotora down Naruto's mouth in order to keep him in storage. The
Great Toad Sage
 then bids Naruto on his journey to find the
octopus
 and Fukasaku decides to send him back home to
Konoha
. Meanwhile, Kabuto greets
Tobi
 at his
hideout
, claiming that he had heard that the
Akatsuki
 member goes by the name of
Madara Uchiha
 these days. Tobi remembers that Kabuto was a spy for
Sasori
 and rushes towards him, calling him a traitor to the Akatsuki. Kabuto uses his
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 technique to summon the corpses of
Itachi
,
Sasori
,
Deidara
,
Kakuzu
, and
Nagato
. Kabuto proposes an alliance for the upcoming
Fourth Shinobi World War
, in which he would provide Tobi with reanimated corpses as he is the only person alive who can use the reincarnation technique; in turn, Tobi would give him
Sasuke
 to use as an experiment. Tobi refuses to accept his deal, and Kabuto smiles as he summons an
unshown corpse
, causing Tobi to become very angry. The masked man later grudgingly agrees to Kabuto's proposition. Meanwhile,
Anko
 and her team follow the corpses Kabuto laid all the way to Tobi's hideout.

Trivia

The robes from all reincarnated Akatsuki members are depicted with an incorrect colour scheme, black with red lining.

Nagato's hair is wrongly coloured dark for one frame when he is summmoned.
