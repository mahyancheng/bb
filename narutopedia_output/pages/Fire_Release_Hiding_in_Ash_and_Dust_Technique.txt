The user expels
chakra
-infused ash that blanket a wide area, burning anyone who comes in contact with it. The technique can also be used as a powerful deterrent from attacks as well as a highly effective smokescreen. This technique is a far more effective substitute for smoke bombs since the user doesn't need their hands to be free nor does this technique require hand seals.
