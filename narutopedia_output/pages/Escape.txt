 anime.

Synopsis

Konohamaru
 reports the mission to
Naruto
,
Sai
, and
Shikamaru
. He hands over the data they collected from the airship, and inquires about
Kawaki
, who had the same
Kāma
 as
Boruto
. Before allowing him to enter
Konoha
, they're examining him in
Katasuke
's
lab
 in Ryūtan. While Naruto worries that he is a child being pursued by
Kara
, the others are more cautions over his violent instincts. Konohamaru also reports that
Koji Kashin
 used the
Rasengan
. At the Ryūtan facility, Kawaki is kept handcuffed in a room.
Akita
 and Katasuke report what they learned about Kawaki to
Team 7
.
 Katasuke also warns
Sumire
 that
Nue
 might react badly to Kawaki. Kawaki tries breaking through the reinforced door of his confinement, but is unable to do it. Katasuke fills the room with sleeping gas. Kawaki dreams back to
Jigen
 and his father. After he wakes up, Team 7 and Sumire bring him food, but he kicks it aside, thinking it's poisoned. Sumire tells him where they are, and they leave. Kawaki requests to use the bathroom. Naruto and Sai depart to Ryūtan to ascertain whether Kawaki is an enemy or not. Kawaki uses a
Smoke-Flash Bomb
 he pockets from a scientist to escape through a bathroom vent. The alarm goes off, warning the facility of his escape. Sumire feels responsible for telling Kawaki there were
scientific ninja tools
 on the facility, and runs into him. She tries to restrain him, but he overpowers her with a
shinobi gauntlet
. In response, Nue attacks Kawaki, injuring his arm. Kawaki flees while Sumire tries calming Nue down. He manages to escape the facility, but leaves a trail of blood behind him.
