"
Fight! Rock Lee!
" (
闘えロックリー!
,
Tatakae Rokku Rī!
) is episode 228 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Lee
 dreams of fighting
Tobi
 using his
Drunken Fist
; as he wakes up, he berates himself for having slept during training for the upcoming
war
. Lee then spots a small boat and wonders whether he can finally put to use what
Guy
 tried to teach him so long ago. Elsewhere, Guy is nauseous from his seasickness and decides to tell
Naruto
 a story about him, Lee, and seasickness.

After Lee had managed to perfect the
Reverse Lotus
, Guy took Lee out to dinner, where Lee accidentally ingested alcohol and used his Drunken Fist to destroy the restaurant. The next morning, all Guy could remember is begging on his knees to the restaurant owner. Not wanting Lee to remember such a disgraceful act, he took Lee out to perfect "image training" in an attempt to make Lee forget forever. After Lee began remembering the Drunken Fist, Guy attempted to cover it up by claiming it was
Seasickness Fist
. However, both Guy and Lee fully remembered their memories from the night before, and Lee told Guy that he was honoured by his sensei's words and actions the previous night. Since Lee was a natural at the Drunken Fist, Guy advised him to use the seasickness as a substitute for intoxication to master the technique, which Lee was able to do.

As Guy finishes his story, Naruto tells him that the training was useless — Lee is unable to fight if seasick, but if he overcomes his nausea, then he would not be able to use his Seasickness Fist. Guy is outraged and cries that he was unable to realise that earlier.

Trivia

In this episode, Rock Lee was seen dreaming about Tobi, even though he has never actually encountered him before.

The dream portion of the episode is animated in a super-deformed style, like that of
Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles
.

Tobi uses the Hokuto Hyakuretsu-ken from
Fist of the North Star
.
