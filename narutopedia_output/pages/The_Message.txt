Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Iruka
 dreams back to when
Naruto
 stole the
Scroll of Seals
.
Konohamaru
 wants to record another message from Iruka, finding the previous one to be uninspired. Iruka still doesn't know what to say. He scolds
Tsukune
,
Mibuna
, and
Sansho
 for vandalising the
Third Hokage
's statue again.
Sadoru
 asks Iruka if he'll be making a speech during the ceremony, but Iruka says
Kakashi
 will do it.

Ayame
 runs into Iruka, noting he hasn't been to
Ramen Ichiraku
 in a while. Iruka explains he's still trying to figure out what to say. Naruto visits Iruka, asking him out for ramen. Iruka is trying to cook his own dinner, without much success. Naruto wants to have fun in his last days as a single man, and Iruka scolds him for it. Naruto wants to go out with him to tell him something. Iruka wonders why he struggled so much with his message. Naruto asks Iruka to attend the ceremony as his father, moving him. Iruka accepts. Iruka and
Hinata
 talk about Naruto's request. Iruka records another message with Konohamaru, finally getting it right. The guests arrive for the reception and mingle. Hinata looks up to the sky thinking of
Neji
, while Naruto is looking at
his father
's face at the
Hokage Rock
.
Hanabi
 and
Hiashi
 inform them that the ceremony is about to begin, and while Hanabi comments on her sister's beautiful appearance, Hiashi is overwhelmed with emotion about his daughter getting married. Hinata holds Naruto's hand, who then asks if she is ready, and the two prepare to get married.

Trivia

The final eyecatcher shows Naruto passing on his
forehead protector
 to his son
Boruto
, signifying the end of the
Shippūden
 series (and that of Naruto's generation) and the beginning of
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
, focusing on Boruto's generation.
