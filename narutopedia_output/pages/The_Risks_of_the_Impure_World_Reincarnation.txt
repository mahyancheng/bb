Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

As the
Kage
 continued their battle against
Madara
, they seemingly gain the upper hand in the battle, meanwhile elsewhere
Chōza
 keeps a
trapped

Dan
 in the loop about what exactly was happening on the battlefield. Upon hearing that the real Madara had been
reincarnated
 as well, Dan exclaimed that the situation had taken a turn for the worst and urged his former comrades to focus all their energies into stopping the Impure World Reincarnation user, to which the
Akimichi
 noted that the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 was doing all they could. Upon seeing his brother,
Sasuke
 tries to stop
Itachi
 so that he may speak with him, but the elder
Uchiha
 pressed for time opted to use his crow
summons
 to evade his younger brother. Arriving at the cave where
Kabuto
 was located, Itachi makes his intentions to stop the technique clear, though a haughty Kabuto informs him that it is a technique with nearly no risks to the user.
 The Kage's battle takes a turn for the worst when the ever-cynical Madara turns the tides against them after they make a mockery of him. Creating
multiple wood clones
, Madara sends five to each Kage to turn the five on one advantage against them. Pressing forward his advantage, he nonchalantly asks the Kage to decide whether or not the clones should each use
Susanoo
. Back at Kabuto's hideout, Sasuke who has pursued his brother thus far decides to fight alongside him, adamant to get the answers he sought from Itachi for so long much to Kabuto's amusement as he himself readied for battle.
