Might Guy
 (
マイト・ガイ
,
Maito Gai
) is a
jōnin
 of
Konohagakure
. A master of
taijutsu
, Guy leads and passes his wisdom on to the members of
Team Guy
.

Background






Guy as a child.



Guy is the son of
Might Duy
, who was known throughout
Konoha
 as the "
Eternal Genin
". Duy was not bothered by this moniker and instead was grateful that other people cared enough to know him at all. Duy encouraged this same kind of optimism in Guy, as well as his belief that one always has youth and that they could both become
taijutsu
 masters through diligent training. Guy did his best to embody his father's teachings, but had doubts that Duy's words were devoid of meaning. He nevertheless loved his father and fought others when they called Duy the "Eternal Genin" mockingly; when one of these fights landed him in the
Konoha Hospital
, Duy encouraged Guy not to be upset by this loss and to instead remember that victory is achieved by defending important things.






Guy at his entrance ceremony.



Guy applied to enter Konoha's
Ninja Academy
, but did not pass the entrance exam.
Kakashi Hatake
 was not surprised due to Guy's lack of talent in
ninjutsu
 and
genjutsu
, which Guy chose to take as a supportive observation. However, Guy was later offered a position as an alternate in the year's Academy class with Kakashi. Upon graduation, he was added to a
team
 that, in the anime, was led by
Chōza Akimichi
. The team at one point entered Konoha's
Chūnin Exams
 and passed to the final stage; Guy himself advanced to the exams' last one-on-one match, where he lost to Kakashi.
 Later, while on a mission with
Genma Shiranui
 and
Ebisu
, Guy and his team were attacked by the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
. They were rescued by Duy, who used the
Eight Gates Released Formation
 to fight off the Seven Swordsmen. Duy died from opening all
Eight Gates
, but it satisfied his one rule for its use: giving his life to protect something precious, namely Guy.

Guy at some point (still in the academy in the anime
) decided that Kakashi was his lifelong rival,
 driven by a desire to prove his perseverance could be just as good as Kakashi's natural genius. He would constantly challenge Kakashi to contests of skill, from eating contests to Rock, Paper, Scissors. Kakashi was indifferent to these contests, which only fuelled Guy's desire to defeat him. In the anime, Kakashi prevailed in the earlier of these competitions, but Guy soon started catching up, eventually achieving only a one point difference in their scores that has remained consistent over the years.
 Guy is proud of his score despite the fact that, because of how varied the contests are, it is hardly representative of anything. Through their competition, Kakashi and Guy became good friends; they were hanging out together on the night of the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
, yet were prevented from helping defend the village, instead being confined within a
barrier
 to keep them safe.






Guy, Asuma, and Kurenai plead Hiruzen to remove Kakashi from the Anbu.



In the anime, Guy was aware of the losses Kakashi experienced during and after the Third Shinobi World War and tried to help him deal with them. Following the death of
Obito Uchiha
, Guy filled in for Obito while
Team Minato
 was on a mission into
Iwa
-territory. When they were surrounded, Guy tried giving his life to allow Kakashi to escape, but they were able to fight off their enemies until reinforcements arrived.
 Following the death of
Rin Nohara
, Kakashi's teacher, the
Fourth Hokage
, sent Guy to tail Kakashi on a mission in case memories of Rin started to get to him. This proved wise: when Kakashi began hyperventilating from using the
Chidori
 - the same jutsu that killed Rin - Guy intervened in time to save Kakashi and take him home.
 Following the Fourth's death during the
Nine-Tails
' attack, Guy requested to be admitted into the
Anbu
 so that he could help Kakashi through his growing depression. The
Third Hokage
 refused his request, which
Danzō Shimura
 seconded, explaining that Guy lacked the necessary darkness for Anbu-service. Guy witnessed this "darkness" when Kakashi provided backup for him during a meeting with the
Land of Woods
, wherein Kakashi mercilessly killed all the Land of Woods' forces. Guy asked the Third Hokage to remove Kakashi from the Anbu because these kind of acts didn't become him.
 When the Third eventually complied, Guy suggested that Kakashi try leading a team of
genin
 to help him regain his lost kindness.






Team Guy is formed.



Guy at some point heard about a boy in the Academy who was unable to use ninjutsu or genjutsu. Guy approached this boy,
Rock Lee
, and encouraged him to use his youth to keep training. Lee was eventually added to Guy's
Team Guy
, along with
Neji Hyūga
 and
Tenten
;
 in the anime, before accepting them, he required them all to demonstrate a desire to succeed no matter the odds.
 Guy took a particular interest in Lee after the team's first meeting, as Lee wished to become a splendid ninja who could only use taijutsu. Guy decided to dedicate his life to helping Lee achieve his dream, teaching him all he knew of taijutsu,
 telling him the same keys to self-improvement his father had taught him, and encouraging him to use a rivalry with Neji to push him to new heights.
 Lee developed well under his guidance, as did Neji and Tenten, though Guy felt it was best to have them wait a year before entering the Chūnin Exams.

Personality






Guy's "nice guy" pose.



Guy is perhaps most fully represented by his "nice guy" pose: a thumbs-up, wink, and winning smile - complete with the proverbial
ping
. The pose captures his optimism and confidence, as by striking the pose he is promising that whatever words accompany it are either true now or will become true in time. It represents his energy, as he will, through his understood-only-to-himself-and-select-others "Power of Youth (
青春
,
seishun
)", enthusiastically seek to live up to his promise no matter the personal investment doing so will require of him. It plumbs his deep emotional well because he only reserves it for the most important promises to the most important people for the most important reasons, and as such tears frequently stream down the face of
somebody
 (inevitably Guy) when the pose is struck. He is a very driven and committed man, both to his principles and his training, constantly pushing himself to go beyond his limits. He believes strongly that one must acknowledge their own strengths and weaknesses and work to improve what one can to make up for what one cannot, something he learned from his father.
 For all his carefree nature, Guy is a very responsible and selfless man. As one who strives to live every day of his life with no regrets, he commits himself entirely to whatever goal is presented towards him. To which, he is more than willing to make a self-sacrifice with no hesitance if he believes it is for the greater good. To which, ever the optimistic, he is not one to linger in self-pity, as even after his career as a shinobi ended, he instead focused on what he could still take part in and make the most of it. In the anime, it was shown that even after gaining effective use of ninjutsu and genjutsu, he makes it a personal choice to rely solely on taijutsu whenever possible, even preferring unconvincing disguises rather than the
Transformation Technique
.
 He prefers weapons without blades.






Guy disciplining Lee, to be followed by manly tears.



Guy can be serious at times despite his odd mannerisms, usually when engaging an enemy who threatens Konoha or one of his comrades.
 But even his serious moments can be undermined by one of his eccentricities: Guy has faced
Kisame Hoshigaki
 on three separate occasions, yet on each occasion he's been fairly confident that he never met Kisame before - Guy is aware that he has a poor memory for faces.
 From observing the vibrancy of youth that his students possess, Guy may, in a moment of thoughtful self-reflection, wonder if his own youth has passed him by, only to immediately dismiss this as impossible because youth can never fade; if his student, Lee, should break one of his tenets of conduct, Guy will discipline him with a physical strike, only to then immediately start crying at the realisation of the harm he's inflicted and the well-intentioned passion that led Lee astray in the first place.

Guy refers to himself as "Konoha's Sublime
Green/Blue
 Beast of Prey" (
木ノ葉の気高き碧い猛獣
,
Konoha no Kedakaki Aoi Mōjū
). Like many of Guy's traits, the moniker may be fitting. Lee wholeheartedly approves of Guy, modelling his own appearance and personality after Guy's so that he can become as beautiful a man as Guy is. For these similarities and their common backgrounds, Guy is in turn dedicated to Lee, doing all in his power to help Lee achieve his dream of becoming a master of taijutsu. Their almost father-son bond is so powerful as to sometimes be disturbing to others.
 In later years, Guy even developed a similar relationship with Lee's son
Metal
, becoming like a surrogate second father/uncle to him.
 Neji and Tenten, though they also benefit from Guy's teachings, are only willing to join in on Guy and Lee's antics up to a point, and will either rein them in or leave them to their devices if their patience has been exhausted.






Guy and Kakashi competing in their usual "contests".



Kakashi shares Neji and Tenten's reservations with Guy, and is often only an unwilling or indifferent participant in their contests. Rather than discourage Guy, this further motivates him, as he wants to defeat Kakashi's "cool, hip, and trendy" personality. There is no animosity to their rivalry, however, and Kakashi in fact considers Guy to be one of his closest and most reliable friends: they work well together in the field,
 can understand what the other is thinking without anything being said,
 and are concerned for each other's well-being.
 At the start of Part I, Kakashi's score is 50 wins and 49 losses, though even when Guy takes the lead the score difference remains the same; considering that their competitions range from eating contests to Rock, Paper, Scissors, the score isn't truly representative of anything.

Appearance

Guy's appearance for most of the series.
Guy in
The Last: Naruto the Movie
.
1/2

Guy is a tall and well-muscled man. He has fair skin, a strong jawline, a somewhat large nose, and black hair. He is most noticeable for his shiny bowl-style haircut and thick eyebrows;
Naruto Uzumaki
 affectionately calls him "Master Intense Brows" (
激眉先生
,
Gekimayu-sensei
,
English TV:
 Bushier Brows Sensei). He wears a green jumpsuit, orange-striped leg warmers, and the standard Konoha
flak jacket
, which he normally leaves unzipped. His red
forehead protector
 is worn around his waist like a belt. Guy's appearance has not changed substantially during his ninja career, though as a
genin
 his jumpsuit was sleeveless and he wore a scarf around his neck. Also as a child, he had bushy hair reaching his chin,
 He also later swaps his flack jacket for the redesigned Konoha model. After the Fourth Great Shinobi War, his right leg is in a cast because of the damage he received during the war.

Abilities

Despite a poor start in his ninja career, Might Guy's potential growth was openly acknowledged by the famous
Sakumo Hatake
.
 He ultimately proved himself a late-bloomer, becoming recognised as one of Konoha's strongest ninja ever. His extreme power has been acknowledged by the likes of
Itachi Uchiha
, warning the entire
Akatsuki
 not to underestimate him, and even Kakashi, who completely trusted Guy to aid him in battle. By the end of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Kakashi acknowledges that Guy has surpassed him. During which, he fought off the Six-Tails alone and with his fullest capacities unlocked, nearly defeated
Madara Uchiha
 as the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki (who compared Guy's performance to the First Hokage).

Despite his permanent damage from the Fourth Shinobi World War officially ending his ninja career, after continued rehab,
 Guy was able to adjust to this handicap to remain as powerful as ever. Ultimately, Guy became recognised as a legendary shinobi.

Taijutsu






Guy punches an opponent through a wall.



Because Guy had little talent in ninjutsu and genjutsu as a child, he dedicated himself to perfecting his
taijutsu
. By adulthood, Guy is a taijutsu master with advanced skill in several styles and likewise equal knowledge in styles that he does not. He specialises in
Strong Fist
 style to effectively adjust his attack patterns and battle tactics to best handle the situation with various unorthodox yet effective strikes. Ultimately, his fighting skills allow him to rarely rely on weapons and even acknowledged by Madara himself as unsurpassed in physical combat.
 After losing usage of his right foot, Guy's style became more stationary, balancing on his left leg and positioning himself so his natural weight works with him. He will use his remaining limbs to battle, even strike with his right knee, and employ flips and handsprings to move about quickly.

Guy conditioned himself to the absolute peak of physical prowess by constantly challenging himself through various arduous training means. Without the aid of chakra enhancement, Guy can perform various seemingly inhuman feats. With a single hand, he can casually plough opponents deep into a rock wall, and with even more effort, launch the foe clear through it and a great distance away.
 Likewise, his sheer speed is consistently able to attack an opponent before they are fully aware of his presence, if at all.
 His stamina and recovery rate allows him to continue fighting for extremely long periods of time or return to battle-ready in extremely short periods of time.

Eight Gates






Guy opening all eight gates.



Taught by his father at a young age, Guy can utilise any and all of the Eight Inner Gates.
 Guy's mastery can instantly open up the first seven gates, without the need of opening previous gates. With each gate he opens, different physical and mental attributes are unlocked to their fullest potential, enhancing Guy's physical, mental, and chakra capacities by considerable amounts. Consequently, his body can take on more strain the more gates he opens, potentially causing major damage the more he moves and longer he keeps them open, with using
all eight gates
 will near-certainly cause eventual death. For this reason, Guy only opens a single gate as a last resort in order to protect something or someone precious. At the same time, Guy's extreme training allows him to handle opening the gates for longer periods of time, able to endure the sixth gate with only noticeable exhaustion, as well as resist the after-effects of the seventh gate to continue fighting for a short period. By the Fourth Shinobi World War, Guy became able to withstand using the seventh gate repeatedly before succumbing to its effects as well as immediately adapt to the immense pain of the eighth gate.






Guy's Evening Elephant, attacking his opponent from several directions.



Guy created several different techniques that he can perform once opening certain gates: with the first gate, he can use the pile-driving
Front Lotus
; with the third gate, he overwhelms opponents with punches through the
Reverse Lotus
; with the sixth gate, Guy can use the
Morning Peacock
 to unleash a series of rapid punches that ignite through air friction; with the seventh gate, he can use the
Daytime Tiger
 to launch concentrated air pressure at opponents that violently expands on contact for what he calls a one-hit kill; with the eighth gate, he can use the
Evening Elephant
 to punch from a distance powerful shockwaves of air. His ultimate technique with all eight gates is
Night Guy
, a single kick of such speed that the space around him is distorted. Night Guy, though it almost kills Madara Uchiha as the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, is responsible for the irreparable damage to Guy's right leg.

Ninjutsu






Guy summoning Ningame.



While rarely performing any ninjutsu or genjutsu, Guy is still capable of them. He can
summon
 tortoises, such as
Ningame
.
 Additionally, he has a chakra nature of
fire
 and
lightning
.
 Guy is at least knowledgeable about other ninjutsu, recognising the
Four Red Yang Formation
 and speaking informatively about its power and difficulty.
 He is also able to dispel a
high-level genjutsu
.

Other Skills






Guy wielding his nunchaku.



Guy is a master in various weapon styles, having trained Tenten extensively in using her various
ninja tools
.
 His preferred weapon in battle is
nunchaku|
,
 with which he utilises the
Sōshūga
 fighting style, being able to smash through boulders
 and trade blows with
Obito
's
gunbai
.
 He at times makes herbal remedies to help Lee with his training, though their benefits are unclear.
 In his mostly-one-sided rivalry with Kakashi, Guy devises a way to predict an opponent's movements by focusing on their feet, effectively negating the
Sharingan
's eye-contact-based
genjutsu
.

Part I

Chūnin Exams

Main article:
Chūnin Exams

After holding them back for a year of training, Guy allows his students on
Team Guy
 (
Rock Lee
,
Neji Hyūga
, and
Tenten
) to enter the
Chūnin Exams
 being held in Konoha. He worries, however, that they may not behave, so he has
Ningame
 keep an eye on them as they prepare to take the exams. Ningame catches Lee trying to use the
Front Lotus
 on
Sasuke Uchiha
, defying Guy's instructions to only use it while protecting something precious. Guy is summoned to reprimand Lee: he punches Lee as punishment, and then embraces him out of regret for punching him; Sasuke and his fellow
Team 7
 members are disturbed by the display. Aware that Team 7 are
Kakashi Hatake
's students, he asks them how Kakashi is. He apologises to them for Lee's behaviour and tells them all to head to the exams' first stage before he departs.

Team Guy advances to the preliminary stage of one-on-one fights held before the finals, and Guy watches his students' matches and cheers them on. When Tenten is badly abused after her defeat by her opponent,
Temari
, Guy stops Lee from getting into a fight with Temari and her
Suna
-teammates. When Neji ignores Guy's request to not bring the
Hyūga clan
's family issues into his fight with
Hinata Hyūga
, Guy intervenes in the match, restraining Neji so that he won't kill Hinata. When Lee is matched against
Gaara
, Guy tells him an important observation he's made: the gourd that Gaara has on his back may be significant. Although Lee takes this information with enthusiasm, it doesn't help him against Gaara's
Shield of Sand
 once the fight begins. For this reason, Guy gives Lee permission to remove his ankle weights, thus making him fast enough to bypass Gaara's shield.






Guy saves Lee from Gaara.



The increased speed is insufficient against Gaara, for which reason Guy allows Lee to use the Front Lotus. The stress the Front Lotus does to Lee's body provides a brief opening for Gaara to escape unharmed, which he takes. Lee, meanwhile, still experiences the after-effects of using the Front Lotus and has difficulty fighting off Gaara's attacks. Guy signals to Lee to use the
Reverse Lotus
. Kakashi expresses disappointment in Guy when he realises what he's allowing Lee to do, but Guy defends his decision, as becoming a splendid ninja is the most important thing in Lee's life, and defeating Gaara will help him achieve that. The Reverse Lotus ends up failing, as Gaara uses the gourd on his back to absorb the attack. Lee is unable to move afterward, allowing Gaara to start crushing his arms and legs. Guy intervenes, forcing Gaara to relent.

Although Lee has lost the match and has fallen unconscious, his body gets up through muscle memory so that he can keep fighting. Guy tearfully embraces him, assuring him he's already a splendid ninja.
Medic-nin
 come to check on Lee, but from a cursory examination of his injuries, they inform Guy that the damage the Reverse Lotus did to his body is so severe that Lee won't be able to continue life as a ninja. Guy is devastated by the news, blaming himself for not stopping Lee when he had the chance and for teaching him the Reverse Lotus in the first place. A month later, on the day before the Chūnin Exams' finals are to be held, Guy visits Lee in the
Konoha Hospital
. He finds Gaara in Lee's room, trying to finish him off. Guy threatens to admit Gaara to the hospital as an inpatient if he doesn't leave, which Gaara complies with.

Guy takes Lee to see the final matches the next day. Because of Lee's injuries, most of the first round matches have completed by the time they reach the stadium where the finals are being held; Neji lost in his fight with
Naruto Uzumaki
. While watching the fight between Sasuke and Gaara, both Guy and Lee are surprised by the speed Sasuke has copied from Lee using his
Sharingan
, though it makes sense to Guy once he sees Sasuke using Kakashi's
Chidori
.

Konoha Crush

Main article:
Konoha Crush






Guy fights the invading Oto-nin.



The Chūnin Exams are interrupted by an
invasion of Konoha
 and most of those watching the finals are rendered unconscious by a
genjutsu
. Guy is among those who dispel it and he teams up with Kakashi to fend off invading
Otogakure
 forces. While Kakashi arranges a team of
genin
 to go after Sasuke and Gaara, Guy defends the area and then creates an opening for the genin to pass through; Guy worries that they won't be enough, but Kakashi has confidence in them. They return to the fight, eventually eliminating all invaders in the area except for
Kabuto Yakushi
 and
Baki
, who opt to flee rather than face them. Guy and the others then converge on the site where the
Third Hokage
 fought
Orochimaru
, but discover that he's died in battle. Guy attends the Third's funeral a few days later.

Search for Tsunade

Main article:
Search for Tsunade






Guy attacks Kisame.



When Kakashi is about to be captured by
Akatsuki
 member
Kisame Hoshigaki
 on the instructions of his partner,
Itachi Uchiha
, Guy arrives in time to repel Kisame. Kakashi falls unconscious as soon as he arrives, so Guy carries him over to
Asuma Sarutobi
 and
Kurenai Yūhi
. They share with Guy Kakashi's earlier warning not to look Itachi in the eye because of his Sharingan, but Guy already knows this and tells them how to combat it: looking at Itachi's feet. He instructs Kurenai to take Kakashi to a medic and Asuma to assist him in keeping Itachi and Kisame busy until the
Anbu
 reinforcements he's requested arrive. Itachi and Kisame withdraw rather than fight.






Guy unintentionally attacks Jiraiya.



Guy and the others take Kakashi back to his home to rest, where Guy is informed that Itachi and Kisame are after Naruto. While they're talking, Sasuke comes to visit Kakashi and is confused by his current condition. Guy and the others try keeping the return of Itachi - Sasuke's brother - a secret, but it is unwittingly revealed by
Aoba Yamashiro
. Sasuke runs off to find Itachi and Guy chases after him. When he catches up, he makes a
sneak attack
 without getting a good look at his target, fearing Itachi's Sharingan. He ends up attacking
Jiraiya
 - who has already driven off Itachi and Kisame - and Guy apologises once he realises his mistake. When Guy prepares to head back to Konoha, Jiraiya asks him to take Sasuke, who has been rendered unconscious by Itachi. Guy tells him that Kakashi is in the same condition and muses that this, combined with Lee's injuries, makes him wish for the medical expertise of
Tsunade
.

Jiraiya reveals that he and Naruto are already searching for Tsunade. Guy asks that they be sure to find her, which Naruto vows to do. Guy is impressed by Naruto's courage and gives him his spare green jumpsuit, telling him it will make a huge difference in his training. Guy departs with Sasuke, assuming that Jiraiya is just as ecstatic by the jumpsuit as Naruto is, unaware that Jiraiya is greatly disgusted by it.

Sasuke Recovery Mission

Main article:
Sasuke Recovery Mission

When Tsunade is brought back to Konoha to become its new
Hokage
, Guy tracks her down just after she's finished healing Sasuke and Kakashi and begs her to look at Lee. After examining Lee, she agrees with the other medics' assessment that the damage is too severe for him to continue life as a ninja. She can heal him, but she confesses there's only a 50% chance that Lee will survive the procedure; she suggests he not take the risk. Lee is crushed by the news and leaves. When he's gone, Guy shares his regrets for having Tsunade look at him, as now Lee's lost the hope he'd had up until now.






Guy comforts Lee over his possible death.



Guy later finds Lee in the same spot where Lee first shared his dream of being a splendid ninja. Lee muses how far he's been able to get in his career using Guy's lessons of hard work and believing in himself, but he now fears that neither of those things can help him in his current situation. Lee asks Guy what he should do. Guy says that Lee has two options: he can give up on the life of a ninja and experience great pain for abandoning his dream, or he can get the operation, and if he dies then he'll at least die pursuing his dream; Guy thinks Lee should do the latter. He reminds Lee of his vow to dedicate his life to making Lee a splendid ninja and, therefore, if Lee's life should end, so will Guy's. Lee is moved by Guy's words and decides to go through with the operation.

Guy is forced to leave Konoha on a mission while Lee has his operation. He completes the mission as quickly as he can and returns to Konoha just as quickly, seeking out Tsunade despite his exhaustion so that he can find out how things went. Tsunade tells him the surgery was a success, which overwhelms Guy with happiness. Moments later they are informed that Lee is missing from his room, which overwhelms Guy with worry. Tsunade realises that Lee's gone off to help the
Sasuke Recovery Team
. What's more, he accidentally took her bottle of
sake
 rather than his medicine, which overwhelms Guy with fear that Lee may unleash the
Drunken Fist
 on somebody. Lee later safely returns, and he and Guy immediately resume their training.

Viva Dojo Challenge! Youth is All About Passion!

Viva Dojo Challenge! Youth is All About Passion!

In the anime, Guy hears about a dōjō that Lee has opened. Guy prepares to challenge Lee in a fight by (poorly) disguising himself as a stranger, but is called away on a mission before he can issue the challenge. When he visits the dōjō afterwards, he runs into
Nanafushi
, a thief disguising himself as Lee, and quickly knocks him out.

Third Great Beast Arc

In the anime, Guy goes on a mission with
Yagura
, a ninja of seemingly greater talent than Lee. During the mission, Guy discovers that it is not really Yagura, but actually one of the
Three Ryūdōin Brothers
 who, along with his brothers, seeks vengeance on Guy for their father's death. They trap Guy and Lee in a castle and force them to fight each other through artificial, mute proxies. They discover this trick by communicating through
Morse code
, then break out by opening the first five
gates

In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths

In the anime, about two years after Naruto leaves Konoha to train with Jiraiya, another Chūnin Exam is held. Guy proctors the preliminary round between the first and second stage: participating teams must reach the
Demon Desert
 within three days in order to qualify for the second stage. During this period,
Team 10
 is nearly killed by a giant scorpion while they search for food, so Guy gives them some. Once the preliminary round is over, Guy watches as the second stage formally begins.

Part II

Kazekage Rescue Mission

Main article:
Kazekage Rescue Mission






Kisame attacks Team Guy.



Tsunade sends Team Guy to provide backup to Team 7 on their mission to rescue the
Fifth Kazekage
 from Akatsuki. On their way to
Sunagakure
 to meet Kakashi and the others, they are intercepted by
Pakkun
, who informs them that Team 7 has tracked the Kazekage to an Akatsuki base in the
Land of Rivers
. Team Guy is closer to the Land of Rivers than Team 7 is, so they change their course. Along the way they are attacked by
Kisame Hoshigaki
 of Akatsuki, who Guy doesn't know. Kisame covers the surrounding desert with
water
 and fends off Guy's students' attacks with his
Samehada
 sword. Seeing Kisame's abilities, Guy gets the feeling that he's met Kisame before, irritating Kisame that he doesn't remember him.






Guy defeats "Kisame".



Team Guy joins forces against Kisame and Guy is able to take Samehada. But Samehada does not allow Guy to wield it and Kisame, meanwhile, is able to trap Lee, Neji, and Tenten in
water prisons
 so that he can fight Guy without interference. Kisame starts to overpower him, forcing Guy to open the first five gates and attack with
Morning Peacock
. Kisame is defeated, but when Team Guy examines his body afterwards they discover that it is only a
doppelganger
 meant to stall them. They continue on to the Akatsuki base, but when they arrive they find they are unable to enter. When Team 7 arrives shortly afterwards, Kakashi identifies it as being a
Five-Seal Barrier
, maintained by one seal over the entrance and four more somewhere in the surrounding landscape. Neji locates the other four with his
Byakugan
 and Team Guy splits up to remove them.






Guy fighting his clone.



Although they succeed in bringing down the barrier, thus granting Team 7 entrance, each member of Team Guy is confronted by a
duplicate of themselves
 as soon as the barrier is gone. Soon after Guy and his clone started fighting, matching each others attacks. After being evenly matched with his clone, Lee communicated to Guy and the rest of the team who were in the same situation and proposed a solution: to become stronger than they had been when the copies had been created. Upon listening to Lee's words, Guy managed to get the upper hand in his fight and defeated his clone. Team Guy reunites with each other after winning their battles and depart to Team 7 location, arriving in time to cut off
Deidara
's escape attempt. Unable to get away, Deidara creates a
Suicide Bombing Clone
, which Kakashi saves them from by using
Kamui
.

Team Guy watches on as the Kazekage - dead because of Akatsuki - is revived by
Chiyo
 in exchange for her own life. They attend her funeral in Suna a few days later before heading back to Konoha. Kakashi is too tired to walk due to his use of Kamui, necessitating that Guy carry him. Guy does so by giving Kakashi a piggyback ride and challenges their students to keep up with him; although Lee is fascinated by this training regimen, the others are deeply disturbed.

Hachō Village
 to help the Team 7 in their fight with
Kabuto Yakushi
. When they arrive, Guy and Lee fight the
Nine-Tailed Naruto Clone
, but find they must open the fifth gate in order to keep up with its speed and strength. After Kabuto retreats, the Konoha-nin investigate

Guy and the others set out.



While Konoha prepares for the approaching
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Guy is part of a team assigned to guard Naruto as he is sent into seclusion, a fact Naruto is not to be informed of. In the anime, as they make their way to their destination in the
Land of Lightning
, they take an indirect route so that Akatsuki cannot find Naruto. Before they can even leave the harbour in the
Land of Fire
, they are attacked by a
Giant Marlin
. They try to help a fisherman,
Yūsuke
, catch the marlin, but Naruto discovers that the marlin is compelled to attack because of a shuriken embedded in its head. When the shuriken is removed, the marlin leaves them alone and they're able to set sail.

Guy and the other bodyguards become seasick soon after starting their voyage, requiring that they briefly stop at
Benisu Island
 until they recover. They next encounter a ghost ship, whose crew was killed by the
Giant Corpse Crab
. Guy and the others help the crew avenge their deaths by defeating the crab, thus releasing their souls. As they continue their trip, Guy is kidnapped by a giant bird that wants Guy to babysit its chicks. When Naruto and the others come to rescue him, the bird takes them to a volcano where the "
ultimate summoning beast
" lives. Guy and the others team up with the bird and other local animals to defeat the beast.






Guy infected with poisonous mushrooms.



Continuing on, their food reserves start to run low and Guy and Naruto, in their desperation, eat a mushroom purchased from bandits. The mushroom makes them act violently, but they regain their senses with the help of
Shima
's cooking in time to stop the bandits from stealing their cargo. Towards the end of their trip, Kakashi comes looking for Guy. Guy gets it into his head that it is not actually Kakashi but rather an impostor and attacks him. When the others aboard start defending Kakashi, Guy concludes that they are also impostors and attacks them as well. Kakashi is able to convince Guy that he's the real Kakashi by recounting something from when they were younger. Kakashi then explains that he's answering a distress signal that Guy sent. Guy has no memory of doing that and suspects he sent it accidentally, so Kakashi returns to Konoha.

Guy attacks his "inner-self".



Guy is battling seasickness by the time they reach the
Island Turtle
 and
Aoba Yamashiro
 looks after him until he recovers. Once he's better, he goes to the
Falls of Truth
, where Naruto previously faced and overcame his inner-self. Aoba dares Guy to do the same, suspecting that Guy's inner-self isn't human. As his inner-self emerges from the falls, it ridicules Guy for his old age and his loss of the youth he constantly preaches about. Guy demands that his inner-self reveal itself, but what emerges from the falls appears to be an insect. Assuming this is his inner-self and that it's been deformed by his loss of youthful spirit, he
attacks
 it to mould it back into shape. Aoba informs Guy that it's not actually his inner-self, enabling him to recognise it for what it truly is: a puffer fish.






Guy's Daytime Tiger against Kisame's Great Shark Bullet.



Killer B
 emerges from the falls and informs them that it is not a puffer fish, but rather
Kisame Hoshigaki
 of Akatsuki, who is trying to escape with information about B and Naruto. After quickly incapacitating B and Aoba, Kisame attacks Guy and starts swimming to the ocean to send out the intel he's gathered. They're unable to move as quickly as Kisame can swim, so B flings Guy across the island in order to head Kisame off; this isn't enough, so Guy
summons

Ningame
 in mid-flight for him to use as a jumping off point to launch him the rest of the way. When he catches up, Kisame has already passed the intel to a shark, the identity of which he hides with
one thousand more
 so that the shark can escape the island. Guy tries to destroy the sharks with
Morning Peacock
, but there are too many and he's forced to open the seventh gate. Kisame tries to stop Guy with his
Great Shark Bullet Technique
, which Guy counters with
Daytime Tiger
.






Kisame, in death, finally gets Guy to remember him.



The Daytime Tiger is unimpeded by the Great Shark Bullet and directly connects with Kisame, creating a giant aftershock that not only defeats him but also destroys the remaining sharks. As Guy collects the intel, Kisame states his surprise that Guy could withhold a jutsu as powerful as the Daytime Tiger until their third encounter. Since Guy doesn't remember their previous two encounters, Kisame attempts to keep fighting, prompting Guy to knock him out. He takes Kisame back to the others so that Aoba can
interrogate
 him. Rather than be used to betray his allies, Kisame breaks free of his confinements through sheer will, traps himself in a
water prison
 so that Guy and the others can't stop him, and summons sharks to eat him alive. Guy deeply respects how and why Kisame chose to die, so vows to remember him for the rest of his life.

They afterwards examine the intel that Kisame was trying to send, which turns out to be booby-trapped: they are each caught in a water prison and are trapped alongside a shark. Guy finally succumbs to the rigors of his earlier use of the Eight Gates and can't fight off his shark, requiring that the others rescue him. Another shark, meanwhile, is able to escape with Kisame's intel.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Sakura heals Guy.



When the Fourth Shinobi World War finally starts, Guy is reassigned to the
Third Division
 of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
; his body is still suffering from using the Eight Gates, which
Sakura Haruno
 tries to heal. Guy recovers by the time the Third Division is called to help the
Surprise Attack Division
, assisting Kakashi, Sakura, and Lee with holding off the
reincarnated

Gari
,
Pakura
,
Haku
, and
Zabuza Momochi
. Zabuza covers the area in
mist
 to hide his and the others' movements, placing the Third Division on the defensive. As the battle commences, Guy and Lee are able to
intercept
 Haku's attack on an ally. When casualties start mounting, reminds those nearby that deaths are inevitable and that they can't let that destroy their resolve.






Naruto helps Guy and the others.



After Kakashi defeats Zabuza, the mist disperses and the remaining swordsmen seemingly retreat. The next day, in the anime, Guy teams up with Kakashi to keep
Jinpachi Munashi
 and
Kushimaru Kuriarare
 busy until the
Sealing Team
 can deal with them. They're eventually able to reduce the number of reincarnated ninja to three, at which point part of the
White Zetsu Army
 arrives to fight the Third Division. One of Naruto's
shadow clones
 arrives shortly afterwards, helping defeat the Zetsus. In the anime, the Third Division is attacked by one additional reincarnated ninja,
Chen
. A taijutsu expert like Guy, Chen is able to gain the advantage because his immortal body doesn't tire out, unlike Guy's. Lee saves Guy and, by talking with Chen and fighting him, is able to return his soul to the
Pure Land
.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax






Guy and Kakashi save Naruto.



Guy and Kakashi eventually leave the Third Division to join the original Naruto and Killer B in their fight with
Tobi
, arriving in time to stop Tobi from capturing Naruto. Guy frees Naruto from the
coral
 that's restraining him and they all attack the reincarnated
jinchūriki
 that Tobi is using as his
Six Paths of Pain
. Tobi has two of the jinchūriki enter
Tailed Beast Mode
, following which the
Four-Tails
 attempts to swallow Naruto. Guy and Kakashi want to help him, but must deal with the others first: while Kakashi deals with the jinchūriki, Guy repels the
Six-Tails
'
Wisdom Wolf Decay
 using Morning Peacock. Naruto, meanwhile, is able to escape the Four-Tails and release it from Tobi's control.






Guy attacks the Demonic Statue.



Tobi forces the remaining jinchūriki to also enter Tailed Beast Modes, expecting to destroy Guy and the others before they can release another of the
tailed beasts
. As five
Tailed Beast Balls
 bear down on them, Guy considers opening all Eight Gates. It ends up not being necessary as Naruto, by entering his own Tailed Beast Mode, deflects their attacks and subsequently frees them from Tobi. Tobi is forced to recall the tailed beasts into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, which he uses against Naruto, B, Kakashi, and Guy. Fighting continues into the night, with neither side emerging victorious. When a light descends on the reincarnated jinchūriki, a sign that the
Impure World Reincarnation
 has been cancelled, Tobi takes drastic action and prematurely initiates the
Ten-Tails
' revival. When they realise what Tobi is doing, Guy and the others focus on destroying the Demonic Statue before it can complete its metamorphosis into the Ten-Tails.






Guy and Kakashi are shocked to see Obito alive.



Tobi defends the Demonic Statue from all of their attacks and, as ever, is himself seemingly impervious to damage, with everything passing through him. After the exchange, Kakashi notices some slight damage to Tobi's mask, which he has a theory about. To test this, he has Guy and Naruto attack Tobi: Guy allows Tobi to absorb the
Nunchaku
 he's been
using
, creating an opening for Naruto to attack with
Rasengan
. Tobi fazes through this, but Kakashi uses his
Kamui
 on the Rasengan, causing Tobi to take damage. This confirms Kakashi's theory that Tobi is also using Kamui and must therefore have the companion
Sharingan
 to Kakashi's. Tobi confirms this, troubling both Kakashi and Guy because of what this may mean. Nevertheless, this information gives them a way of attacking Tobi, though Kakashi is so distracted in thought that he doesn't join in until Guy brings him back to his senses. Their combined efforts succeed in destroying Tobi's mask. When they see his face, Guy and Kakashi recognise Tobi as
Obito Uchiha
.






Guy attacks Madara.



Guy and, in particular, Kakashi are surprised that Tobi is Obito. Naruto doesn't know who Obito is, so Guy explains their history with him. Naruto notes that the past doesn't change the fact that Obito is now their enemy, which Guy agrees with and uses this to try to help Kakashi recover from the shock of seeing Obito. Obito is soon joined by a reincarnated
Madara Uchiha
, who decides to take Naruto's
Nine-Tails
 and Killer B's
Eight-Tails
 before the Ten-Tails is revived. Guy helps defend them - entrusting Obito to Kakashi - but Madara is too formidable and Guy soon becomes tired. Madara tells them that fighting against him is futile, which Naruto refuses to believe. Guy is moved by Naruto's confidence and attacks Madara with Daytime Tiger, propelling him away and leaving Guy no longer able to move. Naruto and the others team up to try and destroy the Demonic Statue, but they fail and the Ten-Tails is revived.






Guy celebrates Obito's defeat.



B carries Guy to Naruto, who takes him into his Tailed Beast Mode to keep him safe while his chakra replenishes. Battle with the Ten-Tails interrupts the process before Guy is fully restored, requiring that Kakashi support him. The Ten-Tails attacks again, but they are saved by the arrival of the rest of the Allied Shinobi Forces;
Shizune
 heals Guy's injuries. When the Alliance restrains the Ten-Tails, Guy and Lee open the fifth gate in order to join the attack against it, but the Ten-Tails breaks free at the last moment and repels them. When Neji is killed in the following battle, Lee mourns for him; Guy comforts him by telling him that Neji will live on so long as they continue to fight for the cause that he gave his life for. Naruto gives them
version 1
-like cloaks to protect them and strengthen their attacks, which they and the rest of the Alliance use to remove the Ten-Tails from Obito and Madara's control.

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki

Main article:
Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki






Guy saves Kakashi from Madara's attack.



Guy does what he can to contribute to the battle, but the prolonged fighting has left him exhausted and eventually Lee must help him walk. Following Obito's defeat, they start slowly heading towards where the rest of the Alliance has engaged in another battle. Along the way they notice the
Fifth Kazekage
 taking Naruto and Sakura Haruno in the opposite direction, towards where Obito was left in Kakashi's custody. Sensing something is wrong, Guy instructs Lee to head back, against Tenten's objections. They get back in time for Guy to save Kakashi from a
Truth-Seeking Ball
 fired by somebody Guy doesn't recognise:
Madara Uchiha
. Guy is surprised to learn that it's Madara's, whose appearance has changed now that he is the jinchūriki of the Ten-Tails.






Guy prepares to fight against Madara.



Kakashi and the others explain that Madara is now impervious to all attacks except for
senjutsu
 and taijutsu. Although the reincarnated
Fourth Hokage
 is technically able to use senjutsu, he can't do so in his current state. Guy therefore decides it's his responsibility to fight Madara and opens the seventh gate. He attacks with
Daytime Tiger
, but Madara survives and Guy, weakened afterwards, must be saved from one of Madara's Truth-Seeking Balls by Lee. With Guy's attack having failed, Kakashi decides that they stand no hope against Madara. Guy corrects him: he still has the
Eight Gates Released Formation
. Kakashi and the Fourth try to convince him not to, but Lee tearfully understands Guy's reasons. As he punctures his heart to open the eighth gate, Guy thinks about
his father
 and reflects that his comrades are precious enough to him to give his life protecting them.






Guy overwhelming Madara.



Guy attacks Madara with
Evening Elephant
, but the pain he experiences forces him to stop after only the first step. When Madara returns, eager to see what Guy can do, Guy starts over, sequentially delivering the first four steps of the Evening Elephant to Madara. Kakashi and the others, aware that Guy has a time limit, team up to eliminate some of the Truth-Seeking Balls that Madara is using to defend himself with. This allows Guy to hit Madara with the Evening Elephant's fifth step directly. Madara survives and, though he's winded, he invites Guy to attack him again. Guy tries additional Evening Elephants that do gradually damage Madara but, with his life about to expire, Guy realises he will need to use
Night Guy
 if he hopes to end things. He charges at Madara and kicks him in the side, obliterating part of Madara's torso and shattering the bones in Guy's right leg.






Guy's life is saved by Naruto.



Guy succumbs to the use of all Eight Gates and passes out; his body starts roasting from the inside and his damaged leg begins to crumble into ashes. Madara's body regenerates from the damage it received and he, as thanks to Guy for being such a great opponent, fires a Truth-Seeking Ball at Guy to put him out of his misery. At the last second, however, Naruto repels the Truth-Seeking Ball and uses his new
Yin–Yang Release
 to stabilise Guy's life-force. After attacking Madara, Naruto takes Guy to Lee and entrusts him to his care, assuring him that Guy will live.

Guy coming to terms with his injury.



Despite Naruto's attempt to stop him, Madara is able to cast
Infinite Tsukuyomi
, trapping the still-unconscious Guy and the rest of the world in a dream. Naruto and
Sasuke Uchiha
 are eventually able to release the Infinite Tsukuyomi, thus freeing the world and ending the war. Because of the damage done to his leg in his final attack against Madara, Guy is confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.

Kakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy Sky

Main article:
Kakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy Sky

A year after the end of the war, Konoha is hired to provide security for the maiden voyage of the
Tobishachimaru
. Guy, having always wanted to fly, has Lee sneak him aboard, threatening to stop being his teacher if Lee refuses. When Kakashi catches him, Guy claims to have no interest in flying and that he merely wants to demonstrate that he can continue to be a ninja despite his leg injury. Kakashi doesn't believe him, but lets him stay and finds a place for them to ride out the trip as stowaways. During the voyage, the Tobishachimaru is hijacked by the
Ryūha Armament Alliance
, who demand that Konoha release their leader from the
Blood Prison
; they will start killing hostages if Konoha takes too long and will blow up the Tobishachimaru if their demands aren't met.

While Kakashi confronts the hijackers to try and rescue the hostages, Guy assists Kakashi's
ninken
 with locating the
explosive tags
 spread around the Tobishachimaru. Once all the explosive tags are dealt with, Guy also confronts the hijackers, drawing
Rahyō
 into battle. Even though his leg is in a cast, Guy remains as fast as ever, allowing him to evade Rahyō's
ice
-augmented physical attacks. He is even able to deliver some successful kicks, though has difficulty disguising the pain it causes him. He brings out his
Sōshūga
 in order to engage Rahyō, but watching Sōshūga's rapid swinging triggers his motion-sickness. Rather than be debilitated by it, Guy turns it into a fighting style he calls
Seasickness Fist
. While Rahyō struggles to hit Guy, Kakashi is meanwhile able to free himself from his restraints and fights
Kahyō
. Kahyō creates a large hole in the Tobishachimaru that starts sucking out the hostages. Kakashi catches Guy before he's sucked out too, but cannot maintain his hold on the ship's hull. Despite Guy's plea for Kakashi to save himself, he loses his grip and they start falling.

As they fall through the air towards the ground far below, Guy makes eye contact with Kakashi and together they accept the fact that they're about to die. They and the hostages are saved by
Sai
, who takes Guy and the hostages to safety while Kakashi returns back to the Tobishachimaru. Guy returns to Konoha and is summoned before
Tsunade
. He tries to come up with a plausible reason for why he was aboard the Tobishachimaru, but she doesn't believe him. She's forced to take a call from the
Third Tsuchikage
 before she can punish him, so she tells Guy to sketch the faces of the hijackers. A few months later, after Kakashi has become the Sixth
Hokage
, Guy is training with Lee when he sees Kakashi reading a letter from Kahyō. Guy pretends disgust by their relationship, but states he won't let it interfere with his duties as Kakashi's adviser.

Team Guy attending Naruto and Hinata's wedding.



Guy is invited to Naruto's marriage to
Hinata Hyūga
. He gets up early one morning to do laps around Konoha until he can think of what present to get them. He invites Lee to join him, but Lee has just done the exact same thing and failed to come up with anything to get for Naruto. Guy suggests that Lee try coming up with a gift for Hinata instead, while he thinks of a gift for Naruto. Lee thinks about Hinata's post-wedding life of childcare and housework. Guy thinks of Naruto's post-wedding life of home maintenance and carrying groceries. Both simultaneously conclude they should buy dumbbells to prepare Naruto and Hinata for their lives ahead. Completely satisfied with this reasoning, Lee and Guy embrace in a long, tearful hug.

On the day of the ceremony, Tenten instructs Lee and Guy about how they should behave at weddings. Guy later congratulates Naruto at the wedding with a thumbs up.

.






Guy, Kakashi, and Mirai head to the Land of Hot Water.



On the day of the
Five Kage Summit
 in Konoha, Kakashi and Guy met up, before departing from the village with their escort
Mirai Sarutobi
. Later, the group arrived in the
Land of Hot Water
. There, they found annual festival/competition where a town was split between two beliefs on its origins; some believing that it was a cat spirit and others believed it to be a dog spirit. While initially enjoying the festival, they found
Kiba Inuzuka
 and his girlfriend
Tamaki
, a cat breeder having begun to join in the feud on different sides do to their respective animal expertise. As their couple's argument began to make the town grow into a frenzy, Mirai stopped the chaos by producing a
genjutsu of a Cat-Dog spirit
, telling the people to stop the feuding. When Guy believed the genjutsu to be a demon and attacked it, he accidentally knocked down the main wall that split the town, convincing the villagers that it was a sign for them to truly come together.

During a stop an inn, they met a young orphan named
Tatsumi
, who despite having no money, was determined to visit all the hot springs in the land in memory of her late mother. At Mirai's request, it was agreed that the little girl can join them on their own trip. Later during the trip, Tatsumi and Mirai snuck off in the hopes of a nearby hot spring rumoured to let people talk with loved ones from the past. Kakashi and Guy soon found them, learning that the rumoured hot spring was a ruse conceived by remnants of the near-forgotten
Jashin
 cult to restore their former glory and power. Guy, along with Kakashi and Mirai, swiftly defeated the fanatics. Later, it was revealed that Kakashi and Guy's vacation was in fact a cover for their working with the Land of Hot Water to uncover the truth behind the missing girls.

Demonstrating his point, Guy decided to have a sparring match against Metal and Iwabee in a two-on-one handicap. Guy decisively won, albeit it was even easier from Metal not focusing properly from so many people watching. Later, Lee decided to challenge his son to a match with many spectators, telling Metal that he had to win if he wants to learn the Eight Gates. During the match, Guy watch in pride as Metal began understanding the words he and Lee told him as he began using his anxiety to fuel his performance and even momentarily access the first gate to win the challenge. The three then tearfully hugged in joy at the proud moment, much to the spectators' discomfort.

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Might Guy

In the
Shonen Jump
 magazine, Viz rendered Guy's name as "Mighty Guy" in some of the earlier chapters; this was changed back to "Maito Gai" in most of the graphic novel stories, and later changed to "Might Guy" when the guidebooks were released.

The name "Might Guy" is a joke aimed at the "hot-headed hero" archetype that appears in many movies and anime.

Guy's appearance and mannerisms seem to be based off those of
Bruce Lee
. He even wields nunchaku and wears a jumpsuit.

Studio Pierrot's Settei sheets of Guy show that he was 141 cm in
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower
, 151 cm during the
Third Shinobi World War
, and 170 cm during the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
.

According to the databook(s):

Guy's hobbies are repeated side-steps, and hitting
focus mitts
.

Guy wishes for a rematch with
Kakashi
.

Guy's favourite foods are super-spicy
curry rice
 and
curry udon
, though he finds it impossible to dislike food.

Guy's favourite phrase is "Overflowing youth!!" (
とび出せ青春!!
,
Tobidase seishun!!
).

Guy has completed 788 official missions in total: 86 D-rank, 270 C-rank, 210 B-rank, 199 A-rank, 23 S-rank.

In
Ultimate Ninja Heroes
, Guy calls himself the "Beautiful Savage of the Leaf Village".

In
Naruto: Shippūden
 episode 359
, Guy states that he is an agnostic of the
Uchiha
's patron deity, which is located in the
Naka Shrine
.

Quotes

(To
Lee
) "
Yes!! This is what youth is all about!
"

(To Lee) "
For those who don't believe in themselves… hard work is worthless!! …You are very much like me, Lee. I used to be a loser too. But these days I can even win against the elite genius Kakashi. "I want to prove that even without ninjutsu and genjutsu I can become a great ninja" that's your nindō right? That's a great goal, it's worth working hard for!
"

(To
Kakashi
) "
What would you know about that boy? That kid has a precious thing he would give up his life to prove. So I wanted to turn him into a man that could accomplish it… That is all…
"

(To Lee) "
You worked hard Lee, there's no doubt in my mind the surgery will be a success. You have the power to shape your own destiny. And on the one-in-one thousand, no, one in a million chance something to happen to go wrong, I will die right along with you.

(About Kisame) "
He was a worthy opponent! A man who lived and died like a real shinobi! Kisame Hoshigaki! I'll remember that name for the rest of my life!

(To Kakashi) "
The springtime of youth has yet to fade away! Don't lose hope! We may not always be able to accomplish all the things we wish for… but if we only do the things we want to do, we'll never start… just like my challenges to you. This is by no means just a show of bravery or courage. The green days of Konoha are over. The time has come to become the red beast.

(To
Madara

…That may be true… but they don't just rot and die!! They will become nourishment for the new, fresh leaves! The time when a new spring comes and the fresh leaves bud… is the peak of youth!! It's the time to burn, deep crimson!!!
