Team 2
 was a team of
Konohagakure

genin
 led by
Yūki Minazuki
.

History

When Team 2 is first formed it consists of
Itachi Uchiha
,
Tenma Izumo
, and
Shinko Inari
, all fresh
Academy
 graduates. The team develops a stellar mission record during their first year, earning them the honorary task of escorting the
Land of Fire
's
daimyō
 on one of his routine trips to Konoha. Tenma is killed by the
masked man
 during the mission, and Tenma's death convinces Shinko to withdraw from the life of a shinobi. They are replaced by
Yōji Aburame
 and
Himuka Suzukaze
, themselves newly graduated.

After only a few months of the team's new roster, Itachi leaves due to his promotion to
chūnin
. Yōji disappears
without explanation
 shortly after that. Himuka stays on, and once yet two more new team members are found, Team 2 resumes its mission load under Yūki's leadership.

Missions

Catch the Ninneko

In the anime, Team 2 is dispatched to
Sora-ku
 to locate a certain
ninneko
, whose whiskers are needed to make a special medicine. After a gruelling and rather humiliating string of failures, Itachi manages to catch the ninneko.

Daimyō Guard

Because the team performed the best out of all the genin teams in said year, Team 2 was given the symbolic position of guarding the
Fire Daimyō
 during his annual visit to Konoha. However,
Obito Uchiha
’s attack claimed Tenma’s life and caused Shinko to quit being a shinobi.
