The
Yata Mirror
 was an ethereal shield with no set form or properties and has the power to alter every one of its attributes. By doing so, it can be used to negate any attack, whether it be spiritual or physical.
 As such, it is said that the Yata Mirror has been endowed with all
nature transformations
, changing its nature to nullify all incoming attacks.

The Yata Mirror is one of two "spirit" weapons wielded by Itachi Uchiha's
Susanoo
;
Black Zetsu
 claimed that the shield in its left hand, together with the
Sword of Totsuka
 held in its right hand, made his Susanoo invincible.
