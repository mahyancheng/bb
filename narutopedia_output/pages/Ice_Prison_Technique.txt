This technique allows the user to infuse their
chakra
 with ice on the ground and bring it to the surface. The user can then trap their opponent within the ice by controlling its movements and completely surrounding them in the ice. It is strong enough to withstand basic
Fire Release
 techniques, because the ice has already been infused with the user's chakra. The user can also surround themselves with the ice prison to act as a shield.
