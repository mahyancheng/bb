"
Naruto's Plea
" (
ナルトの嘆願
,
Naruto no Tangan
) is episode 200 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 tries to convince the
Fourth Raikage
 to veto the execution order on
Sasuke Uchiha
, claiming that Sasuke is his friend and that killing him would pit
Konoha
 in a war against
Kumogakure
. As Naruto gets on his knees and begs,
Yamato
 reminds him that Kumo owes them for the
Byakugan
 incident, in which
Hinata
 was kidnapped by a Kumo-nin under the
Raikage
's orders and
Hizashi Hyūga
 had to be sacrificed as a result. However, the Raikage merely dictates that
shinobi
 should be powerful and headstrong, instead of bowing their head and begging. Stating that the
Akatsuki
 are criminals that deserve to be hunted, the Raikage and his squad continue on the way to the
Five Kage Summit
.

Once all five
Kage
 convene at the
Land of Iron
, they begin their discourse, where the Raikage declares that he does not trust any of the other Kage because they have used the
Akatsuki
 as mercenaries in the past, shocking
Gaara
. He explains to Gaara that while
Orochimaru
 may not have been a member during the
Konoha Crush
, he did kill both the
Third Hokage
 and the
Fourth Kazekage
, and that
Iwagakure
 and
Kirigakure
 have often enlisted the Akatsuki's services, with rumours swirling that Kiri is home to the Akatsuki. The
Third Tsuchikage
 explains that in a time of disarmament where suspicious between shinobi nations still persist, it is cheaper and much more effective to hire the Akatsuki to fight for them and that he had no regrets or qualms about it, while the
Fifth Mizukage
 reveals that
Yagura Karatachi
, the Fourth Mizukage, had actually been controlled by a member of the Akatsuki.

Gaara discloses to the other leaders that he was once a
jinchūriki
, and that the former
Fifth Hokage
 of Konoha was the only one to provide any assistance. The Third Tsuchikage justifies their lack of involvement by citing that the abduction of jinchūriki is an embarrassing matter that should be dealt privately and internally, and that despite the Akatsuki's collection of tailed beasts, not even the jinchūriki can fully control them, citing Gaara as an example. However,
Danzō
 divulges that there have been people who have managed to gain full control over the tailed beasts, namely
Hashirama Senju
,
Madara Uchiha
, Yagura, the former Mizukage, and
Killer B
, the Raikage's brother. To the utter shock of the other leaders, he reveals that Madara himself is the leader of the Akatsuki.

With Madara being announced as the leader, the other Kage realise the seriousness of the situation and the action that must follow.
Mifune
, the general of the Land of Iron, declares himself the presiding neutral party and proposes that all five hidden villages convene as one to form the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 as a response to the Akatsuki threat, and that Danzō, the leader of the village that houses the last remaining jinchūriki, should be the leader of the allied forces.
