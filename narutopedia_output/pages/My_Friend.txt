Synopsis

After seeing
Sora
 in his
four-tailed form
,
Kazuma
 states that his job is done and attempts to flee, but is pursued by
Asuma
. In the woods, Asuma attempts to strike Kazuma, only for the latter to keep evading. However, Kazuma is stealthily bound by three
ink snakes
, created by
Sai
, who had left the
hospital
 when he heard the commotion in the village. Kazuma breaks out of Sai's binds and attempts to rush at Asuma, but Asuma stabs him with his
chakra blades
. As Kazuma dies, Asuma spots his white
Land of Fire
 sash, recalling Sora's words about how the only thing he could remember about his father was his spotless white sash.

Meanwhile,
Naruto
 attempts to get through to
Sora
, who keeps attacking him.
Sakura
 attempts to jump in and heal him, but Sora fires a
Tailed Beast Ball
. While
Yamato
 protects himself,
Team Asuma
,
Kiba
,
Akamaru
 and
Rock Lee
 with his
Wood Release: Wood Locking Wall
, Naruto shields Sakura's body with his own. He tells Sakura to standby until he can save Sora from the
Nine-Tailed Fox
's spirit, and asks Sakura to heal him first. However, Sora's body is not strong enough to contain the fox's chakra and rejects it. As the chakra is expelled from Sora's body, it takes on the monstrous shape of a fox's head; however, without a host body to take over, the chakra dissipates. Sora is restored to his human self, although he is unconscious. Naruto attempts to wake him up, and Sora manages to hear Naruto and recalls their interactions. As Sora wakes up, Naruto proclaims that Sora could now go home. Sora tells him that he has no home, and Naruto tells him that
Konoha
 is his new home, filled with his new friends. The other Konoha
shinobi
 surround Sora and smile, leaving Sora happy for the first time in his life. Sai also shows up, asking to join, but Naruto rebuffs him, causing everyone to laugh.

After Sora and Naruto are discharged from the hospital, Sora tells Naruto, Sakura and Yamato that he is departing Konoha in order to travel the world and try to make friends. He tells Naruto that he has finally thought of a name for him in the afterlife, which irritates Naruto, who had just learned what the afterlife meant. However, he asks Naruto to convey his well wishes to Asuma. Elsewhere, Asuma and
Shikamaru
 play a game of shōgi where they discuss the king of Konoha. Shikamaru states that it is the
Hokage
, and Asuma tells him that he once thought the same thing, but that Shikamaru would one day learn otherwise.

Elsewhere, two members of the
Akatsuki
,
Hidan
 and
Kakuzu
, track down a
woman
 in
Kumogakure
. Hidan attempts to strike her with his
Triple-Bladed Scythe
 but misses, and Kakuzu warns his partner not to take the woman lightly, as she is the
Two-Tails
'
jinchūriki
.
