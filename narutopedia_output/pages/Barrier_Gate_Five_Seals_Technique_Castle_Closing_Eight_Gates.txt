This technique requires a
scroll
 on which a blueprint of a particular area will be mapped. When activated, it causes four giant gates to emerge north, east, south, and west of the targeted area. Afterwards, the gates form a barrier around the area. This barrier has a very high durability, and anything that makes contact with it is immediately engulfed in flames. The only way to pass through the barrier unharmed is with a special seal. Upon the death of the caster, the barrier will be dispelled.

Trivia

The gates are based on the
Four Symbols

Azure Dragon

Vermilion Bird

White Tiger
