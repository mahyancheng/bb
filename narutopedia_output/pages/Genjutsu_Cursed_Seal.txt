The user applies a spiral-shaped cursed seal that manifests a
genjutsu
 on the victim's subconscious, allowing the user to alter selective memories from their mind and manipulate them under their subliminal control. The more powerful the genjutsu is applied to the victim, the further the seal spreads across their body.

The technique apparently requires regular reapplications as gradually, the mark fades away, causing the victim's true memories to resurface in a migraine-inducing headache.

Trivia

The marking of the technique is used as the
Byakuya Gang
's insignia.
