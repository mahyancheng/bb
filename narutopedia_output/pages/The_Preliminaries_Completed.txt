Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Medics take
Lee
 away to tend to his injuries. After a brief examination, they inform
Guy
 that the damage Lee sustained is too severe to be healed and that Lee will likely never again be able to operate as a ninja. Devastated that Lee's dreams have been shattered because of an attack he taught him, Guy is sad at Lee's injuries. He leaves the arena so that the final match between
Dosu Kinuta
 and
Chōji Akimichi
 can take place. As Dosu prepares to enter the arena, he thinks about how he finally figured out that
Orochimaru
's true goal was not to have
Team Dosu
 kill Sasuke but to have them unknowingly test Sasuke's abilities which explains as to why Orochimaru went ahead and gave Sasuke a cursed seal instead of killing him with Dosu silently remarking that he will not fulfil Orochimaru's wish and that he will win this match to fight Sasuke. Having prior experience with Dosu's
sound-based attack
, Chōji tries to use his techniques to block out the sound's effect on his ears. This only provides Dosu with an amplified medium for his soundwaves, knocking Chōji out and winning him the match much to the dismay of Team Asuma. Dosu then silently vows that he will teach Orochimaru that he is no guinea pig. With the final match over, Hayate then announces that the trials for the Round 3 test have been completed.
