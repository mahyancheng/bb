Summary

When
Naruto
 is invigorated with enhanced speed and strength by the

'
chakra
, he attacks
Neji
. Neji has difficulty keeping up, but is able to match Naruto's attacks. As the Nine-Tails' chakra clashes with Neji's
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
, the two are flung apart. When the dust clears Naruto lies defeated. Neji starts to berate him for thinking he could win when Naruto bursts from the ground beneath him and delivers an uppercut. Seeing that Naruto used a
shadow clone
