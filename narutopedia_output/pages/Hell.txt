Hell
" (

,
Jigoku
) is chapter 605 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

As
Kakashi
 releases
Rin
 from his grip, both he and
Obito
 watch her die, causing them to awaken their
Mangekyō Sharingan
. As Kakashi passes out, Obito flies into a fit of rage and disbelief which catches the attention of the
Kirigakure
 ninja. Wooden spikes begin to grow from Obito's right side as he commences his assault. Mercilessly, Obito uses a combination of
Kamui
 and the
Wood Release: Cutting Technique
 to kill all the Kiri-nin on the battlefield. Amazed that the young
Uchiha
 could already use
Wood Release
,
Tobi
 noted that he now knew why
Madara
 had chosen the young man. Realising that they could not win, the Kiri-nin decide to pull out but not before retrieving Rin's body. Obito, who was not about to let any such thing happen, slips through several more Kiri-nin and then slaughters the ninja that had tried to retrieve Rin's body. All the while questioning where he was, a blood-spattered Obito crushes the remaining Kiri-nin between giant branches, and as he stands in a pool of his opponents' blood, comes to the conclusion that he must be in hell.
