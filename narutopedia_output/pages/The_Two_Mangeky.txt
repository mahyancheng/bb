The Two Mangekyō
" (
二つの万華鏡
,
Futatsu no Mangekyō
) is episode 415 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Now that
its master
 is nearby,
Black Zetsu
 declares that nobody can stop it from handing Madara the left
Rinnegan
 and the
Nine-Tails
'
Yin
 half, detaching itself from
Obito
's body. As
Kakashi
 and
Gaara
 prepare to attack in order to give
Naruto
 the means to survive the
tailed beast
's extraction, Black Zetsu finds itself unable to leave Obito's body, due to him not allowing it to. Obito questions Madara about who he himself is to the older
Uchiha
, with the
jinchūriki
 explaining how Obito – as a follower of Madara's
ideals
 – is Madara, he who wishes to cancel the world created by the
Sage of the Six Paths
 and to create a new one through the
Eye of the Moon Plan
's
completion
.
 Seemingly giving in to Madara's words, Obito starts walking towards his ancestor, with
Minato
 trying to
attack
 Madara as Kakashi and Gaara try to stop Obito, only for Madara to effortlessly stop them. However, Obito doesn't take Madara's hand, but instead pierces him in the gut, claiming that his current self is the same as the one who wanted to become
Hokage
 – recalling Naruto's words in the process. Obito goes on to extract fragments of the
One-Tail
's and the
Eight-Tails
'
chakra
, ordering Kakashi to
teleport
 Naruto and
Sakura
 to the
other dimension
. After Madara stops Obito from going there himself, Kakashi runs to Obito's side, with his old comrade commenting on how Kakashi always looks down upon him, remembering the old times in
Konohagakure
.

Trivia

As in the manga, the spike going through Obito's left hand is missing throughout the episode, but reappears when he enters Kamui's dimension.
