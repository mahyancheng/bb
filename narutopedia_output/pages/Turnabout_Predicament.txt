Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Shikamaru
 forces
Hidan
 to abandon his
Triple-Bladed Scythe
 and leads him away.
Kakuzu
 is impressed by their tactics, remarking that fighting
Konoha
 ninja reminds him of when he fought the
First Hokage
. He merges two of his masks to double their damage and attacks. Meanwhile,
Shikamaru
 brings Hidan to a remote location and covers the area in
explosive tags
. When his shadow reaches its limit, Hidan attacks him. He gets some blood, obtains a link, and stabs himself in the heart. Shikamaru collapses and Hidan starts heading back to Kakuzu. He is unaware that Shikamaru tricked him into creating a link with Kakuzu, thereby destroying one of his partner's hearts instead of Shikamaru's.
