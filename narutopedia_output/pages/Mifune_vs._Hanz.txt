 anime.

Synopsis

As the
Surprise Attack Division
 attempt to retreat to the rendezvous point, they are chased by reinforcements of the
Akatsuki
's own
Surprise Attack and Diversion Platoon
. Amongst their members are
Hanzō of the Salamander
 who summons his
salamander
 and orders it to attack. The salamander then unleashes a
cloud of poison
 from its mouth that renders the division paralysed. However,
Mifune
 and his division soon arrives and deflects the would-be devastating blow. Conversing about the past and the paths they had chosen to walk, as the two traded blows, Hanzō commands his salamander to come from underground where he had told it to hide. Swallowing Mifune whole, the shinobi prematurely claims victory before the head of his summon is
cleaved open
 and Mifune re-emerges. Moving in for a final blow, Mifune is able to break Hanzō's sickle and respirator. Finally remembering his encounter with Mifune in life, Hanzō moves towards his broken
kusarigama
 and using the blade commits
seppuku
 telling Mifune that he entrusts him with his conviction. This act cuts the poisonous sac that had been placed in Hanzō's body when he was a child, and causes the poison to leak out and evaporate. Shocking
Kabuto Yakushi
, Hanzō's body ceases to respond to his orders and the legendary shinobi is soon
bound
 and
sealed
.
