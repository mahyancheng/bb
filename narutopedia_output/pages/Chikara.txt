Part I

Matchmaking Proxy Mission

Main article:
Matchmaking Proxy Mission

Princess Fuku hired
Ino Yamanaka
 and
Naruto Uzumaki
 to pretend to be her, while she tried to lose weight. They couldn't hold it for long though. When Chikara found out about the real Princess Fuku, he loved her looks more than Ino's and the engagement got confirmed. Ino and Naruto are rather taken aback by the daimyō's looks after having heard how handsome and desirable he is from the princess. Nonetheless, her opinion is supported by the daimyō's attendants, who swoon over him.

Trivia

"Chikara" (
力
) means "power". Of possibly some relation, his name is reminiscent of chikara udon, which is udon topped with mochi.

His appearance is similar to many
Elvis impersonators
. Particularly those that impersonate Elvis'
Las Vegas
 years, when he put on a great deal of weight.

In the English dub, his voice is based on
Elvis Presley
.
