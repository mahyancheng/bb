These chains formed by a member of the
Uzumaki clan
 are used offensively rather than the ones used for
sealing purposes
.

Usage

Using this technique, Karin manifested chakra-based chains from her body which she can use to attack and pulverise a target. Despite these chains having been stated to being an incomplete version of the Adamantine Sealing Chains, Karin was able to use this technique to destroy most of
Tobi
's
giant wooden statue
 and its
many hands
.

While said to be incomplete, in the anime, Karin later showed the ability to not only attack with the chains but neutralise her target by binding and nullifying their chakra with the chains.
 When used against
Suigetsu Hōzuki
, it sent him flying some distance away, leaving him incapacitated and his
body
 in its jelly-like state.
 Karin also seems capable of manipulating the size of her chains to fit the situation.

Trivia

While it was unnamed in the manga and anime, it was named in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
.
