Naori Uchiha
 (
うちはナオリ
,
Uchiha Naori
) was a
kunoichi
 from
Konohagakure
's famed
Uchiha clan
.

Background

Her close friend
Naka Uchiha
 was able to use
Izanagi
 and in time, became obsessed with its power. She was determined to save him from it and so ultimately cast
Izanami
 on him in order to get him to see the error of his ways and come to accept fate. She was successful in this and Naka was able to finally accept the truth and break the endless loop the technique had plunged him into.

She presumably died either before, or during the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
 along with the rest of her clansmen.

Personality

Naori was a calm kunoichi who maintained her composure even when fighting a friend and fellow clan member. She also was very kind and selfless as she tried to save Naka by making him accept his fate using a non-lethal method, sacrificing one of her eyes in the process.

Appearance

Naori had long wavy purple hair and cropped bangs hung over her Konohagakure
forehead protector
 with only the Konoha symbol showing on it. She also wore the standard mantle of the Uchiha clan with their crest emblazoned on the back along with two swords strapped to her left hip by multiple bandages.

Abilities






Naori's Mangekyō Sharingan.



Naori was undoubtedly a powerful ninja. She was shown wielding a
sword
, indicating skill with
kenjutsu
. She was also able to awaken her clan's
dōjutsu
: the
Sharingan
 and was even able to awaken the
Mangekyō Sharingan
. Unlike most known Mangekyō forms, the colour of her dōjutsu is inverted. It is split down the middle in three and has an appearance similar to a three-petal flower.

She was also able to use one of the clan's
kinjutsu
:
Izanami
 which traps the target in an endlessly-looped genjutsu with no hope of escaping unless they accept themselves.

Trivia

Written as "治り", Naori means "recovery". This is possibly a reference to her desire to save her fellow clansmen from their lust for power.

Along with
Itachi
,
Kagami
, and
Shisui
, Naori is one of few Uchiha who never appeared to succumb to her clan's
Curse of Hatred
 despite her personal loss and awakening of the Sharingan.

While not appearing in the manga, Naori and the other Uchiha featured in the episode make a cameo in the final chapter of
Sasuke Uchiha's Sharingan Legend
.
