Kakashi's ninken.



Ninken
 (
忍犬
,
English TV:
 Ninja Hounds,
literally meaning:
 Ninja Dogs)
 are essentially
dogs
 that have heightened senses and abilities, and as such, are able to work and be summoned alongside shinobi. Although the dogs belonging to the members of the
Inuzuka clan
 are ninken, the phrase is usually used in reference to the pack of eight ninken summoned by
Kakashi Hatake
.

Kakashi's ninken have shown the ability to use human language,
walk on water
, develop
combat strategies
, and track down targets through their enhanced smell. They are supposed to be quite dangerous in combat, as Kakashi notes in the anime that they can tear their opponents apart on his command. He can summon them separately, as he commonly does so with Pakkun, or all together. He can also summon them for special purposes, like he does with his
Summoning: Earth Release: Tracking Fang Technique
. With this technique, the dogs can travel through the ground following the scent of their target, emerging when the target is found and holding them in place. They all have a face-shaped design on their backs called Henohenomoheji (
へのへのもへじ
) — which is the sound made when all the characters in the face are put together. Appropriately enough, children use this design as the face for their scarecrows, which is "
kakashi
" in Japanese.

In
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
,
Ni
 had
two ninken-like beasts
 at her disposal, that appear to have been mutated through the
Chimera Technique
.
