Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Hana
 takes her students for an outside class on an uninhabited island that used to be part of the village's training grounds, including spending a night on it. She warns them to be careful of the unmaintained island. The students thank her for arranging it to make up for the festival.
Mimi
's
ninken

Kikuchiyo
 gets hurt on a trap.
Sōsha
 heard a rumour that the island is a home of a killer
missing-nin
, worrying everyone.
Kawaki
 is suspicious that the trap isn't old, and that people on the island wouldn't manage to stay hidden for long. Hana says that the island has a history of people escaping to it, some not even knowing the war is over. Their food is suddenly gone as well, and the ship will only return to them the next day. Hana blames herself, but
Himawari
 assures her they can manage. Everyone starts setting up tents and looking for food. Kawaki is still bothered by the trap. Hana finds them lucky, and would have killed them all if she didn't still have a
mission
.
Osuka
 finds a game trail leading to edible wild plants, making use of what she learned when she lived in a mountain with her mother for a movie.
Kae
 makes a flower arrangement for Hana.
 Kawaki wants her to stay close, and she asks if he's still guarding her, as the matter of her assassin is over. When they get startled by some movement, Osuka and Himawari have
Neon
 check it with her drone, but it gets taken down. They ask for help, and
Soul
 finds it. Neon finds it unlikely to have malfunctioned, having recently serviced it. They worry about missing-nin. Hana watches them, hidden. Kae gifts Hana the flower arrangement. Himawari calls her and everyone is informed about the drone incident.
Doseki
 and Soul want to search the island, having a numbers advantage, but Kawaki points out that with the ninken and the drone out, they can't search far, as
Harika
's
kikaichū
 also can't search too wide an area. Hana tries calming everyone, and Kawaki stresses they must stay close together and in line of sight. At night, everyone eats. Kawaki checks on the trap, and tells Kae that according to Mimi, it was baited with Kikuchiyo's food, meaning he was the target from the start. Kae thanks for still watching over her, and he admits that going to the
Academy
 has been fun as well. Kae has had fun as well, and reveals she'll return to the
Land of Bamboo
 after this extra curricular class.
Konashi
 gives Kae his latest sweet, and pulls Kawaki away to try some as well. Hana approaches her, who notices the flower arrangement is gone, and offers to help Hana look for it. Kawaki asks Himawari about the damage to the drone, and she found that its blades were cleanly sliced, and the drone too damaged for the height from which it fell. Himawari recalls that the drone has recording capabilities, so they have Neon play it to review the footage. Kawaki notices something and calls Himawari aside. He saw
Wind Release

flower petals
 on the corner of the screen before the footage cut off, and they realise it implicates Hana. They don't want to believe it, but too many things fit the theory. Himawari finds the flower arrangement Kae made discarded. Hana tries getting Kae further away from the group to find the gift, but Kawaki and Himawari stop them, wanting to ask questions. Hana sets off a
smoke bomb
 and runs away with Kae. Hana fights Kawaki and Himawari, who thinks someone switched places with her. She pushes them away with her Wind Release, and rushes to a bridge, where she seemingly slashes Kae with a kunai, to Kawaki and Himawari's horror.
