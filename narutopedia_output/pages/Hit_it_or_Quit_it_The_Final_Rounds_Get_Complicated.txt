" (
失格!?キケン!前倒し!波乱含みの大本選!

) is episode 63 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Genma
 announces that
Naruto
 is the winner.
Sakura
 resolves to get stronger too because she envies Naruto and his strength.
Asuma
,
Kurenai,
 and the
Third Hokage
 are all surprised to see that Naruto was able to control the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
's
chakra
 on command. After some medical-nin take
Neji
 into a room to treat his injuries,
Hiashi Hyūga
 comes, asking for some time alone. He hands Neji a scroll, who realises it’s in his
father's
 handwriting. The scroll described the truth that took place during the
Hyūga Affair
 many years ago. Despite the elders wanting Hizashi to die in Hiashi's place in order to protect the
Byakugan
, he states that he wants to do this of his own free will. Not to protect the Head Family, but to protect his brother and their village.

Hiashi then bows his head to Neji, begging for his forgiveness.  Asking him to raise his head, Neji proclaims his goal now is to become stronger. After many complaints that
Sasuke
 was late against his match with
Gaara
, the Third Hokage decides to disqualify Sasuke. However, "
The Fourth Kazekage
" tells him that many of the other village's leaders and daimyō have come to Konoha for the sole purpose of watching the sole surviving Uchiha face off against Suna's very own Gaara. Hearing this, he decides to postpone Sasuke's match.
Kankurō
's match is thus moved up, but he forfeits his match with
Shino Aburame
, not wanting to reveal
Karasu
's inner workings to Konoha, thus allowing Shino to win by default. With Kankurō's withdrawal, the next match is set to begin, between
Temari
 and
Shikamaru Nara
.

Trivia

At the very beginning of the episode, in a shot of Naruto, the characteristic whisker marks on his face are gone.

Also in a shot of Kurenai Yūhi, the rose thorn pattern on her outfit is white instead of black.

In the manga, Hiashi begged Neji for forgiveness. In the anime, Hiashi handed a scroll to Neji which had Hizashi's handwriting on it, then later begged Neji to forgive him and the main family.

In the English dub of the previous episode, Naruto tells Neji that he's fighting because everyone called him a failure, and that he'll prove them wrong. In this episode, while Neji is lying in the hospital bed remembering his fight, Naruto's words are changed; Naruto now says that he is fighting because Neji called him a loser and that he'll prove
him
 wrong.
