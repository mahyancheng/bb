Akahoshi
 (
アカホシ
) is a
shinobi
 from
Hoshigakure
 in the
Land of Bears
, and the self-proclaimed
Fourth
Hoshikage
 (
四代目星影
,
Yondaime Hoshikage
,
literally meaning:
 Fourth Star Shadow).

Background






The Third Hoshikage is murdered by Akahoshi and his two followers.



Akahoshi took over as the Hoshikage after the
Third
 suddenly "grew ill" and died. In truth, he and his followers
Shisō
 and
Yotaka
 murdered the Third Hoshikage, when their appeal to lift the ban on the star training was denied.

Upon taking control of the village, Akahoshi reinstated the star training, believing that with the powers from the meteor, their ninja would become invincible and they could compete with the five main countries. When he never told anyone about the side effects of the star training, some of the villagers went against him as
Natsuhi
 and
Hotarubi
 try to hide the star.

Personality

Akahoshi was, in his own way, extremely loyal to his village, but that was mostly shown in his ambition for it to become as strong and respected as the five great villages. His methods of obtaining that status and importance showed him as a ruthless and ambitious person who was even willing to endanger the village children in the quest for power. He was also quite willing to commit murder as he brutally slew the Third Hoshikage when his request were denied for the star training to be resumed, proving to be both treacherous and cruel. Akahoshi often showed a maniacal side especially during battle and when talking about his crimes, showing a psychotic grin in the meantime, having neither remorse nor fear of retribution. He even publicly and contemptuously degraded the Third as an incompetent leader for not reinstating the star training. Once he implanted the meteorite into his own body, he relished the newfound power it granted him, expressing that he would have done so sooner had he knew of such power, and that he would have it all to himself, showcasing his selfishness and forsaking the village. Despite these factors Akahoshi was shown to be more inclined to make people do as he pleased by manipulating them and their feelings rather than using raw might, proving him to be, at heart, a schemer.

Appearance

Akahoshi was a man of pale tone, he had a thin and bony face, blue eyes and a narrow nose. Akahoshi also had lilac-coloured hair with a ponytail and a blue forehead protector.

Abilities

Ninjutsu

Akahoshi showed excellent skill in the use of the
Mysterious Peacock Method
, having been self-trained in its use during the rule of the Third Hoshikage. He could let his chakra take the form of a
beast
 for offensive usage and was also able to form
wings
 for short flight. Akahoshi also displayed great defensive capabilities utilising the special chakra, being able to catch incoming shuriken and return them with a wave of Chakra. He could also
absorb
 the chakra of
his

comrades
 to improve his own strength. He is also an adept
sensor
, able to
track
 targets from their chakra trail.

After placing the
Meteorite
 into his chest, he effectively fused with it, causing the meteorite to take control of him. His appearance also changed, and his chakra underwent a drastic increase in power. With this increase in chakra, as well as with the meteorite's influence, he was able to create a
dragon
 with the star chakra. With said dragon, Akahoshi could easily overwhelm a large number of Hoshi-nin, as well as Naruto Uzumaki with blasts and waves of chakra.

Other Skills

Akahoshi showed proficiency in tracking and deception, continually deceiving opponents and his fellow villagers, often for prolonged periods of time, proven that none even suspected that the Third Hoshikage had been murdered. His deception and scheming even landed him the position of Substitute Hoshikage. He was also proficient in using a crossbow with deadly accuracy.

Part I

Star Guard Mission

Some time later, Akahoshi called upon the services of
Team Guy
 and
Naruto Uzumaki
 to help protect the meteor. He later posed as the mysterious masked ninja and managed to kidnap
Sumaru
 to lure out the mysterious bandit to use as bait for Natsuhi. When Natsuhi arrived, she and Akahoshi battled each other as Akahoshi sends Shisō and Yotaka to fetch the leaf ninja. Akahoshi used his
Mysterious Peacock Method: Beast
 to knock Naruto and Natsuhi into the Valley of Death, which they managed to secretly get out of using the
Mysterious Peacock Method: Wings
. Akahoshi told
Neji Hyūga
 that Naruto got in the way and that their mission is over.

Akahoshi's true colours were shown to the leaf ninja when
Rock Lee
 and
Tenten
 find Sumaru in his quarters hospitalised and rescued him. Later Naruto and Natsuhi tracked them down by tracking her chakra trail. Akahoshi claimed the meteor after using Sumaru to force Natsuhi to surrender it. Akahoshi then laid a trap at the Star Training Building the which resulted in Natsuhi's death.






Akahoshi fused with the Star.



Akahoshi gave orders to the adult ninja to eliminate Sumaru,
Hokuto
, and the leaf ninja shinobi at first sight. Akahoshi later had the adult ninja fire arrows at the Star Training Building that Sumaru was mourning Natsuhi in. When Hokuto and
Mizura
 exposed the side-effects of the Star Training, the adult ninja turned against Akahoshi, especially in that moment when an insane Akahoshi accidentally confessed that he murdered the Third Hoshikage. Akahoshi proclaimed that he was the Fourth Hoshikage and planted the meteor in his chest to get the meteor's ultimate power. Therefore enabling him to use his
Mysterious Peacock Method: Dragon
. None of the ninja could defeat him until Naruto used the
Rasengan
 to destroy the meteor and defeat Akahoshi with the help of Natsuhi's ghost who was able to save Sumaru. Though he is a prisoner in his own village,
Tsunade
 mentioned that he, Shisō, and Yotaka will be subjected to "severe punishment".
