Tsume Inuzuka
 (
犬塚ツメ
,
Inuzuka Tsume
) is a
tokubetsu jōnin
 of
Konohagakure
, and a member of the
Inuzuka clan
. Her canine companion is
Kuromaru
.

Background

At some point, she apparently scared off her lover and was left to raise her children alone.
 When her son
Kiba
 was a little boy, she gave him
Akamaru
 as his canine companion.

Personality

Tsume is a very tough woman often seen scolding Kiba for his actions, such as not taking his training seriously when he was younger as well as telling him not to underestimate the enemy when they faced
Pain
. Though strict by nature, Tsume clearly cares deeply for her family and the village. According to Kiba, she was responsible for scaring away his father.
 She is also described as being wild and impatient — traits her son also inherited.
 Despite this, Tsume is quite level-headed in battle. This was seen during her fight with the
Preta Path
 where she told her son that they would not allow the enemy to escape. She also has a somewhat "odd" sense of humour displayed when she was poking fun at the Preta Path when it fled, stating that the enemy was afraid of her.

Appearance






Tsume and Kuromaru.



Tsume has an animalistic look similar to that of her son Kiba. She has long, spiky, untamed brown hair, vertical slit-like pupils, elongated canine teeth and nails. She also has the clan fang markings on her cheeks as well as markings over her eyes and wears dark purple lipstick. She wears the standard outfit of a Konoha shinobi consisting of
flak jacket
 and a black suit underneath with the sleeves rolled up and bandages around her legs.

Abilities






Tsume and Kuromaru attacking the Preta Path.



As a member of the Inuzuka clan, Tsume employs the use of
collaborative attacks
 alongside her beloved companion, Kuromaru. She is able to use the clan's
Four Legs Technique
, which allows her manoeuvre with canine-like characteristics. She can also perform the
Fang Passing Fang
 technique alongside Kuromaru, which was powerful enough to send a target crashing into a wall while dealing them extensive damage.
 She also employs the use of
flash bombs
 in order to add a surprise to her attacks. The blinding light allows her and Kuromaru to make use of their heightened sense of smell to locate and attack their targets.

During
Pain's assault
 on Konoha, Tsume and Kuromaru drop a
flash bomb
 and then attacked Pain's Preta Path with Fang Passing Fang, but the Preta Path managed to stop the attack by using the corpse of the former Animal Path as a shield. She was later joined by Kiba and Akamaru as backup, however, the Preta Path fled from them. In the anime, Akamaru uses
Dynamic Marking
 to help track the body's movements. Tsume and Kiba chased after it and just as she and Kuromaru were about to catch it, the Preta Path was summoned away by the Animal Path, so that Pain could use his full-powered
Shinra Tensei
 to level the village. She was later seen with Kiba following the destruction of Konoha along with their hounds. In the anime, she was also later seen celebrating
Naruto Uzumaki
's victory over Pain.
