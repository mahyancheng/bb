While lurking underground, the user grabs a target and drags them into the earth, leaving only their head above the surface. Because victims are rendered unable to move in this state, they are easily subjected to torture or decapitation. Such extreme measures are not required, however;
 when
Kakashi Hatake
 uses this on
Sasuke Uchiha
, it is only to restrain Sasuke. Sasuke is eventually able to free himself.

Trivia

In the
Naruto Collectible Card Game
,
Deidara
 grabbing Sasuke from within his
C1
 bird is labelled as this technique.
