Yūga
 (
ユウガ
) was a shinobi from the
Land of Haze
.

Background

Yūga and his brothers were orphans who found a home in the Land of Haze's orphanage. Despite it being a smaller and impoverished country, they enjoyed having decent meals. They would also often spend their time playing under a large peach tree.

Personality

Like his brothers, Yūga was an extremely committed man. He would willingly sacrifice himself for his brothers and his mission. This came from the hardships of his childhood. Appreciating what it is like to suffer in life, he treasured any small peace of joy he can have.

Abilities






Yūga using Haze Ninja Art: Forbidden Technique: Ephemeral Life.



Yūga was able to use a self-sacrificing technique, the
Haze Ninja Art: Forbidden Technique: Ephemeral Life
. It was a last-ditch technique where a spectre is summoned and allowed to use the user's life force to hold physical form. Upon entering physical form, the creature erects a large, powerful barrier around its targets. It has blitzing speed, power, great resilience and can absorb the chakra from living creatures to gain more power and even recover lost limbs.

Yūga was also quite capable with the
Transformation Technique
, using it to fool others. He also carried a
tantō
, hinting at skill in
kenjutsu
.

New Era

Kara Actuation Arc

Main article:
Kara Actuation Arc

Yūga and his brothers were given a mission to retrieve the cells of the First
Hokage

Hashirama Senju
, which made its way into the black market in the
Land of Silence
. Using their female disguises, Yūga and his brothers attempted to seduce
Kirisaki
 to learn of the location of the cell. However, he lost interest when
Boruto Uzumaki
 arrived himself
taking the appearance of a woman
.






Yūga and Asaka confront Boruto.



Witnessing Boruto and his comrades taking away an unconscious Kirisaki, Yūga and his brothers tracked them to learn that
Sakuya
 had the cell in her possession. Yūga,
Asaka
 and
Hiruga
 successfully sneaked into the castle, thanks to
Yoruga
's
sacrifice
 to bypass the
barrier ninjutsu
 surrounding the castle. Yūga and Asaka managed to locate and kill Sakuya and claim the cell. Boruto arrived and using the opportunity for a getaway, they framed him for the deaths of Sakuya and her butler, but not before the latter alerted the castle guards of her death and alleged culprits. Having successfully escaped the village, Yūga and his remaining brothers mourned Yoruga.

While making their way back to their country, Asaka learned they were being followed, and in order for their mission to be a success, Yūga stayed behind to stall their pursuers. Yūga passed on his earring to Asaka before they part ways. Yūga confronted the
Konohagakure
 shinobi, who had successfully escaped from the Land of Silence, hoping to stall them for his brothers. As Yoruga before him, Yūga sacrificed his life to ensure the success of the mission.

Legacy

Like Yoruga before him, Yūga left his brothers with greater drive to complete the mission and relinquished his earring for it to be hung under the peach tree of their old orphanage.
