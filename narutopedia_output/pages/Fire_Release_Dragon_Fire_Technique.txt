The user spits flames from their mouth that, like a
dragon
's, quickly travel forward in a straight direction. Upon contact with a target, the affected area is engulfed in flames. Whereas the
Great Fireball Technique
 will burn everything in the vicinity, the Dragon Fire Technique is more narrowly focused at its initial target, likened to a projectile.
 When first used by
Sasuke Uchiha
, he uses
wire strings
 to guide the Dragon Fire Technique to his target's face.
 The anime later shows it burning through a line of enemies, with the flames moving from one enemy to the next.
 Despite these two cases, the Dragon Fire Technique seemingly does not require a medium through which to be transmitted.

Trivia

"Ryūka" (
流下
) can also be translated as "downward flow", which fits the nature of this technique.

In
Mission: Protect the Waterfall Village!
, the blaze splits into multiple smaller dragons of fire that strike the foe from multiple directions.

Jiraiya
 uses this technique in "
The New Erotic Ninjutsu Completed!!
", which was later
adapted
 in
Naruto: Shippūden
.
