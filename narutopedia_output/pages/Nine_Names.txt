"
Nine Names
" (
九つの名前
,
Kokonotsu no Namae
) is chapter 572 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

As
Naruto
 and
Kurama
's
Tailed Beast Ball
 collide with those of the opposing
tailed beasts
, both attacks fly upwards and explode. Using the opportunity to
grab
 the beasts by the throat, Naruto sends clones in the initial
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 to grab hold of the
black receivers
. As they do so, the original enters the consciousness of the tailed beasts who had all been waiting there with their respective
jinchūriki
 and is greeted by
Yugito
 who was pleased he had made it to this level. Welcoming him, Naruto and
Yagura
 — whom the former starts pitying believing the former
Mizukage
 to be a child who looked even weaker than Naruto did — have a brief conversation. After learning of
Son Gokū
 and
Rōshi
's fate from
Fū
, he is summoned before the tailed beast and told to stretch out his hand. After
Utakata
 and
Han
 thank Naruto, one by one, tailed beast and jinchūriki alike introduce themselves to Naruto and then "bump fists" with him. Here, Kurama remembers the parting words of
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 and then — as the stakes are removed — asks his fellow tailed beast if they too believed as Son did that Naruto was the one that the Sage had spoken of so long ago. They all affirm them as a shocked
Tobi
 reseals them into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
. Though stating that nothing had changed because of his worn out condition after the
Tailed Beast Mode
 had ended, Naruto refutes Tobi's claim, stating that he had just learned a bunch of difficult names all at once.
