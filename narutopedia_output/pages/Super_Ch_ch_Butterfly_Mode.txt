Synopsis

During a training session,
Chōji
 demonstrates some of their clan's
secret techniques
 to
Chōchō
, but she is distracted watching T.V. Chōchō asks her father to sign a scroll about a background check for an upcoming mission. In
Otogakure
,
Mitsuki
 trains with
Orochimaru
, and also asks him to sign a scroll. Chōji and
Karui
 question Chōchō's interest in soap operas. Later, Chōchō complains about her father to
Sarada
. When Chōchō says she needs to slim down, but won't go on a diet, she shows Sarada her clan's
Butterfly Mode
, which slims her down.
Boruto
 informs
Mitsuki
 their joint mission with
Team 10
 is to bodyguard an actor. The two meet up with Sarada and Chōchō outside of the
Information & Receiving Centre
, but Boruto doesn't recognise Chōchō. On the way to receive their mission, they meet with
Tomaru
 and
Ashina
 from the soap opera Chōchō watches, who are the actors they're supposed to bodyguard.
 At
Naruto
's office,
Shikadai
 and
Inojin
 recognise that Chōchō used a certain jutsu. Tomaru explains that he and Ashina have received death threats over shooting the soap opera. Naruto assigns Team 7 to bodyguard Ashina and Team 10 to bodyguard Tomaru. During shooting, Chōchō tends to Tomaru's needs while acting like she's not interested, while Ashina just bosses Team 7 around. Chōchō keeps pretending in front of Tomaru, which Sarada questions. Tomaru asks Chōchō to take care of a prop ring, which makes her want to marry him. An
Amegakure
 ninja attacks the studio, breaking through a wall. Boruto lands an attack, but it turns out to be a clone, who drops a smokescreen device. He counters Inojin's attack, but Shikadai pins him down. Chōchō returns to her normal weight to attack, but she spots Tomaru. Afraid to show her true self, she slims back down, weakening her strike, and letting the attacker gets away. The producer is worried that because one of the actresses got injured, production will be delayed. Tomaru suggests Chōchō take over the role. Chōchō gets excited when she learns she'll be in a kissing scene.
