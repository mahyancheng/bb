Taji
 (
タジ
) was an
Anbu
 and
medical-nin
 of
Konohagakure
.

Background

As
Biwako Sarutobi
's disciple, Taji was assigned to aid her with delivering
Kushina Uzumaki
's
baby
, making Taji one of the few people to know of the special conditions surrounding the delivery.
 However, shortly after the delivery, both women were killed by
Obito Uchiha
.

Appearance

Taji had shoulder-length brown hair and eyes. When she assisted with Naruto's birth she was seen wearing a standard medical outfit, which consisted of a high-collared outfit with a poufy hat.

Abilities

As a member of the Anbu, Taji was presumably a skilled
kunoichi
. Her being a medical-nin indicates that she had great
chakra control
 and knowledge about
medical ninjutsu
 in general. The fact that she was chosen to assist in a top-secret and highly risky delivery furthermore indicates her skills in that area.

Trivia

When written as "他事", "Taji" means "other matters" or "other people's affairs", while "多時" stands for "lots of time" and "多事" for "eventfulness".
