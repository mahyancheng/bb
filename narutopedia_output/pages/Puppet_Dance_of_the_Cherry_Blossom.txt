Chiyo uses
chakra threads
 to control Sakura and dozens of
kunai
 at the same time. Sakura runs at the opponent and Chiyo launches the kunai behind her, using Sakura to hide them from the opponent's view. At the last second, Sakura is pulled back by the threads, the opponent taking the shower of kunai. Then, Sakura jumps up high and comes down at the opponent preparing a
chakra-enhanced punch
, Chiyo adding extra momentum by pulling her down with the strings. Finally, Sakura punches the opponent creating a gigantic crater.
