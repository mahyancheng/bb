After shooting fire onto the opponent, Tobi uses his
gunbai
 to strengthen the flames, which creates a vortex of fire that knocks them into the air.

Trivia

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
,
Boruto
 is able to replicate this jutsu using the
Shinobi Gauntlet
. Instead of using a gunbai, he uses a
technologically advanced shuriken
 containing a Wind Release ninjutsu.
