Gensui creates a special
sealing tag
 which, if placed on human beings, transforms them into false replications of one of the
tailed beasts
. Not only does the seal shape the victim into the desired tailed beast, but it also grants them the original's abilities. The tag can also replicate the tailed beast's
jinchūriki
 as well.

In order to maintain itself, the technique drains the victim's chakra, leaving them in varying stages of incapacitation, dependent on the technique's duration. Also, while the technique is active, the victim is under the complete control of the user.
