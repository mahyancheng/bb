The
Smoke-Flash Bomb
 (
煙閃光弾
,
Kemuri Senkōdan
) is a Scientific Ninja Weapon, developed by
Katasuke Tōno
 of
Konohagakure
's
Scientific Ninja Weapons Team
. Similar in use to the
smoke
 and
flash bombs
 respectively, this tech dazes the senses by emitting a powerful sound and light. It was powerful enough to block even
Mitsuki
's enhanced senses of sight and hearing. Its major downside, however, is that, as it affects a wide area, allies could also be caught in the blast radius, if not warned beforehand.
