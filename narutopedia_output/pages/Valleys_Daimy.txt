Kara Actuation Arc






Victor meets the Land of Valleys' daimyō.



The daimyō arrived at Victor's company with his retinue for an inspection. The daimyō and
Victor
 discussed
Konoha
's inquires to investigate the company, and the daimyō agreed to protect the company against outsider interference.
Victor's secretary
 took the daimyō and his guards through decontamination processes before entering the company's lab, during which the daimyō was placed under
genjutsu
. Once inside, the daimyō was shown in Victor's research, which he claimed to have cured previously incurable illnesses. His guards broke the genjutsu on him, revealing themselves as
Konohamaru
 and
Mugino
. They explained the truth of Victor's experiments on human subjects. Victor activated his experiment, allowing a recreated
God Tree
 to grow in his lab, which attempted to capture and absorb the chakra of any target it could ensnare. Konohamaru and Mugino protected the daimyō while fighting the tree.

As the tree continued to grow to increase its assault, it managed to ensnare the daimyō, draining most of his chakra before being saved by the Konoha-nin. In a critical state, Mugino was tasked with getting the daimyō to safety as the only credible witness to Victor's crimes. Ultimately, following Victor's defeat, the daimyō survived and brought to light the horrible crimes of the company, leading to its dissolution.
