Trivia

The gameplay in this game is similar to the
Super Smash Bros
 games, and
Jump Super Stars
/
Jump Ultimate Stars
, which are Japan-exclusive games that features many characters from the popular magazine
Weekly Shōnen Jump
. A few Naruto characters were included in them.

The spirit of
Asuma Sarutobi
 appears whenever Shikamaru attacks with his
trench knives
.

Ironically, despite Fukasaku and Shima being playable characters, they still appear when Jiraiya goes into
Sage Mode
, although they appear much smaller than their playable appearances.

There are no voiceclips in versions released outside of Japan.

This was the last Naruto game released for the Nintendo DS.
