The
Lava Release Chakra Mode
 is a heightened state utilised by Rōshi after manifesting one of
Son Gokū
's tails.

Usage

Rōshi envelops his entire body in a coating of lava that enhances the damage of his physical attacks. Due to the extreme heat generated by the lava, he is capable of burning the target without coming into direct contact with them.
 In addition, it can also be used for defensive purposes, as it acts as a deterrent towards those who wish to attack the user physically.
