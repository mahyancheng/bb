The user produces a fog by forcibly extracting all water within the grass, trees, earth and all other living beings throughout the entire area, trapping all within the area in a powerful illusion of themselves. In addition, because of the nature of this technique, it will quickly dehydrate its victims, eventually killing them. The technique can also be condensed to target a single person. If the user is rendered unconscious, the technique will end.
