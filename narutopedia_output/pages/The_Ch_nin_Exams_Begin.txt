Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Arriving in
Amegakure
,
Kakashi
 reveals his identity, and says that he wishes to speak to
Hanzō
. Entering Hanzō's fortress, Kakashi gives him the message sent by
Suna
 and
Konoha
. Unbeknownst to him, Hanzō is actually dead, and is merely
Konan
 in disguise. Telling
Pain
 of the
Chūnin Exams
 co-hosted by the two villages, the
Akatsuki
 leader orders Konan to send a few
genin
 teams to join.
Tsunade
 receives Amegakure's response that they will join the Chūnin Exams, though suspect they might have a secret agenda, and orders
Shizune
 to keep a close watch on the Ame genin.
 Elsewhere in
Takigakure
,
Shibuki
 meets with
Fū
, regarding the invitation of the Chūnin Exams sent by Konoha and Suna, and ultimately agrees for her to participate, but warns her to be cautious. Meanwhile in Sunagakure,
Gaara
 speaks to
Kankurō
, and reveals his intention to supervise the exams, while also wanting to make amends with the rebels against him, much to Kankurō's dismay. Back in Konohagakure, Tsunade informs the
jōnin
 of the impending Chūnin Exams, and asks for them to recommend their respective genin pupils.
Asuma
 recommends his
team
 to take part (excluding
Shikamaru
), and
Ino
 invites
Sakura
 to join because they needed a three-man squad to qualify, but she turns down this request in the fear her non-combat skills may hinder Ino and
Chōji
's chances. However, after realising her capabilities, Sakura decides to participate while
Naruto
 reaches a new step in his training. Meanwhile, all of the genin from other villages participating enter Konohagakure, signifying the start of the Chūnin Exams.
