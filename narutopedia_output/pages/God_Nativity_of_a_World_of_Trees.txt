God: Nativity of a World of Trees
 is a technique used to manipulate the roots of the
God Tree
, spreading them around the entire world to encase those caught within the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 in the roots' bark. By ensnaring all living beings and connecting them to the tree, similar to cocoons, this will keep their now-slumbering bodies alive so long as they remain attached, while sapping their chakra. At the same time, this assimilates every victim to the God Tree, regathering the
chakra
 into one location, in order to sprout a new
fruit
. It is one of the Jutsu with the greatest expansive power, spreading throughout the planet.

The chakra can also be collectively used by the user of this technique, as proven when Madara Uchiha's body began to rapidly absorb the chakra of everyone connected to the tree during his transformation into
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
. Over the course of years,
 humans ensnared by this technique will be drained of their personalities and defining features, reducing them to shells of their former selves and ultimately converting them into
White Zetsu
.
 Simply cutting the victims loose neither wakes them up, nor frees them from the tree, as other branches will relentlessly form and imprison them once again.

Once the Infinite Tsukuyomi is cancelled, the branches, along with any preexisting White Zetsu, wither away and the entrapped people would be freed, assuming they have not already been converted into White Zetsu.
