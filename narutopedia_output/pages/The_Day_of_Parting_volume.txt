 as his equal, both being strong and both knowing what it is to be lonely. However, Sasuke claims that Naruto lacks the power to scratch the forehead protector, and that once he has killed Naruto he will become even stronger. Naruto attacks and Sasuke, his
Sharingan
 having matured, is able to predict his movements and dodge his strikes. He attacks Naruto's openings and repels him. Within Naruto's subconscious, the

 grants him more of its
chakra

 wanted, which Sasuke is not willing to do. Kakashi marvels at the choice of location for Naruto and Sasuke's battle: the

Author's Note

“

My cover image for this volume was inspired by the Nine-Tailed Fox Naruto that appears in the GameCube game,
Clash of Ninja
. They did such an awesome job with the presentation that I couldn't resist imitating it.
