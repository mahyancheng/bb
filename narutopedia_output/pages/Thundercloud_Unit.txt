The
Thundercloud Unit
 is a special backup unit, belonging to the Supply Unit of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 from
Kumogakure
. It is composed of seven members who are well versed in several areas of
bukijutsu
, especially
kenjutsu
, formed by twelve to thirteen years old kids. Despite their young age, they were considered prodigies in their village which earned them a place in the war.

History

During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, the Thundercloud Unit was sent to the
Seventh Front
 in order to back up the Amphibious Search and Destroy Unit, who had been overrun by two thousand
White Zetsu clones
. Sometime during this, they became trapped within a large statue on the battlefield after the White Zetsu used the
surrounding, poisonous red soil
 to create a vast smokescreen of poisonous gas. After speaking with his teammates within the statue,
Yukai
, the leader of the group, and the others emerge to fight the Zetsu and face their fate. In the ensuing fight, Yukai is injured, however,
Omoi
, who had come to rescue them, appears and fights alongside them. At this point, using the
Lightning Release Co-Operation: Thunder Bomb
 technique, the group is able to neutralise and finish off the remaining White Zetsu.
