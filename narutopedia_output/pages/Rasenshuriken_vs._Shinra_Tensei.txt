Rasenshuriken Bāsasu Shinra Tensei!!
) is chapter 441 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Nagato
 is not able to maintain his
Chibaku Tensei
 any longer. It falls apart and
Naruto
, in
Sage Mode
, lands on the ground. Naruto is confused about how he got here, so
Katsuyu
 explains that he succumbed to the
Nine-Tails
 and went on a rampage. Katsuyu assures him that he did not harm anyone and that
Hinata
 is all right. Seeing the
Deva Path
, he asks it to take him to Nagato. It refuses, so Naruto takes one of its
black receivers
 and tracks Nagato's location. He then attacks the Deva Path with a
Rasenshuriken
, trying to hit it while its repulsion powers are recharging.
