Personality

Tatsunami is a rather greedy and cruel person who took advantage of the naive nature of
his boss

shinobi
 from
Konohagakure
 who could foil his plan. Tatsunami has shown dislike for the young ninja, outright calling them fools. Despite the fact that he and Sakanami fight seemingly on an equal footing, it seems that Sakanami is under a little pressure from his comrade, which is especially noticeable when Tatsunami did not help his partner during his defeat by
Metal Lee
 but decided to save the gold instead.
