Amagi Izuno
 (
伊豆野アマギ
,
Izuno Amagi
) is a kunoichi of
Konohagakure
 and the head of the
Izuno Clan
.

Background

As her granddaughter Wasabi grew up, Amagi would often tell her stories of their clan and jutsu. However, as she would make the jutsu sound grander each time she told it, Wasabi stopped believing the story, and came to think of it as something her grandmother made up.

Personality

Like Wasabi's parents, Amagi is a very passionate person, especially towards her granddaughter and her potential. She is likewise very proud of her clan's history and would like to see it flourish. From this, she openly believes Wasabi will be the one to succeed in greatness. At times, she comes off a tad senile, always changing the nature of her stories.

Appearance

Amagi is a short, elderly woman with heavy wrinkles and missing a top, right tooth. She has white hair that is done up in a bun. She wears green robes with a grey shirt over it.

Abilities

As the head of the Izuno Clan, Amagi is presumably well-versed in all of her clan's secret cat-based techniques.

During the finals of the
Chūnin Exams
, Amagi visited Wasabi before her match, and alongside her parents, expressed her confidence in her abilities. Before she left, she gave Wasabi a scroll with the jutsu that featured in the stories she told. In the middle of the match,
Mazuma
 covered Amagi's ears so as not to hear Wasabi confess to
Iwabee
 her lack of faith in her own ability and the pressure she felt from her family's expectations. Amagi was proud and impressed when Wasabi was able to use their clan's jutsu to save Iwabee.
