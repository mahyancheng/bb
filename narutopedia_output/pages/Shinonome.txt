The
Shinonome
 (
東雲
,
literally meaning:
 Dawn) are a series of eight offshore platform power stations constructed by the
Land of Water
, with the assistance from foreign technicians, sometime after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, within the span of a decade. The stations harness the sea for power generation, while pacifying the turbulent water currents as an additional benefit.

The
Funato clan
 saw the Shinonome Project as an insult to the natural order of the ocean, and regarded it as a symbol of the Land of Water's corruption. Upon their declaration of war against the country, they set out to destroy the
Shinonome 1
 (
東雲壱号機
,
Shinonome Ichigōki
), which the
Sixth Mizukage
's forces guarded with a
barrier
 and a fleet.
 In the aftermath war between
Kirigakure
 and the Funato, the Shinonome Project was suspended due to the Land of Water's reckless modernisation, which now sought to get more comprehensive popular support before resuming modernisation efforts.
