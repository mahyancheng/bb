Summary

Kakashi
 regrets the way things have turned out and gathers up
Naruto
. Because of the rain he has lost
Sasuke
's trail, so he carries Naruto back to
Konoha
. Sasuke staggers towards
Orochimaru
, having decided not to kill Naruto. Although that would have given him strength in the form of the
Mangekyō Sharingan
, acquiring it would have been what
Itachi
 wanted, which Sasuke is not willing to do. Kakashi marvels at the choice of location for Naruto and Sasuke's battle: the
Valley of the End
. Their battle being much like the one that formed the valley, Kakashi wonders if battles like this will continue forever. Meanwhile, an
Akatsuki

member
 emerges from the ground and comments on the battle.
