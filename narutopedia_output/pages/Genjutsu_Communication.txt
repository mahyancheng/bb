This technique is a
projection-type genjutsu
 used as a means of communication.

Usage

The members of Kara often use this technique as a means to meet with multiple members at once, compensating for the fact that a group may not always be in close proximity. All the images projected by this technique appear corporeal and even the immediate surroundings can be altered by the user.

Projecting themselves also gives the user awareness of the chosen location, allowing the user to monitor the surrounding area.
 Though the user's movement is sometimes seen reflected in their projection, this does not seem to be necessary in all uses.

Trivia

While being controlled by
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
,
Jigen
's body can perform this technique.

When the genjutsu ends, the image disperses into blue fragments. However, when Ōga used this technique, the fragments were pink.
