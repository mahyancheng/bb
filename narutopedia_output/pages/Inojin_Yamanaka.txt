Inojin Yamanaka
 (
山中いのじん
,
Yamanaka Inojin
) is a
genin
 and a member of
Konohagakure
's
Yamanaka clan
. Together with his teammates
Chōchō Akimichi
 and
Shikadai Nara
, he forms the seventeenth generation of the
Ino–Shika–Chō
 trio.

Background

Inojin is the only child of
Ino
 and
Sai Yamanaka
. As his parents continued to stay close to their childhood friends over the years, Inojin ultimately came to know the various parents' respective kids well. From a young age, Inojin would often have sleepovers with Chōchō and Shikadai, even having matching pyjamas. Their parents would also continue
Asuma Sarutobi
's tradition of taking the kids to
Yakiniku Q
 to celebrate accomplishments.
 On the day of the
Seventh Hokage
's inauguration, he watched the ceremony with his parents and Shikadai.

Personality

Inojin seems rather obedient and the most reasonable of the new generation of the
Ino–Shika–Chō
 trio, as he, unlike his teammates, insisted on going to training to learn the Ino–Shika–Chō techniques. At the same time, he can be very blunt and indifferent to people, situations and the feelings of those involved even to the point of being condescending. He also seems to have inherited the role of being the most motivated of the trio from his mother,
Ino
, and his late grandfather
Inoichi
. Because of his nature, Inojin is a very alert individual with outstanding powers of observation.
 Likewise, he is shown to be a very level-headed and adaptable person, able to calmly accept the surreal nature of a situation and act accordingly.

Despite regularly practising his respective parents' ninjutsu skills, mainly his father's, Inojin is always looking for a newer and more stylish means to go about it. At the same time, he has very simple goals in life, hoping to make more practical use of his skills for better financial gain.
 Later, Inojin developed romantic feelings for
Himawari Uzumaki
.

Appearance






Inojin's full appearance.



Inojin bears a strong resemblance to both his mother and father: he has pale blue eyes and light blond shoulder-length hair which he keeps in a small ponytail, both are traits which feature heavily in his clan. He also inherited his father's pale white skin colour, his hair bangs resemble that of Sai and his attire is also similar to that of his father's: a black collarless suit with red straps and mesh armour and a purple shirt underneath. In his backpack, he carries two items, the handles of which can be seen at each side. As
customary of his clan
, both of his ears are pierced by grey stud earrings.

His outfit as an academy student consisted of a violet sweater and white overalls, regular shinobi sandals and a brown strap to hold his tantō identical to Sai. Three years after Boruto's departure from Konoha, Inojin wore a large, baggy full-sleeved top with a wide, raised collar along with a bag strapped diagonally across his torso from his left shoulder to his right hip. He wore light shorts that reach past his knees and dark, long socks or leggings under his shorts, finished off with light shinobi sandals.

Three years after Boruto left Konoha, Inojin's hair grew out, no longer having a ponytail while it became fuller as it sat atop his head. He also wears a purple sweater, with a beige, single-strap backpack over right shoulder, light blue shorts, black spandex pants, and low, beige sandals with high tongues.

Inojin using Super Beast Imitating Drawing: Modern Era.



Like his mother, Inojin is also a practitioner of
Medical Ninjutsu
.
 While also a
Sensor Type
, Inojin struggles to detect people, having limited range. He can compensate for this with his drawings, using them as a medium to focus his sensing as they're also made with his chakra. He does, however, have a knack for detecting alterations to one's chakra signature.
 As a member his generation's Ino—Shika—Chō, he has become proficient in
Cooperation Ninjutsu

shurikenjutsu
 prowess, able to easily hit the bulls-eye. Inojin is also skilled in
kenjutsu
, wielding a tipless
tantō
 for close-range combat. For his signature skill, Inojin has also been taught the art-oriented techniques of his father, and as such he is able to effectively
animate
 his drawings for various purposes, though his drawing style differs greatly from that of his father's, and even more noticeably, he uses colour in his drawings.
 He can apply
explosive tags
 to his drawings to cause them to detonate when in close proximity of his target.

Fūinjutsu

In the anime, he can effectively use
fūinjutsu
, able to
restrict
 a person's movements, and
reinforce
 fellow users' fūinjutsu.

New Era: Part I

Academy Entrance Arc

Academy Entrance Arc






Inojin takes Iwabee's Jō to stop Iwabee's fight with Boruto.



In the anime, two weeks into his
Academy
 career, Inojin voiced his views on how Boruto was taking advantage of his father's status as Hokage. While Boruto brushed it off and offered to be friends, Inojin noted he doesn't trust Boruto with his nature. Later, he joined the rest of the class to watch the fight between Boruto and
Iwabee Yuino
, which he later
intervened
 as Iwabee decided to
break his word
. Ultimately, Boruto and Inojin's respective words resonated with Iwabee, ending the fight. The following day, Inojin defended Boruto, saying that he was actually trying to make a name for himself away from his father and did what he did for his friends.

After Boruto's failed attempt at shurikenjutsu caused property damage, Inojin and his friends were punished with repairing the damages to the
Hokage Rock
. The day after Shikadai had insulted Lee for his problems with anxiety, Inojin, Boruto and Shikadai found Lee, who was acting unusually aggressive. A fight broke out between them, during which Inojin managed to trick his opponent and get him off his guard with the help of his drawings, which he used to simulate Shikadai's shadows.






Inojin and Shikadai save Boruto and Chōchō from falling.



During a lesson about
summoning
 techniques, Inojin and other boys began bickering with the girls, which Konohamaru broke up. Later during their lunch break, Boruto began to fight with Sarada over who would get the last yakisoba bun. Shino appeared, insisting that they boys and girls settle things with a race challenge for a flag. The challenge quickly got heated, with many of the boys being taken out of the contest until only Boruto, Shikadai, and Inojin were left on their team. Getting desperate, Boruto found a summoning scroll and miraculously summoned a snake-like creature. The creature went on a rampage, attacking the students and launched
Chōchō Akimichi
 off the roof, to which Inojin helped Boruto to save her. After the creature was subdued by the timely arrival of Konohamaru, the contest ended with the girls getting the flag. Despite their victory, the girls made peace with the boys.

After their
sensei
 ends classes early due to the impending
Five Kage Summit
, Inojin tried to convince his teammates Chōchō and
Shikadai
 to go training with them. However, they both casually shirk their training opting to eat instead and claiming it was too troublesome respectively. Ultimately, he went to the training field alone, but was afraid to confront his upset mother and hid behind a tree instead contemplating how best to approach the situation. Later, the class gained a new transfer student from
Otogakure
 named
Mitsuki
. Wanting the students to warm up to Mitsuki, Shino organised a welcoming party for the new student. When Shino's efforts for the party backfired with his insects, the class began to freak out, with Denki begging someone to make the insects go away, which Mitsuki did with his
Wind Release: Breakthrough
, causing even more damage to the Academy.






Inojin and Metal Lee visit the Fire Department.



Later, the class was assigned by Shino to split into groups of three and each tail a different workplace for a few days to better understand non-shinobi life. Inojin joined Lee in gong to the Fire Department. While tailing their work, Inojin watched in embarrassment as Lee's social anxiety caused him to spray a fire-hose about the place randomly. Later, Inojin checked on some of his friends after learning that they were hospitalised from a recent attack. After completing his assignment with the fire department, Inojin and Lee were approached by Shikadai, who recruited them to stop the attacker. Inojin and his friends the met up at the post office to discuss their plan. After splitting up to patrol the village, the culprit of the attacks unleashed their
Shadow Spectre
 on the post chief
Komame
. Inojin's group however quickly appeared, having anticipated this move as all their recent efforts were clearly being spied on. While half the team stayed to save the possessed Komame, Inojin's half pursued the masked culprit. While the post chief was saved, the spectre and the culprit ultimately got away. When another attack came, the area was closed off. Inojin, along with Denki and Shikadai, wondered where Boruto was, along with the missing Sumire. The following morning, they found Boruto, along with Sumire and Mitsuki in the field. They were soon joined by Sai and his unit, who took Sumire in for question. As Denki asked what happened, Boruto happily brushed it off, saying everything was fine.

Several weeks later, Shino decided to change up the three-man teams for their next challenge to determine the optimum pairings for graduation. Inojin teamed up Chōchō and Shikadai. When Iwabee noted that they were essentially forming the Ino-Shika-Chō trio like their respective parents, the team admitted that their techniques were naturally compatible. Later, Inojin told his friends that his father has gathered files on Academies in other villages, making Shikadai wonder if Sumire was going to leave the Academy. During the team challenge to capture the flag, Inojin distracted Mitsuki long enough to let Shikadai pin Mitsuki down, but escaped with a launched needle. Mitsuki created a distraction long enough for Boruto win the challenge. Shino was then called aside concerning Sumire. As the class began discussing rumours that Sumire was being transferred to a different school, they were relieved to see her return to their class.

Inojin photocopies Super Beast Imitating Drawing.



In the anime, after returning to Konoha, Inojin began photocopying his
Super Beast Imitating Drawing

Team 10 training for the Chūnin Exams with Temari.



As Moegi presented the
Chūnin Exams
 application papers to Inojin and his teammates, he and Shikadai had doubts about entering as they considered themselves rookies. Having cold feet about the situation, Moegi resorted to handing the pair letters from their mothers, which frighteningly persuaded them to take part in the exams. Remembering that they organised to meet up with Boruto, the boys hurried off to
Lightning Burger
. There, the three genin play a video game together. When Boruto offers to give them his data to make the game easier, Inojin reacts with disappointment, along with Shikadai to find that Boruto had been cheating while they were playing.

Following attending the entrance ceremony for the Chūnin Exams, the three raced towards the first exam venue in the time provided in order to not get eliminated. Bypassing all traps and obstacles on their route, the team made it to Exam Venue B. There, the team participated in a true or false question given by Sai, which resulted in all competitors falling into a pit that contained a pool of ink. Having been

A ransom was left that demanded 20 million ryō and for Ashina to be the one to deliver it. During the exchange, as Konohamaru already captured the attacker and disguised himself as the Ame-nin, Ashina was revealed to be the mastermind behind the assaults as she desperately wanted to rekindle her fame as an actress. In a last blind effort to keep her fame by burying the truth, she attempted to blow up the area. While Konohomaru stopped her from using them, the explosive tags went off, causing a landslide, which the Konoha-nin quickly saved the spectators from. Afterwards, Ashina was arrested.

Mitsuki's Disappearance Arc

Mitsuki's Disappearance Arc






Team 10 blocks Boruto and Saradas' path.



In the anime, after Mitsuki's apparent betrayal of Konohagakure, the village was put on lockdown. Despite this, Boruto and Sarada decided to sneak out to find Mitsuki. Team 10 was assigned to find and bring back the two genin. The following day, they managed to intercept them. As the two refused to come back peacefully, they created a distraction and then attempted a decoy with Boruto's shadow clones. This succeeded in splitting up Team Moegi between the jōnin and her students. Sarada and Boruto were soon intercepted by their friends, who through Shikadai's strategy easily anticipated Sarada and Boruto's tactics to quickly subdue them. While ready to take them back, Shikadai noticed the snake. Once learning that a message was left on it from Mitsuki, Shikadai realised that the situation had to many inconsistencies to brand Mitsuki a traitor. Wanting to find answers, Shikadai convinced his team-mates to help Boruto and Sarada.

Eventually, they found themselves in a foggy canyon. As they began wondering about aimlessly, they found a large palace, assuming that it must be the Ryūchi Cave. Inside, they found to their surprise a very lavished setting and were greeted by a beautiful young woman. Saying the White Snake Sage was expecting them, the woman invited them to a large feast. As the others began to enjoy themselves, the woman insisted that after they eat, they could ask the sage about Mitsuki. Boruto realised the woman was deceiving them as he never mentioned Mitsuki by name. The woman revealed herself to be a snake creature and the palace and food were but illusions to test the guests. Applauding Boruto's fortitude, she explained that to see the sage, one must past a series of tests, if they fail, the snake servants may eat the guests. As only Boruto wished to speak with the sage, Inojin and the others were separated from him and knocked out. Ultimately, proving his resolve, Boruto passed the other tests.

Once Inojin and the others were reunited with Boruto they met with the White Snake Sage, surprised to see that she was a small and frail-looking reptilian woman. While surprised that someone would risk meeting with her for something other than learning senjutsu, the sage insisted that she couldn't help give answers beyond mastery of senjutsu. Boruto refused to give up, begging the sage to reconsider. Giving in to Boruto's stubbornness, the sage agreed to help analyse Mitsuki's snake only if they first brought to her the Reverse Scale of the giant snake Garaga, who was located in the most dangerous part of the cave. Boruto and the group accepted.

In their journey through the cave, they found several massive stone snake statue before ultimately being attacked by
Garaga
. The genin attempted to hold their ground but were quickly overpowered by the massive foe. As the rampaging snake attacked Sarada, another massive snake appeared to stop him. After the genin retreated to safety, the other snake appeared again, revealing himself as
Aoda
, Sasuke's personal summoning. As Aoda made his peaceful intentions known the group explained their goal of acquiring Garaga's Reverse Scale on the request of the
White Snake Sage
 to get her help in finding
Mitsuki
. Aoda was reluctant as Garaga's savage nature made all other inhabitants of Ryūchi Cave stay clear of him, but nonetheless agreed to help Sarada. Following Shikadai's plan, they were initially able to pin down Garaga after Inojin blinded it with his Super Beast Imitating Drawing, until the rampaging foe used his spit to petrify
Chōchō Akimichi
.

As Aoda was too battered to continue, Inojin and the others continued their pursuit for the Reverse Scale. Ultimately, Boruto learned Garaga's aggressive nature and disdain for humans came from a past betrayal of one. As Boruto offered the giant snake to enter a summoning contract with him on the grounds that if Boruto failed to make Mitsuki come back, Garaga could eat him. Agreeing this bet, Garaga returned Chōchō to normal and presented himself before the White Snake Sage. Accepting that Boruto upheld his part of the deal, the sage revealed the secret thoughts inside Mitsuki's snake, revealing that Mitsuki feigned killing a guard to save his life. Still unclear why Mitsuki joined the attackers but knowing where he went headed off to the Land of Earth.

As the group began to approach the Land of Earth's border, Shikadai had Inojin and Chōchō to return to the village to report their findings. Along the way, the two found a group of jōnin paralysed on the field. They decided to investigate. Following this, Inojin and Chōchō turned back to help their friends. They arrived in time as they struggled against
Kokuyō
. The Ino-Shika-Chō trio decided to hold off the artificial man while Boruto and Sarada went on ahead. Despite their perfect team formations, the enemy was able to repel all of them. Ultimately, the trio was forced to retreat. The trio soon after caught up to their friends, where they learned of Mitsuki's betrayal upon attacking Boruto and leaving with the enemies.

While caring for Boruto, Inojin discovered a miniature and imperfect
Akuta
 that became very fond of him. After Boruto awoke, the group discussed whether to return to Konohagakure with their findings, or push forward to find the truth about these new enemies that posed a threat to the peaceful times. Ultimately, it was agreed to go venture on to Iwagakure and retrieve Mitsuki. Boruto suggested that go seek the help of
Ōnoki
. Upon arriving outside the village, Inojin was chosen to stay behind as the Akuta with them would draw too much attention. While hiding in a cave, realising that the tiny creature didn't like being called an "Akuta", Inojin decided to give it a new name of
Akkun
, which it liked while Inojin himself became more attached to the creature. Inojin began attempting to teach it his friends' names, but only could refer to them in silly nicknames.

Deciding that they waited long enough, the group decided to look for their friends. They instead found an injured Akatsuchi. They then noticed an explosion. Realising that it could be their friends, Inojin was chosen to take Akatsuchi back to the cave while Sarada and Chōchō went to investigate. Back at the cave, the hideout was found out by
Kirara
. As she attacked Akkun, Inojin tried to defend it and seal her, only to be subdued by her genjutsu. Inojin was used as a pawn to get close to Boruto and the others, where he quickly subdued his friend.

Inojin was detained himself when the genjutsu was undone. He was brought back with his fellow captured genin and Ōnoki to the village. Once arriving, they learned that all of Iwagakure was taken over by Kū as an extra measure to keep the outside world from learning of their plans. When contorting the second-in-command, he voiced his desire to transplant human hearts into the Fabrications as it would sustain them. Ōnoki however refused on the grounds that it went against the purpose of his goal for saving lives. Deciding that Ōnoki was to sentimental to see the bigger picture, Kū usurped the Third Tsuchikage. Before Kū could move forward with his plan, Shikadai appeared, using a diversion to help his friends escape.






Inojin makes a grave for Akkun.



They were soon intercepted by Kokuyō. Inojin and his team-mates decided to face the foe while Boruto and Sarada moved on. Kokuyō's advanced physical prowess quickly adapted to the Ino-Shika-Chō's previously shown attack patterns and forced them back. Using a plan of Shikadai, they were able to lead Kokuyō into a trap. While nearly working, the foe proved to strong and moved in to finish Inojin. Instead, Inojin was saved by the efforts of Akkun. The creature's efforts let Chōchō land the final blow to finish their foe, but not before Akkun was struck down. Inojin held his fallen friend closing, chastising him for being so reckless and wept as the tiny Akuta crumbled into dust. Ultimately, the
Fabrications
 were defeated, thanks to the personal sacrifice of the Third Tsuchikage. While wanting to stay for the funeral, Naruto sent Inojin and his friends back to Konohagakure. Before leaving, Inojin made a grave for Akkun, placing the remains of its mask and a drawing of the Akuta on top.

 to search for Urashiki's remaining puppet in the Land of Wind. On the way to the mission, Inojin's team decided to stop for a bit to eat, where they bumped into

While Shikadai was the highest ranking ninja of the group as a chūnin, they decided to let Shinki lead the way as he knew the area better. Upon discovering the puppet, they were encountered by Deepa, who demanded to be given the puppet. When they refused, he
pelted
 them with a barrage of carbon cubes that even Shinki's Iron Sand Wall couldn't completely resist. Shikadai developed a strategy to detain Deepa long enough for Shinki to strike. While seemingly working, Shinki's Black Iron Fist was completely ineffective against Deepa's super durable body, who swiftly defeated them. Shinki used the last of his strength to destroy the puppet rather than let Deepa have it, and Deepa let them live.

After returning to the village and reporting what happened, Inojin and Chōchō were convinced by Shikadai to help Boruto in his training to defeat Deepa's durable body. Shikadai decided that the key was focusing Boruto's Rasengan's power on a key point. Despite their long hours of effort, they had little success. Ultimately, Inojin had to call it a day as it was getting late and didn't want to face his mother's fury.

Later, after Boruto and his team's victory over Deepa, Inojin and his friends found Denki setting up an experiment to improve radio communications. Inojin and the others decided to help him with the work. It ultimately worked, but failed to maintain stability. Denki however remained determined to improve the technology. Inojin joined everyone in cheering.






Inojin learns about Inoichi's will.



When Ino decided to perform a trial run of the newly overhauled sensing system, Inojin was asked to participate, along all other shinobi with sensing skills. He was paired up with fellow clansman
Kohan
, and learned that his friends Boruto and Shikadai would also participate as mock intruders. During the morning, he underpeformed, and was unable to apprehend a single target. Ino apologised for making him take part in the test when he had little interest in sensing. He confessed to his father he thought his mother was disappointed in him, so Sai explained that her dedication to sensing comes from looking up to her father, who died in the Fourth Shinobi World War. During the afternoon, after Kohan gave him a few pointers, he detected a strange, registered chakra signature. After investigating with Boruto and Shikadai, they discovered a recent addition to the Bingo Book had mimicked a registered chakra signature to avoid detection. Inojin was able to extend his sensing range through his Super Beast Imitating Drawing, and the three were able to capture the intruder. His discovery was deemed valuable and the sensing system was modified to account for it. Inojin asked Ino if she was going to quite Yamanaka Flowers, but she assured him she treasured both jobs, and encouraged him to do what he enjoyed.

Team 10 heard that a village archive was attacked and data was stolen. Inojin noted that according to his mother, there was no tampering with the
Sensing Barrier
 around the village. They realised that this might be an inside job, and decided to investigate. To their luck, they soon found the thief's hideout. They also discovered Kakashi performing his own investigation, who decided to work with the genin. They found the culprit,
Koji Kashin
, who escaped into the sewers. As Kakashi followed the man, he had the genin report their findings to the officials. Ultimately, Koji was able to escape. While Team 10 was upset at their loss, they did take comfort in knowing they stopped Koji from stealing more data.

While the Ino-Shika-Chō trio were training, they were approached

Chūnin Re-Examination Arc

In the anime, following
Isshiki
's attack, Naruto decided to host another Chūnin Exam to boost morale and promote more chūnin. Inojin passed the first, written exam, and slipped Chōchō answers with his art. While not as invested in becoming chūnin, as being in Shikadai's team already allowed him to take on higher rank missions, Shikadai reminded him that as chūnin, his pay for each mission would also increase. During the second exam, in the
Forest of Death
, he had to rescue an injured ally within an allotted time limit. Inojin was able to succeed, and was one of 10 genin the pass the exam. He would have to fight an one-on-one battle with one of the other 9 as a final exam.

The following day, as everyone prepared for the finals in their own way, Inojin joined his team-mates for a meal. Afterwards, with Shikadai paying for everyone' meal, it became clear that secretly, Shikadai was eager for his team-mates to advance with him. This prompted Inojin to get more earnest in his preparations. The day of the final exam, the first match pitted Inojin against
Hōki Taketori
, one of Sai's genin. Hōki quickly disoriented Inojin by turning the arena into a maze, creating blind spots from which he attacked Inojin. Having spent too much chakra, Inojin tricked Hōki into attacking from a known position, putting him on the path of his Mind Body Switch Technique. However, Hōki's Anbu training under Sai allowed him to
repel
 the jutsu and subdue Inojin, winning the match. Inojin's team-mates checked on him, while Hōki helped him up, thanking him for pushing him to give his all. The two shook hands. Inojin took to the stands to watch the remaining matches.

Before the third match, between Chōchō and Sarada, Shikadai found Inojin sulking about his defeat. When Chōchō arrived, distressed at having to fight her best friend, Inojin reminded her of their promise to stand as equals with Shikadai. After Chōchō's loss, while she was happy for her friend, she cried with her team-mates for failing to keep her promise. They consoled her, with Inojin pointing out it would be better for them to be promoted at the same time, so as not to stand out with Shikadai, cheering her up. By the end of the exams, Inojin cheered for his friends as they were officially promoted. Later, Inojin joined his team at Yakiniku Q to celebrate their efforts.

Later, as Kawaki was being tested to earn qualification as a genin, he was put alongside various team, constantly showing poor teamwork. When he was assigned an escort mission alongside Team 10.

Main article:
Boruto's Return Arc

Three years later, Inojin and his team were helping Himawari with her shinobi training. They were still amazed how Himawari continued to view Boruto as a good person who didn't kill her parents and needed her help.

When
Code
 attacked the village, looking for Boruto, he unleashed his
Claw Grimes
. Inojin joined his team and Himawari to defend the village, taking to the sky on his drawings with Himawari. He picked one grime who targeted Chōchō from behind, but it slashed his ink bird's wing with its tail, the loss of balance throwing Himawari off. Inojin jumped to catch while Kawaki arrive to fight the grime, as their numbers increased.

Once all the grimes were defeated, Team 10 and Himawari joined Kawaki to face Boruto and Code. As Boruto was able to
subdue
 Code an interrogate him for the Ten-Tail's location, another Claw Grime then emerges from Code. As Kawaki strikes it down, Code uses it to teleport away. Shikadai noted that Code may still be in the village. Team 10 and Himawari then went to work looking. They later learned that a Claw Grime had consumed
Moegi
 and transformed into a small tree to contain and steal her chakra. Inojin and his team vowed to free her. When
Jura
 and
Hidari
 invaded Konoha, they met with Team 10, who was with Himawari, having mistaken her for Naruto over the presence of tailed beast chakra in her. Inojin assured Himawari he'd protect her.






Inojin being impaled.



Jura quickly recognised who Shikadai was from previous research. The sentient God Tree revealed that he was here for Naruto, yet was instead drawn to Himawari because she somehow had
Kurama
's chakra. Deciding to follow through initial direction, Jura ensnared Himawari with his Wood Release. Team 10 used their formation to save her. When Jura suddenly unleashed a powerful Tailed Beast Ball, which Team 10 narrowly deflected safely away, it was decided to leave the village with Himawari, knowing that the enemies wouldn't launch such attacks near Himawari as they desired her now. Ultimately, Jura caught up and grounded them. As Himawari was captured, Inojin tried to save her, only be impaled by Jura's Wood Release. The sight of this caused Himawari to unleash a new power and break free, revealing herself as the new Jinchūriki of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox. Using her newfound power, Himawari healed Inojin and his team-mates took him away from the battle for safety.

After the God Trees retreated, Inojin was brought to the hospital, where he was looked over by Sakura, proclaiming him fine as he slept.

Post Matsuri and Ryū Arc

After Inojin visited Himawari’s home to deliver her favorite rare honey, he was confronted by one of Koji's
toads
. The toad initiated a conversation, noting Injoin's romantic interest toward Himawari, which greatly flustered Inojin. From this, it asked Inojin if he desired to protect her. Inojin confirmed without hesitation. Immediately, Inojin was transported to Koji, who formally introduced himself alongside Boruto. Both requested Inojin’s assistance, assuring him that they would safely return him to Konoha. Inojin performed the
Mind Body Transmission Technique
, which enabled Koji to secretly communicate with Shikamaru during a meeting with the village elders.

Following the meeting, Inojin expressed concern that he had violated several protocol by facilitating the secret communication. Koji reassured him that the situation allowed no alternative against their enemies and declared that Inojin was now part of their group. Boruto then instructed Inojin to consider what he needed to fight, he concluded in order for him to protect Himawari both power and resolve were necessary to defeat Jura.

Later, Inojin helped Koji contact Shikamaru again. Koji explained how the Human God Tree,
Mamushi
, would attack the village soon. He warned everyone about his
Division
 ability and how to best deal with it. When Inojin suggested they attack Mamushi before he arrives in the village, Koji said facing him in the village would be their best chance to defeat Mamushi because he would be more restricting in battle, fearing damage to Konoha and angering Jura, who came to enjoy the village's environment. Koji then tells Inojin that he needed to master a new technique, a superior version of the Mind Body Transmission Technique, within just 2 days before Mamushi arrives in Konoha, as he believed this new jutsu will be a key factor in defeating Mamushi. Puzzled, Inojin expressed his doubts about being able to master a new jutsu in such a short time. Koji then reveals to him that it is a jutsu he had created on his own in an alternate timeline to avenge Himawari, therefore it is well within his potential. Motivated by this, Inojin vowed to learn it in just a single day in order to prevent a tragic future for Himawari. Afterwards, Inojin connected Shikamaru to Konohamaru, who admitted to the Jōnin that he freed Boruto and was working with Koji and asked Konohamaru to help them.
