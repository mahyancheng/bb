Kakashi
 and
Obito
 use
Kamui
 to transport the opponent inside their
pocket dimension
, where they strike their target with a series of cooperative
taijutsu
 attacks. After gaining enough distance, Obito creates a
Black Receiver
, through which Kakashi channels his
Lightning Cutter
. Obito launches the receiver, electrocuting and piercing them, both with the thrown receiver and the new ones which branch from it upon impact.
