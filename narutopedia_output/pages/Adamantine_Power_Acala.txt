Hashirama kicks the opponent away and raises some wood tendrils to strike the enemy down. With the opponent layed on the ground, Hashirama gathers a large amount of chakra into his right fist, jumps and drives it into his foe's torso. The impact causes the ground to break apart and a small forest to erupt from it.
