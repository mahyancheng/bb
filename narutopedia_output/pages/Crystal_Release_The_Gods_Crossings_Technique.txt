Guren places her hand on a surface, creating a long stream of sharp blue crystals to bind and pierce a target.

Influence

The name of this technique comes from a natural phenomenon that occurs in
Lake Suwa
 in Japan's
Nagano Prefecture
. In winter, the lake's surface freezes over, but because of a natural hot spring under the lake, the lower waters remain warm and circulating. This causes pressure ridges to appear on the ice, reaching heights of 30 centimetres or more. Local belief holds that these ridges are formed by gods crossing the lake to visit the various buildings of the twelve centuries old
Suwa Grand Shrine
.
