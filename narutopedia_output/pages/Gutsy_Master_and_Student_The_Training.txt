"
Gutsy Master and Student: The Training
" (
ド根性師弟修業編
,
Dokonjō Shitei Shugyōhen
) is episode 187 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

While recovering from his injuries after having
fought

Sasuke
,
Naruto
 is
visited
 by
Jiraiya
, who tells him that as soon as he is discharged from the
hospital
, they would be leaving
Konoha
 for three years in order to train. Jiraiya advises that Naruto train solely to fight off the
Akatsuki
 and that he would be a fool to chase Sasuke, but Naruto declares proudly that he is a fool. As Naruto recovers, the two set off on their journey.

Elsewhere, Jiraiya attempts to teach Naruto how to break out of a
genjutsu
 illusion, since Sasuke would most likely be learning how to master
genjutsu
 using his
Sharingan
. As Naruto practises all night, Jiraiya recalls how he
told
 Naruto that he bore a striking resemblance to the
Fourth Hokage
 and thinks back upon Naruto's parents, Minato and
Kushina
. The next day, Jiraiya
summons

Gamariki
 to inflict his
Genjutsu Kiss
 on Naruto, advising Naruto to rotate his
chakra
 from within in order to disturb his chakra flow, thus breaking out of the genjutsu. Instead, Naruto rotates his chakra externally and hits Gamariki.

In order to hone Naruto's skills, Jiraiya and Naruto head to the
Genjutsu Tree Village
, where the trees give off a magnetic field that induces genjutsu. However, they discover that the entire village has been taken over by
Kandachi
, who is keeping the women and children hostage after killing
Sukune
, the village's former leader. In order to defeat Kandachi, Naruto transforms into
Tanishi
, the child who had notified them of the village's crisis, and ties up Jiraiya, pretending that he had caught Jiraiya as his prisoner. The two are then escorted to the lake, where Kandachi resides and where the prisoners are held.

Trivia

When
Naruto
 looks at
Hokage Rock
 before leaving with
Jiraiya
,
Tsunade
's face is next to
Minato
's, even though it wasn't there when they left at the end of Part I. In fact, when Naruto
returned
 to
Konoha
, he claimed that the only thing different about the village was that Tsunade's face was now engraved on the rock.
