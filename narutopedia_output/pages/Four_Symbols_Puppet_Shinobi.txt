 members are given a special human-shaped seal created by Nagato that takes a physical form known as the
Four Symbols Puppet Shinobi
, to fight or stall the enemy. The Puppet Shinobi goes to a faraway location to create numerous copies of itself. The only way to break the technique is to stop the Puppet Shinobi source.
