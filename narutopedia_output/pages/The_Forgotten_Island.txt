 anime.

Synopsis

While on their voyage to the
Land of Lightning
, a giant bird swoops down and kidnaps
Guy
. The team pursues the bird and are led to a
volcanic island
. Upon arrival,
Aoba
 spots a
mysterious girl
 watching them and decides to pursue her while Yamato and Naruto search for Guy. During their search,
Naruto
 and
Yamato
 encounter many giant creatures, including the bird that kidnapped Guy. They eventually locate the bird's nest where they find Guy, who was actually kidnapped to babysit the bird's chicks. Meanwhile, as Aoba pursues the girl, he discovers the animals on the island were actually bred to be used by
shinobi
 as
summons
, as well as for research dedicated to developing the
Ultimate Summoning Beast
. He continues to follow her, and she leads him inside the volcano to find a huge monster asleep inside an abandoned research lab. Using the
Psycho Mind Transmission
 technique, he discovers the monster was too powerful to be contained and had devoured many of the islands summons, as well as the researchers, before going to sleep.

Meanwhile, the bird takes Yamato, Guy, and Naruto to the volcano where they encounter Aoba, and the beast suddenly awakens, going on a rampage. The monster is powerful and uses
genjutsu
 as well as
Lightning Release
. Naruto decides to enter
Sage Mode
 while Yamato
protects
 him as Guy and Aoba fight the beast in order to buy some time. Guy manages to knock the beast into the heart of the volcano, but the monster is revealed to have wings, and it starts trying to escape. The bird which kidnapped Guy comes down and attacks the monster along with the other summons. The girl, actually the spirit of Honoka whom the researchers used to restrain the beast, appears and manages to immobilise the beast; Naruto finishes it off with
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
, knocking it into the volcanic lava and killing it once and for all.

Trivia

In this episode, when Naruto goes into
Sage Mode
, his canines become elongated, akin to his
Nine-Tails
 transformation.

When the summoning animals were trying to prevent the Ultimate Summoning Beast from escaping the volcano, a couple of chameleons bearing a striking resemblance to
Pain
's
Giant Snake-Tailed Chameleon
 can be seen.
