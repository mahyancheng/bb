 returns from the
other dimension
 victorious; having successfully obtained his missing
Rinnegan
. As
Naruto
 calls out to
Obito
,
Black Zetsu
 declares that he had taken the
Uchiha
's body for his own, all the while chastising Obito's desires for Naruto to succeed as childish. Reflecting upon how she always took a spectatory role in everything,
Sakura
 resolves to create an opening diversion and activates her
Ninja Art Creation Rebirth — Strength of a Hundred Technique
 attacking Madara head on.
 Her attacks fails to land on Madara, however, as she is stopped by an
invisible force
. Retrieved by Naruto and
Sasuke
, the latter is able to quickly deduce that Madara now is using four shadows after noticing that his attack was ineffective as well. Madara goes on the offence, activating multiple
Chibaku Tensei
, and attempts to drop the massive earthen debris on his opponents. Naruto and Sasuke are quick to counter-attack using a
Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshuriken
 and
Complete Body — Susanoo
 respectively with four of Naruto's
shadow clones
 confronting Madara's shadows. Despite these efforts, Madara manages to achieve his goal, recalling the text recorded on the
stone tablet
, and having neared the
moon
 sufficiently, he removes the plating from his forehead revealing a
third eye
, much like
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
. Turning to the moon, Madara casts the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 which reflects the
dōjutsu
 from its surface.
