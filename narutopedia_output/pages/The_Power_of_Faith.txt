Naruto
 manga.

Summary

After taking the first of the
Three Coloured Pills
,
Chōji
 is able to match
Jirōbō
 in physical strength. They exchange blows, but Chōji quickly begins to feel the strain of taking the pill. As they leave the area the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 wonders if Chōji can defeat Jirōbō, but
Shikamaru
 informs them that one-on-one battles are perhaps the best they can hope for and that Chōji, who considers himself as the weakest of the team, is doing his part now. Shikamaru adds that he is wrong to think so, as Chōji is actually the strongest. Jirōbō activates the first stage of his
cursed seal
 to overpower Chōji and observes that he has been abandoned by the rest of his team. Determined to prove Jirōbō wrong and to avoid disappointing Shikamaru, Chōji takes the second pill, the yellow Curry Pill (
カレー丸
,
Karēgan
), to increase his size to gigantic proportions.
