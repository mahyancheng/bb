"
Obito and Madara
" (
オビトとマダラ
,
Obito to Madara
) is episode 344 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

An unmasked
Obito
 is joined by
Madara
, who was assumed to still be battling the five
Kage
. This leads
Naruto
 to immediately question Madara of their condition. Madara nonchalantly responds that they are "
not doing so well
".
Tsunade
, even though bisected, uses her remaining strength to summon
Katsuyu
, saying she could still save the other Kage. As the two
Uchiha
 converse about the progress of their
plans
, Madara wonders why he was not revived as a living person, to which Obito notes
Nagato
 had
betrayed
 them and used the
Outer Path — Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 on the
Konoha

shinobi
 instead.
 Naruto attacks Madara, enraged at the fact that he used Nagato. The Uchiha easily counters with his
gunbai
 and
attacks
; his fan triggering a beam of light that sends Naruto flying back, revealing that the Naruto who had attacked Madara was in fact a shadow clone. Madara prepares to take on Naruto, leaving Obito to deal with
Guy
 and
Kakashi
. Meanwhile, Obito recalls his first ever meeting with an elderly Madara, who had saved him from beneath the boulders. As Madara tells the younger Uchiha of his goals to
unify the world
, Obito — uninterested — attempts to escape, eager to meet his teammates once again.

Trivia

When Naruto asked Madara about the Kage status,
Gaara
 was not seen on-screen at first. After Tsunade summoned Katsuyu, he was shown just like the other Kage.

Obito's scar on his face is on the right side but here it's on his left side.
