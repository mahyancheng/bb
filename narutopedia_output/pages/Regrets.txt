Viz:
 Regret) is chapter 647 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

En route
 to the main battlefield, the five
Kage
 see the tree form of the
Ten-Tails
 and wonder just what it was, which leads
Tsunade
 to ask
Katsuyu
 to explain exactly what was happening where its other divisions were. When
Shikamaru
 is found to be one of the victims of the tree's attack, Sakura tries to have Katsuyu heal him
remotely
, but Katsuyu informs her that its clones also died due to having their chakra absorbed, leading the
medical-nin
 and
Sai
 to rush to her comrade's side instead. The
Allied Shinobi Forces
 members spiral into despair, and taking advantage of the all-time-low morale,
Obito
 declares that he would not kill those who stopped resisting, but
Hashirama
's
wood clone
 reminds them not to give up because the fate Obito wanted for them was no less worse than death.
Hiruzen
's sentiments cause
Orochimaru
 — who had just arrived with
Suigetsu
 and
Karin
 in tow — to note that pessimism was very out of character for his sensei. As
Madara
 and
Hashirama
 continued to fight, the Uchiha reveals that even without the full chakra of the Eight and Nine-Tails, the tree form of the Ten-Tails would bloom in approximately fifteen minutes, during which Madara planned to take Obito's place using Hashirama's
senjutsu
 abilities.
 As the info is relayed to him, Hashirama's
wood clone
 called out for a
Yamanaka
, and while startled,
Ino
 responds and on the command of the First,
patches
 him through to the Alliance. Connected, the clone passes on the recent revelation, and also tries to boost the shinobi's morale, telling them decisively to not give up. As the tree moves again to attack, a large chunk of its root is cut off by a
Susanoo
-clad
Sasuke
, who asks Naruto if he had already reached the limit of his capacity. Responding to his friend's question, Naruto once again enters both
Tailed Beast Mode
 and
Sage Mode
 and through Ino's technique, his feelings and memories are conveyed to everyone. Remembering his time as a child and the people he had lost along the way, Naruto notes that he did not want to have any more regrets and that the sacrifices made would not be in vain.
