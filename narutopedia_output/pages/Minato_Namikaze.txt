Namikaze Minato
) was the
Fourth
Hokage
 (
四代目火影
,
Yondaime Hokage
,
literally meaning:
 Fourth Fire Shadow) of
Konohagakure
. He was renowned all over the world as
Konoha's Yellow Flash
 (
木ノ葉の黄色い閃光
,
Konoha no Kiiroi Senkō
,
English TV:
 Yellow Flash of the Leaf). He died during the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
, sacrificing his life to
seal
 a half of the
Nine-Tails
 into himself and the other half into his newborn son,
Naruto Uzumaki
.

Background

Early life






Minato in Team 6.



Minato entered Konoha's
Academy
 with the dream of earning the villagers' respect and recognition by becoming Hokage.
 When
Kushina Uzumaki
 moved to Konoha, she was placed in the same class as Minato. Minato was immediately drawn to her bright red hair, finding it beautiful. Minato was a natural prodigy as a ninja, the likes of which appears only once in a generation.
 When he was added to a
genin
 unit,
Team 6
, under the leadership of
Jiraiya
. The Sannin took a special interest in Minato and took him on as his apprentice, teaching him many of his own signature abilities.
 In time, Minato's exceptional skills led Jiraiya to believe he might be the
Child of the Prophecy
, someone who would someday save the world.






Minato rescues Kushina.



Years later, after they graduated and became ninja, Kushina was kidnapped by
Kumogakure
 forces. Konoha mobilised its ninja to retrieve her, but only Minato noticed the strands of red hair Kushina left behind to mark their path. Minato, acting alone, rescued her from her captors.
 On their way back to Konoha, Minato confessed his admiration for her hair and her strength,
 causing Kushina – who had previously believed Minato "unreliable" and even "girly"
 – to fall in love with him.

The feat of single-handedly putting a stop to the Nine-Tails' abduction raised Minato's renown greatly, moving him from an ordinary shinobi to one who was well known across many nations for his great accomplishment of foiling Kumo's kidnapping attempt,
 both in the
Land of Fire
 and beyond.

Konoha's Yellow Flash

Minato and Kushina were a couple from the time that he rescued her, and with his love, Kushina was able to keep the Nine-Tails sealed within her at bay. To aid in this goal, Minato was taught many sealing techniques from both Kushina and Jiraiya. When Konoha became involved in the
Third Shinobi World War
, Minato's obligations became split between his efforts to protect Kushina and helping with to win the war. During a confrontation against
Han
 and
Rōshi
, the two Iwa-nin unleashed their
Tailed Beast Modes
 to attack Team 6 with their
Tailed Beast Balls
. After Minato warped himself and his team to safety, Minato took inspiration from the Tailed Beast Ball, researching its nature and began a three-year process of creating the
Rasengan
.
 The day he completed it, Kushina visited him. He explained he developing the Rasengan for her, in the event she had to fight other jinchūriki. The Nine-Tails attempted to break free at that moment, its chakra leaking and injuring him. Minato was able to reinforce the seal, and his words of affirmation towards Kushina encouraged her to resist as well. The Nine-Tails' pierced Minato's gut with its claws during the encounter, but he recovered. Kushina later took him to the top of her residence, and named the Rasengan, as he had pointed out he made it for her. Minato and Kushina would eventually marry each other.






Team Minato.



After proving himself an accomplished and responsible ninja, Minato was placed in charge of his own team, consisting of
Rin Nohara
,
Obito Uchiha
, and
Kakashi Hatake
. In the anime, the
Third Hokage
 gave Minato the special task of helping Kakashi overcome the bitterness caused by
his father
's death and remind him of the human element of being a ninja.
 Minato gave his team a
bell test
 upon its formation in order to teach them the value of teamwork.
 Minato often held back less against the prodigious Kakashi than with Rin and Obito so they couldn't obtain the bells without teamwork. Unfortunately, Kakashi realised this, but only used Obito and Rin as a means to an end to obtain the bells. Nonetheless, he passed them because they accomplished the goal of the test by working as a team. Although he did encourage them to improve their teamwork afterwards, a message that Obito and Rin took to heart, but fell on deaf ears with Kakashi.

During a mission into
Kusagakure
 to destroy the
Kannabi Bridge
, Minato transferred leadership of the mission to Kakashi – who had recently become a
jōnin
 – while he headed to the front lines. He met up with the
surviving and out-numbered
 Konoha ninja and single-handedly wiped out the opposing
Iwagakure
 forces. In the anime, his victory in this battle against a thousand ninja convinced the
Third Tsuchikage
 to accept a peace treaty.
 When he rendezvoused with his team afterwards he found Kakashi and Rin and surrounded by Iwa-nin, Obito having already been lost. He rescued them, helped them complete their original mission once they recovered, and returned to Konoha with them to mourn Obito.
 Minato's competing obligations would later repeat the tragedy of Obito's death: while he was away on another mission, Madara orchestrated Rin's kidnapping by
Kirigakure
, who died during Kakashi's attempt to retrieve her, as part of Madara's plot to corrupt Obito.






A attacks Minato.



Minato encountered
A
 of Kumogakure a number of times during the war,
 developing a rivalry across their many battles.
  During their first meeting, Minato and A fought with their speed, with Minato proving the faster. He received orders to retreat before their competition could resolve, but he lingered to compliment A and his brother,
B
, a
jinchūriki
 like Kushina; he encouraged A to take care of B and remember he was a person. A pursued Minato, so Minato moved against B, threatening to kill him if A didn't let him and his team go.
 Minato was confident he and A would someday meet as
Kage
.

Fourth Hokage






Minato becomes Hokage.



For his performance during the War, Minato was chosen over
Orochimaru
 to become Fourth Hokage.
 He taught the Flying Thunder God Technique to the
Hokage Guard Platoon
 to better aid them in their duties of serving the Hokage at any given time.
 In the anime, he also tried to help Kakashi, now an
Anbu
, emerge from the darkness he'd fallen into after Obito and Rin's deaths. During the gradual transfer of responsibilities from the Third Hokage to him, the Third advised Minato to restore Kakashi's value of life by tasking him with protecting Kushina during her pregnancy.






Minato and Kushina, expectant parents.



As a jinchūriki, the strain of childbirth would weaken the seal keeping the Nine-Tails sealed into Kushina. For that reason special precautions had to be taken: the child would secretly be delivered in a remote location outside of the village, with barriers around the area and several Anbu guards as extra protection. Minato was not greatly worried about the birth, and in fact gave Kakashi the day off in gratitude for his good work. He and Kushina had already decided on a name for their son, "Naruto", after the main character of Jiraiya's
first book
, hoping that their Naruto would be just as determined as the character (and thus its author). Jiraiya tried to convince them to make a different choice since that would make him Naruto's godfather, but they insisted that this was a good thing.

Naruto was born on the night of October 10. Only moments after the birth Minato began making preparations to restore the Nine-Tails' weakened seal, but he was interrupted by the arrival of a masked man, otherwise known as
Tobi
. Tobi killed the Anbu guards and midwives and took the newborn Naruto hostage, threatening to kill him if Minato didn't back away from Kushina. Minato immediately took Naruto back from him, yet discovered
explosive tags
 had been planted on Naruto. Minato was forced to teleport away to keep Naruto from harm, allowing Tobi to escape with Kushina. He found a safe place for Naruto and teleported to Kushina in time to save her from being killed by the Nine-Tails, extracted from her body by Tobi. He reunited mother and son before heading out to protect the village.






Minato clashing with the masked man.



Minato returned to the village in the early stages of the Nine-Tails' attack on Konoha, arriving in time to
teleport away
 a
Tailed Beast Ball
 before it destroyed the
Hokage Rock
. He attempted to reach the Third Hokage so that he could inform him of what happened, but was interrupted by Tobi, who tried to
warp him away
. Minato reacted in time to escape, but Tobi pursued him. Because Tobi was controlling the Nine-Tails' actions, defeating him was of prime importance in order to save Konoha. Minato initially struggled to successfully strike him but, after several failed attacks, he finally hit him with a Rasengan and branded him with a Flying Thunder God seal, allowing him to teleport to Tobi whenever he wanted. He then used a
Contract Seal
 on Tobi to release the Nine-Tails from his control, forcing him to flee.






Minato using the Dead Demon Consuming Seal.



No longer being controlled, the Nine-Tails began retreating from the village, though it continued to attack the Konoha ninja that pursued it. As it prepared another Tailed Beast Ball, Minato once again arrived in time to stop it, this time by
dropping

Gamabunta
 on top of it. He had Gamabunta keep it restrained while he gathered the chakra needed to transport the Nine-Tails to Naruto and Kushina's location, the farthest from the village he could get. Kushina
restrained
 it and erected a barrier so that it couldn't escape while they decided what to do. To protect the village, Kushina offered to have the Nine-Tails sealed back into her so it would die with her. Minato rejected this, believing the Nine-Tails' power would be needed in the future if and when Tobi struck again. Remembering Jiraiya's words about the "Child of the Prophecy", Minato decided to believe that Naruto was that child and that he would someday save the world. To prepare Naruto for this, Minato would make Naruto the Nine-Tails' new jinchūriki so he could make use of its strength.






Minato and Kushina protecting Naruto.



Because the Nine-Tails' chakra was too immense to seal into an infant, Minato used the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
 to cut its chakra in half, sealing the Yin half in himself. Realising what they were planning, the Nine-Tails tried to kill Naruto, but Minato and Kushina used themselves as shields. With his last ounce of strength, Minato summoned
Gerotora
, gave him the key to the seal he would use on Naruto, and sent him to Jiraiya. Meanwhile, Kushina told Naruto how much his parents loved him, which Minato seconded. He
sealed
 the Nine-Tails' Yang half into Naruto, weaving Kushina's chakra into the seal so that she could someday assist Naruto with learning to control the Nine-Tails and its chakra.
 He mingled in some of his own chakra, too, programming it to activate if ever the seal was about to break so that he could restore it.
 Seeing the Third Hokage nearby, Minato communicated to him a final request for the villagers of Konoha: to think of Naruto as a hero and not the container of the monster that caused so much death and destruction.
 With that, his soul was consumed by the
Shinigami
, ending Minato's life.

Personality

Despite his physical resemblance to Naruto, Minato's personality was considered by both
Jiraiya
 and
Tsunade
 as the opposite of Naruto's; he was a very humble and collected man. Very perceptive and shrewd, he was noted as not to do something without a reason.
 He was well-aware of the terror his reputation inspired in rival villages and would take advantage of it at times, but even then he would remain respectful to opponents. A very polite individual, Minato would adress others with the appropriate honourifics, directed even towards dangerous criminals such as
Orochimaru
.

Minato also wouldn't pry into other people's personal affairs unless he felt it was necessary,
 and was not the type to hold grudges, only feeling sorry for Obito despite his role in his own and Kushina's deaths, dissuading Kakashi from killing Obito.
 If anything, Minato blames himself for his death for several reasons; he couldn't save Obito from the fate that
corrupted
 him, Konoha from the difficulties that arose after his death,
 and even his own son Naruto from the painful and difficult life he suffered as a jinchūriki orphan.

Regardless of their differences, Naruto is not without any of his father's personality traits: both have indomitable spirits and fierce ambitions that drive them through all their choices in life. Outside of missions, he would be rather carefree and lighthearted like his son. Both are of unwavering loyalty to Konoha and their loved ones – friends and family – and that devotion inspires all those around them. Also like Naruto, Minato had the tendency to create questionable techniques, although in Minato's case, it was the pointlessly longwinded names he came up with rather than the actually useful technique. This was seen when initially considered "Halo Hair Whole of Jiraiya Inspired by Frozen Dessert Twin Style Sphere" as the name for what would instead be called the Rasengan.

Appearance

Minato as a jōnin.
Minato as the Fourth Hokage.
1/2

Minato was a tall, fair-skinned man frequently compared to Naruto in physical appearance; both have blue eyes and spiky, blond hair. Minato also had jaw-length bangs framing either side of his face. Minato was considered to be very handsome as many girls became infatuated with him.
 His normal attire consisted of a standard Konoha uniform with two bands on both of his sleeves, a green
flak jacket
, blue
forehead protector
, and blue sandals. After becoming Hokage, he started wearing a short-sleeved long white haori over his normal attire, closed in the front by a thin, orange rope. The haori was decorated by red flame-like motifs on the edges, with the kanji for "Fourth Hokage" (
四代目火影
,
Yondaime Hokage
) written vertically down the back.

During his time in the Academy, he wore a simple white suit of clothing with green trimmings and a hood. After becoming a full-fledged shinobi, he wore a tracksuit with three stripes on the sleeves, mesh under-armour, a pair of black pants, and sandals.

Abilities






Minato defeating Tobi.



Minato was one of the most powerful shinobi in history. He was prodigy of such talent that, while still a child, he became well-known and regarded across many nations for foiling Kumogakure's kidnapping of his village's Jinchūriki.
 By adulthood he was considered by the likes of Jiraiya and the Fourth Raikage to be unmatched,
 and one of very few people able to fight a
tailed beast
 head-on.

Kurama
 compared Minato's power to
Hashirama Senju
's.
 During the Third Shinobi World War, flee-on-sight orders were given to enemy shinobi should they encounter him.
 In the anime, he single-handedly wiped one thousand
Iwa
-nin — a feat that forced
Ōnoki
 to accept a peace treaty.
 During the Nine-Tails' attack on Konoha, it was only from Minato's actions that Tobi and the fox were defeated and the village was saved from destruction. Over a decade later, with the looming threat of Orochimaru to the village, Minato was believed the only one who could stop the Sannin at the time.
 Minato's fighting style revolved mainly around suddenly appearing and just as quickly taking down enemies, often excluding traditional time-consuming methods like hand seals.

Ninjutsu






Minato using the Shadow Clone Technique.



Minato was taught many skills and techniques by Jiraiya, including to
summon

toads
, becoming one of few people to earn the full respect and cooperation of Toad Boss
Gamabunta
.
 He had skill with
barrier ninjutsu
.
 Minato was an adept
sensor
, able to detect and track chakra signatures from great distances.
 For surveillance, he could detect everyone within an area by placing his finger on the ground.
 Minato could also use the
Shadow Clone Technique
 for a variety of battling strategies, from gaining strength in numbers to deception. Minato was proficient in the
nature transformations
 of
Fire
,
Wind
,
Lightning
, along with
Yin
 and
Yang Release
.

Rasengan






Minato forming the Rasengan.



After observing the nature of the Tailed Beast Ball,
 Minato spent three years developing one of his signature techniques, the Rasengan.
 He created it for his then-girlfriend,
Kushina Uzumaki
, both for Kushina to use for her own protection and so he himself could battle beside her against enemy
Jinchūriki
. Its power proved able to stalemate
Kurama
's
Tailed Beast Ball
.
 The highest level of shape transformation, it gives him an edge in combat due to requiring no hand seals to create and being self-sustaining. Minato's mastery allowed him to form it with either hand instantly and vary its size from standard to
Big Ball Rasengan
-sized.
 He intended to combine it with his element chakra, but failed to before his early passing. When using Tailed Beast Mode, his Rasengan becomes proportionately as large.

Space–Time Ninjutsu






Minato's Space-Time Barrier.



His exploits with the Flying Thunder God technique gained him the moniker "Konoha's Yellow Flash".
 The creator of this technique, the
Second Hokage
, openly acknowledged Minato's skills as superior to his in its usage. With the technique, Minato could instantly move to the location of anything marked with his special seal, whether a tool, place, or person. Minato also could bring others with him,
 or send them by themselves,
 giving him a
defensive option
 to teleport incoming threats away.
 He was also a skilled teacher of
Space–Time Ninjutsu
, having taught the
Hokage Guard Platoon
 the
Flying Thunder Formation Technique
.

Shurikenjutsu






Minato's special kunai.



Minato had his own special
brand of kunai
 for combat; triple-prong kunai for better offensive potential. He would throw them at opponents or wield them as melee tools, even in his mouth.
 Their main use was for the
Flying Thunder God
 seals they were marked with, allowing him to teleport to wherever one of the kunai were.
 He carried a large number of kunai in the field that he would scatter across a wide area so that he could move around with more options.
 Although his normal tactics with kunai did not require precision, Minato nevertheless had excellent aim and could coordinate his throws' timing and placement to allow him to perform
complex manoeuvres
.

Fūinjutsu






The key to the Nine-Tails' seal.



Minato learned several
fūinjutsu
 from Jiraiya and Kushina.
 Kurama was shocked to seeing such a unique sealing prowess when it attempted to escape
Kushina Uzumaki
.
 With the
Eight Trigrams Sealing Style
, he sealed the Nine-Tails' Yang-half into Naruto and the Yin-half into himself, allowing small amounts of the Nine-Tails' chakra to naturally mix with the host's own.
 Knowing the seal would slowly weaken over time, Minato created a key that could accelerate or reverse this process. As an extra precaution, he mixed Kushina's and his own chakra into the seal so that, when certain conditions were met, they could help Naruto with his control of the Nine-Tails' power, as well as allow them to see their son after they were dead.

Minato could also perform the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
, which he had enough familiarity with to know it couldn't be used to seal all of the Nine-Tails' chakra. With the
Contract Seal
, he could remove an opponent's control over any creatures they summoned.
 He could also immediately
transfer
 a
tailed beast
 from a jinchūriki into a new host.

Chakra and Physical Prowess






Minato saving Kakashi.



Minato was hailed as the fastest shinobi of his time.
 While this recognition was due in part to his space–time ninjutsu, Minato's natural speed and prowess with the
Body Flicker Technique
 were immense: he could outstrip three other Kage-level ninja
 and engage an enemy or retrieve an ally before anyone realised what he was doing.
 He could cover a considerable distance in a short amount of time and perform a technique before an opponent could finish theirs.
 In the anime, he could appear before
sensors
 could detect his approach.
 Minato's reflexes allowed him to react to and avoid techniques with no warning, such as
Kamui
 and
Lightning Straight
.

Minato had very large chakra reserves, able to summon the massive Gamabunta, as well as
teleport
 multiple massive targets like a tailed beast and their attacks. His chakra control was very refined, evidenced by his skill and versatility in the Rasengan, which demands very precise chakra control to use, as able to weave
hand seals
 with only one hand.
 Minato also demonstrated great endurance, able to survive being impaled through the chest by Version 2 Kushina and still fight back Kurama within its seal.
 He could also withstand being impaled by Kurama and survive long enough to impart instructions unto others before his eventual death.

Jinchūriki Transformations






Minato's Nine-Tails Chakra Mode.



Main article:
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode

Minato became the jinchūriki of the Kurama's Yin-half shortly before his death, though it wasn't until his
reincarnation
 that he could make use of it. Unlike most tailed beasts, the Nine-Tails offered no resistance to cooperating with Minato, granting him immediate access to
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
, which impressed all spectators.
 Minato's form was slightly darker with different markings than Naruto's but otherwise identical in appearance and abilities; he can use
chakra arms
,
 enter
Tailed Beast Mode
, create
Tailed Beast Balls
,
 and perform stronger versions of his usual techniques. Minato would later lose access to its power after having his half of the Nine-Tails stolen by Black Zetsu.

Senjutsu






Minato in Sage Mode.



Minato's chakra strength and reserves are both great enough to learn
senjutsu
 of
Mount Myōboku
, enhancing his techniques and physical parameters by entering
Sage Mode
.
 He could perfectly balance the natural energy with his chakra, displaying only the orange pigmentation around his eyes and no other physical changes — the true marking of a Sage. However, by his own admission, Minato's skill in senjutsu was limited as he hasn't used it in actual battle before, making him unable to maintain it for long.

Intelligence

Minato was an exceptionally intelligent and keen-minded individual. He graduated the Academy at the age of 10 years old, going on to have the highest scores in the history of the Chūnin Exams written test.
 Even at a young age, only he, out of all the ninja sent to rescue Kushina, noticed the trail she left behind to mark her kidnappers' path.
 In combat, he could correctly deduce the basic mechanics behind a technique after seeing it only once, and from there plan around its strengths and weaknesses to his or his allies' advantage.
 With his observational skills he could determine an opponent's plans and motivations based on only limited evidence.
 After he had finished analysing, Minato would strike quickly and with precision, attacking vulnerabilities at the most opportune moments.

As Hokage, Minato prepared for threats facing Konoha by placing a network of marked locations around the village's outskirts for him to teleport to, including at least two
safe houses
 and likewise passed on his space–time ninjutsu onto the
Hokage Guard Platoon
.

Part II

Pain's Assault

Main article:
Pain's Assault

During his fight with
Pain
, Naruto is nearly tempted by the Nine-Tails to remove its seal. This activates the safeguard Minato placed on the seal, causing his imprint to appear within Naruto's subconscious and stop him. Minato says that he isn't happy to see the Nine-Tails again, but that at the same time admits that its actions have allowed him to see his son. Naruto picks up on this and, having never known his parents' identities, is overjoyed to meet his father. The Nine-Tails keeps threatening to kill Minato while they talk, so he and Naruto relocate.






Minato placing his trust in Naruto.



Naruto is angry that his own father would seal the Nine-Tails within him and punches Minato out of frustration, which he understands and apologises to Naruto for. He quickly gets over it, noting that, as the son of the Fourth Hokage, he can handle it. Minato's time with Naruto is limited so he does a quick run down of the things he has already observed through Naruto: that Pain has destroyed Konoha and killed
Jiraiya
. Despite what he's done, Minato suggests that Pain is only a symptom of the shinobi system and that he's being taken advantage of by
Tobi
. Naruto is overwhelmed, unsure if he can forgive Pain or do anything to stop the cycle of hatred that produced him, but Minato responds that he has faith in Naruto. He restores the Nine-Tails' seal before disappearing.

In the anime, when Naruto nearly loses control after his
clone
 absorbs the Nine-Tails' chakra, Minato appears before him again to restore the seal. Once again, Minato voices his confidence in his son and his ability to overcome any adversity.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

Main article:
Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax






The four Hokage are reincarnated.



At the request of
Sasuke Uchiha
,
Orochimaru
 releases the souls of the first four Hokage from the stomach of the
Shinigami
 so that he can
reincarnate
 them. After taking in their surroundings, the
First
 and
Second Hokage
 are excited to meet Minato, the Fourth, and take him as a sign of the village's prosperity. Minato says he does not know since he died before the
Third Hokage
 did. While Sasuke talks to the First Hokage, Minato detects Naruto's chakra and is glad to sense he has gained full control of the Nine-Tails.






The Hokage arrive on the battlefield.



From listening to the four Hokage, Sasuke decides to side against Tobi and
Madara Uchiha
 in the ongoing
Fourth Shinobi World War
. The Hokage are allowed to help as well, and they set out for the site of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
' battle with the
Ten-Tails
. Minato, eager to see Naruto, arrives first, just in time to
warp
 away the Ten-Tails'
Tailed Beast Ball
, saving Naruto and the Allies. He introduces himself to
Sakura Haruno
 and asks if she is Naruto's girlfriend. Sakura becomes angry and hits Naruto due to his answer, reminding Minato of
Kushina
. When the other Hokage arrive they jointly erect a
barrier
 to confine the Ten-Tails.






Minato strikes down Obito.



Sometime later, Tobi appears above the Ten-Tails and begins
reviving
 Madara, which the Alliance focuses its efforts on preventing. Minato cannot leave his position or the barrier will fall, so he sends a
shadow clone
 to help. Because Tobi is still branded with the
Flying Thunder God
 seal from their last encounter, the shadow clone is able to teleport to him and strike him down. It is only after he attacks that he realises Tobi is his old student, Obito Uchiha. The attack ends up coming too late and Obito
seals
 the Ten-Tails into himself, becoming its jinchūriki. After Obito destroys the barrier, the First and Second engage him to determine his new abilities, leaving Minato to get everyone else to a safe distance.

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki

Main article:
Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki






Minato clashes with Obito once again.



Minato joins the offensive against Obito. He can no longer teleport directly to Obito because the Flying Thunder God seal has disappeared from his body, so he must engage him directly. Just before they clash Obito, having until now struggled to control the Ten-Tails' power, finally masters it and strikes at Minato. He severs Minato's right arm and plants a
Truth-Seeking Ball
 on him, which Tobirama teleports away before it detonates. Minato, the Second, Naruto, and Sasuke coordinate their efforts to attack Obito with
Flying Thunder God Mutually Instantaneous Revolving Technique
, but Obito emerges without damage. What's more, Minato's arm has not regenerated, indicating that Obito's Truth-Seeking Balls can nullify the advantages of the Impure World Reincarnation.






Minato and Naruto combine their power.



Obito traps the Alliance in
his own barrier
 and prepares to destroy them all with a barrage of Tailed Beast Balls. With little time to act, Naruto forms a plan: he and Minato link their respective Kurama's chakra – which networks in all of the Allied forces that Naruto has shared its chakra with – and lets Minato teleport all of them out of the barrier. Minato is very impressed by Naruto's quick-thinking and says he wishes he had more of a chance time to talk to him. Naruto explains there's no need as he's already met Kushina and heard everything. Minato is moved to tears with pride.






Minato and Naruto attack Obito.



Having learned that Obito is susceptible to
senjutsu
, Minato prepares for an assault while Naruto enters
Sage Mode
. They both then enter
Tailed Beast Mode
 and attack with a
combined Rasengan
, breaking Obito's defence and forcing him to manifest the Ten-Tails' tree form. They evade the tree's roots, but Minato's chakra levels are severely depleted. He is forced to keep his distance and watch as Naruto leads the Allied Shinobi in another assault against Obito. When the Alliance starts to strip the
tailed beasts
 from Obito's body, Minato helps Naruto pull out the fragments of Kurama's chakra Obito has taken, and ultimately they succeed.






Minato stops Kakashi from killing Obito.



Obito is unable to move after his defeat and
Kakashi
 moves in to kill him. Minato stops him, having sensed Obito's change of heart while he was removing Kurama's chakra. While Naruto and the Allies leave to confront Madara, Minato and Kakashi stay with Obito. Obito reflects on his actions and decides he has done terrible things, which he wants to make amends for by using the
Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 to revive those he's killed. While he is forming the hand seals,
Black Zetsu
 emerges from the ground and takes control of his body. Minato and Kakashi are confused, so Obito explains he has been forced to revive Madara instead. Black Zetsu also tries to take Obito's
Rinnegan
 to deliver to Madara. Minato and Kakashi move to stop it, but can't do anything without harming Obito. Before Black Zetsu assumes full control of his body, Obito pleads with Minato and Kakashi to destroy the Rinnegan at any cost.






Minato unwillingly seals Yin-Kurama into Black Zetsu.



Right before Minato can attack, Yin-Kurama alerts him to Naruto's loss of Yang-Kurama. He is soon brought to Minato's side, with Sakura performing emergency life support and
Gaara
 explaining that the only chance of saving Naruto's life is if he is given Yin-Kurama. Just as Minato
starts the transfer
, Black Zetsu intercepts him and takes Yin-Kurama for itself. Madara arrives immediately afterwards, now the Ten-Tails' new jinchūriki and intent on taking Obito's Rinnegan. Minato enters Sage Mode and attacks him alongside Kakashi, but they are easily repelled and Minato loses his other arm. Before Madara can take what he wants, Obito reasserts control of his body and, with some help from Kakashi, escapes with Naruto and Sakura using
Kamui
.






Minato intercepts Madara's attack on Guy.



Might Guy
 arrives, ready to give his life to defeat Madara. With his energy and arms gone, Minato can do very little to help directly, but he can at least give Guy an opening. He instructs
Rock Lee
 to throw one of his
Flying Thunder God Kunai
 at Madara's Truth-Seeking Balls, which Minato teleports to in order to catch several and escape with them, allowing Guy to initiate his assault. Minato, meanwhile, teleports to the
Hokage Rock
 where he remains with the inert Truth Seeking Balls. He later witnesses the others' failure when the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 is cast and Konoha's villagers are entwined by the
God: Nativity of a World of Trees
. He attempts to cut some people from the tree, but has no success as another branch simply forms and imprisons them again.

Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes

Main article:
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes






Minato wishes happy birthday to Naruto before departing.



Minato returns to the battlefield and reunites with the other Hokage, the only ones unaffected by the Infinite Tsukuyomi. As they try to figure out what they can do to help, the four Hokage are met by the spirit of the
Sage of the Six Paths
, who recruits their help. Combining efforts with the spirits of the other deceased
Kage
, they
summon
 Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi, Sakura, Madara, and the tailed beasts back from
Kaguya's dimension
. Minato congratulates Naruto on finally ending the war and wishes him a happy seventeenth birthday. Happy with his son's prospects for the future, Minato and the other Kage are returned to the
afterlife
 by the Sage of Six Paths with Minato silently promising to tell Kushina everything that had occurred.

Legacy

After Minato died, the
Third Hokage
 reported to the villagers Minato's last request that Naruto be regarded as a hero. Very few were able to separate their hatred of the Nine-Tails from Naruto, prompting the Third to forbid anyone from speaking of the Nine-Tails, hoping that the younger generation would not blindly hate Naruto as the rest of the villagers did.
 He also concealed Naruto's relation to Minato in order to keep him safe from his father's enemies,
 and otherwise did his best to give Naruto a comfortable life. For years Naruto did not know his parents' identities, and neither did most of Konoha.

Even when he was not aware of his relation to Minato, Naruto still greatly admired the Fourth Hokage, considering him a hero who gave his life for the village
 and becoming overjoyed whenever their similarities were remarked upon.
 Before Naruto left Konoha to begin his training with Jiraiya, he looked at the Fourth Hokage's face on the
Hokage Rock
 and asked him to look after him.
 After learning that Minato was his father, Naruto took pride in it and felt it was his responsibility to makes his parents' sacrifices worth it.

With Minato's death, the Third was forced to resume his position as Hokage, a role he filled until his death, never being able to find a replacement of Minato's calibre. Minato himself became regarded as the village's hero,
 and, indeed, one of the greatest ninja Konoha had ever produced,
 so much so that villagers would regret his death whenever tragedy struck the village.
 Because Minato was never able to tell anyone what happened during the Nine-Tails' attack, villagers came to their own conclusions and the
Uchiha
 were suspected of the act, creating ill-will that would culminate in the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
. Jiraiya recognised that Minato would not have sealed the Nine-Tails into his own son unless he had a good reason and that Minato intended Naruto to gain control of the Nine-Tails, but he could never conclude why.

After the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, his student,
Kakashi Hatake
, became the Sixth
Hokage
, and his son, Naruto, became the Seventh Hokage ten years later. Four and six years respectively after the war, Minato had
two

grandchildren
, who both inherited his prodigious talent.
 Minato was featured in
Extreme: Shinobi Picture Scrolls
 cards, Shikadai telling Kawaki to address Minato with proper honorifics indicating that even new generations hold him in high regard.

Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower






Minato as depicted in the movie.



Twenty years in the past, Minato and Kakashi are part of a team sent to
Rōran
 to stop
Mukade
, a
missing-nin
 from the future, from using the
Source of the Ryūmyaku
 to make a Puppet Army that will conquer the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
. When they arrive in Rōran they meet Naruto, who Minato realises is also from the future. Minato tries to get Naruto to leave so that he won't tell them anything that will change the future. However, Naruto believes Minato and his team mean to kill the Queen of Rōran,
Sāra
, and attacks them until he recognises Minato as the Fourth Hokage.






Naruto and Minato's Supreme Ultimate Rasengan.



In the interest of preventing Naruto from saying anything else about events that haven't happened yet, Minato instructs him to protect Sāra, also giving him a Flying Thunder God Kunai just in case. When Naruto and Sāra later fight Mukade, Minato and his team arrive to help. Mukade fuses with his puppets, becoming a giant puppet monster using the Ryūmyaku's power. While Sāra tries to cut off the Ryūmyaku at its source, Minato and Naruto attack him, the former being surprised when the latter uses Rasengan. The attack fails and Naruto is left exhausted, so Minato lends him some of his own and advises him on where Mukade's weak points are. Realising that Naruto is his son and that they therefore have similar chakra, they are able to create the
Supreme Ultimate Rasengan
 and defeat Mukade.

After Minato seals off the Ryūmyaku completely, Naruto begins to glow as he starts to return to his own time. Naruto tries to fight it, wanting to talk to Minato and warn him about what will happen, but Minato refuses. Naruto asks if there is at least a chance that Minato is his father, to which Minato responds that if he ever had a son, he wishes he would be just like Naruto. Naruto smiles and sheds tears of joy before being sent back to the future. Minato
wipes everyone's memory
 so that their meeting Naruto won't change the future.

In the
alternate world
, Minato never became Hokage and therefore he and Kushina did not die on the night of their son,
Menma
's, birth. While essentially the same as his real-world counterpart (kind, courageous, and dutiful), this Minato values his family's safety above all else, choosing to put their well-being before all others.

 series
 as part of Naruto's ultimate technique called "Mysterious Aid Arrives".

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Minato Namikaze

The name "Minato" means "harbour" (
港
), while his family name "Namikaze" (
波風
) means "waves and wind".

Minato ranked ninth in the sixth
character popularity poll
 and seventh in the seventh poll.

Minato's silhouette can be faintly seen in the background of the
Naruto Shippūden
 third opening
 standing behind Naruto and
Sora
 and under the Nine-Tails, in reference to its attack on Konoha that binds all four characters.

In
Hidden Leaf Village Grand Sports Festival!
, Minato suddenly appears in the hallway of the stadium when Naruto is running to the toilets. All of these appearances in this special were only for the comical effect.

In
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower
, Minato's chakra appears to be a light green colour, as opposed to the normal blue.

Studio Pierrot's Settei sheets of Minato show that he was 147 cm when he saved Kushina from Kumogakure.

According to the databook(s):

Minato's hobby was reading; Jiraiya's novels were his favourite.

Minato wished to fight Jiraiya.

Minato's favourite food was Kushina's homemade cooking.

Minato completed 847 official missions in total: 122 D-rank, 147 C-rank, 216 B-rank, 323 A-rank, 39 S-rank.

Minato's favourite phrase was "The fire's shadow illuminates the village" (
火の影は里を照らす
,
Hi no kage wa sato o terasu
).

On the cover of chapter 178, the colour on Minato's cloak were inverted.

Minato is ambidextrous. He has been shown wielding his kunai as well as the Rasengan proficiently with each hand. This is also shown when he summons using his left hand,
 indicating that he signed the contract with his left hand.

Prior to his battle with
Pain
, Jiraiya mentioned Minato sealed Kurama within Naruto partially with the intent of having Naruto master a certain technique. Although it was never elaborated what technique it was, it is possible he was referring to the
Tailed Beast Ball
 as only a jinchūriki has access to that technique, not including the Tailed Beasts themselves, and he did base his Rasengan off the Tailed Beast Ball.

Prior to sealing half of Kurama within an infant Naruto, Minato mentioned to himself that he needed to put up a barrier to both contain and restrain Kurama. It is unknown whether this barrier would have held long enough for Minato to complete the sealing as he was also concerned about his remaining chakra reserves.

Unlike most people who had a single hair whorl that spiral in a single direction, Minato had two whorls that spiral in different directions.

Because I know that you're strong, in body and in spirit. But this is a fight between two villages. It's different from other fights, so… I didn't want to lose you.
"

(As quoted by
Kakashi
) "
Those who stray from the path of justice have no courage, but under the wing of a strong leader, cowardice cannot survive.

You're a man with a true skill… an example we should all follow. I can't think of a finer shinobi than you!

Happy Birthday, you really become a splendid young man, Naruto.
