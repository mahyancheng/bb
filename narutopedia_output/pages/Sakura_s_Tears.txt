"
Sakura's Tears
" (
サクラの涙
,
Sakura no Namida
) is episode 43 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
, in his
four-tailed form
, is pinned against the side of a cliff by
Orochimaru
's
Sword of Kusanagi
. However, the Sword of Kusanagi is unable to pierce Naruto's body due to the
Nine-Tails
'
chakra
 coating it. Orochimaru retracts the sword and slowly begins his descent back to his body.
Sai
 is observing Orochimaru, unaware that he is being watched by
Yamato
's
wood clone
. Orochimaru states that
Gen'yūmaru
's body is beginning to reject him and that he is at his limit right now, though he comforts himself over the thought of still having
Sasuke
.

Kabuto
 states that he is surprised that Naruto would go this far to save Sasuke, claiming that the boy is gone and only the monster remains. His words cause Sakura to remember Naruto's promise to her - that he would bring Sasuke back no matter what, and that as his
nindo
, he would not go back on his promise. Sakura runs towards him in tears, despite Yamato's warning. She attempts to tell Naruto to change back, but Naruto simply smacks her aside with his tail, harming her. Before he can kill her, Yamato uses his
Wood Release
 ability to create tree trunks to bind Naruto. Kabuto heads towards Sakura, and Yamato, believing that he is about to finish off a wounded Sakura, binds him as well. Kabuto tells him that he is actually attempting to save Sakura, and he heals her wounds to the best of his ability. He tells them that they share a common enemy - the
Akatsuki
 - and that he is sparing and saving their lives just so that they can continue to dwindle down their numbers. As Kabuto leaves, Naruto manages to break out of the wooden restraints. Yamato uses the
Hokage-Style Sixty-Year-Old Technique — Kakuan Entering Society with Bliss-Bringing Hands
, which utilises the power of the
First Hokage
's Wood Release and the crystal gem in the
First Hokage's Necklace
 (which Naruto is wearing) to suppress and seal a
tailed beast
's chakra. With excruciating effort and pain on both Yamato and Naruto's side, Yamato begins to revert Naruto back to his humane self.

Meanwhile, Sai approaches Orochimaru, claiming that he means no harm and that he is only an envoy of
Danzō Shimura
 sent to relay a message. Orochimaru is surprised that Danzō is still alive and agrees to hear the message, but warns Sai to choose his words very carefully, lest he get killed. Sai responds that he cannot choose his words carefully as he can only relay the exact message Danzō told him. As he smiles at Orochimaru, the
Sannin
 launches a sword towards Sai.
