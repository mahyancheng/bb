Plasma Ball
 (
荷電障壁殻
,
Purazuma Bōru
) is a technique utilised by
Ranke
 by drawing energy from the
Stone of Gelel
.

Overview

By converting the Gelel energy into electricity, Ranke can create a plasma barrier around her to serve as a defence which protects her from incoming attacks. The shield can be used offensively, by discharging the electricity in the direction of her choice in a wave.

While Ranke is in her
transformed state
, the Plasma Ball is strong enough to defend her from something as wide-ranged as the
Quicksand Waterfall Flow
, and she can rush at her opponents even if the barrier is active. However, if her electricity is drained, she cannot form the barrier and will be left vulnerable.

Trivia

Although the Japanese subtitle of this technique is written in kanji, it is pronounced in English, "Plasma Ball" (
プラズマボール
,
Purazuma Bōru
). The Japanese pronunciation of the kanji would be
Kaden Shōhekikaku
, which would literally translate to "Electric Charge Barrier Shell".
