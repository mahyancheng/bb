"
Samurai vs. Science
" (
サムライ対カガク
,
Samurai tai Kagaku
) is episode 226 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Boruto
 and
Mitsuki
 rush to the arena, having been selected as the next match. As they're not present when their names were drawn,
Shikamaru
 recommends not giving them special treatment, so they're disqualified.
Wasabi
 informs
Tsubaki
 she's next.
Namida
 cheers for her as well. Tsubaki is committed to showing the results of her growth.
Denki
 prepares himself, thinking how he and his
team-mates
 have changed since starting at the
Academy
. Boruto and Mitsuki arrive at the arena, and
Sarada
 angrily informs them they've been disqualified. They realise they would have had to fight each other, and wish they could have done it. Sarada tells them the last match is between Tsubaki and Denki. Denki enters to arena wearing a power suit of his making, confusing many spectators.
Naruto
 is interested in the pitting of
samurai
 against
science
. Denki's confidence makes an impression in Tsubaki. She makes the first move, but Denki's power suit allows him to quickly analyse her movements and react accordingly. He uses a pseudo
Lightning Release
 they recognise from the previous Chūnin Exam with his suit.

Katasuke
 excitedly explains that Denki's suit uses Lightning Release to
stimulate his reflexes
. Mitsuki asks if he feels embarrassed considering the previous exam.
Iwabee
 recalls that the person Denki least wanted to fight was Tsubaki, over his limited data on how samurai fight as opposed to shinobi. Still, he remained confident. Denki goes on the offensive, so Tsubaki dodges a heavy blow that surprises everyone. She acknowledges his power, and apologises for underestimating him. Tsubaki recalls overhearing Namida and Wasabi before the exams, how they didn't want her to go back home, but deciding to cheer on her for bringing pride to her people back in the
Land of Iron
. Tsubaki and some of the spectators notice that Denki's attacks are getting more precise. Denki manages to land hits and throws Tsubaki up in the air, where he aims a fireball at her. She
slices
 through it, and back on the ground, she manages to land an attack made in desperation. Tsubaki wants to test something, and begins attacking Denki not only with her sword, but also her sword's sheath. She's able to destroy Denki's visor. Katasuke explains the visor contained a motion sensor to help Denki predict her movements, which Sarada compares to the
Sharingan
. The rest of Denki's suit begins to overheat. Tsubaki commends him on what he's achieved so far, but he refuses to give up. He dodges her attack, allowing her to destroy his suit, which surprises her. Denki enhances his movements with the Lightning Release from earlier on his own, and uses the last of his chakra to land an
attack
 on Tsubaki. She is knocked unconscious, and Denki is declared the winner. Denki's
father
 cries overjoyed watching the broadcast.
Metal
 and Iwabee celebrate. Denki's victory inspires Katasuke to create new tools.
Konohamaru
 formally announces the four victors as chūnin as their team-mates cheer on them. Tsubaki wakes up in the infirmary, and confesses to her team-mates she let her guard down when she learned Denki would be her opponent. She also says she didn't consider their feelings, and reveals her intention to request an extension of her stay in
Konohagakure
. On their way back to
Sunagakure
,
Team Shinki
 discusses their mission to observe
Kawaki
, and
Shinki
 admits he wanted to see Boruto's match. The new chūnin celebrate with their friends, team-mates, and families. At home, Naruto asks Kawaki his opinion. He thought everyone was too desperate to win, but thinks it's not too bad to start as a genin. Boruto and Mitsuki decide to have their match by themselves at the arena that night.
