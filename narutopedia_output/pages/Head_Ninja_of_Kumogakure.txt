He was the
Head ninja
 (
忍頭
,
shinobigashira
) of
Kumogakure
 at the time of the
Hyūga Affair
.

Background

As the head ninja of Kumogakure at the time, he was sent with an envoy to sign a peace treaty with
Konohagakure
. However, the treaty was nothing more than a means to gain free entry into the village with the covert purpose of abducting a member of the
Hyūga clan
 in order to obtain the
Byakugan
. During the middle of the night, he snuck onto the Hyūga clan's estate and abducted young
Hinata
 while she slept. However, Hinata's father,
Hiashi
, intercepted him during his escape, and quickly killed him. Despite the sinister nature of the visit, Kumogakure demanded Hiashi's head as compensation as per the agreement in the treaty they had signed, or risk starting another war. Left with not much choice, Konoha seemingly handed over Hiashi's corpse, but it was, in fact, that of his twin brother
Hizashi
, upon whose death, the Byakugan was
sealed away
.

Personality

He has been described as being greatly self-confident and someone who only listened to himself.

Appearance

He was a tall, slim man with dark eyes with lines underneath them, black hair and goatee. He wore the older-styled Kumo
flak jacket
 which had thick shoulder pads. His head was bandaged and a Kumogakure
forehead protector
 covered his right eye. When he tried to kidnap Hinata, he wore a black suit of clothing and an obi around his waist, completed by a mask.

Trivia

In the
First Databook
, he was called the "Head Ninja of the Land of Clouds" (
雲の国の忍頭
,
Kumo no Kuni no Shinobigashira
), but in the index for the
Third Databook
, he was renamed to "Head Ninja of Kumogakure" (
雲隠れの里の忍頭
,
Kumogakure no Sato no Shinobigashira
).
