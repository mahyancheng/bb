Menma Memory Search Mission

Menma Memory Search Mission

Both of her parents were killed when
Shiin
 and his
group of bandits
 attacked her village. She wears a necklace which belonged to her father. Later, she helped
Naruto
 and
Menma
 build the defence wall around the village. When Fuki heard that Menma was a part of the bandits who killed her parents, she started to throw rocks at him. After Menma's sacrifice, Fuki called him "big brother".

Fuki was saved three times by Menma. The first time being when one of the bandits tried to kill her, the second time was when she was going to fall from the cliff where her father was killed. The third time was when Shiin attacked the village for the yet second time. Fuki regained her speech after she was saved for the third time, warning Menma of an enemy behind him. She was also one of the reasons Menma quit the bandit's group.

Trivia

Written as 吹き, Fuki means "playing (a wind instrument)".
