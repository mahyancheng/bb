Yamanaka Ichizoku – Hiden Ninjutsu

Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

As
Team Asuma
 were reaching the oasis water to hydrate themselves, they were stopped in their tracks by
Team Ameno
.
Ameno
 politely suggested to the Konoha-nin to hand over their scroll, and in return her team would allow them to pass to get to the oasis water and give them medical treatment if needed. However, Team Asuma refused the offer.
Ino
 takes the initiative of attacking the Suna-nin first by launching a few
kunai
 but her attack fails and she is knocked unconscious by
Shishio
's
sand lions
.
 While
Sakura
 battled Ameno and
Chōji
 battled
Kōji
, Shishio infused his
chakra
 onto the ground. When set, Shishio
cloaks
 his teammates from sight. This puts Team Ameno at an advantage as neither Sakura or Chōji could detect the enemies properly. As Sakura and Chōji began losing, Ino awoke,
sensing
 the enemies' location and warned her teammates in time to have them counter to hit their opponent before they could strike. However, the Suna-nin were able to
heal
 their injuries. The Suna-nin attack again, and because of the
sensing barrier
 Shishio used, it disrupted Ino's ability to sense his now invisible teammates again. While restrained, Ino forces herself to transfer her teammates'
thoughts
 to one another to help them warn one another of incoming attacks they could see from one another's blind spot where the enemy attacked from. This allowed Sakura and Chōji to defeat the Suna-nin but Team Asuma ultimately decides not to take their scroll since they already have two matching scrolls with them. After the
medical-nin
 from both teams healed one another's teammates, they part ways, promising each other to meet in the third phase.
