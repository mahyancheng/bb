"
Kakashi Hatake, the Hokage
" (
火影はたけカカシ
,
Hokage Hatake Kakashi
) is episode 219 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As the
stone carver
 begins to sculpt
Danzō
's face onto the
Hokage Rock
, he is notified by his
assistant
 that Danzō has died. Meanwhile,
Kakashi
 takes
Karin
 to the
Konohagakure Intelligence Division
 to be questioned.
Naruto
 gathers the
Konoha 11
 and tells them his decision to fight
Sasuke
 alone, much to their frustration. He refuses to explain why, simply asking them to trust him.

Homura
 and
Koharu
, the village elders, agree with
Suna
's recommendation that Kakashi become their next
Hokage
. Kakashi wanders around
Konoha
 thinking about his future as Hokage and looks at
Minato
's face on the monument. Just then,
Might Guy
 appears and challenges him to race. Kakashi ultimately wins the race, albeit very closely, and Guy congratulates him on becoming Hokage, claiming that from now on Kakashi would be too busy for their challenges. However, Kakashi tells him that they will always be "eternal rivals" and that he is happy he is there and would need Guy's help running the village, leaving Guy in tears.

Later, the members of the
Land of Fire
, including the
Fire Daimyō
, as well as the
Konoha Council
, hold a meeting to officially appoint Kakashi as the next Hokage. The
daimyō
 is unsure about whether to appoint Kakashi as the sixth or the seventh Hokage, as he had appointed Danzō as the sixth earlier, although Danzō did not formally take office. Koharu protests that Danzō should still be recognised as the sixth, while Homura shakes his head. In the end, the daimyō makes his decision, only for Guy to burst into the room and inform them that
Tsunade
 has awoken from her coma. The elders decide to have Tsunade resume her role as Hokage in order to present a stabilised front, relieving Kakashi. As the stone carver begins to carve Kakashi's face, he is once again stopped and informed that Tsunade will remain the Hokage, much to his frustration.

Trivia

In the previous episodes, Karin's clothes were torn and bloody on her back. In this episode, her clothes are clean.

In the manga, the ninja who interrupted Kakashi's meeting with the feudal lord was not Guy, it was an unknown character not seemingly of great importance to the plot.
