The
Hidden Leaf Village Grand Sports Festival!
 (
木ノ葉の里の大運動会
), also known as
Konoha Annual Sports Festival
, is the third
Naruto
 OVA.

Synopsis

The
Rookie Nine
, plus
Team Guy
, are taking part in a sports competition in which the winning team gets one whole week free from missions.
Naruto
 needs to go to the bathroom, forcing him to make repeated dashes for the bathroom in between games, only to be foiled each time by one of the other ninja, who are mostly unaware of his condition (i.e. Hinata, who wants to speak to Naruto; Choji, who knocked down all the porta potties while practicing his Human Boulder Technique; and Shino, who occupied the last bathroom stall).

In the end, Naruto wins the relay race, which wins
Team 7
 the vacation, only to be spoiled by him releasing his bowels, much to everyone's disgust.
