Sage Art: Gate of the Great God
 is a sealing technique utilised by
Hashirama Senju
 while in
Sage Mode
.

Usage





Hashirama using the Seal Ten and Seal Head variants.



The user manifests a select number of massive red
torii
 that fall down from above, in order to pin an intended target between the gate and the ground. The size and form of these torii, which boast an absolute binding force, matches the target in which it is used against. Not only is the target arrested and unable to move even a finger, but the torii also blocks their will of opposing the technique and is thus rendered completely docile.

Hashirama was even able to use this technique to immobilise the
Ten-Tails
 and
its jinchūriki
. Hashirama can pile the torii atop one another in an attempt to increase their ability to immobilise the target.
 When Obito was able to control the power of the Ten-Tails, he was able to break through these.

Variants

The exact number and size of the torii involved in this technique can vary dependent upon what the user specifies:

Seal Ten
 (
封十
,
Fūtō
,
Viz:
 Ten Seals): Creates ten torii that can be used to pin several individual targets simultaneously.

Seal Head
 (
封頭
,
Fūtō
,
Viz:
 Head Seal): Creates a single, large torii, intended to pin the target's neck beneath it, so as to immobilise their head.
 The target is imbued with
natural energy
 to stop it from resisting.

Trivia

The 頭 kanji, used in the "Seal Head" variant of the technique, is also used as a counter for large animals.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
, the colour of torii are grey instead of red, as portrayed in the manga and anime. This was corrected in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
.
