Udon Ise
 (
伊勢ウドン
,
Ise Udon
) is a
shinobi
 of
Konohagakure
, and the leader of
Team 5
.

Personality

As a child, Udon was an easy-going and quiet individual.
 He usually looks very sleepy, and is always seen with a drip of snot hanging from his nose. Udon has stated many times that he loves math, as he is sometimes seen writing math problems during class. As an adult, he is a very collected and straight-forward man who is shown to be keen minded and perceptive. As a teacher, he has a strict but fair teaching style and is not above punishing his students for making mistakes that could have cost them dearly. Overall, his students view him as "cool", and were surprised to hear how awkward he was as a child.

Appearance






Udon in Part II.



Udon has short brown hair and dark eyes. He is characterised by the drip of snot always seen hanging from his nose and his circular glasses. While in the
Academy
, he wore a simple blue shirt which zipped up the middle, a pair of brown pants, sandals and a pair of goggles to represent his membership in the
Konohamaru Ninja Squad
. As a
genin
, he has grown noticeably taller, and wears a black top and blue pants with regular shinobi sandals. Instead of goggles, he now wears the village's
forehead protector
.

Several years later, Udon has not changed his appearance much. He has stopped wearing the Konohagakure forehead protector. He also dons a pompadour-like haircut. He also wears new rectangular glasses. On active duty, Udon wears his forehead protector and wears a navy blue attire and a Konoha
flak jacket
 with long sleeves and a medium-length hem.

Abilities

During his time at the Academy, Udon considered himself a loser, due to struggling to properly perform the
Clone Technique
, leading to him failing to graduate several times.
 Upon becoming a genin, he could collaboratively perform the
Bouncy Bouncy Technique
 with his teammates,
 but his repeated mess up on missions cause him to label himself as a burden on his team. Fifteen years after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, he had become a
jōnin
 who specialised in producing powerful
water tendrils
 from his mucus.
 He's also very attentive, able to deduce whether others are under the influence of genjutsu and quickly release them.
