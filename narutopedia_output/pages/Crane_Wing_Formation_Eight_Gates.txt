The
Crane Wing Formation
 is a
collaboration technique
 used by seven members of the
Suicide Corps
 after activating the
sixth gate
.

Overview

The users line up side by side and enter the sixth gate. Upon doing so, they leap at their opponent, able to reach high up into the sky. The aura surrounding the users as a collective gives off the appearance of a crane's wings spread out — hence the name. When enclosing in on a target, the technique acts like a powerful blade, capable of destroying most of a gigantic meteorite.
