 manga.

Summary

The
Sunagakure
 representatives are shocked that
Lee
 has managed to strike
Gaara
. After Lee lands some additional blows they begin to grow concerned, as Gaara is becoming increasingly more interested in the fight. Gaara reveals that his body is coated in a layer of sand which has absorbed the impact of Lee's attacks. Knowing that there is nothing he can do about this defence, Lee opts to attack in such a way that not even Gaara's armour can protect him. Lee uses
Front Lotus
 on Gaara, but during a brief series of pain, gives Gaara the chance to escape his grasp.
