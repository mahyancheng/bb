This is an advanced version of the
Transformation Technique
, where two or more users combine into one form in order to gain that form's physical abilities. Because there is more than one user involved, some of the prep work can be split between users, such as by having one provide the
chakra
 while another performs the
hand seals
.

The Combination Transformations that have been seen in the series are:

The
Sound Four
 take the form of the
Fourth Kazekage
's bodyguards, with two members in each guard.

Gamabunta
 and
Naruto Uzumaki
 take the form of a giant fox. In the anime, it is specifically the

Kiba Inuzuka
 and
Akamaru
 take the form of a
Double-Headed Wolf
.

Kiba, Akamaru, and one of Kiba's shadow clones take the form of a
Three-Headed Wolf
. Because there are three users, it's called a "Mixture Transformation" (
混合変化

In the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime, the
Magaki Group
 takes the form of
their leader
