After blowing dozens of bubbles, the user manipulates them to surround the enemy in all directions. Only the slightest amount of physical contact with an opponent is required to make these bubbles burst, resulting in a small but powerful
explosion
 when they do. The user can then make them detonate simultaneously with a snap of their fingers.

Trivia

泡沫 is written with two kanji that both mean "bubble". The word can also be pronounced as "utakata", also carrying the meaning of something ephemeral and transient like a soap bubble.

Prior to the technique's introduction in the manga, the anime introduced a
similar singular variant
.

When the
Genjutsu World
 version of Utakata performed this technique, he called it "Suiton: Utakata no Jutsu".
