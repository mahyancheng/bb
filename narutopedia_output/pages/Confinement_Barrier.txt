A type of
barrier ninjutsu
 utilised by the
Konoha Barrier Team
. After using themselves as the perimeter for the barrier, a barrier is erected and then takes on a dome shape capable of even trapping the
Nue
. To ensure Konoha's ability to respond to a crisis, Naruto routinely trains Konoha shinobi to use the barrier, usually releasing his own powerful chakra to test their limit.

The barrier apparently does not prevent people from entering as the
Seventh Hokage
 was able to enter it without any issues. Similarly a
Space–Time Ninjutsu
 was able to reach the barrier.
