The
Kurama Clan
 (
鞍馬一族
,
Kurama Ichizoku
) is a clan of extremely skilled
genjutsu
 users, exclusive to the anime. This talent in genjutsu is due to the
kekkei genkai
 that the clan possesses. However, once every few generations, a member of the clan will be born with such enormous skill in genjutsu that their illusions cause the brain to make anything that happens to the victim within the genjutsu physically real, allowing the clan member to kill their opponents with genjutsu.

Such frightening power is not without its drawbacks, however. The user can rarely control the full extent of their abilities, and as such their subconscious will often regulate that power, leading to the creation of a second personality in control of that power. This personality then overwhelms the original, turning the individual into a monster that is a danger to everyone that surrounds them. They were originally one of the more prominent clans in
Konohagakure
, but the number of ninja in the clan has severely dwindled.
