Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Team 7
 agrees to continue protecting
Tazuna
. Since they are risking their lives for him, Tazuna tells them about why he lied about the mission. The
Land of Waves
 has fallen under the control of a man named
Gatō
, who has reduced the country to poverty in order to continue his illegal import and export business. Tazuna hopes that, by building a bridge that will connect the Land of Waves with the mainland, he will be able to free the country from Gatō's control, which Gatō intends to stop by killing Tazuna. He adds that he had wanted to pay for the
B-rank
 mission that this will be, but could only afford a
C-rank
. As soon as they arrive in the Land of Waves they are attacked by
Zabuza Momochi
, a skilled assassin.

Trivia

On the last page, Zabuza is mistakenly depicted with a Konoha
forehead protector
. This was not corrected for the volume release.
