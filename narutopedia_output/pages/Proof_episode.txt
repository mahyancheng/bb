Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Kawaki
,
Sarada
,
Boruto
, and
Mitsuki
 are stunned by the implication of
Naruto
's chakra ceasing to make the prosthetic hand work.
Shikamaru

paralyses
 Kawaki, has
Tasuki
 put up a
barrier
 around the Uzumaki house, and orders other shinobi to look for traces of Naruto and the enemy. He releases his hold on Kawaki and asks what happened. Wishing to save Naruto, Kawaki explains that
Jigen
 suddenly
appeared
 after his
Kāma
 hurt and formed a pattern he had never seen. Shikamaru comments on the
Konoha Barrier Team
's report, and determines it to be
space–time ninjutsu
. Sarada is confused why Jigen would take Naruto if he's after Kawaki, but he says it's because Naruto protected him. They deduce that if Jigen had simply dropped Naruto in another dimension, he'd be back by now, so they're either fighting, or Naruto has defeated Jigen and has no way back himself.
 Boruto suggests
Sasuke
, but Shikamaru reveals he has returned critically injured, and being looked after by the
Medic Corps
. They won't be able to receive Sasuke's intel until he regains consciousness. Shikamaru asks if Kawaki is holding something back, revealing he's never trusted Kawaki, and suspects he's a Kara spy. In Naruto's absence, it falls to Shikamaru what to do with Kawaki, so he decides to keep him under house arrest until they can prove he's not a spy. Boruto finds it extreme, but Kawaki agrees to it. At
Kara
's headquarters,
Amado
 tends to Jigen, and determines it'll take ten days for his chakra to fully recharge.
Code
 is incredulous someone pushed Jigen so much,
Delta
 remains silent. Amado asks about Naruto, who Jigen reveals he has sealed. Jigen admits to getting carried away by the progress of Kawaki's Kāma, both he and Amado agreeing it's due to resonance with Boruto's Kāma. He believes both of them will become powerful
Ōtsutsuki
, and that a giant
God Tree
 will grow, claiming all life in the
planet
, its chakra fruit making all their wishes a reality. As he retreats to recover, Jigen orders Code to guard the
Ten-Tails
, and asks about
Boro
. Code says he's neither there nor with
his cult
. Jigen wants Code to relay orders for Boro to guard Naruto's seal. Delta is mad there's nothing for her to do, Jigen telling her there's no need for her powers at the moment, and that it'll all be over soon. Boruto and Shikamaru continue to argue over whether Kawaki is a spy. A Kara operative informs
Koji
 that Boro wishes to speak with him. Boro contacts him
through genjutsu
, and asks him about his inaction and lack of reports. Koji claims to have reported everything to Jigen, who must have chosen not to relay the intel to them. Koji keeps up his facade, even when Boro shows him one of his
toads
 he recovered in the crashed airship. Koji claims he knew the airship would crash because Jigen had suspicious about it, so he was using the toad to
monitor
 it. He reveals that Jigen personally came to
Konoha
, and asks why didn't he deal with Koji if he was a traitor since he was so close. They discuss the progress of Boruto's Kāma before Boro is called away. Kawaki wonders why Naruto was so caring about him, and Sarada shares her opinion. One of Shikamaru's subordinates brings the repaired vase, which Boruto tries to use as proof that Kawaki isn't a spy, which Shikamaru refuses. Kawaki's prosthetic hand resumes working, Naruto's chakra being proof he's alive. Sensing Naruto's chakra, Kawaki asks Boruto for help, and they use their Kāma to open a portal like Jigen's. The children want to go rescue Naruto, but Shikamaru paralyses them, having not allowed it. Kawaki
absorbs
 Shikamaru's jutsu with his Kāma, and Mitsuki takes the other two through the portal. As he leaves, Kawaki tells Shikamaru he's getting his proof.
