A map depicting the country's location.



The
Land of Demons
 (
鬼乃国
,
Oni no Kuni
,
English TV:
 Land of Ogres) is featured in
Naruto Shippūden the Movie
. It is located two countries away from the
Land of Swamps
. The country's priestess,
Shion
, can
predict someone's death
 and seal away demons. The demon
Mōryō
's spirit was imprisoned here.
 The techniques that are passed down in this country, such as the
Shrine Seal
 and the
Shadow Mirror Body Changing Method
, seem to use
hand seals
 that are completely different from the standard twelve.

Mōryō's Spirit Seal





The shrine where Mōryō was sealed.



A large stone building whose interior opens up into a seemingly natural cavern. Part of the
Ghost Army
 is sealed within pits around the centre, not unlike the real life terracotta army in China. Numerous ropes with what appear to be paper seals hang around across the cavern. At its centre is a shrine-like structure surrounded by five pillars, a large emblem made of light illuminating it from above. According to
Yomi
, the chamber where Mōryō's soul is sealed is another realm separated from that of the living, and that only he, who bears the name "Yomi" (
黄泉
,
literally meaning:
 underworld), can enter. The entrance was guarded by four soldiers before the
Gang of Four
 easily killed them.

Priestess' Compound





Shion's home.



A large building not unlike a temple complete with torii. It is where Shion seemingly lives, guarded by countless soldiers. In the event of attack, there is a secret passage leading from the back wall of the Priestess' room to a waterfall behind the compound, which then appears to go further through the waterfall to an unknown location. The complex was greatly damaged by the Gang of Four, in which many guards were killed and wounded.
