boy
 with connections to

Misuno and Kagura sharing information.



Misuno accompanied Chōjūrō to the opening ceremony of the
Shinonome
 1 power station. After one of the airships crashes, Misuno asked Chōjūrō to return to his office, where he can better request for reinforcements. Later, she and Kagura updated each other on the events that happened on the ceremony and at the prison. When the Funato and Kirigakure fleets began fighting at sea, Misuno reported to Chōjūrō they remained on the defensive.






Misuno protects Chōjūrō from Isari's harpoon.



Later, Misuno reported to the Mizukage that
Kagura Karatachi
 and
Hebiichigo
 were killed in action protecting a village from a detached Funato unit on its way to a secret attack to Kirigakure. When they received word that
Isari Funato
 wanted to negotiate, she remained wary. While Isari and Chōjūrō agreed to talk, Araumi made a broadcast, announcing an attack on Kirigakure, and unwavering commitment, even willing to attack his relatives if they opposed him. The
Marlin Harpoon
 skewered Isari, killing him, and attempted to kill Chōjūrō, but was cut down by Misuno. Misuno later notified Chōjūrō that the main Funato forces meant to sail through the Sea of Death in order to attack the Shinonome 1. She carried out his orders to mobilise all ships that could get arrive in time to defend it.

As the Kirigakure forces gathered to protect the Shinonome 1,
Team 7
 arrived, returning Kagura's
Hiramekarei
. They voiced their desire to stop the war, hoping to reason with
Ikada Funato
, who was previously their friend. Misuno was outraged at the naivety, determined to make the Funato pay for all the harm they caused to the Land of Water. Chōjūrō calmed her down, understanding Team 7's desire for peace. He permitted them to make an effort to reason with Ikada, explaining to her that as Boruto was able to turn Kagura away from violence before, he might be able to achieve the same with Ikada. In the event of it failing, Misuno and Chōjūrō rallied the Kiri forces to prepare for war. As Team 7 approached the Funato ships, Misuno and Chōjūrō listened in through their ship's instruments.






Misuno and Chōjūrō discuss the aftermath of the Funato war.



Misuno wasn't surprised by their hostility and asked Chōjūrō what they should do, him telling her Team 7 still had more time. She was shocked when the Funato mobile fortress appeared, its
Chakra Cannon
 charging a shot at the Shinonome 1. They were also shock by Boruto's offer to sacrifice himself to stop the war. Chōjūrō ordered Misuno to prepare for launching an attack. However, Boruto's commitment paid off, and Ikada ordered a withdrawal of the Funato forces. Chōjūrō admitted to Misuno that they allowed their anger for what happened to Kagura to distort his wish for peace, and also recalled their forces. In the aftermath, Misuno provided Chōjūrō with reports on the damages, as well as a request from the
Water Daimyō
 for harsh punishment for the Funato ringleaders Araumi and Ikada. They discussed the lives lost, and how the quick modernisation of the country led them to the conflict. She later accompanied Chōjūrō as he informed Ikada of his surveillance sentence by
Kajiki
.

Trivia

桶柑
) in the end credits.
