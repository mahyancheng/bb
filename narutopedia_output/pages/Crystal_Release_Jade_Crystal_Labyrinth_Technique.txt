After planting red crystal seeds, Guren can cause them to bloom at will. These flower-like constructs will rapidly grow and into a massive barrier in order to trap whatever is within its perimeter. Enemies trapped inside hindered by the labyrinth's reflective nature as it can generate mirror images of the routes, paths, and other details within its confines, confusing and disorienting them. It is even capable of confusing the
Byakugan
. Until it is broken, the barrier cannot be discerned from within.

Because of the crystal's stable molecular structure, a simple attack focused at one point is rendered useless, and its wide surface will disperse the force of wide range attacks, reducing their effectiveness. To overcome this technique, an
attack that has impact force both wide and powerful
 is required to smash through it from the outside.

Trivia

Although the technique is called "Jade-Crystal Labyrinth", the gigantic labyrinth itself is
red
 in colouration.
