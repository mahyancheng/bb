Naruto
 manga.

Summary

As
Obito
 lay defeated, he watches on as
Naruto
 uses his
Big Ball Rasenshuriken
 to attack
Madara
, who has been
immobilised
 by
Hashirama
.
Gaara
 asks
Shukaku
 for help in
sealing
 Madara to which the raccoon eventually obliges as a way of proving himself superior to
Kurama
. The other
tailed beasts
 also lend Gaara their help, intent on repaying Naruto for freeing them. Meanwhile, giving the regenerating Madara no time to retaliate, Hashirama incapacitated him further by trapping him beneath his
torii seals
.
 Despite his circumstance, Madara grins in anticipation. Kurama tells Minato that even though Obito lost the tailed beasts, he'll survive as he's still connected to the life force of the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
. Obito muses on how
Nagato
 used the
Outer Path: Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 to help the enemy, then ultimately decides to do the same. Obito tells
Minato
 and
Kakashi
 that he finally understands why Nagato would side with Naruto in the end; the teachings of
Jiraiya
 were what gave them hope for a better future. Knowing that his connection to Minato, who was a student of Jiraiya made him similar to Nagato and Naruto, Obito decides to repent by sacrificing his own life the same way Nagato did. At that moment,
Black Zetsu
 suddenly
appears
 and grabs hold of Obito. As Zetsu apologises to him, he declares that this was his singular purpose all along as he begins to merge with Obito's body. Madara thanks Naruto for weakening Obito as it allows Black Zetsu to manipulate Obito into using the
Outer Path
 technique to successfully bring Madara back to life. Now alive the ecstatic Madara declares that he would once again be able to enjoy the thrills of war with a human body.

Trivia

In one panel, Kakashi is mistakenly depicted wearing a
Konohagakure

forehead protector
 rather than that of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. This was not corrected in the tankōbon version.

When the
Sage of the Six Paths
 is shown, the pattern on the back of his kimono are identical to the markings that were on Obito's back as the
Ten-Tails
'
jinchūriki
, with the
Rinnegan
 marking shaped into a
magatama
. This was not corrected in the tankōbon version.
