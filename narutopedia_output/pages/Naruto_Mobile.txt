Naruto Mobile
 (
ナルトバイル
,
Naruto Mobairu
) is a free-to-play side-scrolling action fighter game developed by More Fun Studio (魔方工作室), a Chinese company owned by Tencent Games, with licensing and IP support from
Namco Bandai Games
. The game features a strong focus on PvP (player vs player) combat and delivers visually impressive animation effects. Production oversight is provided by Masashi Kishimoto and the production committee of
Shueisha
,
TV-Tokyo
 and
Studio Pierrot
.

The game's background and characters will be depicted in 2D, with elaborate character animation. Some of the character designs, including the opponents for the playable characters, as well as the backgrounds, were taken from a
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Online
 as it was created by the same authors. Unlike the aforementioned game, however, in this game the player does not need to create an original character, since the entire plot follows the characters of the original story. The plot begins with the first episode of the original anime and continues up to the events of
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
.

This game is released only in Chinese with the original voice acting of all the characters. The game also requires mandatory registration in the Asian social network QQ.

Commercial Performance

Naruto Mobile
 has been a colossal commercial success for Tencent Games since its launch in 2016. By 2024,   its lifetime revenue across all platforms had surpassed
20 billion CNY/(approx. $2.87 billion USD)
.  It consistently ranks highly on revenue charts, placing 7th among all Tencent-published mobile games in 2024 and 14th among all mobile games in China by revenue for the year, generating around 4.0 billion CNY (approx. $568 million USD) in 2024 alone.

According to official data, in 2023 alone, the number of people participating in the "Naruto" mobile game e-sports events has exceeded 6 million, and the total number of spectators has reached
100 million
.

The game maintains a large and engaged player base, with peak Daily Active Users (DAU) exceeding 10 million and a 30-day retention rate steadily above 21%. Its performance remained strong during the summer of 2024 (June–August), recording a 40% year-over-year revenue growth.

Key factors contributing to its enduring success include engaging PVP gameplay, frequent content updates, and a robust social ecosystem featuring Clan Wars and Ninja Leagues. In addition, the support of a large, dedicated, and loyal community, alongside the strong backing of the Naruto IP, has ensured sustained player engagement and long-term appeal.

Gameplay

Naruto Mobile plays very similar to a beat-em-up style fighting game. Most notably, the game has a vertical axis; unlike most fighting games, characters can move up and down instead of being solely limited to moving left and right.

The passage of the game follows the plot of the anime. Characters are categorised by strength and are designated with a ranking system of S, A, B and C, where S are the strongest fighters and fewer than the rest, and C are relatively weaker and mainly consist of more minor characters. The player receives playable characters by collecting fragments, winning tournaments, purchasing characters with in-game currency or real money, or as gifts. Characters are also given out regularly as monthly sign-in rewards. In the game itself, in addition to battles, the player needs to complete small missions like bringing the dying
Zabuza
 to
Haku
's body.

In this game, a fairly large number of player attacks are associated with the summoning of techniques from the scroll. Summons of various techniques like
Fire Release: Demon Lantern
 or
Wind Release: Spiralling Wind Ball
 are available to absolutely any playable character. In addition, each character has access to the
Summoning Technique
, with the help of which he can summon any creature, from
Ninken
 and
Toads
 to
Giant Rhino
 and
Ibuse
.

In the trailer announcing content from
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
, the game appears to reference an outdated version of the wiki's
nature transformation chart
.
