Tatakai no Hajimari…!!
)

After gathering his things,
Sasuke
 heads for
Konoha
's exit. He finds
Sakura
 waiting for him there. He tells her to go home. She does not, instead asking why, after all they've been through together, he always ignores her. Sasuke responds that she can't understand him, but Sakura insists that, because she loves him, she's willing to try. She offers to help him take revenge and to accompany him in leaving Konoha, anything so long as she can be with him. He leaves so she threatens to scream. He knocks her out after thanking her. The
Sound Four
 greet Sasuke outside the village to accompany him to
Orochimaru
.

While running errands for
Tsunade
,
Izumo
 and
Kotetsu
 find
Sakura
 unconscious. They wake her up and she tells them about
Sasuke
's defection. They immediately inform Tsunade. Surprised that
Orochimaru
 is making his move so soon, Tsunade has
Shikamaru
 brought before her and tells him what has happened. Because the village is understaffed after Orochimaru's
Konoha Crush
, Shikamaru and a
genin
 team of his choosing are all that can be spared to retrieve Sasuke. Tsunade recommends
Naruto
 and Shikamaru insists on bringing
Chōji
. Naruto suggests that
Shino
 would be preferable to Chōji, but
Kiba
 informs them that Shino is away on a mission. He, however, volunteers.
Lee
 overhears them and recommends
Neji
. Lee himself awaiting his surgery.

Before the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 departs,
Shikamaru
 asserts his leadership and establishes a basic approach to how the mission will be carried out. Despite the frantic nature of the mission, the team and
Rock Lee
 can find no faults with his plan.
Sakura
 stops them before they leave and pleads with
Naruto
 to bring
Sasuke
 home, believing that he is now the only person capable of getting through to him. Admitting that he knows of Sakura's feelings, Naruto half-heartedly vows to do so, encouraging the team and causing Sakura to acknowledge all of his selfless actions. Elsewhere the
Sound Four
 inform Sasuke of a task given to them by
Orochimaru
, bluntly telling him that he needs to die once.

Chapter 184

Oto vs. Konoha!!
" (
音vs木ノ葉!!
,
Oto Bāsasu Konoha!!
)

The
Sound Four
 offer to advance
Sasuke
's
cursed seal
 to its second level. Because they are forcing the process, Sasuke must be put into a death-like state for an extended period of time. They explain the state as 'suspended animation' after which Sasuke agrees and, after "dying", is sealed into a coffin. Meanwhile,
Tsunade
 gives
Lee
 a final chance to back out of the operation. Seeing how determined he is to resume his life as a ninja and fulfil his dreams, she immediately gets to work. As the Sound Four carry Sasuke's coffin to
Orochimaru
, they are found by
Konoha
 ninja returning from a mission. Knowing they will need help, the Sound Four activate their cursed seals.

Chapter 185

"
Pursue Oto…!!
" (
音を追え…!!
,
Oto o Oe…!!
)

After activating level one of their
cursed seals
, the
Sound Four
 attack
Raidō Namiashi
 and
Genma Shiranui
. When they do not return their teammates,
Iwashi Tatami
 and
Shizune
, go looking for them and find them near death. The
Sasuke Recovery Team
, detecting the battle while pursuing
Sasuke
, realises that Sasuke has escorts. They near the Sound Four's location and find traps in the area. Knowing they are probably resting after their battle, the Retrieval Team prepares to ambush them.

Chapter 186

"
The Strategy… Failed?!
" (
作戦…失敗!?
,
Sakusen… Shippai!?
)

Having been forced the activate level two of their
cursed seals
 during the earlier fight with the
Konoha
 ninja, the
Sound Four
 rest. The
Sasuke Recovery Team
, observing them, determines that
Sasuke
 is likely in the coffin the Sound Four have with them. They approach, but are quickly attacked. Although the Sound Four believe they have stopped an ambush, they discover that they have been captured by
Shikamaru
's
Shadow Imitation Technique
.
Sakon
 is
somehow
 able to free them and
Jirōbō
 immediately traps them in a rock prison from which the Retrieval Team is unable to escape. The Sound Four continue on while Jirōbō stays behind, which
Neji
 discovers to be because he is absorbing their
chakra
.

Chapter 187

"
Begging for One's Life…!!
" (
命乞い…!!
,
Inochigoi…!!
)

As their
chakra
 is slowly consumed by
Jirōbō
,
Shikamaru
 analyses the damage that
Kiba
 is doing to their rock prison in his attempts to break out. He offers to give up the others if Jirōbō will let him go, but Jirōbō refuses. Most of the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 concludes he is a traitor but
Chōji
, trusting Shikamaru, recognises that he has a plan. Shikamaru informs them that, although their prison repairs itself, the process is slowed at the point furthest from Jirōbō. With the help of
Neji
 they are able to pinpoint the slowest repairing point. Ashamed for doubting him, the team focuses their attacks on that area and are able to escape.

Chapter 188

"
The Shinobi of Konohagakure…!!
" (
木ノ葉隠れの忍…!!
,
Konohagakure no Shinobi
)

Jirōbō
 is impressed that the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 was able to escape but, having consumed most of their
chakra
, is confident he can defeat them.
Shikamaru
 suggests splitting the team up, the others going ahead while he catches Jirōbō with his shadow and
Naruto
 fights him. Jirōbō ridicules the plan and Shikamaru's jutsu, expressing his sympathies that the team has a leader as useless as Shikamaru.
Chōji
 demands that he, and only he, be allowed to fight Jirōbō while the others follow the rest of the
Sound Four
. He gives them
Military Rations Pills
 to restore their chakra which Shikamaru, confident in Chōji, accepts. They leave and Jirōbō tries to go after them, but Chōji takes the first of his
Three Coloured Pills
, the green Spinach Pill (
ホウレン丸
,
Hōrengan
) to stop Jirōbō.

Chapter 189

"
The Power of Faith…!!
" (
信じる力…!!
,
Shinjiru Chikara…!!
)

After taking the first of the
Three Coloured Pills
,
Chōji
 is able to match
Jirōbō
 in physical strength. They exchange blows, but Chōji quickly begins to feel the strain of taking the pill. As they leave the area the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 wonders if Chōji can defeat Jirōbō, but
Shikamaru
 informs them that one-on-one battles are perhaps the best they can hope for and that Chōji, who considers himself as the weakest of the team, is doing his part now. Shikamaru adds that he is wrong to think so, as Chōji is actually the strongest. Jirōbō activates the first stage of his
cursed seal
 to overpower Chōji and observes that he has been abandoned by the rest of his team. Determined to prove Jirōbō wrong and to avoid disappointing Shikamaru, Chōji takes the second pill, the yellow Curry Pill (
カレー丸
,
Karēgan
), to increase his size to gigantic proportions.

Chapter 190

"
Unforgivable!!
" (
許せない!!
,
Yurusenai!!
)

Jirōbō
 activates level two of his
cursed seal
 to repel
Chōji
. Chōji cannot move after taking two of his
Three Coloured Pills
 and thus cannot stop Jirōbō from eating the last of his potato chips. Jirōbō assures him that he shouldn't feel bad since Chōji is fat and will soon be joined by
Shikamaru
, his "worthless" team leader, in death. Chōji thinks back to his childhood and how all of the kids his age looked down on him for his weight. Only Shikamaru stuck up for him and, in fact, didn't care, knowing Chōji had more important qualities. They have been best friends ever since. Although using the last pill will surely cause his death, Chōji does not hesitate to take the red Chilli Pill (
トンガラシ丸
,
Tongarashigan
). Easily restraining Jirōbō, he informs him that he's one-hundred times as powerful as he was before. Chōji tells him that he could ignore being called fat or having food taken from him. What he cannot forgive is Shikamaru being insulted. He punches Jirōbō, decimating the area.
