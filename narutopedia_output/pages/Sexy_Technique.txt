Naruto Uzumaki
 created this technique in order to play pranks on men. The user
transforms
 into a beautiful woman, with special attention given to the woman's figure, breasts, and waist.
 When Naruto teaches this technique to
Konohamaru Sarutobi
, Konohamaru initially struggles to take an attractive form;
 in the anime, Naruto helps him improve by having him look at naked women.
 With practice, Konohamaru is eventually able to use this technique effectively, though
Rin no Sho
 describes his version as not having the same "wow" factor as Naruto's.

Certain types of men are very vulnerable to the Sexy Technique: the
Third Hokage
 gets a severe nosebleed, causing him to pass out;

Jiraiya
 remains conscious, but agrees to do anything the user - typically Naruto - asks him to do.
 On the other hand,
Ebisu
 only blushes to see it and is otherwise unmoved; for cases such as these, Naruto created the
Harem Technique
, which does indeed defeat Ebisu.
 Because the standard Sexy Technique has no effect on women, Konohamaru eventually creates the
Sexy: Boy on Boy Technique
 to specifically appeal to them.

Trivia





The revealing devil outfit.



In the manga, the Sexy Technique usually takes the form of a naked woman whose private parts are obscured by smoke. In some anime episodes and in
Naruto
 video games, the user instead takes the form of a woman wearing a swimsuit.

In "
The New Erotic Ninjutsu Completed!!
", instead of turning into a naked woman, Naruto transforms into a woman wearing a revealing devil outfit. Jiraiya's desire for Naruto to take a form with even skimpier clothing leads Naruto create a
"new" Sexy Technique
.

A similar transformation appeared in the
pilot chapter
 of
Naruto
.

In
Hyō no Sho
,
Iruka Umino
 rates the Sexy Technique as having an Impact of 4/5, Creativity of 5/5, and Annoyance of 1/5.
