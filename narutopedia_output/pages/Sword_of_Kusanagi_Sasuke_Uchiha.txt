This article is about the chokutō wielded by Sasuke Uchiha. For the sword wielded by Orochimaru, see
Sword of Kusanagi
. For other uses, see
Sword of Kusanagi
.

The
chokutō
 Sasuke Uchiha referred to as a
Sword of Kusanagi
 was his personal weapon throughout the entirety of Part II. It had a black scabbard and matching hilt, and was a larger size than a normal chokutō. It had none of the natural specialities as
the one

Orochimaru
 wields, such as the extension of the blade and the ability to cut through almost anything, both of which are natural attributes of the Kusanagi, but it was repeatedly shown to be very durable and able to cut through various materials.

Sasuke could expand on his sword's might by
channelling
 his
lightning chakra
 into the blade with
chakra flow
, which would increase its sharpness greatly through high-frequency vibrations, as well as increasing its cutting range. This would allow Sasuke to cut through almost anything, as well as numb the target who has been pierced by this lightning blade. During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, a
reincarnated

Itachi Uchiha
, while cooperating with his brother, temporarily wielded the blade to engage
Kabuto Yakushi
. Sasuke was later mortally wounded after being stabbed in the heart with this blade by
Madara Uchiha
.

The sword was later discarded during his battle with Madara, while the scabbard was destroyed during his battle with
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 in her
dimension
. Many years after the war, Sasuke replaced the sword with a new one.
