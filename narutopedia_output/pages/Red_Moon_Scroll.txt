The
Red Moon Scroll
 is a special
scroll
 that can end the
Genjutsu World
. At some point,
Jiraiya
 went on a mission to retrieve the scroll, but failed to return it to
Konoha
. Before perishing, to make sure it didn't fall into the wrong hands, Jiraiya set a
trap
 that only his student,
Minato
, could get through. Minato and several other Konoha-nin later went to retrieve the scroll. Although they inadvertently triggered the trap, Minato was able to remove it and acquire the scroll. The scroll was stored in a safe in Konoha until the moon turned red, the only time it could be used.
Menma
 subsequently attacked the village in an attempt to steal the scroll, ultimately destroying it in order to stop
Naruto
 from using it.
