Bingo Books
 (
手配書
,
Bingo Bukku
) are black books used by ninja that contain any and all information on black-listed ninja they are to target. There are multiple versions of the Bingo Books, the most common being those based from the Hidden Villages.

Purpose

Normally, Bingo Book entries are compiled by a village's high ranking officials, usually the
Kage
, that are then distributed to its
jōnin
 and
Anbu
 members. Those listed are typically dangerous ninja from rival villages,
missing-nin
, or potential security threats that are to be eliminated given the opportunity.
 A unit of Anbu from
Kirigakure
, the
hunter-nin
, have the sole purpose of eradicating missing-nin so that no physical trace of their body remains.

The
Akatsuki
, on the other hand, use their Bingo Book for the purpose of listing their
jinchūriki
 targets and certain ninja from the villages who have potential use to them. In
Kakuzu
's case, he lists his Bingo Book with information on various ninja with large bounties on their heads so that he can claim the bounty on them.

In
Sakura Hiden
,
Sai
 investigates several individuals listed in the Bingo Book to determine if any are behind recent attacks in Konoha. He dismisses each of them as suspects for different reasons:

Tenzen (

) is a
missing-nin
 of
Kirigakure
. He has been causing mischief near
Kumogakure
 for the year prior to

Genba (

) was a member of the group called "Tamanuki" (
魂抜き
). He died of an illness half a year before the events of
Sakura Hiden
.

Baraki (

Trivia

Although the word for Bingo Book is written as "Tehaisho" (
手配書
), it is
read
 the same as the English "Bingo Book". The kanji would literally translate to "Wanted Person Book" and is commonly used to refer to
wanted posters
.

According to
Kabuto
, his own bounty within the Bingo Book pales in comparison to
Sasuke
's or
Orochimaru
's.
