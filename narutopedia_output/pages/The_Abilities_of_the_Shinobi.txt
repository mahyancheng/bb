Naruto
 manga.

Summary

With
Jiraiya
 unable to fully control his
chakra
,
Naruto
 tries to summon a
toad
 larger than
Gamakichi
 for him to use. He can only summon
Gamatatsu
, Gamakichi's younger brother.
Orochimaru
 and
Kabuto
, each riding a
snake
, attack. Jiraiya is able to trap Orochimaru's in a swamp, but Kabuto's manages to catch Naruto in its mouth. As Naruto struggles to escape, Kabuto fights
Shizune
 and quickly subdues her. He then turns his attention to the still-paralysed
Tsunade
. Jiraiya and Orochimaru exchange blows but, being unable to do much to each other, discuss their respective interests. Orochimaru says that nobody can compare to
Sasuke
, an
Uchiha
, but Jiraiya says that natural skills do not compare to someone with Naruto's determination. At that moment, Naruto blocks Kabuto's attack.
