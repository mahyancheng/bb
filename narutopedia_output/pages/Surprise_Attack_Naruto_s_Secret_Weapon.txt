Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Using
Kiba
's own smokescreen as a cover,
Naruto
 disguises himself as a third Kiba through use of the
Transformation Technique
 and tricks Kiba into knocking
Akamaru
 out, which only serves to anger Kiba. Naruto, however, is still at a disadvantage due to Kiba's pill-enhanced chakra and superior speed. Kiba's onslaught ends when Naruto accidentally farts in Kiba's face due to straining himself too hard, resulting in a disastrous effect on him due to his enhanced sense of smell. Naruto then finishes the battle with
Naruto Uzumaki Combo
, a technique he based off of
Sasuke
's
winning move
 that utilises his
shadow clones
.
