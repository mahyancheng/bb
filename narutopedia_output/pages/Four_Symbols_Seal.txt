This technique requires a great deal of talent to perform. The user applies the seal's formula to an object or a human's body, sealing a large enemy or an evil spirit within them.
 If two Four Symbols Seal are used, a stronger seal is created; this is called the
Eight Trigrams Sealing Style
. If the Four Symbols Seals do not completely overlap with each other, this allows the enemy/spirit's
chakra
 to merge with whoever they've been sealed into. This is how the
Nine-Tails
 was sealed into the body of
Naruto Uzumaki
.

The Four Symbols Seal is based on the
fūinjutsu
 of
Uzushiogakure
's
Uzumaki clan
.
 According to
Killer B
, it is stronger than the
Iron Armour Seal
 used to seal the
Eight-Tails
 within him.
 The Four Symbols Seal is also left on the stomachs of those who perform the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
.

Trivia

This technique has the opposite effect of the
Reverse Four Symbols Sealing

Obito Uchiha

two
 Four Symbols Seals.

In the anime,
Orochimaru
 suited
Mecha-Naruto
