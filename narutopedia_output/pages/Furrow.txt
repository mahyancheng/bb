Naruto
 manga.

Summary

As the
tailed beasts
 all start to take corporeal forms, they gladly thank
Naruto
 for saving them. Rushing forward suddenly,
Sasuke
 heads towards
Obito
's location with his
sword
 drawn; his intentions clear. With other
sensors
 such as
C

detecting
 that Obito was still alive, the
Alliance
 mobilise to deal the finishing blow. However, both Sasuke and the Alliance are stopped by
Kakashi
's
reemergence
 on the battlefield and
Tsunade
's orders respectively.
 Kakashi informs his former student that this burden was his to bear as he was Obito's friend, but before Kakashi can deal the blow to a resigned Obito, he is stopped by
Minato
. The three men talk about the past, their regrets over
Rin
's death and how everything had turned out. Kakashi then tells a doubtful Obito that Naruto would not turn out the way he they did because if he faltered, he had friends and support that would help him back up. All throughout this, Naruto had moved to locate
Madara
 and
Hashirama
 in order to aid in sealing the
Uchiha
. Standing atop the tree form of the
Ten-Tails
, Naruto and his
shadow clones
 form the
Big Ball Rasenshuriken
 which they continue to increase in size until it becomes like a giant beacon above the battlefield, that illuminates his
comrades
' footsteps.

Trivia

At the start of the chapter, when Sasuke rushes towards Obito to deliver the final blow, his eyes are in his original
Mangekyō Sharingan
 form. This wasn't corrected in the
tankōbon
 version.
