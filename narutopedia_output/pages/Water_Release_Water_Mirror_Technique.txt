The user creates a large, flat, circular pool of water in front of their opponent. Its surface acts like a mirror, perfectly reflecting the attacking targets. By then hooking onto and rotating the "mirror" 90° with their
staff
, the reflections emerge and materialise from the mirror, where they collide with the mirrored targets. As these reflections use the exact same
technique
 as their counterpart — regardless of its type — they counter the attack completely, while repelling them in the process. However, upon impact, the reflections disperse into water.

Trivia

Mizukagami
 (
