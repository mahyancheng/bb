Synopsis

Naruto
 arrives to help a team of
Allied Shinobi Forces

Karui
, who are struggling against a
reincarnated

samurai
, whom
Naruto
 recognises as a man named
Tatewaki
 he met on a previous mission. Naruto has a flashback to when
Tsunade
 assigned
Team Asuma
 and Naruto to go to the
Land of This
 and kidnap
Shū
, the son of the
daimyō
 under a treaty.
Shikamaru
 formulates a plan to capture Shū by having
Chōji
 enter an eating contest at the Land of This' castle and get second place. Chōji speeds through the competition, and before the final round,
Ino
 uses her
Mind Body Switch Technique
 to take control of Shū and goes to the washroom in the castle, where Naruto uses his
Transformation Technique
 to transform into Shū. When Shū is able to re-enter his body, he asks who Shikamaru is and Shikamaru explains the mission to him. Meanwhile, before Chōji can win the final round of the eating contest, Shikamaru uses the
Shadow Imitation Technique
 to stop Chōji from eating the last BBQ chicken, landing him in second place after
Isono
.

Trivia

The outfits Naruto and Chōji wear for the eating contest are the same clothes they wore during their childhood.
