This article is about former daimyō of the Land of Wind. For his Part II successor, see
Wind Daimyō
.

He is the former
daimyō
 of the
Land of Wind
 (
風の国の大名
,
Kaze no Kuni no Daimyō
).

Personality

The former daimyō of the Land of Wind has been described as being deeply religious and
hedonistic
.
 He is also quite frugal, as he reduced funding for Sunagakure, the village of his land, and outsourced many jobs to the less expensive Konohagakure; this led him to be highly unpopular with Suna's citizens, leaving them to believe he was trying to get rid of them and attempted a revolution to induce fear into the daimyō by destroying Konoha.

Appearance

He wears a purple garb over a brown kimono and a purple hat to match, not the standard attire of the
daimyō
 of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
. He keeps his black facial hair in the form of a goatee.

He had become very unpopular among
Sunagakure
 shinobi after reducing the funding of the country's hidden village; he outsourced many jobs to
Konohagakure
. This had caused many to believe that he was trying to do away with Suna. This prompted Sunagakure to take part in the
Konoha Crush
.

For undisclosed reasons, he has been replaced by
another daimyō
 by Part II.
