The user concentrates all their
Shikotsumyaku
 powers into the creation of a single bone weapon, which is made as hard as possible with a considerable amount of
chakra
. Because of the weapon's large size, as well as the sheer density of the compressed bone,
Kimimaro
 must enter the second level of his
cursed seal
 to be able to handle it. The bone weapon can be incredibly destructive, wielded as a sort of battering ram or spear. But a philosophy of the
Kaguya clan
 is that even the deadliest weapon is useless if it can't hit its target. As such, Dance of the Clematis: Flower is first preceded by
Dance of the Clematis: Vine
, which is used to immobilise targets.
 Despite its strength, this technique was unable to break through
Ultimately Hard Absolute Defence: Shield of Shukaku
, against which it shattered into pieces.

Trivia

Clematis florida

clematis
. It's a perennial ivy that grows flowers coloured white or deep purple.
