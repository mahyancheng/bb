Iwaji
 (
岩次
) is a
shinobi
 from
Iwagakure
 and along with his siblings made up the
Three Brothers
 group.

Personality

Iwaji seems to be a relentless and cruel person. He also seems to be easily irritated and quick to action as seen when his brother had to stop him from rushing after
Kosuke Maruboshi
.

Appearance

He is, unlike his two brothers, both tall and slender, with pronounced cheekbones, a prominent chin, and a narrow face. He does however have the same shaven head and wears bandages around his arms like his siblings. His attire also mirrors his siblings as he wears the standard Iwa-nin
flak jacket
 with no shirt underneath, the standard pants with lapel, and sandals. Unlike them, however, he dons his
forehead protector
 in a bandanna style.

Abilities

Though much has not been seen of his abilities he seemingly preferred close-range combat and was adept at
taijutsu
. Iwaji was a fast individual, and it often appeared that he was skating on the ground rather than simply running on it.
