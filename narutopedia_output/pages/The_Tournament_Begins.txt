Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Teams Konohamaru
 and
Moegi
 prepare for the third round of the Chūnin Exams. The Five
Kage
 are in attendance, and
Rock Lee
 is the proctor for the round. Lee explains how the battles were arranged. The first battle is
Boruto
 versus
Yurui
. The briefly clash with swords and kunai before Yurui begins using his exploding bubblegum.
Yodo
 tells
Shinki
 he might not get to fight Boruto. Shinki warns them against fighting
Mitsuki
, but
Toroi
 is confident he'll beat him. Boruto tries curving his shuriken to weave through the bubblegum, but hits one before getting to Yurui. Boruto considers curving his shuriken again, but not wanting to lose with his father watching, he uses the
Kote
 instead, curving a shuriken that manages to pop one of Yurui's gums right in front of him, defeating him.
 The second match is Yodo versus
Shikadai
. Shikadai goes on the offensive, trying to pin Yodo with his shadow and kunai, but Yodo dodges them easily. She reflects a kunai with an
explosive tag
 back at Shikadai, and dodges his attack again even when he obscures her sight with a
smoke bomb
. Yodo attacks using her
hair to create sound waves
. Shikadai steps on leftover of Yurui's gum, and his next attack almost hits her. Shikadai realises she's not using her eyes to read his movements, but is listening to his shifting posture to determine where he's going to attack. Shikadai tries using explosive tags, but her attack hits him again, causing them to detonate. Yodo is paralysed by his shadow, and realises he deliberately set off he tags to muffle the sound of his shifting stance. Cornered, Yodo yields the match. The third match is
Sarada
 versus
Tarui
. Sarada dodges Tarui's initial attack with her
Sharingan
, and defeats her with one punch. The fourth match is
Inojin
 versus
Araya
. Inojin uses explosive tags inside his drawings, but Araya gives no reaction to them, and defeats him. The fifth match is Toroi versus Mitsuki. Toroi uses
Lightning Release
 to
increase his reaction time
. Mitsuki begins to use
Sage Mode
, something Shinki apparently recognises. Mitsuki remembers he's not supposed to use Sage Mode, so he
summons

snakes
 to pin down Toroi, forcing him to yield. The final match of the first round is
Chōchō
 versus Shinki.
