Summary





Kiba's impostor.



Noticing a decline in the success rate of
Naruto
,
Hinata
, and
Kiba
 on their recent ninja
missions
,
Tsunade
 decided to give them one final chance before considering sending them back to the
academy
 for additional training. Their mission involved retrieving a hidden treasure. However, disagreements between Naruto and Kiba led them to take different paths, with Kiba consistently choosing the correct route. Along the way, Hinata injured her ankle, prompting Kiba to proceed alone while Naruto stayed behind to assist her.

During Kiba's absence, Naruto and Hinata were attacked and captured by mysterious ninja. Upon awakening, Naruto discovered that they were replicated by their captors, members of the
Kedōin clan
 with a unique transformation technique capable of
copying a person beyond mere appearance
. The clan's sinister plan involved infiltrating Konoha to destroy it from within.

Facing a perilous situation, the enemies attempted to crush Naruto and his team in a cave-in. Kiba and Naruto worked together to free Hinata, who utilised her
Gentle Fist
 technique to repel the falling rocks. Escaping the cave, the team pursued the Kedōin clan. Naruto's anger surged when his double wreaked havoc in the village, accumulating a hefty bill from various establishments and consuming all of Naruto's saved food at home. Discovering the doubles' weakness in replicating physical prowess, they easily captured them.

In a surprising twist, Tsunade revealed that she had actually hired the Kedōin clan to test Naruto and his companions, assessing their ability to handle such challenging situations.
