Chikasui Mujinzō no Ningu
) is episode 189 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 and
Yurinojō
 do battle with
Ruiga
, and with
Chōji
's help, are able to defeat him by destroying his "dowsing" tonfas, which allows him to search for places where there are great amounts of water, and leading him to a dry area to put him at a disadvantage. Ruiga survives the battle, but the second brother,
Jiga
, kills him for a greater share of the country's wealth. Meanwhile, after
Haruna
's reasons for distrust were revealed to be the result of her father allowing her to be kept hostage as a child, Haruna knocks
Hinata
 unconscious and escapes, leaving the others to die. Naruto pursues the princess, but encounters Jiga, who can manipulate magnetism.
