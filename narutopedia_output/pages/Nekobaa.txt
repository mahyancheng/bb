Background

In the anime,
Itachi Uchiha
 would usually visit Nekobaa for errands he had to run with a young
Sasuke Uchiha
 tagging along with him every time. Sasuke would get bored and throw tantrums so Itachi made a game to collect paw prints from fast and nimble cats, the
Paw Encyclopaedia
 which Nekobaa continued after Sasuke stopped collecting paw prints. Nekobaa collected one of the two last paw prints Itachi assigned, that of the
Two-Tails
 which the
jinchūriki

Yugito Nii
 agreed to give after being asked by Nekobaa.

Nekobaa tasked
Team 7
 with a mission to capture and retrieve the paw print of a certain cat for Nekobaa's encyclopaedia. Upon hearing this, Sasuke took this on as a personal mission. It was later revealed that he and Itachi had been doing this for several years when they were younger. In the end when the paw print was retrieved, Nekobaa revealed that this was a test set by Itachi as another hurdle for him to overcome.
