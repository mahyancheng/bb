Moulding chakra to create techniques.



Jutsu
 (
術
,
literally meaning:
 techniques/arts/skills) are the mystical arts that a ninja will utilise in battle. To use a jutsu, the ninja will need to use their
chakra
. To perform one, the
Shinobi
 will bring out and release the two energies of chakra. By forming
hand seals
, the ninja is able to manifest the desired technique. Because of the extensive number of hand seals and different combinations, there are thousands of potential jutsu to be discovered.

Origins

Main article:
Ninshū

Ninshū
 (
忍宗
,
Viz:
 Ninja Creed,
literally meaning:
 Shinobi Sect) is the religion and the peaceful precursor of modern
ninjutsu
 created by
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
, the first one to understand and teach the mystery of
chakra
. The teachings of ninshū were meant to give people a better understanding of themselves, as well as others, and lead the world into an era of peace. Ninshū would eventually come to be known as ninjutsu, a more weaponised version of the Sage's teachings.

The Basics

There are three basic types of techniques:
ninjutsu
,
genjutsu
 and
taijutsu
. Subcategories exist, including
fūinjutsu
,
juinjutsu
 and
senjutsu
. There are also
kekkei genkai
 abilities which aren't techniques, but inherited abilities passed down through certain clans (however, they can be used as base for certain techniques, such as
Haku
's
Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals
). Kekkei genkai can also be attributed to certain parts of the body, such as
dōjutsu
.

Without proper control of their chakra, a ninja will produce ineffective or weakened technique which will lead to them running out of chakra early in a fight. To manipulate their chakra more easily,
hand seals
 can be used. With these hand seals, users can control their chakra and technique with higher efficiency. Different techniques require different hand seals.

Ranks

Depending on the difficulty or skill necessary to perform a technique, they are ranked differently. There are six different ranks in techniques:

E-rank
 - Learned by
Academy students
. Are the basic and most fundamental techniques for all ninja.

D-rank
 -
Genin
-level techniques. Can be achieved by all genin, though many ninja only learn their "type" of technique.

C-rank
 -
Chūnin
-level techniques. Sometimes learned by genin who have trained extensively.

B-rank
 -
Jōnin
-level techniques. Require high levels of chakra to use.

A-rank
 -
Kage
 or jōnin-level techniques. Require great control over one's chakra and may be
forbidden
.

S-rank
 - Secret, extreme level techniques. Are typically unique to a single user.

Kekkei Genkai
 and
unique abilities
 normally do not have a rank.

Main Jutsu Types

Ninjutsu

Main article:
Ninjutsu

Ninjutsu
 (
忍術
,
English TV:
 Ninja Art,
literally meaning:
 Ninja Techniques) is one of the three main jutsu categories. Ninjutsu is the most nebulous of the three, and may most simply be described as anything that is not
genjutsu
 or
taijutsu
. Most ninjutsu require
chakra
 and
hand seals
, but this is not always the case since the mere usage of
weaponry
 qualifies as ninjutsu.

Genjutsu

Main article:
Genjutsu

Genjutsu
 (
幻術
,
literally meaning:
 Illusionary Techniques) is one of the main jutsu categories which uses
chakra
. Unlike
ninjutsu
, the effects of genjutsu are not real, being only sensory illusions experienced by those who fall victim to it. According to the
Second Mizukage
, genjutsu falls under the broad category of
Yin Release
.

Taijutsu

Main article:
Taijutsu

Taijutsu
 (
体術
,
literally meaning:
 Body Techniques) is a basic form of
techniques
 and refers to any techniques involving the martial arts or the optimisation of natural human abilities. Taijutsu is executed by directly accessing the user's physical and mental energies, relying on the stamina and strength gained through training. It typically does not require
chakra
, though chakra may be used to enhance its techniques. Taijutsu generally requires no
hand seals
 to perform, occasionally making use of certain stances or poses, and are far quicker to use than
ninjutsu
 or
genjutsu
. Taijutsu is, simply put, hand-to-hand combat.

Sub Jutsu Types

Barrier Ninjutsu

Main article:
Barrier Ninjutsu

Barrier ninjutsu
 (
結界忍術
,
Kekkai Ninjutsu
,
literally meaning:
 Barrier Ninja Techniques)
 are
techniques
 that impose an effect upon a defined space.

Bukijutsu

Main article:
Bukijutsu

A
ninja
's use of
weaponry
 in combat is known as "
bukijutsu
" (
武器術
,
literally meaning:
 Weapon Techniques). All ninja use a weapon at some point in their careers, but not all do so regularly.

Chakra Absorption Techniques

Main article:
Chakra Absorption Techniques

Chakra absorption techniques
 (
チャクラ吸引術
,
Chakura Kyūin Jutsu
,
English TV:
 Chakra Absorption Jutsu) allow the user to absorb the
chakra
 of another individual - usually an opponent's - and utilise it as if it were their own.

Chakra Flow

Main article:
Chakra Flow

Chakra Flow
 (
チャクラ流し
,
Chakura Nagashi
) refers to both the flowing of
chakra
 through an object as well as any technique that increases the potency of a weapon by flowing chakra through it. Ordinarily, elemental chakra is used to flow through bladed weapons in order to either, dramatically increase their various pre-existing properties, or to gain additional advantageous effects. Usually, the user must be touching the tool to initiate chakra flow but not always as with the
Fire Release: Phoenix Sage Flower Nail Crimson
 technique, and direct contact with the weapon is not necessary to maintain chakra flow. Similarly, techniques such as
Kakuzu
's
Earth Release: Earth Spear
,
Rōshi
's
Lava Release Chakra Mode
 and the
Fourth Raikage
's
Lightning Release Chakra Mode
 are used to increase close-quarter combat offence and defence by flowing chakra directly through the user's body. However, whether through an individual's body or weapon, the exact effects observed are entirely dependent upon the respective nature and amount of the chakra used.

Clone Techniques

Main article:
Clone Techniques

Clone techniques
 (
分身術
,
Bunshinjutsu
) are techniques that create copies of the user or their tools. Though the standard
Clone Technique
 is considered the most basic of
ninjutsu
, these techniques are highly versatile, often used to distract enemies or fool them into thinking they have landed a hit on the user. Corporeal clones can aid the user in physical combat, and even use techniques independent of the original. There are varying methods of creating clones, some techniques using only
chakra
 while others require some sort of medium to give the clones form and substance. There are also clone techniques that transform another person or animal into a clone of the user, such as the
Beast Human Clone
, as well as
genjutsu
 which create illusory clones, such as the
Mist Servant Technique
.

Cooperation Ninjutsu

chakra
 to be used, while the latter varies depending on the technique. Dōjutsu can be transplanted into others, though use of the dōjutsu is typically more limited or taxing for those without a genetic predisposition for it.

Trivia

Early English volumes of the
Naruto
 series occasionally referred to jutsu under the blanket terms of "spells" and "illusions".
