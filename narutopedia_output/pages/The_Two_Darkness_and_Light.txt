Summary

To make sure that
Naruto
 stays committed to the battle,
Gaara
 begins to slowly suffocate
Sakura
, explaining that she will only be released if he is defeated. He then attacks Naruto, who protects
Gamakichi
 from harm. Gaara's transformation continues to progress and Naruto realises that he might have turned out just like Gaara if he hadn't met
Iruka
 and
Team 7
. Although he wonders if he can really defeat someone driven by so much hate, Naruto attacks, knowing that under no circumstances can he allow himself to lose.
