The user turns the ground beneath their target into a deep, muddy pit that the target will slowly sink into. To prevent targets from escaping, the walls of the pit are lined with hands made out of mud that pull the target deeper. These pits can only be created on earthen surfaces, so if a target is able to find something to stand on that is not made from dirt, they are safe from this technique.
