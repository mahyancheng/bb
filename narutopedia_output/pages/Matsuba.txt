Genin Mission Arc

Matsuba stood watch with Kiri on the tower as
Team 7
 arrived at the bridge leading to their village. Using binoculars, he identified them as
Konohagakure
 shinobi and promptly informed the village leader. Despite Kiri's initial surprise at children being sent to them, Matsuba assured her of their capabilities and ordered the bridge to be lowered.

Later, during Team 7's introduction to Kiri, Matsuba stood by the village leader's side alongside
Iori
. When
Ashimaru
 attacked and chaos ensued, Matsuba joined the commotion along with everyone else. Despite the unexpected challenges, Kiri insisted on handling the situation herself, denying Matsuba's suggestion to mobilise the village.

Following Kiri's kidnapping, Matsuba, along with Konohamaru, deciphered the note left by the kidnappers. He expressed suspicion about Kiri seeking aid from Konohagakure without divulging critical information. Matsuba revealed Kiri's dedication to protecting her people, emphasising his desire for her rescue. Entrusting Konohamaru with a scroll symbolising the bridge's ownership, he stressed its significance compared to Kiri's life.

Upon Kiri's safe return, Matsuba, leading the villagers, welcomed her with open arms after hearing her apologies. Expressing joy at her return, he pledged unwavering support. Matsuba remarked on her resilience, likening it to her father's, and predicted she would surpass him as a ruler. As Team 7 departed, Matsuba and Kiri commemorated their visit by setting up a plaque in their honour.
