Summary

The two bodies that
Pain
 summons turned out to also possess the
Rinnegan
. Although confused that there are three people with the Rinnegan,
Jiraiya
 attacks, blinding one of the Rinnegan wielders. He then joins
Two Great Sage Toads
 in a joint elemental attack, but the second body absorbs it and all of their subsequent attacks. Jiraiya tries to attack the blinded body, but it has no difficulty blocking attacks that one of the other bodies can see. Noticing this,
Fukasaku
 hypothesises that they are somehow able to share vision.
