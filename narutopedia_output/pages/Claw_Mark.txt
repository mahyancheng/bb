Claw Marks (episode)
.

A unique ability to mix
chakra
 with the iron from the user's blood to create black bands that serve as portals to travel to previously marked locations.

Overview





Code travelling through a marking.



By making contact with or — from a distance — swiping towards a desired location, the user can manifest variously sized portals to any surface.
 Once applied, they are able to freely travel to any of them, regardless of distance — even if they're in a
different dimension
.
 While it only allows the user to move through them, it can take only one other person with him at a time.
 While mostly used in battle or for transportation, it can also be employed as a means of communication, putting the user' mouth or ear through them to contact
Ada
.

Although primarily chakra-based, they also contain iron from Code's blood which when mixed together causes them to become physical matter making absorption from
Kāma
 impossible.

When his limiters were active, the number of Claw Marks Code could create each time was severely limited. Once they were removed, he could create enough to cover the gigantic
Ten-Tails
, and manipulate them into pinching off pieces of the beast into
Claw Grime
.
 He can also use them as makeshift bandages to staunch bleeding.

Removal of Claw Marks may be difficult, as
Shikamaru Nara
 had to request
Kawaki
 to use
Sukunahikona
 to shrink them to unusable sizes.

Drawbacks

Claw Marks are one size fits all; if they are shrunk to a certain size, Code will not be able to move between them, being forced to create new ones.
