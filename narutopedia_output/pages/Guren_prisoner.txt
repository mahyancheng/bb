Appearance

Guren has long shaggy orange hair. When activated, the cursed seal he possesses resembles vines as it spreads across his body.

While in his second state he had two horns one sprouting from each side of his forehead and two more one coming from each side of his cheeks. He also wore a white T-shirt and a white pair of shorts. In his second state, his eyes turned black with the centre being a yellowish colour. His face is all jagged-like and around his mouth, there is a darkish colour.

He was able to enter the second state of the cursed seal, and was powerful enough to brutally massacre all the prison guards with just the first state.
 He was powerful enough to kill a man with just a single blow to the head. He could also jump down from really tall places and use appendages that grew on his arms while in second state to cushion his fall.
