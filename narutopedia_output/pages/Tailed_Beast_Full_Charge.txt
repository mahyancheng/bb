Shukaku
 punches the opponent,
Matatabi

slashes them
 with its claws,
Isobu

bulldozes
 them towards
Son Gokū
, who kicks them, allowing
Kokuō
 to
thrust
 their body towards
Saiken
 who then
sprays them with acid
, which leads to
Chōmei

knocking
 the opponent towards
Gyūki
, whose punch allows
Kurama
 to ram them into the ground.

After the sequence, the Tailed Beasts unite their tails into a single attack, pummelling their opponent.

Triva

While unnamed in the manga and anime, it was named in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
, the
Tailed Beasts
 use a similar attack, except all nine jinchūriki participate in it.

The name of this jutsu seems to be a pun on the Godzilla film "
Destroy All Monsters
" (
怪獣総進撃
,
Kaijū Sōshingeki
).
