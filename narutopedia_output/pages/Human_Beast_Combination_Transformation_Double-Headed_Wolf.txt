This technique is a specialty of the
Inuzuka clan
. The Inuzuka and their
ninken
 companion perform the
Combination Transformation
 to take the shared form of a two-headed wolf. Because of the transformation's size, its strong claws, and its two sets of fangs, its standard attacks are quite powerful. This is especially true of any other
jutsu
 performed while using this form, which are far more destructive than what the Inuzuka or the ninken are ordinarily capable of. These attacks and jutsu are most often performed against targets that have been cornered, fitting their wolf form.
