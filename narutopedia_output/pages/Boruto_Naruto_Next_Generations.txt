Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 (
BORUTO -ボルト- -NARUTO NEXT GENERATIONS-
,
Boruto: Naruto Nekusuto Jenerēshonzu
) was a monthly
manga
 spin-off series within the
Naruto
 franchise.
 The first 51 chapters of the series were written by
Ukyō Kodachi
, with the author of
Naruto
,
Masashi Kishimoto
, acting as supervisor. Beginning with
chapter 52
 - released in November 2020 - Kodachi left the series while
Mikio Ikemoto
 took over writing duties, following Kishimoto's drafts. Ikemoto also illustrated the manga throughout its run. The series adapts the story-line of
Boruto: Naruto the Movie
 and then continues the story afterward. The manga launched on May 9, 2016, in the 23rd issue of
Weekly Shōnen Jump
, and is simultaneously published in
Weekly Shōnen Jump
 digital magazine in English. The serialisation of the manga was transferred to
V Jump
 in July 2019.

Manga

Kodachi compares the story of
Boruto
 to the
Cold War
, where a world at peace is threatened by a resumption of its prior chaos.
 Ikemoto's illustrations for the series are much more realistic than what was used in
Naruto
, and in fact he is regularly reminded by Kishimoto to make characters' mouths and eyes bigger in order to better align the two series. Ikemoto hopes to conclude the story of
Boruto
 within 30 volumes.
 Until his institution as the sole writer of the series, Kishimoto, though he had no direct role in the manga's creation, nevertheless oversaw each chapter as it was being worked on. When asked if he was worried that new characters in
Boruto
 would come off as clones of their parents, Kishimoto admitted it was a concern. He labelled
Shikadai
 as essentially a clone of his
father
, while
Chōchō
 is more a combination of her parents; he believes that both characters serve archetypal roles that are common to manga series.
 On June 1, 2023, it was announced the first part of the manga had concluded with Volume 20.
 In
V Jump
 #8, Part II of the manga was announced, titled
Boruto: Two Blue Vortex
, to begin publishing in
 V Jump
 #10.

There are six story arcs in Part I of the manga:

Versus Momoshiki Arc

Mujina Bandits Arc

Ao Arc

Kawaki Arc

Code's Assault Arc

Similar to
Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles
, there was also an "
SD
" version of the
Boruto
 manga, titled
Boruto: Saikyo Dash Generations
.
