Shōseki
 (
ショウセキ
) is a citizen of
Konohagakure
 and the apprentice of weapon maker
Iō
.

Personality

He is an apprentice of Iō, and is helping him in his weapon-making job. He often complains about hard work. One time he mistakenly sold
Gameru
 and
Kusune
 two
ninja
 weapons Iō created:
Tsurukame
 and
Dakō
, in order to increase their budget.

Appearance

Shōseki is a bespectacled boy with dull, black hair, small dark eyes and a rather broad face. He dons a red, high-collared jacket over a blue kimono shirt along with a simple, brown sash around his waist, brown pants and sandals. He wears a pair of black gloves along with bandages on his arms and legs.

Abilities

Though not much was seen of his abilities, he is seemingly proficient with
basic fūinjutsu
.

Part II

Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha

In his début, he was seen on fire, before
Tenten
 pushed him out of the way, wanting to hear more about the weapons that Iō made. He later brought out Iō's latest invention to show the Konoha shinobi but was interrupted by intruders. After seeing their weapons that Gameru and Kusune were wielding, Shōseki apologised emphatically to Iō explaining that due to the funding that they received from the Leaf Village wasn't enough to maintain their research, he sold the weapons to the men, believing them to be simple prototypes. Later after Tenten had defeated the men with the
Jidanda
, Shōseki took the weapon from her and resealed it much to the kunoichi's dismay.

Trivia

Shōseki's name is probably derived from
saltpetre
 (
硝石
,
shōseki
), an important ingredient in
gunpowder
.
