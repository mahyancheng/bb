Sakura proceeds to throw four small white bags at them filled with
exploding tags
, which are disguised as cherry blossom petals in the opponent's eyes. She shatters them by throwing kunai at them and the exploding tags begin to fall gently towards the target. Lastly, Sakura aims a kunai with a final exploding tag attached to it at her opponent's feet and it detonates, followed by the explosion of the other falling "tags". There is a huge blast and the opponent is either killed or severely damaged.
