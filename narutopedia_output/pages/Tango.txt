Tango
 (
タンゴ
) is a
Kumogakure

shinobi
.

Appearance

Tango has somewhat slanted eyes and a fairly flat nose along with dull-black hair concealed underneath his
forehead protector
 which he wears like a bandanna. He wears the standard outfit of the Kumogakure shinobi inclusive of the one-strap-over
flak jacket
.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, he was assigned to the
Surprise Attack Division
. After his division mobilises and finds a good location,
Kankurō
 instructs Tango to set up a
chakra transmission antennae
 for communication purposes with the
Intelligence Division
.






Tango and his division faces the Surprise Attack and Diversion Platoon.



He along with the rest of his division then move on the offensive when Akatsuki's
Surprise Attack and Diversion Platoon
 attacked them. After
Omoi
 uses his
Cloud-Style Reverse Beheading
 to free
Tokuma
 and
Ranka
 who were being
controlled
, he caught Ranka. After leaving Ranka in
Ittan
's
fort
, he and
Hoheto
 stayed in the rear to protect
Kiri
 while he healed the wounded.

Later, he and the part of his division encountered a back up for the
Surprise Attack and Diversion Platoon
. When they tried to flee from it, they are hit with
Ibuse
's
Poison Mist
 and succumb to its paralysing effects. They are, however, rescued by the samurai of the
Fifth Division
 who carry them to the medical unit for treatment.

Trivia

Tango's name might be a pun on the
spelling alphabet
 for the letter 'T' due to the word 'Tango' being used by those that transmit and receive messages via audio and his role as the communications personnel on his team. This also fits with his village's convention of naming shinobi after letters of the alphabet.

In the
fourth databook
, he's mistakenly listed as a
Konoha
 ninja.
