Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As the
Allied Shinobi Forces
' headquarters scramble to deal with
White Zetsu Army
 clones
infiltration
 issue, word reaches the
Fifth Division
 of the development and
Mifune
 instructs his division accordingly.
Kurotsuchi
 travels to the Fifth Division to speak to
Deidara
 and interrupts him being freed by a disguised White Zetsu clone. As their conversation goes nowhere, she requests that
Kankurō
 opens
Kuroari
 so she could speak to Deidara directly. Before this could be done, however,
Okisuke
 arrives and interrogates the samurai on guard who responds incorrectly and is cut down mercilessly. Deidara, however, is able to use a
sword
 as a makeshift
ground rod
 to channel the
electricity
 from his body and escape.

As he and several White Zetsu flee, Deidara notes that he needed to get his hands on some
Explosive Clay
. As they escape White Zetsu clones continue to dwindle until
Kabuto Yakushi
 sends
Chūkichi
 to aid them. Finally reaching a small amount of clay Deidara is able to fight and later
self-destruct
 using the sword once again as a ground rod when a
Konoha
-nin from the
Communications Team
 tries to incapacitate him with lightning. Shocked to see himself reforming, once the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 is explained to him Deidara concludes that his art and the technique were incompatible since his art was supposed to be for a solitary moment and not immortal like
Sasori
. Eventually, Deidara is recaptured within Kuroari after falling prey to Kurotsuchi's
Sasuke Uchiha

transformation
, Mifune's clever use of a battery to imitate the effects of Lightning Release and being lured to an area where he could not use the sword to siphon off the charge. While trapped inside the Kuroari once again, Deidara states that he has found his super ultimate art and looks up at the moon.

Trivia

Okisuke noted that the correct response to his statement "mountain" was "river". This may be an allusion to either the show "'
The Burning Mountain River
", which famous samurai and Mifune's namesake
Toshiro Mifune
 appeared, or to the Japanese saying which roughly translates to, "
the country is in ruins, and there are still mountains and rivers
".
