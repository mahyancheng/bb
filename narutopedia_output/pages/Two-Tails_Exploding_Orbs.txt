Matatabi creates large orbs of flame-like
chakra
, similar to the flame covering its body. It then manipulates these orbs in order to chase the enemy before they explode. Enemies hit by the explosions of one of these orbs will have their offensive capabilities lowered for a time. This has only been shown used by a
false Two-Tails
.
