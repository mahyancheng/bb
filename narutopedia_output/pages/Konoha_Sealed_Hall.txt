The Konoha Sealed Hall.



The
Konoha Sealed Hall
 is a location appearing in the
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3
 and was stated to have been around since the creation of the village.

Located on the outskirts of
Konohagakure
, the Sealed Hall is built into a cave and has a torii gate at the front. As its name suggests, is protected by a powerful seal which only a
master of fūinjutsu
 can unseal. It is used to store up powerful
kinjutsu
, including the
Demon Shinki
. The members of the
Anbu
 from Konoha apparently also go here to conduct experiments.
Shinga
 would later return there to retrieve the Demon Shinki and infuse it into himself in
Tsukigakure
.
