The
black salamander
 (
黒山椒魚
,
Kuro Sanshōuo
) was a creature native to
Amegakure
 that was famous for the deadly
poison
 its body produced. After its death,
Hanzō
 during his childhood, had its venom sac implanted into his body, thus granting him the ability to create the same poison, as well as allowing him to develop a resistance to this particular poison. Due to the consequence that even by breathing he would release the toxin, Hanzō quickly became feared as
Hanzō of the Salamander
 (
山椒魚の半蔵
,
Sanshōuo no Hanzō
).

Trivia

In the anime, the salamander was depicted as being brown instead of black.

Though the Black Salamander, like
Ibuse
, could be based on the
Japanese giant salamander
, there is also a species known as the
Japanese black salamander
. Salamanders such as these were sometimes thought to have medicinal powers.
