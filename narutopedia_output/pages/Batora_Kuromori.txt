He is also quite a responsible person who followed the movement of people in the kitchen, remembering every moment. His desire to protect and help Kae stems from a deep sense of gratitude to her father for giving him a new life in the Land of Bamboo.

friend
 and seeing how hard she works on her goals.

Kawaki & Himawari Academy Arc






Batora knocked out by Kawaki.



Batora was sent to Konohagakure to serve Kae while she enrolled in the village's
Academy
. After spending a few days at the Academy, Batora asked if she was satisfied, to which she responded that she was and that she made a new friend. When Kae invited her class-mates for a tea party, Batora oversaw the preparation of the sweets and desserts, though Kae insisted on making the cake herself. During a commotion,
Kawaki
 rushed towards Kae and fell on Batora, briefly knocking him unconscious. After recovering, he showed Kawaki and
Himawari
 around the kitchen, explaining where the cake had been stored. After the party, he supervised the cleaning staff.






Batora helps Kae and Kawaki in a student prank.



Days later, when a group of students decided to investigate the Academy's Seven Mysteries, Kae joined them and had Batora fake them with Kawaki's help. When one of the mysteries was seemingly real, they chased a shrouded figure, and eventually discovered they were Shino's insects cleaning the Academy.

When Himawari didn't show up for a shopping trip with Kae, Batora accompanied Kae as she looked for Himawari. Checking with Kawaki, they found her pendant on the street, and followed up looking for
Osuka
, Batora knowing where her residence was. They discovered Osuka had been kidnapped for ransom, and deduced that Himawari had also been kidnapped. They visited
Neon
 for more information, who told them more of Osuka's home life, before using a new sensing function of her drone to find them. Batora and Kae took care of Himawari and Osuka as Kawaki defeated the
kidnapper's leader
. After their arrest,
Hibari
 arrived and reconciled with her daughter, after which Osuka apologised for her attitude, and Hibari invited everyone for pudding.






Batora reveals his investigation on the assassination plot.



On the day of the school festival, Batora claimed he was unable to attend due to other unavoidable matters, though he was actually investigating a person of interest in the plot to assassinate Kae, having lost track of them at the festival. He appeared in the background of one of
Sōsha
's photos. He later informed Kae that her father wanted her back home, and assured her that despite being on a mission, Kawaki certainly considered her a friend, pointing out his refraining to report the possibility of an assassin so she could enjoy the festival instead of having it cancelled. When the assassin attacked Kae at her home, Batora was injured in his arm protecting her. Himawari looked after them while Kawaki chased the assassin, who committed
suicide
 to hide their identity. With the intel Batora gathered, the Land of Bamboo authorities discovered the plot's mastermind was their
minister
 and arrested him.

When
Hana Kaka
 was discovered to have a Land of Bamboo background, it uncovered the rest of the plot against Kae. Batora joined
Sai
 in going to the island where her class was, and reunited with Kae after Hana was defeated, and her teacher personality reasserting control. Because Kae had to return as her father had taken ill, the class decided to put on their Sannin play, with Batora in attendance. He later joined Kae on the train back home.
