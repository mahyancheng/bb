Hayate Gekkō
 (
月光 ハヤテ
,
Gekkō Hayate
) was a
tokubetsu jōnin
 of
Konohagakure
.

Background






Hayate's team competing in the Chūnin Exams.



As a
genin
, he was placed in a team with
Ibiki Morino
 and
Tokara
. During the
Chūnin Exams
, Hayate and his team confronted
Team Orochimaru
.

In the anime, at some point, Hayate was chosen to be
Yūgao Uzuki
's instructor in kenjutsu; the time the two spent training together eventually led to them falling in love with each other.

Personality

Hayate seemed to be a calm and composed individual. He was also described as being an
individualist
, and gentle person.
 He also had a great sense of duty to his village, as he risked his life to spy on
Kabuto Yakushi
 and
Baki
.

Hayate seemed to be well known and respected by his fellow Konoha ninja as many of them, including
Kakashi Hatake
, were saddened after learning of his death. He cared deeply about his girlfriend Yūgao, displaying a light teasing mood when alone with her, and showed concern for her well-being, asking her to be careful on missions after her promotion to
Anbu
 due to their increased difficulty.

Appearance

Hayate had short brown hair, dark-coloured eyes and dark markings under his eyes. Even though he was a young man, he had pronounced lines under his eyes as well as an unexplained chronic cough that plagued him. He wore the standard Konoha shinobi outfit complete with a
forehead protector
 that he wore as a bandanna,
flak jacket
 and regular shinobi sandals. He also carried a katana with a rectangular hand guard strapped over his back. When reincarnated, other than facial cracks, the only change in Hayate's appearance is the grey sclerae common in all the other ninja Kabuto brought back.

As a genin, he wore a simple outfit with a long-sleeved, red-coloured haori,
 and ¾ length pants with bangles around his wrist and legs. He carried his
sword
 tied to two strings on his hip. He also had dark markings under his eyes which makes it unclear whether or not he was ill since his youth or not.

Abilities

As a tokubetsu jōnin, Hayate was a very skilled shinobi, further emphasised in the anime where he was chosen to be
reincarnated
 by Kabuto Yakushi in the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. Baki, a skilled and experienced shinobi from Sunagakure, commented that the village had many talented ninja after seeing Hayate's skill at such a young age.

Kenjutsu






Hayate attacks Baki with the Dance of the Crescent Moon.



Hayate's signature skill was in
kenjutsu
. He could use the
Dance of the Crescent Moon
, a technique involving him and two
shadow clones
 simultaneously attacking an opponent with their swords at such high speeds, that they create afterimages, making it difficult to avoid. In the anime, he could even perform the Dance of the Crescent Moon with just kunai, and still be just as lethal.
 During his fight against Baki, Hayate proved to have possessed keen reflexes, as he was able to draw a kunai just in time to block an attack despite being inches away from his opponent and, on several occasions, was fast enough to use his sword to deflect kunai thrown at him, while he was in mid-air. Hayate also displayed great physical strength and precision in his sword attacks, slicing through and shattering several boulders with only a single strike.
 In the anime, he could also perform other techniques that required great speed to confuse the enemy, such as the
Secret Sword: Moonlight
.

Other Skills






Hayate using the Transparent Escape Technique.



Notably, Hayate also had excellent tracking and stealth skills, having remained undetected for a considerable period of time while spying on Kabuto. The anime showed that Hayate was adept at using the
Transparent Escape Technique
, which gave him personal praise from the Third Hokage, who later assigned him as the only suitable candidate to undertake the dangerous mission of spying on Orochimaru's right-hand man. Hayate also had talent in
ninjutsu
 and
genjutsu
.

In the anime, Hayate also showed proficiency with
taijutsu
, able to hold his own during his confrontation with a weakened
Naruto Uzumaki
, and could kick him away with such force that the wall Naruto smashed against received massive cracks.
 He also had a keen sense of smell, being able to smell the blood of thousands of people even though he was far away from the battlefields. He showed himself to be very nimble, able to effectively manoeuvre through a barrage of rock projectiles while still moving in for an attack. Hayate also proved to be quick thinking and a cunning strategist, as shown in his fight with Baki, where he used Baki's own spit powder as a substitute, confusing Baki, before delivering a kick to the Suna-nin's face. Hayate also had a very strong will and mentality, as when he was reincarnated, he was able to resist Kabuto's commands in a few instances, even when his personality was erased, a feat very few that were reincarnated had managed to do.

Chūnin Exams

Chūnin Exams






Hayate addressing the genin.



At first sight, Hayate appeared to be not in the best of health, as he had an unexplained chronic cough and eye bags. He, however, is scheduled to be the proctor during the final rounds of the Chūnin Exams, and as such, oversees the preliminary matches that will decide who advances to the final round. During the battle between
Neji
 and
Hinata Hyūga
 after an enraged Neji prepared to attack Hinata with the intent of killing her, Hayate along with the other jōnin present stopped him from doing so. After the preliminaries were completed, the participants were given a chance to train and recuperate. In the anime, learning of the deaths of several Anbu who had been assigned to guard
Sasuke Uchiha
, Hayate worried about Yūgao who was in that unit, rushing to the village hospital. After a brief conversation with Yūgao, in which the two lovers promised on the moon to be there to protect each other no matter what, he was assigned by the Third Hokage to investigate
Kabuto Yakushi
, who had been revealed as Orochimaru's spy after a confrontation with Kakashi, tracking his target to
Kikyō Castle
.






Hayate fighting Baki.



Hayate learned of
Sunagakure
 and
Otogakure
's plans to invade Konoha after overhearing the conversation between
Baki
 and Kabuto. Before he could escape to tell the
Third Hokage
 what he had learned, he was sensed by the two and chased down. After a short battle with Baki, Hayate used his
Dance of the Crescent Moon
 technique on him. However, the swing of his blade was too shallow and got stuck in his
flak jacket
. As Baki praised him for his skill and effort, he used his
Blade of Wind
 technique to kill Hayate. His body was found the next day by a squad of Anbu, including Yūgao, who had been sent to investigate the sounds of a disturbance in the area.
Genma Shiranui
 subsequently replaced Hayate as proctor for the Chūnin Exam finals. In the anime, the fight between Hayate and Baki was expanded upon, revealing Baki actually needing to use his bare hand to stop Hayate's strike. It is shown that Hayate was hit multiple times by wind discs and that Kabuto took away his DNA, removing his corpse's odour in the process.

Power (Arc)






Hayate forced to attack his comrades.



In the anime, after the
Five Kage Summit
, Hayate's grave was defiled by Kabuto, and he was later
reincarnated
 for the massacre in
Tonika Village
. Hayate confronted and almost killed
Dokku
 until his movements stopped during the finishing strike.
 He was summoned again to battle
Team Kakashi
, who were investigating the massacre that Kabuto brought about to gain access to
The Hole
.
 Hayate confronted
Sakura Haruno
 and was punched a ways away by the kunoichi while she apologised for attacking her fellow Konoha comrade. This, however, proved futile as Hayate began to reconstruct from the attack.
 Hayate was returned to his coffin as Kabuto and his other reincarnated shinobi retreated.






Hayate attacks Naruto.



The next day, he was again forced to fight against his former comrades and took on a dramatically weakened Naruto, attacking him with taijutsu and defeating him with the
Dance of the Crescent Moon
.
 Hayate was summoned to battle once more when the
Ama no Hoko
 was activated. He, along with Kabuto's other reincarnated shinobi, were planted with
explosive clay
 by Deidara and used as suicide bombers. Rather than reforming upon exploding as those reincarnated by Kabuto typically would, Hayate and the others instead turned to dust, with the bodies of the sacrifices used to reincarnate them falling out.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Main article:
Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

In the anime, Hayate was reincarnated by Kabuto to assist him in finding corpses of elite shinobi to be used as tools against the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. When he is reincarnated, Hayate immediately recognises Kabuto, and asks him what happened leading up to and after his death. Kabuto takes a moment to explain the failed
invasion
 and the effects of his death. After explaining this to Hayate, he reincarnated a
Sunagakure
 shinobi and a
Kumogakure
 shinobi to go take the KIA scroll from the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
. While attacking the Medical Camp, he spotted his lover Yūgao.






Hayate forced to fight Yūgao.



After escaping with the scroll, Hayate and the other reincarnated shinobi were pursued by a small group, including Yūgao. After swiftly being tracked down by the assembled pursuit team, they engaged in battle. While the other two reincarnated shinobi were quickly sealed away, Hayate easily defeated two of the Konoha ninja,
Iō
 and
Yokaze
. Despite his plea for her to stop him, Yūgao found herself unable to fight Hayate. He subsequently fled to deliver the scroll to Kabuto. He was soon tracked down by Sakura Haruno, whom he quickly recognised from her participation in the Chūnin Exams, after noting that she has become a fine shinobi, he effortlessly overwhelmed her in a brief struggle, however she was saved by Yūgao who had mustered the courage to face Hayate after remembering their promise. After a clash between their Dance of the Crescent Moon techniques, Hayate congratulated Yūgao on her improved skills and admitted that he was happy he could see her again. Kabuto then began taking full control of him. Feeling his consciousness slipping away, Hayate quickly charged at Yūgao, giving her the opportunity to subdue him. As the reinforcements arrive, Hayate bade Yūgao farewell before being sealed away.
