"
Formation! The Sasuke Recovery Team
" (
結成!鉄壁のフォーメーション
,
Kessei! Teppeki Fōmēshon
) is episode 110 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

When
Sakura
 wakes up,
Izumo
 and
Kotetsu
 find her lying on the bench. She tells them about
Sasuke
's defection, and the two inform
Tsunade
. Tsunade orders them to summon
Shikamaru
, a newly promoted
Chūnin
. Unable to send higher ranking ninja after Sasuke, Tsunade orders Shikamaru to assemble
a team of genin
 under his lead to go after Sasuke. He first recruits
Naruto
 (under the recommendation of Tsunade), and then later
Chōji
 and
Kiba
. After rounding them up, he invites
Neji Hyūga
 and
Rock Lee
 who they find talking together. Neji joins, while Rock Lee chooses to stay behind to recover from the surgery. After rounding up all the genin he could find, Shikamaru quickly devises the optimal formation for the group. Before they leave, Sakura interrupts and pleads Naruto to make sure to bring Sasuke back. Naruto promises to do so, and the group sets out. Meanwhile, after well passing the
Konoha
 borders,
Sakon
 along with the rest of the
Sound Four
 tells Sasuke of an important task that
Orochimaru
 had given them: "Sasuke must die just this once".

Errors

There is a single frame where Rock Lee is missing as the group is shown standing at Konoha's gates.
