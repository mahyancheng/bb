Shukaku
 pounds on its stomach with its arm, producing a loud sound. The external pressure from the pound forces a ball of
wind
 from Shukaku's large mouth, firing it like a bullet. The wind, highly compressed and imbued with
chakra
, travels in a straight line. It moves quickly across the landscape, tearing up trees and hollowing out the ground. When it finally impacts with its target, it explodes,
 dealing enough damage that even
Gamabunta
 couldn't withstand more than a few. By hitting its stomach rapidly, Shukaku can produce multiple Air Bullets in order to overwhelm opponents.
