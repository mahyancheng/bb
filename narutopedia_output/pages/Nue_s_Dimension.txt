Nue's Dimension.



This dimension is an alternate space where
Nue
 resides, which
Tanuki Shigaraki
 and
Sumire Kakei
 referred to as the underworld (
異界
,
ikai
). The
Gozu Tennō
, a
fūinjutsu
, acts as a gateway to this dimension as well as a medium through which
chakra
 can be fed to Nue.
Boruto
 was also able to move in and out of the dimension by subconsciously activating his
Jōgan
. After the Gozu Tennō was destroyed the space began to collapse upon itself, but Sumire was able to retain a small portion of the seal.

Appearance

This place is similar to an underground cave. There are several swamps with trees similar to mangroves. These are connected to each other through a network of lianas and ropes. Nue's den is inside a large, hollow trunk bound with a
shimenawa
.
