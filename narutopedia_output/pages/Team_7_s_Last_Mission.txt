Team 7's Last Mission?!
" (
第七班、最後の任務!?
,
Dainanahan, Saigo no Ninmu!?
) is episode 227 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Three days before the
chūnin
 promotion ceremony,
Sarada
 examines her new
flak jacket
, and
Sakura
 comments on how her team dynamics will change now that she's captain and
Konohamaru
 doesn't have to look after them. She gives
Boruto
 and
Mitsuki
 forms to fill, and they discuss how the team is likely to change. Sarada is bothered that Konohamaru won't be part of their team anymore, and they decide to see how he is, wishing to celebrate Sarada's promotion. Coming across
Sai
 and
Shikamaru
, they discover Konohamaru is on a guard mission with
Mirai
, escorting a married couple checking on their future home. They're disappointed to learn he won't be back until after Sarada's appointment to team captain. At home,
Sasuke
 and Sakura notice how dejected Sarada is over not having Konohamaru as captain any more. Sasuke comforts her, and advises her how to approach it. Mirai makes her way back to
Konoha
 battered and poisoned. Sakura treats her, and Sai informs
Team 7
 that she came back alone. Konohamaru is beat up by one of the assailants who captured him and the married couple he was guarding.
 He recognises their leader as
Hyōgo
‎, an infamous
Kusagakure

missing-nin
. Hyōgo‎ explains he has remained hidden by taking control of the mountain village they're in, finding it better to drive outsiders away than simply hiding. He intends to torture Konohamaru for information. Mirai wakes up and informs Konoha of the situation. Sai and Shikamaru discuss it with
Naruto
, and find it strange that Mirai and Konohamaru couldn't handle the situation by themselves. They decide to send reinforcements, and Naruto agrees to Team 7's request to go, as their history with Konohamaru should make it easier to coordinate. They hope the mission gives Team 7 closure. Team 7 arrive at the village, and scouting the enemies, wonder why Konohamaru hasn't defeated them. Boruto notices that the villagers seem to be cooperating with the bandits, and Mitsuki wonders if they're all hostages. Konohamaru is questioned about Konoha's
sensing system
, but divulges nothing. Hyōgo‎ changes his approach, and instead of torturing Konohamaru, he tells his men to torture the couple he was guarding. Despite finding it premature, he decides to act, but Boruto arrives
transformed as a woman
, claiming to be a lost traveller. Hyōgo‎ doubts it, as the village is away from everything, so no one arrives there on their way to somewhere else. A thick fog rolls in, and Team 7 begins taking out Hyōgo‎'s subordinates. Konohamaru frees himself, and Team 7 informs him they've done all he planned to do using the fog as cover, including freeing the many hostages. Hyōgo‎ tries using the fog to cover his escape, but Mitsuki's snake informs him of his direction, so Boruto and Sarada
throw
 Konohamaru, who lands a
Rasengan
 on him. He gets emotional over their last mission together, and they help repair the village before returning to Konoha. Naruto officially appoints the new chūnin as team captains. Team 7 takes a team photo.

Trivia

Shobu and Yomogi, the couple Konohamaru and Mirai were assigned to guard, are not credited, despite having short speaking roles.
