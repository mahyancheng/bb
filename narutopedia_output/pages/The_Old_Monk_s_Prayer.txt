"
The Old Monk's Prayer
" (
老僧の祈り
,
Rōsō no Inori
) is episode 75 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Asuma
's team arrives at the
Fire Temple
, where they are told by
Bansai
, an old monk that
Chiriku
's remains were not to be found.
Izumo
 reminds Asuma that Chiriku had a bounty of 30 million ryo on his head and that the
Akatsuki
 are most likely on their way to collect. Asuma and his team head to the closest
Land of Fire Bounty Station
 while Izumo sends word to the other teams to check out the other four bounty stations. Before they leave, however, they receive a prayer from Bansai.

Hidan
 and
Kakuzu
 head to the bounty station where the two almost get into a fight. Hidan attempts to discard the body and continue looking for
jinchūriki
, and Kakuzu warns Hidan that one day he may kill him as he finds him extremely annoying.

Sakura
 arrives with a fresh basket of food pills to the waterfall, only to see no one there.
Sai
 arrives there as well, and the two believe that Naruto must have pushed his limits before he could succeed in his training. Sakura offers Sai a food pill; the taste of the food pill causes Sai to drop the pill and run away, before catching his breath by a tree and claiming that he feels sick.

Kakashi
 and
Yamato
 head to
Ramen Ichiraku
, only to find out that
Ayame
 has converted the store into a dipping noodle shop. After having a little argument with them and converting three bowls of dipping noodle soup into ramen, Kakashi tells Naruto he has something to show him. Returning to their training area by the waterfall, Kakashi shows Naruto his
Rasengan
, and the latter is surprised that Kakashi knows the technique as well, as it was believed that other than Naruto, only
Jiraiya
 and the
Fourth Hokage
 could use it.
