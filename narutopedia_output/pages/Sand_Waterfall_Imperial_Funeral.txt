After a target has been engulfed by
Quicksand Waterfall Flow
, Gaara slams his hands onto the
sand
 and activates this technique.
 As with the regular
Sand Waterfall Funeral
, the sand compresses upon and grinds down the target, though on a far greater scale than the regular version. The large volume of sand used in the Quicksand Waterfall Flow is flattened out and the target is repeatedly squeezed, preventing them from moving and ultimately crushing them to death.
Kimimaro
 is able to survive this technique only because of
fortification to his bones
.

Trivia

"Sand waterfall" (
砂瀑
,
sabaku
) is pronounced the same as the Japanese word for "desert" (
砂漠
), a pun commonly used for Gaara and his jutsu.
