Todoroki
 (
トドロキ
) was the captain of the guards on the ship that was transporting
Gantetsu
.

Background

Years before
Naruto Uzumaki
,
Sakura Haruno
 and
Rock Lee
 had accepted the mission, the
Shinobazu
 had attacked his home, resulting in the deaths of his parents. Todoroki had seen Gantetsu with his hand over his brother
Akio
's mouth before flaming debris had fallen into the room the two were in. Believing his brother to be dead, Todoroki had trained hard to prepare for the opportunity to avenge him.

Personality

Todoroki was shown to be a very serious and cold person and is determined to kill Gantetsu. He is also shown to have a fear of fire as he is shown trembling when he sees fires but later on he overcame it. He also has a strong sense of justice.

Abilities

Although not being a
shinobi
, he is very skilled in
kenjutsu
, able to slice through dozens of straw men in mere seconds, fast enough to hit the last one before the first falls apart. He also had training to become a guard hinting at many other skills.

Part I

Gantetsu Escort Mission

Naruto found Todoroki below decks threatening to kill Gantetsu. Suddenly, one of the Shinobazu ninja used a metallic wire technique to slice the ship in half, separating Naruto from everyone besides Gantetsu and Todoroki. Todoroki consistently refused to trust Gantetsu, and eventually tried to kill Naruto and Gantetsu to gain his vengeance and to escape blameless. Upon learning of his brother being alive, Todoroki reluctantly agreed to let Gantetsu help them. Todoroki was reunited with his brother and told Gantetsu that, while he could never forgive him, he would allow him to remain with his orphans.
