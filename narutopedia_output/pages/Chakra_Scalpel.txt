This
medical technique
 forms one's
chakra
 into a small, sharp blade. This can then be used for highly accurate incisions necessary for surgeries and anatomical dissections.
 Unlike regular scalpels, the chakra scalpel can make cuts inside the body without actually creating an open wound, limiting the risks of an infection.

The chakra scalpel can also be used offensively to inflict internal damage, although it requires great precision to be effective. Because of this requirement, using the chakra scalpel offensively is highly unusual. In heated combat, even the greatest
medical-nin
 won't be able to exert the precision needed to target the vital spots, but it can still effectively cut muscle tissues and tendons, rendering the target immobile.

Kabuto has displayed enough skill with the technique to be able to deliver fatal cuts that can target vital spots, even cutting through wood and flesh with ease. He could also sever the
chakra pathway system
, which prevented a jinchūriki from receiving chakra from their tailed-beast. When enhanced with
natural energy
, he can even use it to sever a person’s body in half.

Trivia

Although it is usually written in
katakana
, the "mesu" (
メス
,
scalpel
) part of the name was given kanji when it was first introduced. It was written as チャクラ解剖刀 (
literally meaning:
 Chakra Dissection Blade), which would usually be pronounced as "Chakura Kaibōtō". "Mesu" is derived from the word "Mes", which is scalpel in Dutch.

Shizune uses this technique as a major portion of her fighting style in the
Ultimate Ninja
 game series
.
