Daikokuten
 is a technique of the
Kokugan
.

Overview






Kawaki transporting targets to the dimension through a rift.



Through its use, anything the user has previously shrunk using
Sukunahikona
 can be stored within a dimension where time does not flow.

Kawaki
’s usage has shown to be able to store living people inside this dimension as well, though unlike inanimate objects, when transporting a person into the dimension he is shown using an inescapable rift similar to
another jutsu
 of his.
 Anything stored there will remain in pristine condition and can instantaneously be retrieved at will.

The objects retrieved are manifested with such speed that they can catch attentive opponents, such as
Sharingan
-wielding
Sasuke Uchiha
,
 and
Six Paths Sage Mode
-empowered
Naruto Uzumaki
 off guard while inflicting serious bodily harm on them.

Trivia

This technique appears to be inspired by the
Uchide no Kozuchi
, a hammer obtained by the hero
Issun-bōshi
, and can manifest anything the wielder desires by striking it against something.

Daikokuten
 is the name of one of the
Seven Lucky Gods
 of Buddhism, the great god of darkness/blackness, and is depicted wielding the Uchide no Kozuchi.

While inhabiting
Jigen
's body, this technique normally required hand gestures in order to summon the foreign matter back.

When using this technique, Isshiki's right eye's pattern changes, with a pupil appearing within the eight intersecting spokes.
