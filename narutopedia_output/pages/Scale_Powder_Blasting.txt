Using Chōmei's wings,
Fū
 strikes her opponent and flies into the air while releasing scales, then fully transforms into
Chōmei
 and delivers a drill-like attack on her opponent. Just before impact, Fū snaps Chōmei's mouthparts, creating a spark which ignites the scale-filled tornado her rotation created, resulting in a massive explosion.
