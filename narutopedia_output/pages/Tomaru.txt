New Era

Chōchō Arc

Main article:
Chōchō Arc

When he and his costar Ashina received death threats about their production, Teams
7
 and
10
 were assigned to protect them. During the mission, Chōchō was always in a slimmed down form thanks to her jutsu. When one of the actresses got injured in an attack, Tomaru requested Chōchō to replace her, deepening her infatuation with him.

When Chōchō's focus on her jutsu broke during an altercation with her team-mates, Tomaru didn't recognise her and was rude to her about her chubby physique. Later, Tomaru was kidnapped, with the perpetrator asking Ashina to deliver the ransom. When Ashina was exposed as the mastermind behind the threats and kidnapping, she accidentally caused a rock slide, rendering Tomaru falling down and hurting his back. Chōchō ended up revealing herself to be the slim girl Tomaru liked while protecting him from the rocks. Tomaru became infatuated with Chōchō instead for saving him, but she told him he'll have rivals for her.
