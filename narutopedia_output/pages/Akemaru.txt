Akemaru and Akamaru accompany
Kiba Inuzuka
 to their local toy store, where Kiba plans to buy a
Kurama
 doll for
Tamaki
. There, they run into
Naruto Uzumaki
 and his daughter,
Himawari
. Because the Kurama doll is in limited supply, neither Kiba nor Naruto are able to find one at this toy store. Himawari cries with disappointment, and Akemaru and Akamaru try to cheer her up. Kiba offers to help Naruto find a doll for Himawari, so he, Akemaru, and Akamaru spend the day searching the village. They find one, but it ends up being stolen while Akemaru and Akamaru transport it to Himawari. The thief - a father who only wants to give his son a Kurama doll - is eventually caught, but Himawari takes pity on him and lets him keep the doll. Since Himawari doesn't want it, Kiba tries to intervene and take the doll for himself, but Akemaru and Akamaru bite at his hand to stop him.
