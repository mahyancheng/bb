The user manipulates water and transforms it into a giant wolf-like beast. The beast can launch powerful streams of water from its mouth, or sweep the area with its claws to let a powerful torrent of water to wash the enemies away.

When Kakashi used this technique against
Shabadaba
's guards at his palace, he manipulated the water at the fountain, which was yellow. He managed to keep the water beast active for a long time, and combined it with his
Sharingan
 to keep track of his enemies, which tired him out at the end.
