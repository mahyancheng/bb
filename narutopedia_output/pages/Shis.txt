Shisō
 (
シソウ
) is a
Hoshigakure

shinobi
 who worked under
Akahoshi
.

Background






Akahoshi and his two followers murder the Third Hoshikage.



After the
Third Hoshikage
 cancelled the star training because its risk was far too great, Shisō and his partner Yotaka led by Akahoshi, came to request the Third to resume the training. After the Hoshikage refused, he along with his partner assisted Akahoshi in assassinating the Third. Though questioning if it was going to far, they were silenced by Akahoshi. After this event, they claimed that the Third suddenly grew ill and died while Akahoshi became the self-proclaimed Fourth
Hoshikage
.

Personality

Along with Akahoshi and Yotaka, Shisō believed they must be willing to risk the well-being of the villagers to ensure their village would stand atop of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
. For that reason, they were willing to assassinate the Third Hoshikage to resume the star training. Unlike the extremist Akahoshi, however, Shisō had his reserves, wondering whether they went too far in killing their village leader, and tried to persuade Akahoshi from going against the protesting villagers. When Akahoshi revealed that the three of them killed the Third Hoshikage, Shisō attempted to deny his part in it, fearing retribution. He would deceive others. He was also prone to panicking.

Appearance

Shisō has long chin length black hair and dark-coloured eyes. He wears a purple
forehead protector
 on his forehead and a blue-purple
flak jacket
 with an black long sleeve shirt underneath it. He also wears a black pair of shorts.

Abilities

He is able to use the
Mysterious Peacock Method
 and could support Akahoshi's techniques by offering him his
chakra
 reserves. He also managed to kill the third Hoshikage alongside Yotaka, although this most likely happened because they caught him off guard. He could also quickly recognise that he is stalked
by

someone
.

Part I

Star Guard Mission

They both assisted Akahoshi the assassination of the
Third Hoshikage
. When the Leaf Ninja were summoned to Hoshigakure to protect the meteor,
Rock Lee
 and
Tenten
 were suspicious of them and did a stakeout until being discovered. After Akahoshi kidnapped
Sumaru
, he sent Shisō and Yotaka to fetch the Konoha ninja to help Akahoshi fight
Natsuhi
.

He, Akahoshi, and Yotaka later found where the meteor is hidden and ran afoul of
Naruto Uzumaki
 and Natsuhi. Akahoshi absorbed the chakra of Shisō and Yotaka. Shisō and Yotaka recovered after Akahoshi recovered the star. Shisō and Yotaka tried to get Akahoshi to give up, but Akahoshi ignored them. When Akahoshi fused with the star, Shisō and Yotaka were among those hit by Akahoshi's out of control chakra. After Akahoshi was defeated,
Tsunade
 mentioned that he, Akahoshi, and Yotaka will be subjected to harsh punishment.
