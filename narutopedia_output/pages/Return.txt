 anime.

Synopsis

Boruto
 fails to create a
rift
 to
Konoha
, their only way home since
Sasuke
 no longer has his
Rinnegan
.
Kawaki
 asks if he's afraid of being taken over by
Momoshiki
 again, and vows to help him get rid of his
Kāma
, just as they helped him. Boruto is able to create a rift as Kawaki begins arguing with him, and they all leave for Konoha.
Shikamaru
 receives word of their return, and
Amado
 asks about Kawaki. Shikamaru,
Katasuke
,
Sumire
,
Sarada
, and
Mitsuki
 greet them. Sarada asks about her father's eye, but doesn't blame Boruto when he claims responsibility. Sasuke agrees with her.
Naruto
,
Sai
, and Shikamaru confer with Amado, to ask about the state of
Kara
 with
Isshiki
's death. He reveals that the remaining Inner,
Code
, is dangerous, as a non-functional Vessel who bears a Kāma. Since his Kāma doesn't function as a means of reincarnation, it wasn't erased, but it still functions as a weapon. Amado explains that while he modified other Inners to make them stronger, he instead restrained Code's power, so as not to undermine
Jigen
's authority, as Code is deeply devoted to the
Ōtsutsuki
.
 Code is the only cyborg stronger than Jigen that Amado didn't dispose of under Jigen's orders, and is likely to seek vengeance for Isshiki's death. Code wakes up at the
Ten-Tails
' pen, having dozed off. His White Kāma activates, manifesting a vision of Isshiki, who deems Code his successor and bequeaths his mission to him. Boruto and Kawaki talk about going back home.
Sakura
 and Katasuke go over what the loss of
Kurama
 and the Rinnegan mean for Naruto and Sasuke. Boruto and Kawaki also receive confirmation of their bodies being 80% Ōtsutsuki, and Kawaki reaffirms his commitment to helping Boruto get rid of his Kāma. Katasuke and Boruto are pestered by the media, wanting to know how the fight with Isshiki went down. Boruto's friends watch him being interviewed on TV. Mitsuki informs Sarada that because of Boruto's situation,
Team 7
 is currently prohibited from going on missions. Boruto apologises for his problem affecting them. Sumire is concerned about him and realises her feelings for Boruto, and Boruto rides the train while pondering about his Kāma.
