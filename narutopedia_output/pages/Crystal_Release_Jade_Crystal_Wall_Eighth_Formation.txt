This technique allows Guren to encase a large area in red crystals, thus crystallising everything within it. This technique was first used in Guren's battle with the
Three-Tailed Beast
, but to no avail, as it broke out shortly after.

Trivia

Although the technique is called "Jade Crystal Wall Eight Formation", the crystal wall itself is
red
 in colouration.
