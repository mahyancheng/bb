Naruto
 manga.

Summary

As the situation on the battlefield gets dire, with attacks coming at
all

ends
 from
Obito
,
Madara
, and the
Ten-Tails
,
Chōji
 notes that
Naruto
's chakra cloaks were protecting them from the worst of the attacks. As
Sakura
's cloak deflects the giant
kunai
 and
magatama
 respectively, she wondered if keeping up a feat like this would not harm Naruto in the end. Evading an attack from Obito thanks to
Kakashi
's warning, Naruto once again decries Obito's ideals, noting that a loner like him could never understand his euphoria to have all his comrades around him. As Obito finds a flaw in Naruto's sentiments, Kakashi looks on wondering why Obito was testing Naruto in that manner. While Kurama wonders how Naruto was doing as he controls its distributed chakra simultaneously, Madara — his face contorted into a maniacal smile — senses
Hashirama
's chakra on the battlefield. With the Ten-Tails letting out a shriek on the battlefield, it undergoes yet another, albeit slight transformation. Kurama warns Naruto of the impending danger as the atmosphere begins to change on the battlefield; Obito muses that this was the consequence of the
Alliance
 separating him and Madara from the beast and wonders if he should just become the beast's
jinchūriki
. The situation prompts Kakashi to attempt to
warp
 the beast away. However, he is intercepted by Obito and as Kakashi calls out to Naruto to handle there, he and Obito warp each other away to
Kamui's dimension
. Elsewhere, Madara notes the fun was about to begin, and cloaks himself with his
Susanoo
's ribcage. The Ten-Tails' power creates
earthquakes, thunderstorms, and tornadoes
 all over the battlefield.
