Summary

Recognising the
Rasengan
,
Tsunade
 creates a fissure in the ground. Naruto falls in and the Rasengan is forced into the ground. Seeing that it is incomplete, Tsunade reprimands
Jiraiya
 for teaching him such a technique as it just gives Naruto unwarranted hope. Determined to prove her wrong, Naruto vows to master the Rasengan in three days. Tsunade offers the deadline of a week instead. If he can stay true to his word, he can have her
priceless necklace

his wallet

Orochimaru
. If she decides to help him, Jiraiya states he will not hesitate to kill her. He then observes that Naruto is very much like her brother
Nawaki
, which
Shizune
 elsewhere decides to tell Naruto about.
