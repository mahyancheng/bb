Summary

The intense battle between
Madara
 and the five
Kage
 continues as
Ōnoki
 attacks Madara with a gigantic
rock golem
. However, Madara counters with his
Wood Release: Advent of a World of Flowering Trees
 technique, shattering the golem into pieces.
Tsunade
 remembers the technique being her
grandfather
's and as the technique released its pollen, she instructs the Kage not to inhale.

A
.
Kabuto
 muses on how people thought no other shinobi is as powerful as Hashirama Senju, just like how people consider the powers of the
Sage of the Six Paths
 a myth. Elsewhere, the
Hokage Guard Platoon
 along with
Dodai
 and
Sagan
 continue to pursue
Mū
. While the Kage are distracted, Madara unleashes his
Susanoo
, causing them to fall through the trees. Madara proceeds to
set the forest ablaze
 and not long after, the five Kage are knocked unconscious.
 Ōnoki, continuously losing his consciousness, remembers of his talk with the
First Tsuchikage
 about the
strong will
 of the
Iwa
 shinobi. Refusing to give up, Ōnoki destroys the forest created by Madara with his
Dust Release
 and as a result, the Kage regained their consciousness. As Madara's body is
reforming
 from the Tsuchikage's attack, to the Kage's horror, the face formed from the DNA of Hashirama Senju appeared on Madara's chest. Meanwhile,
Itachi
 continues his search for Kabuto, as
Sasuke
 detects the former. Sasuke follows him but his brother refused to talk to him. With no choice, Sasuke attempts to catch Itachi with his Susanoo, only for Itachi to counter with his own. The two begin to have a conversation. Meanwhile at the battlefield, Madara decides to take out Tsunade first after realising she was a
Senju
 and also deemed her a weak woman, pathetic compared to the likes of her grandfather. Tsunade stated that she inherited something more than power from her grandfather — the
Will of Fire
 — something that Madara should not take so lightly.

Trivia

When Itachi spoke with Sasuke, Itachi's left sclerae mistakenly appeared normal in one scene instead of black sclerae.
