Though resembling a normal crustacean, this summon has a number of chakra receivers, one being stuck through the top left side of its back and another in the lower right side of its back, implying it is being controlled by Pain. Around its mouth and all of its underside are coloured white while the rest is a reddish colour. It has eight crab-like legs and two big crab-like pincers. It has many large spikes jutting out of its lower back area, most notable the very large spike in the centre of its lower back. It appeared very dark inside of its mouth.
