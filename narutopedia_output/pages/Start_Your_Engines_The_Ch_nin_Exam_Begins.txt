Synopsis

Ibiki Morino
 appears and announces that the first part of
Chūnin Exams
 is a written test and describes the rules: no asking questions. Ibiki also explains that a team's score will be added up at the end of the exam to see which teams pass. Various
chūnin
 proctors line the sides of the room and watch the
genin
 to catch cheaters. If caught cheating five times, the genin and his/her team are all disqualified. However the test proves exceedingly difficult, and eventually most candidates figure out the trick to the exam. In order to pass, they have to cheat without getting caught. They then used their respective skills to subtly cheat.
