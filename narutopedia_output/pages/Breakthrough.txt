Naruto
 manga.

Summary

With the entire area set
ablaze
 from the
attack
 on
Obito
,
Sasuke
 and
Naruto
 watch, wondering if their attack was successful. Meanwhile,
Tobirama

teleports
 to
Minato
's side, noting that they had landed their attack before Obito could shield himself with the
mysterious orbs
. However, Obito emerges from the flames, unscathed as the orbs erase the black flames. As the two
Hokage
 analyse the situation, Tobirama notes that Minato's arm should have regenerated by now, and comes to the conclusion that whatever Obito was doing involved the use of
Yin–Yang
 rendering the regenerative abilities of the
technique
 useless. As Naruto calls out to Sasuke noting they would have to lead the assault and attempts to go into
Tailed Beast Mode
. As a result, the mantle disappears altogether leading Tobirama to chide Naruto and Minato for not thinking.
 As Minato sheepishly apologises to the Second, they are all shocked when
Gamakichi
 attacks Obito with the
Starch Syrup Gun
 technique noting that the
Summoning Technique
 was soon going to run out and he wanted to try something before he disappeared. As Obito deflects the attack under the
shinobi
's watchful eyes, Minato questions of his intentions lead Obito to decry the position of Hokage, leading Minato to blame the chain of events during the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
 on his inability to recognise his own student. Naruto, however, tells the
jinchūriki
 not to look down on the position because he was unable to acquire it, and — picking up on what was happening as Naruto formed a
Rasengan
 — Tobirama teleports Naruto above Obito where he sends his attack crashing into Obito's back. Though Sasuke and Minato are shocked, Tobirama explains that it appeared that
senjutsu
 was effective against Obito's form. As Minato notes that his son had become a
sage
 like his own
sensei
, the silhouetted
Yin
 half of
Kurama
 notes that Naruto had grown up to be someone who loved his parents and had even persuaded his
Yang
-half to cooperate with him.
