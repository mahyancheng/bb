The user takes a deep breath and exhales several small blasts of
wind

chakra
 that scatters in different directions, making it very difficult for one to avoid without injury. Due to the properties of this technique, the expelled blasts are capable of piercing into and potentially through an opponent's flesh. In the anime, Danzō could also compress the air to create a spherical-like blast that is powerful enough to break through a
wood dome
.
