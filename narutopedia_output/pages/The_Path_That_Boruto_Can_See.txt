Synopsis

Kakashi
 determines
Nue
 isn't summoned like other animals.
Naruto
 tries sensing it with
Sage Mode
, to no avail. Naruto,
Sai
, and Kakashi discuss finding the jutsu caster, who must be in another dimension as well.
Denki
,
Shikadai
, and
Inojin
 look for
Boruto
. Shikadai notices something strange in the sky. In
Nue's home dimension
, Boruto follows a strand of dark chakra to a tree stump, where Nue attacks him. Boruto strikes back, managing to stab Nue in the face. Boruto can suddenly see Nue's chakra network, a spot at the base of its tail standing out. Nue attacks while Boruto is confused by what he sees, but
Mitsuki
 saves him, and tells him Nue is attacking on
Sumire
's orders.
 Boruto has Mitsuki stall Nue, and prepares many explosive tag kunai. He stabs Nue at the base of its tail, and sets up the explosive tags, causing thick ropes above to fall on Nue. Mitsuki strikes the downed Nue with
Lightning Release
, but Sumire blocks it with her
Water Release
. Boruto and Mitsuki ask her if there's any chance she'll back down willingly. Sumire is baffled at them, and explains that despite her father serving the village, after the war, he was deemed a criminal for being involved with Root. All the fear and anxiety of living in hiding made her mother die of illness. Sumire exchanges attacks with Mitsuki. Boruto puts himself between them, telling to stop, and is injured. He is unconvinced that Sumire truly faked all her concern for her class mates since meeting her. Mitsuki is surprised by Boruto, and adds Sumire did mention wanting to end things quickly while in the hospital. Boruto sees the dark chakra's hold on her dissipating. Boruto deduces the reason why the ghost affected those who were troubled was because Sumire herself was troubled, making it easier to infect like-minded people. Sumire orders Nue to extract what's left of her chakra and blow itself up. Nue simply nudges her gently, Boruto concluding that despite being raised by Sumire to be a weapon, it sees her as its parent. Boruto tells her she doesn't have to use Nue as a weapon like her father used her. The
Gozu Tennō
 on her back shatters, causing accumulated chakra to become unstable, and the place starts to cave in. The three rush to leave, and Nue protects them from the unstable chakra. Boruto manages to see where a rift is, and the three escape the dimension. Sai arrives with Konoha shinobi. He sympathises with Sumire, and offers to help her. She accepts. Boruto sees there is still a connection between her and Nue. The five of them jump on the coming train, as they're late for
Academy
.
