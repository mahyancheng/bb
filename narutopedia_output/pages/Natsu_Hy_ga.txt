This article is about the member of the Hyūga Clan. For the Iwagakure shinobi, see
Natsu
.

Natsu Hyūga
 (
日向ナツ
,
Hyūga Natsu
) is a
kunoichi
 of
Konohagakure
's
Hyūga clan
.

Background

Natsu was a maid of the Hyūga clan, and was the caretaker of
Hanabi Hyūga
. One day when Hanabi wanted to play with
her sister
, Natsu reminded her that Hinata was busy with her training. The next morning when they were taking a walk through the village, they witnessed
Naruto Uzumaki
 being scolded by a villager. As Hanabi wondered why Naruto was treated as an outcast, Natsu told her to shun him. Later, she watched over Hanabi finishing her studies, and told her to finish them before she could play with Hinata.

Personality

Natsu is a kind and responsible person, having been tasked with looking after Hanabi Hyūga. Despite this, like most of the villagers in Konoha, she only saw Naruto as the host of the beast or even the beast itself that once devastated their home, and thus treated and viewed him poorly when he was a child.

Appearance

Natsu has short, dark green hair and like the rest of her clan, she has large white eyes. Attire-wise, she wears a full-length kimono with a white apron on top along with the village's
forehead protector
 around her forehead. While she was with Hanabi and Hiashi while returning to Konoha from their meeting with the Taketori, she wore a navy blue kimono and an obi in the same colour with an orange cord around it.

Abilities

As a member of the Hyūga clan, Natsu possesses the
Byakugan
 which grants her an almost 360° field of vision, x-ray vision, and the ability to see through the
chakra pathway system
.
