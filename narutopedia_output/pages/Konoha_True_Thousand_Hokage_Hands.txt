In
Sage Mode
, Hashirama creates a
gigantic wooden statue
. The other five
Hokage
 all channel their chakra through it, causing it to glow with power. Hashirama detaches the statue from its countless hands, and lands a sequence of six
chakra-enhanced punches
 with it, swiftly moving the statue in front of the opponent after each hit to land the next. The last punch is an uppercut, throwing the opponent into the sky, and creating a fire in the shape of the kanji for fire.
