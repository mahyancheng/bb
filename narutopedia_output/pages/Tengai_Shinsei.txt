The user weaves three
hand seals
 simultaneously between themselves and their Susanoo, in order to draw massive
meteorites
 from the upper atmosphere down towards a specific location on the ground. As they descend in succession along the same trajectory, if one of these meteorites is stopped, the user can summon another one to then
collide
 with the first, ensuring that they crash into their intended destination.

The impact of this technique was of such enormity that it devastated a significant portion of the
Fourth Division
, with the resulting tremors felt from the border of the
Land of Lightning
 to as far away as the
Allied Shinobi Forces
'
headquarters
.
 It was also able to completely destroy Madara's Susanoo, and obliterate his body.

Trivia

While not named in the manga and anime, it was named in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
 and
J-Stars Victory Vs
.

As a nod to Madara's own body being affected by this technique, the latter game while with no direct damage involved, can allow Madara and his ally to be affected by the blast radius of the second portion as friendly fire (which however does not add any combo hit counts unlike hitting enemies with it).

The sheer enormity of this technique caused the Fourth Division to question if it could even be called
ninjutsu
, with
Gaara
 believing it to be a power comparable to a god's.

After becoming the
Ten Tails
'
jinchūriki
, Madara's usage of Chibaku Tensei created several meteors similar to the ones this technique summons.

When the second meteor first dropped, it looked almost perfectly spherical, but when Madara awakened his
Complete Body Susanoo
 from his armoured Susanoo, it looked elongated vertically.

In the anime and video games, the hand seal held by Madara changes from the manga to be a Ram seal instead of a Snake seal.
