The
Six Paths Yin Power
 is a power wielded by
Hamura
 and
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
, and later given to
Sasuke Uchiha
. It is represented by a dark-coloured, crescent moon-like palm seal (
掌の印
,
shō no in
)
 on the user's left hand.

Background

Besides being comprised of the
Yin Release

nature transformation
, the actual applications of this power aren't clearly understood. It can be presumed that it augments the user's abilities.

As noted by
Black Zetsu
, there is a special resonance between the Six Paths Yin and Yang powers, allowing the wielders to
sense
 each other's presence.
 When the Yin and
Yang
 powers are used together, they can
seal
 and transform their target into the core of the
Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei
 technique. When Sasuke did so in conjunction with
Naruto Uzumaki
's
Six Paths Yang Power
, the palm seal on his left hand vanished, returning to Hagoromo's own left hand.
