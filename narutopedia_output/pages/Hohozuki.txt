Hohozuki
 (
歩々月
) was a friend of
Ameyuki
.

Background

Hohozuki was born in the same village as
Ameyuki
. Unlike all of the other villagers, Hohozuki did not hate Ameyuki and in fact was his only friend. One day slavers attacked their village and kidnapped the women and children - Hohozuki included. Ameyuki rescued them, using his
Mud Release
 to kill the slavers. Rather than thank Ameyuki for his help, the villagers now feared Ameyuki and tried to kill him. When Hohozuki found out about this, he convinced Ameyuki to go to
Shangri-la
 with him so that they could live without being bothered. Before they could leave, the villagers found out what they had planned and killed Hohozuki.

Ameyuki felt responsible for Hohozuki's death and wanted to die also, but lived on because it's what Hohozuki wanted. Believing Hohozuki was better than himself, Ameyuki used the
Transformation Technique
 to assume Hohozuki's identity.
