"
Regarding Pain
" (
ペインについて
,
Pein ni Tsuite
) is chapter 369 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

The first of his prisoners is uncooperative, so
Jiraiya
 demonstrates how "ruthless" he can be to those who do not help him; he turns the
Amegakure
 ninja into a
toad
. His companion is suddenly very forthcoming with information. He tells Jiraiya that little about
Pain
 is known by Amegakure citizens. He corrects Jiraiya's belief that the civil war is ongoing, Pain's side having already won. Jiraiya is horrified that anyone could defeat the former leader of Amegakure,
Hanzō
, who not even he and the other
Sannin
 could defeat. The ninja goes on to detail how Pain came to be regarded as a god amongst Amegakure's villagers by killing everyone even remotely affiliated to Hanzō in order to remove any possibility of dissent. Meanwhile, Pain sets out to face Jiraiya.
