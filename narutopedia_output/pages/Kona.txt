Kara Actuation Arc

Kona ended up infected with the cells of
Hashirama Senju
 which left her in an unconscious state. She was found by
Yubina
, whose treatment could not cure her of the infection and had to slow the spread with
fūinjutsu
. It wasn't until the arrival of
Mitsuki
, whose unique body was able to resist the cells, that Yubina was able to cure Kona with Mitsuki's antibodies.

After she recovered, Kona helped Mitsuki sneak into the
Land of Silence
 through her underground passageway. There, Mitsuki met Kona's brother
Katara
, who in gratitude for saving Kona, helped save Mitsuki's team-mates after they were framed for killing
Sakuya
 to steal a sample of
Hashirama Senju
's cells.
