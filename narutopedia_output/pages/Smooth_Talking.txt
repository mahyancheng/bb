Naruto
 manga.

Summary

After leaving the
Ramen Ichiraku
,
Kakashi
 reminds
Naruto
 that creating a technique requires combining
nature transformation
 with
shape transformation
. By completing his
Wind Release
 training, he has the former, and since he can already perform the
Rasengan
, he has the latter. Naruto concludes that creating a new technique will be easy since he has already mastered both components, but Kakashi corrects him by showing that he can also use the Rasengan. Combining nature transformation with the Rasengan was too difficult for Kakashi and the Rasengan's creator, the
Fourth Hokage
. Kakashi is confident that Naruto will succeed where they failed. Elsewhere,
Shikamaru
 points out that
Asuma
 hasn't smoked a cigarette since learning of
Chiriku
's death, a sign that something is bothering him.
