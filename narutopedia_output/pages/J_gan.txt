The
Jōgan
 (
淨眼
,
literally meaning:
 Pure Eye) is a unique dōjutsu that is known only by the
Ōtsutsuki Clan
,
 whose members claim that it is troublesome and a power strongly inherited from their clan.
 In the manga, the dōjutsu is featureless in appearance with a barely visible pupil.
 When depicted in the anime, the dōjutsu is light blue in colour with a darkened sclera and visible pupil.

When first used during his time in the
Academy
,
Boruto
 did not appear to have the ability to activate it on command; instead, the eye would involuntarily activate when Boruto focused his attention on a particular person or object. As a teenager, he displayed the ability to activate it at will.

Abilities

The Jōgan perceives
chakra pathway systems
 down to the
tenketsu
, enabling the user to observe changes in
chakra
 flow and identify individuals by their chakra signatures. It also grants the ability to see through invisible barriers between dimensions and can predict where
Yomotsu Hirasaka
 will be used.

The Jōgan activates automatically in the presence of high-level threats, including those that are otherwise undetectable. With sufficient mastery, the user can also activate it at will. Unlike other dōjutsu, the Jōgan is usable even if the eye is damaged in its natural state, retaining full sight and access to its powers.

Trivia





Chengxi's drawing.



In early production materials its name was tentatively spelled with modern kanji as "Jōgan" (
浄眼
,
literally meaning:
 Pure Eye), however upon officially appearing in writing the spelling was changed to the traditional form, "Jōgan" (
淨眼
,
literally meaning:
 Pure Eye).

After the airing of
episode 15
, Chengxi Huang, an animator for
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
, made a blog post hoping to offer clarification to debating fans. The animator explained that the eye was neither a
Byakugan
 nor a
Tenseigan
, and at the time was being referred to as a "Jōgan" (
浄眼
,
literally meaning:
 Pure Eye). He also explained that the eye is related to the
Ōtsutsuki clan
's dimension and its powers are the dōjutsu equivalent of Naruto's ability to
sense negative emotions
. However, he also noted that he personally hadn't read all the scripts and that this information was tentative and would be explained in detail in the future, and that fans should not think too much of it for now, as the
author
 hadn't thought everything through himself. He included an illustration of Boruto putting eyedrops into his right eye, captioned "Jōgan" (
浄眼
,
literally meaning:
 Pure Eye).
