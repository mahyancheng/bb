Amagi
 (
アマギ
) is a
chūnin
 of
Sunagakure
, directly under
Kankurō
's supervision since he has turned 15.

Personality

Amagi is quite impatient when in battle, believing that there is no worth in waiting for an opening to strike as it just gives the target time to gather their strength and attack. He believes in avenging his allies, so much so that he considered a
death penalty
 to be given to
Kajūra
, due to him killing his comrades, but was reasoned with by Kankurō. Amagi is a strong believer in the teachings of the
Sage of the Six Paths
, specifically
ninshū
.

Appearance

Amagi is a young boy with androgynous features, like his cherubic chestnut brown hair, that has him mistaken for a girl.

Abilities

Amagi had survived countless battles after his first fight. When in combat, he deploys small and sharp daggers and kozura (knives, attached to sword scabbards), with which he is very artistic. Despite that, Kankurō noted that the weapons are quite easy to deflect. Amagi can also use
chakra threads
 in unison with kozura to control their direction, making them sort of like homing devices.

Blank Period

Gaara Hiden: A Sandstorm Mirage

While on the mission to capture
Kajūra
, a
missing-nin
 of
Ishigakure
, Amagi witnessed the terrorist killing his comrades and decided to take action. The boy launched several daggers and kozura at the opponent's
Iron Sand

form
, but was
electrocuted
 and left in a near-death state. Despite that, he managed to successfully recover in a short amount of time. After Kankurō defeated and captured the criminal, Amagi proposed killing him to Kankurō, as a way to avenge their fallen comrades, but the
jōnin
 reasoned with him that killing Kajūra won't bring their teammates back from the dead. Reminded that
shinobi
 are those who endure, the boy, with the rest of the
Counter-Terrorism Division
, decided to head back to the village.

After learning about Kankurō's decision to take over for
Gaara
 as the
Kazekage
, Amagi questioned his superior, whether this was what he truly wanted, confused about his actions as a shinobi. When the jōnin faced
Tōjūrō
 and learned of his betrayal, Amagi appeared behind the senior and restrained him.
