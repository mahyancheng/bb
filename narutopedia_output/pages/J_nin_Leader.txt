"
Jōnin Leader
" (
担当上忍
,
Tantō Jōnin
) is episode 360 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Now relieved from his
Anbu
 duties,
Kakashi
 starts his day as
jōnin
 and instructor to
genin
. He recalls his past mistakes on his training days with his former sensei
Minato Namikaze
 and tries to make his own way in instructing his candidates, primarily team-work and not blindly following the rules.
Hiruzen
 notices the "darkness" still embedded in Kakashi's heart when Kakashi fails his genin teams in the
bell test
.
 Meanwhile,
Guy
 trains
Lee
,
Neji
 and
Tenten
 and the young shinobi successfully excel in their training. As they rest, they talk about Kakashi's way of training and this makes Guy worry. At the
Dango Shop
, Guy talks to
Asuma
 and
Kurenai
 about Kakashi and suddenly Hiruzen joins them. After Kakashi continuously ignores Guy, he is stormed by his former students and thanked him for the lessons he taught from the
bell test
. Hiruzen finally reveals the next genin team to be assigned to Kakashi:
Sakura Haruno
,
Sasuke Uchiha
, and
Naruto Uzumaki
.

Trivia

When Hiruzen presents the data of
Team 7
, it is been stated that Sakura's birthday is on March 26 which contradicts what is mentioned in the databooks that her birthday was actually on March 28.
