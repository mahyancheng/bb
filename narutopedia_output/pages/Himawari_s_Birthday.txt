"
Himawari's Birthday
" (

,
Himawari no Tanjōbi
) is episode 53 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Urashiki Ōtsutsuki
 arrives at the moon, where he meets with
Toneri Ōtsutsuki
. Toneri is surprised when Urashiki mentions the clan's main branch, and that they witnessed Toneri's troubles, wondering why he still protects the planet. Urashiki is also aware of Toneri's intervention with
Boruto
. Toneri attacks, but Urashiki paralyses him with a chakra string, and utilises a powder to freeze Toneri in time for ten thousand years, as he isn't allowed to kill a clan member. Urashiki departs as Toneri ponders that Boruto isn't ready. In an interview,
Naruto
 stresses the importance of teaching the current generation the history of how their current peace was achieved by the sacrifices made during the last war. He also offers advice for the genin who will be taking the
Chūnin Exams
.
 Boruto's not excited about the exams, instead wanting to become a shinobi like
Sasuke
.
Moegi
 hands her genin application papers for the exams.
Katasuke
 requests that the genin are allowed to use scientific ninja tools on the exams. Naruto denies it, considering the exams should measure a genin's own strength. In the
Ninjutsu Research Centre
, Katasuke wonders about Naruto's decision, and is approached by a
hooded figure
. Boruto plays video games with
Inojin
 and
Shikadai
, who disapprove of Boruto's cheating.
Mitsuki
 and
Sarada
 bring the application papers for Boruto, still uninterested in participating. Sarada manages to convince him by pointing out that passing the exams will be a way show everyone how strong he is. Boruto goes home to celebrate
Himawari
's birthday, and is surprised to find Naruto home. As the celebration starts, Naruto disappears, revealed to be a shadow clone. Boruto is furious that Naruto broke his promise.
Hinata
 tries reasoning with Boruto, but he's sick of always hearing the same excuses. Boruto notices Naruto's old, battered up cloths, and tosses it out the window. Someone rings the bell, and believing it to be Naruto, Boruto opens the door prepared to punch, but is blocked by Sasuke. Boruto apologises and introduces himself. Sasuke asks Hinata if Naruto is there, and she informs him he's still at the office. Boruto is thrilled about meeting Sasuke.

Trivia

When Sasuke blocks Boruto's punch, he can be momentarily seen with his normal left eye instead of
Rinnegan
.

Koji Kashin makes a cameo in this episode ambushing Katasuke, however it’s revealed later in the manga to have been co-working with
Ao
 to put the scientist under the control of
Kara
.
