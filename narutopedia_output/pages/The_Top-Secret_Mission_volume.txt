The Top-Secret Mission…!!
 (

Gokuhi Ninmu…!!
,
Viz:
 The Secret Mission) is volume 33 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 290

"
The Betrayal's Conclusion!!
" (
裏切りの結末!!
,
Uragiri no Ketsumatsu!!
)

Kabuto
 begins asking about information that only the real
Sasori
 would know, so
Yamato
 prepares to capture him. At the same moment
Orochimaru
 confronts them. Having been alerted by Yamato's action, Kabuto is able to get away and join up with him. Yamato starts to wonder how he will fight Orochimaru while maintaining his disguise as Sasori when Kabuto cuts off the disguise's head. Yamato flees and Orochimaru points out that he is not Sasori, Kabuto not knowing what the real Sasori looks like. Outnumbered, Yamato calls in
Naruto
,
Sakura
, and
Sai
.

Chapter 291

"
The Trigger of Rage!!
" (
怒りの引き金!!
,
Ikari no Hikigane!!
)

Naruto
 demands that
Orochimaru
 give
Sasuke
 back. Orochimaru tells him to try using force. Naruto promptly manifests a
one-tailed chakra shroud
 and attacks him, sending him back into the forest. Seeing this,
Yamato
 remembers a conversation he had back in
Konoha
 about Naruto's tailed-transformations. Naruto enters tailed transformations as he loses his temper, becoming more dangerous to himself and others with each new tail. Since the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 would be released if he reached nine tails, Yamato is to prevent this from happening. Orochimaru remarks on this when he returns, noting that Konoha should be grateful for giving Yamato
Wood Release
 abilities. He voices his interest in examining Yamato and seeing how Naruto compares to "his" Sasuke. Naruto grows infuriated by the reference to Sasuke as property and reaches three tails.

Chapter 292

"
The Third Tail…!!
" (
三本目…!!
,
Sanbonme…!!
)

Team 7
 tries to come to grips with the power of
Naruto
's
three-tailed form
. Naruto roars, flinging
Kabuto
 back and destroying the
Tenchi Bridge
. While Naruto goes after
Orochimaru
,
Sakura
 falls and hits her head, knocking her unconscious.
Sai
 does not save her, instead following Naruto, forcing
Yamato
 to stop her from falling into the ravine. As Naruto attacks him, Orochimaru remarks that he does not compare to
Sasuke
, causing a fourth tail to start to appear.

Chapter 293

"
Rampage…!!
" (
暴走…!!
,
Bōsō…!!
)

As a
fourth tail
 begins to appear,
Naruto
, within his subconscious, succumbs to the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 in order to find
Sasuke
.
Yamato
 wakes up
Sakura
 and, after confirming that she is okay, sends a
wood clone
 after Naruto. As it nears his location the forest explodes and the clone just barely shields itself. It investigates and finds Naruto has reached four tails, a form
Jiraiya
 had warned him about.

Chapter 294

"
The Fourth Tail…!!
" (
四本目…!!
,
Yonhonme…!!
)

Sakura
 asks
Yamato
 about what is happening to
Naruto
, but he only assures her that he has things handled.
Kabuto
 also approaches them and asks if their presence means
Sasori
 is dead. He is glad when they confirm. Meanwhile,
Orochimaru
 attacks Naruto but Naruto, in a
four-tailed transformation
, has no difficulty countering the attack and then some. The observing
Sai
 and Yamato's
wood clone
 realise that there is nothing they can do but watch. Orochimaru tries to flee but Naruto has no difficulties pursuing him. With Orochimaru cornered, Naruto prepares an attack.

Chapter 295

"
Towards the Nine-Tails…!!
" (
九尾へ…!!
,
Kyūbi e…!!
)

As
Naruto
 prepares his attack,
Orochimaru
, seeing how dangerous it is, creates some distance between them.
Sai
 and
Yamato
's
wood clone
, also sensing the attack's power, ready themselves. Naruto fires a beam of
chakra
 that devastates the area and that Orochimaru is only able to survive by using
Summoning: Triple Rashōmon
. Orochimaru emerges from the rubble and strikes Naruto with his
Kusanagi
. Although it cannot penetrate his
chakra shroud
, it at least pushes Naruto back to where Yamato,
Sakura
, and
Kabuto
 are.

Chapter 296

"
The Sad Conclusion
" (
悲しき決着
,
Kanashiki Ketchaku
)

Kabuto
,
Sakura
, and
Yamato
 got away from the struggling
Naruto
. Kabuto, seeing his
four-tailed transformation
, remarks that Naruto has allowed himself to become a monster to find
Sasuke
. Distraught over what Naruto is putting himself through, Sakura approaches him to try and calm him down but Naruto, no longer able to distinguish between friend and foe, attacks her. Yamato suppresses the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
's influence over Naruto while Kabuto tends to Sakura, thanking her for eliminating
Sasori
. Meanwhile,
Orochimaru
 collapses from the strain put on his body by fighting Naruto. He is approached by
Sai
, who asks for a chance to speak with him on the behalf of
Danzō
.

Chapter 297

"
Sai's Mission!!
" (
サイの任務!!
,
Sai no Ninmu!!
)

With the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 suppressed,
Sakura
 heals
Naruto
's injuries. She asks if it is is possible to learn
Yamato
's
Wood Release
, hoping to be more helpful to Naruto, but Yamato says it is not. Yamato adds that this doesn't matter given her feelings, but Naruto wakes up before he elaborates. Naruto asks how Sakura became injured and, seeing that
Sai
 is gone, suggests it was him. Meanwhile,
Orochimaru
, surprised by Sai's claim that he speaks for
Danzō
, agrees to listen to him. He does, however, insist that Sai speak in person, destroying his
ink clone
. Sai reaches for his bag but is tackled by
Kabuto
, believing he is an enemy. Orochimaru finds what Sai was looking for and tells Kabuto to release Sai, as Sai will be coming with them.

Chapter 298

"
The Top-Secret Mission…!!
" (
極秘任務…!!
,
Gokuhi Ninmu…!!
)

Naruto
 examines the area and is confused by the damage, unaware that he is responsible for everything. They come across
Sai
's location, meeting with
Orochimaru
 and find a number of Sai's belongings, including his picture book, strewn around the area.
Yamato
, his
wood clone
 having seen it firsthand, informs them that Sai has joined up with Orochimaru and that the wood clone is following them back to their base. They assume that Sai is working with Orochimaru on
Danzō
's orders and intend to find him to determine why, but must wait for Naruto to rest since the
Nine-Tails
 negatively impacted his body. Meanwhile, Yamato's wood clone comes across Sai hanging from a tree.

Chapter 299

"
The Source of Strength…!!
" (
強さの源…!!
,
Tsuyosa no Minamoto…!!
)

Yamato
's
wood clone
 examines what appears to be
Sai
's corpse. While meant to look as though Sai has been killed to prevent
Orochimaru
 from being followed, the wood clone determines that it is a fake and continues on its way. The rest of
Team 7
 follows as well, but must take a break because of
Sakura
's injury. Although Sakura does not want
Naruto
 to know that he gave her the injury, Yamato secretly tells him. He encourages Naruto not to rely on the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 if he really wants to protect his friends. While resting, Sakura looks at Sai's picture book.

Author's Note

“

There is one period during each day that is my favourite time... The hour between 10 and 11 in the morning. The reason is that everything always seems so refreshing and delightful at that hour. But because of looming deadlines, I usually end up sleeping through it... That refreshing and delightful feeling... what was it like again?
