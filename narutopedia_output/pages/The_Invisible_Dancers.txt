Summary

Taka
 and
Orochimaru
 arrive in
Konohagakure
 as they continue their journey to their destination, sensing
Naruto Uzumaki
's
chakra
 as they press on at
Sasuke Uchiha
's behest. Meanwhile on the battlefield, everyone looks on in shock at the shroud that had surrounded
Hinata Hyūga
, which a wounded
C

comments
 on. Advising Naruto of what had happened,
Kurama
 commended
Shikaku Nara
's analysis of its chakra before telling Naruto, who had got the gist of the situation, that using some
shadow clones
 would be fine. Dispersing the clones around the battlefield, Naruto begins tapping the shinobi on the battlefield, thus transferring Kurama's chakra which envelops them in the same manner it did Hinata. Moving to attack once again, the
Ten-Tails
' tail is
rebuffed
 by Hinata, which leads
Hiashi
 to marvel at the fact that she had used that simple technique, to such devastating effects. Also noticed by
Madara Uchiha
,
Obito Uchiha
 nonetheless sends out several more of the beast's tails to attack the shinobi which are subsequently blocked by
Chōji Akimichi
 and several other
enlarged
 members of the
Akimichi clan
. Signalling to his team-mates,
Ino Yamanaka
 and
Shikamaru Nara
 prepare their techniques while remembering the final words their
fathers
 had left them with. Just as Obito was about to fire off several
wooden projectiles
, Ino is able to
take control
 of the
Uchiha
 once again and veer the attack off-course. Following through with an attempt to instead crush the shinobi with its tail, the beast's body is
bound
 by
Shikamaru
 and several other
Nara
 who boldly declare that their clan wasn't to be underestimated. With
Rock Lee
 mourning the loss of his close friend and comrade,
Might Guy
 and
Tenten
 try to comfort him. Decrying Guy's words as nothing more that the prolonging of a curse, Kakashi and Naruto rebuff Obito's sentiments, and Naruto tells the Uchiha that shinobi were meant to endure and that even if remembering your friends was a curse, he did not care as he wanted to keep the real
Neji Hyūga
 in his heart forever.
