Funeral Proxy Mission

Fūta is first seen giving the will of his father to
Shino Aburame
 and
Naruto Uzumaki
. He is very worried that he'll begin to laugh at his father's funeral, since that will make him lose his right to the estate, and give it the next in line. Therefore he wants Shino to be his stand-in. Later at dinner with his sister Mai, Shino and Naruto, he looks frightened on as Shino start laughing from some laughing drug in the food. At the funeral Fūta watches on, as his family all try to make Naruto laugh, which doesn't succeed, even though Fūta couldn't stop laughing himself. Later when his father made his appearance, Fūta came from his hiding being very surprised. Fūta then remembered how much fun they had as kids, and that he wanted that back.
