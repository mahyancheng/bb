Summary

Somewhere in an underground lair,
Orochimaru
's experiment is brought to life by a struck of lightning. However, Orochimaru's plan backfires as the experiment attacks him and begins to destroy the building, forcing him and
Kabuto
 to evacuate. The next day,
Itachi
 and
Kisame
 find the broken experiment in the destroyed building and brings it back to their leader,
Pain
. In a secret
Akatsuki
 hideout, Pain uses the
King of Hell
 to repair it, as well as add new modifications to it. The Akatsuki leader then instructs Itachi to capture the
Nine-Tails
 with the newly repaired experiment, now hooded by a cloak, joining him in his mission. Itachi soon arrives near
Konohagakure
 and orders it to capture
Naruto
.
 It begins its search for Naruto, attacking several villagers and defeats
Team Guy
 in the process. Naruto himself shows up to stop it so that he can get back to training. Naruto attacks the experiment with his
multitude of clones
, but it easily repels the assault. Naruto manages to land a hit on its cloak, tearing it apart, and is revealed to be a mechanical replica of himself known as
Mecha-Naruto
. Mecha-Naruto begins siphoning Naruto's Nine Tails chakra, causing him to lose his strength.
Kakashi
 and
Yamato
 arrive with Kakashi distracting Mecha-Naruto with his
Lightning Cutter
, giving Yamato the opportunity to save Naruto. The trio manage to escape using a secret tunnel and Mecha-Naruto begins to destroy the village in an effort to find Naruto. In the
Hokage
's office,
Tsunade
 devises a plan to lure Mecha-Naruto away from the village: Naruto rides away from the village in a palanquin with Yamato while
Chōji
,
Kiba
,
Neji
 and
Shikamaru
 act as bearers and Kakashi as backup. The plan is put into action and Mecha-Naruto starts pursuing the palanquin.
Shino
, not wanting to be left behind like last time, arrives to distract Mecha-Naruto, but is defeated. The group decides to escape into the forest, with Shikamaru switching places with Kakashi so that he can try to defeat Mecha-Naruto. However, Shikamaru is defeated after being smashed into the ground by Mecha-Naruto. Tsunade then orders
Shizune
 to request assistance from
Sunagakure
.

Trivia

Naraka Path
.

In one scene, while carrying the palanquin, Chōji appears to have red hair.
