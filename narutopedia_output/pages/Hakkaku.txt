Hakkaku
 (
ハッカク
) is a
cooking-nin
 from the
Land of Lightning
.

Background

He went to the same cooking academy as
Teuchi
. Many years after attending the academy, Hakkaku had become a succesful cooking-nin. His food made everyone who ate it keep on eating it, eventually making them fat. However, he became jealous of Teuchi, who had a fabled "Phantom" Recipe, which was highly acclaimed. He visited Teuchi and wanted to know the recipe only to be denied. In an attempt to know the recipe, Hakkaku and his fellow cooking-nin kidnapped Teuchi's daughter
Ayame
 to get the "Phantom" recipe and left a note and a picture of Ayame tied up to Teuchi, saying that he'll let Ayame go in exchange of the recipe.

Personality

Hakkaku was seen to be a very greedy man who was jealous of Teuchi's skills. He would go as far as to kidnap innocent people to get what he wanted. Hakkaku was also very disappointed when he found out that there was no "phantom" recipe.

Appearance

Hakkaku has long greyish-coloured hair and small black eyes.

Mix it, Stretch it, Boil it Up! Burn Copper Pot, Burn!

On the day of the deadline, he and the three ninja met up at the area where they were to meet up with Teuchi. Hakkaku's concealed ninja prevented Teuchi from advancing to where Ayame's voice was heard from, with Hakkaku stating that he will see his daughter once the contest is done. Teuchi, with the help of
Naruto Uzumaki
,
Chōji Akimichi
, and
Sakura Haruno
, had to compete against Hakkaku's cooks in a contest to see who can make the best ramen. The three genin eventually aided Teuchi in crafting the perfect bowl of ramen. In reality, the "Phantom" recipe didn't exist. It was just the disposal of the broth's bitter taste. As a result, Hakkaku let Ayame go, who had gotten fat from Hakkaku's food, much to Teuchi's dismay.

Trivia

Hakkaku when translated can mean either "Detection" or "Octagon".
