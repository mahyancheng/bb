The user unleashes a volley of
shuriken
 with one hand, and at the same time,
exhales

fire
-infused
chakra
 onto them in order to increase the weapons' destructive potential by making them capable of inflicting severe burns upon direct contact with either the intended victim, or any other object caught within their trajectories.

Due to the chakra-based nature of the flames that surround them, the shuriken will continue to burn after impact, regardless of the flammability of the object that they ultimately collide with.

Trivia

Hōsenka (
鳳仙花
) is the Japanese name for the
Impatiens balsamina
. Tsumabeni (
爪紅
) is an alternative name for this plant, stemming from its use in producing red dyes for nail polish.

Sasuke
 used a similar form of this technique by hiding shuriken within his
Fire Release: Phoenix Sage Fire Technique
 for a surprise attack. However, that tactic and this technique should not be confused with each other, as this one employs chakra flow — breathing the flames directly onto the shuriken.
