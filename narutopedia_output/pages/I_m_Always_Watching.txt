I'm Always Watching

,
Chanto Miteru
) is episode 386 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Naruto
 remains determined to convince
Obito
 to see the error of his ways. The
Uchiha
 begins to reminisce more of his past with
Team Minato
, and how
Rin
 always looked after and truly cared for him. Naruto believes Obito still has bonds with his friends, proven when he remembered his old teammates to maintain control of his consciousness after the
Ten-Tails
 took control of his body.
 Obito is seemingly hesitant whether or not he is doing the right thing. Naruto notes that he won't allow Obito to drag everyone onto his path and continue his
Eye of the Moon Plan
 any longer. Naruto then reaches his hand out to him and calls for him to accept himself as a
shinobi
 of
Konohagakure
 once more and atone for his
crimes
.

Trivia

This was the first episode to air after the manga reached its conclusion; specifically, it aired three days after the manga ended.

In the scene in the forest where Rin is wrapping about a bandage around Obito's right hand, the red bracelet on her left hand is missing.
