Tailed Beast Mode
, shapes the
sand
 coating his arms into multiple
shuriken
. By swinging his arms - which are more powerful than normal because of his transformation - the shuriken are launched rapidly, with additional volleys being possible with each additional swing. The Sand Shuriken, made to be stronger than steel, easily cut through whatever they come into contact with. This technique is a useful way to fend off approaching attackers, as well as a good way to stop opponents from fleeing.
