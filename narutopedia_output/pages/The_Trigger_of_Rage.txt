Viz:
 Rage Trigger!!) is chapter 291 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Naruto
 demands that
Orochimaru
 give
Sasuke
 back. Orochimaru tells him to try using force. Naruto promptly manifests a
one-tailed chakra shroud
 and attacks him, sending him back into the forest. Seeing this,
Yamato
 remembers a conversation he had back in
Konoha
 about Naruto's tailed-transformations. Naruto enters tailed transformations as he loses his temper, becoming more dangerous to himself and others with each new tail. Since the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 would be released if he reached nine tails, Yamato is to prevent this from happening. Orochimaru remarks on this when he returns, noting that Konoha should be grateful for giving Yamato
Wood Release
 abilities. He voices his interest in examining Yamato and seeing how Naruto compares to "his" Sasuke. Naruto grows infuriated by the reference to Sasuke as property and reaches three tails.
