"
Sombre News
" (
悲報
,
Hihō
) is episode 152 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

The five members of the
Akatsuki
 finish
sealing
 the
Six-Tails
 inside the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, killing its
jinchūriki

host
.
Tobi
 tells
Konan
 that he has tasked
Taka
,
Sasuke
's team, with the retrieval of the
Eight-Tails
, vouching for Sasuke's credibility and success.

At home,
Naruto
 remembers his
last encounter
 with
Itachi
, where Itachi had placed him under a
genjutsu
 where they could talk in peace. Itachi had asked Naruto what he would do if Sasuke were to attack
Konoha
, since Naruto views Sasuke as his brother, and asks if Naruto would kill him. Naruto replied that he would save the village without murdering Sasuke in the process. Itachi calls him a childish fool, claiming that
shinobi
 must make hard decisions, prompting Naruto to remember when
Jiraiya
 had told him to
give up on Sasuke
 since shinobi must make such decisions. Naruto promptly told Itachi that he would not give up on Sasuke as it was part of his
ninja way
; Itachi proceeded to smile and stored his
crow
 inside Naruto, telling the former that he was sharing some of his power with him in the event Sasuke did decide to attack the village. Naruto mulls over Itachi's words and wonders how Sasuke is doing at the moment.

Clutching his eyes in pain, Sasuke and
Jūgo
, the latter carrying the unconscious
Karin
 and
Suigetsu
, make their way back to the Akatsuki hideout, where Sasuke hands
Killer B
's body over to Madara. As Sasuke begins to leave, Madara asks him where he is going; Sasuke replies that first, he would tend to his wounds, and then proceed to destroy Konohagakure. Madara smiles as he recalls a conversation with Sasuke, in which he had asked Sasuke if his goal to destroy Konoha would be halted by Itachi's goal of saving it. Sasuke had responded that he held the
two

members
 of the
Konoha Council
 and
Danzō Shimura
 responsible and thus would kill them, as those three were the ones who ordered Itachi to
murder
 his own clan, including his
mother
 and
father
. Sasuke told Madara that Itachi was unable to kill him that night because Itachi viewed Sasuke's life as more precious than the village's; similarly, Sasuke finds that Itachi's life is more precious than the village's, and wishes to slaughter everyone who lives in Konoha, stating that they are all equally as guilty for living in the safe and peaceful environment that Itachi had sacrificed everything for. Having noticed Madara's unresponsive manner, Sasuke reminded the Uchiha that while the former may write him off as an emotional brat, he does not care for anyone who thinks of him in a different manner and that his love for Itachi and the subsequent inconsolable grief that came after his death would cause him to assassinate anybody who stood in his way. Meanwhile in
Kumogakure
,
J
 tells the
Raikage
 that his brother Killer B has been abducted by an Akatsuki member who is an Uchiha from Konoha.

Back in the village, Naruto is awoken by
Kakashi
, who tells him that
Tsunade
 has summoned him. On the way to the
Hokage
's office, Naruto spots
Gamabunta
 and
Gamakichi
, wondering why the two toads are there and why Kakashi is being silent. Inside Tsunade's office, Naruto is greeted by
Fukasaku
, one of the
Two Great Sage Toads
 and Jiraiya's very own master. Naruto is insulted when Fukasaku refers to Jiraiya as a "boy" while the toad is amused that Naruto refers to Jiraiya as a pervy sage. Fukasaku, however, reveals to Naruto that Jiraiya has died during his
battle with Pain
. Naruto is heartbroken and unable to form a response as Kakashi wonders how Jiraiya had died. Fukasaku reveals to them that Jiraiya had found out that
Pain
, the leader of the Akatsuki, was operating out
Amegakure
 and had decided to infiltrate the village to confront him. Upon meeting Pain, Jiraiya found out that Pain was actually his former student Nagato. Kakashi and
Shizune
 are shocked when Fugasaku adds that Pain, along with
five others
, possess the
Rinnegan
. Kakashi is unable to believe that there are six Rinnegan wielders in the world while Shizune reveals that it was thought to be a mythical
dojutsu
 once wielded by the
Sage of Six Paths
. Removing his robe, Fukasaku shows them the code Jiraiya had
engraved
 onto his back.

Naruto decides to blame Tsunade for Jiraiya's death, telling her that she shouldn't have sent him on such a dangerous mission. As he leaves, he tells Tsunade that had Jiraiya been the Fifth Hokage, he would never have sent her on the same mission. Kakashi attempts to apologise to Fukasaku for Naruto's behaviour, but the sage toad tells Kakashi that he can see that Naruto cared for and loved Jiraiya, and that he believes, more than anything after seeing how much Jiraiya meant to him, that Naruto is the
Child of the Prophecy
. As he walks home, Naruto recalls certain memories involving Jiraiya — when he
first summoned
 Gamabunta, when Jiraiya had
asked him
 to accompany him on his
search for Tsunade
, and how Jiraiya
had told him
 that Naruto reminded him of the
Fourth Hokage
. As he remembers Jiraiya giving him a popsicle stick, Naruto notices the leaves in the air and stares up at the sky, saddened.

Trivia

Tsunade
 muses how
Jiraiya
's encounter with the
Ame Orphans
 occurred during the
Third Shinobi World War
, when in actuality it was the
Second Shinobi World War
. The same error was made in
Tales of a Gutsy Ninja ~Jiraiya Ninja Scroll~ Part 1
 and
Part 2
.
