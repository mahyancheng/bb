 anime.

Synopsis

The
daimyō
 of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 gather at a fortified house where they leisurely discussed the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 and what medals to award the shinobi after the war when
Black Zetsu
 appears. Black Zetsu infiltrates the fortress to assassinate the daimyō but his attempt ends in a failure as the daimyō had been moved to a new location prior and all that was left there were wooden dummies. Surrounded by shinobi and a net, he
flees
 the premises and maintains his surveillance stating that they were underestimating him.
Mei Terumī
 and her
team
 escort the
daimyō
 of the
Land of Frost
 and assures him of his security.

Meanwhile at the coastline of the
Land of Lightning
,
Darui
 launches his assault on the enemy forces using his
Black Lightning

technique
.
Hizashi
 confronts his brother,
Hiashi
 and reiterates that his death was for the sake of the entire
Hyūga clan
 and the village despite being reincarnated and forced against his will to fight for the enemy. In the meantime,
Kankurō
 and his
division
 faces another group of reincarnated shinobi —
Chiyo
,
Hanzō
,
Kimimaro
 — who were recruited by
Chūkichi
 to provide backup to the
Surprise Attack and Diversion Platoon
. In the desert,
Shikamaru
 receives the orders from headquarters to takes half of his squad and assist Darui's division.
Temari
 was visibly perplexed as they were about to face a powerful
kekkei tōta

shinobi
.
Ōnoki
 arrives on the battlefield to assist the
Fourth Division
. Still at the coastline, Darui now faces the
Gold and Silver Brothers
:
Kinkaku
 and
Ginkaku
 and apologises for the fact that he would now have to take away their "
gold and silver
" glow even further with one strike of his
Storm Release
.
