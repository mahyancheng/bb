Exploding-Till-You-Eat
 is a father and son (
Kūi
 and
Daore
) team of competitive eaters who travel the land participating in any and all eating contests. To most onlookers, their team's name makes no sense, as the common expression is "eating-till-you-explode" (
食い倒れ
,
kūidaore
). Kūi and Daore dislike the common expression, and whenever somebody brings it up they do not acknowledge it.

The team participates in
Konohagakure
's special
Parent and Child Day
 eating competition. They are one of three teams to make it to the final round, but Daore faints from all the food he's eaten and Kūi throws up after eating
Ankorodō
's
tainted
 dumplings.

In the anime, the two instead are in league with the Ankorodō's owner, and she rigged the competition in favour of the Dōtonbori, ensuring their Lightning Burgers are not spicy, and their dumpling bowls are shallower than the Akimichi's. However,
Boruto Uzumaki
 caught on, and switched the rigged dumpling bowls to the regular ones, and ultimately, when the Ankorodō owner was exposed for her cheat, the three were scolded by
Shikamaru Nara
.
