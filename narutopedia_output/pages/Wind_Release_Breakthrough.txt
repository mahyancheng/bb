After gathering chakra in their stomach, the user expels it as a gust of wind. They can also release it as a burst of wind from their hands.
 This technique is powerful enough to blow away everything within the user's immediate vicinity. This technique can also be used for supplementary purposes, such as creating a vortex of wind to save a falling ally.
