The year he began retirement, Tadaichi was seen heading out from a Hot Springs when he ran into a
hooded individual
 asking if he was Tadaichi of Konohagakure. Tadaichi denys the question saying he is nothing but a lowly merchant. The hooded individual says that they cannot be fooled and uses a
dōjutsu
 on him.

Some time later, under the spell of an ocular technique, he was sent to attack Konoha along with those who became explosion humans.
