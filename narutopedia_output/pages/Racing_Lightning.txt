) is episode 202 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 attempts to attack
Tobi
 with his
Rasengan
, only for the attack to go
through
 him.
Yamato
 restrains Tobi with his
Wood Release
 while
Kakashi
 prepares his
Lightning Cutter
, telling Tobi that he knows that he is none other than
Madara Uchiha
. Madara reiterates that physical attacks won't work on him; however, Yamato reminds him that he would have to become tangible if he ever wishes to capture Naruto, and that he would strike when such an opportunity arises. Madara states that he has only come to talk to Naruto, wanting to know how he convinced
Nagato
 to betray him. Naruto, however, is only interested in wanting to know about
Sasuke
. Madara agrees to explain Sasuke's motives, but adds that to do so, he must first tell them the truth about
Itachi
.

Back at the summit, the
Fourth Raikage
 breaks
White Zetsu
's neck, seemingly killing him. He is admonished by the
Fifth Mizukage
 for killing off a valuable source of information, but Gaara interject stated that Akatsuki won't speak anything no matter what as the Fourth Raikage and his two subordinates,
C
 and
Darui
, decide to locate Sasuke and kill him. Before leaving, he tasks
Ao
 to keep
Danzō
 under watch, who meekly explains that he cannot use his
technique
 multiple times a day.
Mifune
 berates him for his actions, claiming that he may have actually chosen Danzō to be the leader of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, but Danzō explains that there is no time for morality and ethics in their
shinobi
 world if they wish to produce results.
Gaara
,
Kankurō
,
Temari
, and
Kurotsuchi
 decide to leave in order to find Sasuke as well.

Meanwhile, Sasuke engages in combat against the
samurai
 soldiers, easily killing them.
Suigetsu
 notices the change in Sasuke's behaviour, as Sasuke had previously been vocal about only killing when necessary, while
Karin
 is able to
sense
 the change in Sasuke's
chakra
, stating it to be more ominous than the second stage of his
cursed seal
. The Fourth Raikage, C, and Darui join the battle, with the
Raikage
 activating his
Lightning Release Chakra Mode
. Darui uses his
Lightning Release: Wave of Inspiration
 to keep Sasuke at bay while the Raikage rushes forward to attack Sasuke, only for the blow to be blocked by
Jūgo
. C uses his
Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar
 to induce a bright
genjutsu
, but Sasuke dispels it with his
Sharingan
. However, both Darui and the Raikage use the opportunity to launch an attack;
Suigetsu
 joins the fray and uses his
Kubikiribōchō
 to block Darui's
Cleaver Sword
, while Jūgo bears the brunt of the Raikage's
Elbow
.

Suigetsu's blade is broken from the clash and continues to fight Darui, who orders C to locate Karin. Using her
Chakra Suppression Technique
, Karin is able to hide, while Sasuke paralyses C with his
Genjutsu: Sharingan
 to take him out. Jūgo, who had purposely tapped into his homicidal nature and had entered into full
Sage Transformation
, tries to kill the Raikage with his
Multiple Lotus Nonself Connected Cannons
, only for the
kage
 to survive unscathed. With Jūgo being injured, Sasuke decides to face the Raikage himself.
