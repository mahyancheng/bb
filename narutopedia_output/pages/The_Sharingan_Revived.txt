Summary

Zabuza
 is forced to release
Kakashi
 in order to avoid Naruto's attack. Enraged by
Naruto
's actions, Zabuza tries to attack him, but is stopped by Kakashi. Kakashi congratulates
Team 7
 on their success and promises to start pulling his own weight. Zabuza attacks Kakashi with his
Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique
, and Kakashi instantly copies it with his
Sharingan
. As the two identical techniques collide, Zabuza prepares another attack, only to realise that Kakashi is mimicking everything he does. Kakashi attacks with Zabuza's own
Water Release: Great Waterfall Technique
, something Zabuza had only been thinking of doing. After landing the attack Kakashi prepares to finish off Zabuza, but a
masked boy
 beats him to it, seemingly to kill Zabuza.
