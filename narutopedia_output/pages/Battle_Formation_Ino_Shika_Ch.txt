possesses

, rendering both of them unable to fight. However, the

 appear to join the fight,
Sasuke
 awakens, the
Cursed Seal of Heaven
 given to him by

 engulfing his body. Noticing

 disappears and he falls to the ground. Dosu admits Sasuke's strength, leaves their scroll and retreats while carrying his teammates, vowing to not run away next time they meet.
