The Konoha Strict Correctional Facility.



The
Konoha Strict Correctional Facility
 (
木ノ葉厳重警戒施設
,
Konoha Genjū Keikai Shisetsu
), which only appeared in the
anime
, is a place where
shinobi
 who have committed serious crimes work off their debt to society.

Overview

In the past, when inmates were plentiful, the prison used to be under the name of
Ninja Prison for Capital Offenses and Felonies
 (
重犯罪忍者専門刑務
,
Jūhanzai Ninja Senmon Keimu
). However, due to reduced crime rate and intensity, the prison was rebuilt into a smaller facility and renamed. The prison is a
shiro
 built in the centre of a volcanic area on a triangular island (akin to a kunai shape), with a long
Bascule bridge
 to connect to the watch-house and the castle. There is a large, exercise area on the front of the island, where prisoners are made to dig through the soil as "character building". Inmates are dressed in grey tunic with their prisoner numbers labelled on the backs.

The prison houses murderers and
missing-nin
 who have broken the law, and are guarded by Konoha shinobi. Known inmates of this facility are
Mizuki
,
Fūjin
 and
Raijin
. Mizuki manipulated the two brothers to help him break out, leading to a huge riot where all the prisoners escaped after taking the guards as hostages. However, all the prisoners were recaptured shortly (Fūjin and Raijin were duped into returning by
Tsunade
).

Fūjin and Raijin were actually too powerful in terms of physical strength to be contained in the prison, as they can easily bend the bars and overpower the guards. It is the jailers' control over the food supplies that keep the two prisoners in check.

Trivia

Mizuki
 claimed having spent an entire year in the dark and damp facility, he has managed to learn the
Silent Killing
, his eyes being able to attune to the darkness and move seamlessly through it.

Izumo Kamizuki
 and
Kotetsu Hagane
 both worked as guards here.
