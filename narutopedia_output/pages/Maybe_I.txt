Lyrics

Rōmaji

Sometimes it's hard to say goodbye doushite

Maybe I, Maybe I hitori ga kowai kara

Sometimes it's hard to see the stars doushite

Maybe I, Maybe I boyaketa shikai ga

Mitasarezu ikiba o ushinatta kokoro

Mitsuketa saisho de saigo no boku no kibou wa

When the cruelest world falls on me now

I'll never be afraid

Cause I know my hope's unchanged

Mieta hikari ga kasuka demo

Sono saki e susumi tsuzuketai

Maybe I, Maybe I, Maybe I, yeah

Maybe I, Maybe I, Maybe I, yeah

Tatta ichido dake sakebu yo

I can!

Kanji

Sometimes it’s hard to say good bye どうして？

Maybe I, Maybe I 一人が怖いから

Sometimes it’s hard to see the stars どうして？

Maybe I, Maybe I ぼやけた視界が

満たされず行き場を失った心

見つけた最初で最後の希望は

When the cruelest world falls on me now

I’ll never be afraid

Cause I know my hope’s unchanged

見えた光が微かでも

その先へ進み続けたい

Maybe I, Maybe I, Maybe I

Maybe I, Maybe I, Maybe I

たった一度だけ叫ぶよ

I CAN

Rōmaji (Full Version)

Sometimes it's hard to say goodbye doushite

Maybe I, Maybe I hitori ga kowai kara

Sometimes it's hard to see the stars doushite

Maybe I, Maybe I boyaketa shikai ga

Mitasarezu ikiba o ushinatta kokoro

Mitsuketa saisho de saigo no boku no kibou wa

When the cruelest world falls on me now

I'll never be afraid

Cause I know my hope's unchanged

Mieta hikari ga kasuka demo

Sono saki e susumi tsuzuketai

Maybe I, Maybe I, Maybe I, yeah

Maybe I, Maybe I, Maybe I, yeah

Tatta ichido dake sakebu yo

I can!

Suddely I found myself in a beautiful crowd

Maybe I, Maybe I hitori janai nda

GYUtto tsunagiatta te no hira

Run and run, Run and run tomo ni kakeru asa

Kujikesou de tachidomari kakete mo

Furimukeba sou kimi ga soba ni ite kureru

When the cruelest world falls on me now

I'll never be afraid

Cause I'm not chasing it alone

Mieta hikari ga kasuka demo

Sono saki wa bokura no tame ni aru

Maybe I, Maybe I, Maybe I, yeah

Maybe I, Maybe I, Maybe I, yeah

Tatta hitokoto tsutae you

I can!

Nobody can beat me up

I'll be fine

Nobody can see me cry

Cause I'm with you

When the cruelest world falls on me now

I'll never be afraid

Cause I know my hope's unchanged

Mieta hikari ga kasuka demo

Sono saki e susumi tsuzuketai

Maybe I, Maybe I, Maybe I, yeah

Maybe I, Maybe I, Maybe I, yeah

Tatta ichido dake sakebu yo

We can!

Kanji (Full Version)

Sometimes it’s hard to say good bye　どうして？

Maybe I, Maybe I　一人が怖いから

Sometimes it’s hard to see the stars　どうして？

Maybe I, Maybe I　ぼやけた視界が

満たされず行き場を失った心

見つけた最初で最後の僕の希望は

When the cruelest world falls on me now

I’ll never be afraid

Cause I know my hope’s unchanged

見えた光がかすかでも　その先へ進み続けたい

Maybe I, Maybe I, Maybe I

Maybe I, Maybe I, Maybe I

たった一度だけ叫ぶよ

I CAN

Suddenly I found myself in a beautiful crowd

Maybe I Maybe I　一人じゃないんだ

ぎゅっと繋ぎあった手のひら

Run and run, Run and run共に駆ける朝

挫けそうで立ち止まりかけても

振り向けば そう君がそばいてくれる

When the cruelest world falls on me now

I’ll never be afraid

Cause I’m not chasing it alone

見えた光がかすかでも　その先は僕等のためにある

Maybe I, Maybe I, Maybe I

Maybe I, Maybe I, Maybe I

たった一言伝えよう

I CAN

Nobody can beat me up

I’ll be fine

Nobody can see me cry

Cause I’m with you

When the cruelest world falls on me now

I’ll never be afraid

Cause I know my hope’s unchanged

見えた光がかすかでも その先へ進み続けたい

Maybe I, Maybe I, Maybe I

Maybe I, Maybe I, Maybe I

たった一度だけ叫ぶよ

WE CAN

English (Full Version)

Sometimes it's hard to say goodbye, why?

Maybe I, maybe I'm afraid of being alone

Sometimes it's hard to see the stars, why?

Maybe I, maybe I, the blurred world

The unfilled heart lost its way

My first and last hope I found

When the cruelest world falls on me now

I'll never be afraid

Cause I know my hope's unchanged

Even though the light I found is dim, I want to step forward

Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I, yeah

Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I, yeah

I'll shout just once: I can!

Suddenly I found myself in a beautiful crowd

Maybe I, maybe I'm not alone

We are holding hands together

Run and run, run and run, the morning we run together

Although I got discouraged and almost stop

When I look back, you're by my side

When the cruelest world falls on me now

I'll never be afraid

Cause I'm not chasing it alone

Even though the light I found is dim, what lies ahead is there for us

Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I, yeah

Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I, yeah

Let me tell you just one thing:L: I can!

Nobody can beat me up

I'll be fine

Nobody can see me cry

Cause I'm with you

When the cruelest world falls on me now

I'll never be afraid

Cause I know my hope's unchanged

Even though the light I found is dim, I want to step forward

Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I, yeah

Maybe I, maybe I, maybe I, yeah

I'll shout just once: We can!
