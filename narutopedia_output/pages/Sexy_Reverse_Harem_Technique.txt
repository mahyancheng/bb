A technique created by
Naruto Uzumaki
, and a variation of the
Harem Technique
.

Usage

Naruto creates several
shadow clones
 and
transforms
 them into attractive naked men. While not threatening, it was able to temporarily distract
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 long enough for Naruto to land a surprise attack on her.

Trivia

During his battle with Kaguya, Naruto claims to have been practising this technique in secret, even more than the
Rasengan
.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
, Sai joins Naruto in performing this technique and the two also force Sasuke to participate. Against most women, the technique knocks out the opponent immediately, but against men, Kaguya and other kunoichi, it distracts them long enough for Sasuke to launch an
attack
 from behind the others.
