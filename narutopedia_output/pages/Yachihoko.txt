This article is about the
dōjutsu
 used by
Nanashi Uchiha
. For

Yachihoko no Kami
.

Yachihoko
 is a
Mangekyō Sharingan

dōjutsu
.

Overview

Tied to the usage of her
Engraved Tsukuyomi
, it allows Nanashi to control the mind and the chakra of any individual linked with an Engraved Tsukuyomi branding. Yachihoko is a powerful Genjutsu, and works by erasing the memories of any individual it targets, creating puppets that Nanashi is able to manipulate. The Genjutsu itself is powerful enough that even a perfect
Jinchūriki
, such as
Naruto Uzumaki
, was unable to have it dispelled by his
Tailed Beast
,
Kurama
.

Yachihoko also allows for the manipulation of chakra from to and from the user via those marked with the Engraved Tsukuyomi blemish. Merz was able to absorb the chakra of a vast portion of the Shinobi World using Yachihoko. Additionally, Nanashi could transfer chakra this way, giving it to Boruto on two occasions to allow him to fight.

Influence

Like other Mangekyō Sharingan abilities, this one takes its name from ancient Japanese myth. Yachihoko-no-Kami (
八千矛神
 or
八千戈神
, lit. "God of Eight Thousand Spears") is a name adopted in the
Kojiki
 by the Shintō god
Ōkuninushi
 (
大国主
), the head of the
kunitsukami
 who governs the earth, nation-building, and agriculture, among other domains.
