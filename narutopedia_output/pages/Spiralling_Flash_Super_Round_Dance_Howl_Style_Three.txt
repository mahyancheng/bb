This technique was devised by Minato Namikaze and employs the use of the Flying Thunder God Technique.

Usage

Minato throws six
Flying Thunder God Kunai
 behind the enemy, and teleports to them. The technique can also be used with the help of a
shadow clone
, though this is not a compulsory component of the technique's execution.
 It should be noted that this technique has never been seen in its entirety.

In the anime, the usage of the technique was enough to defeat an entire platoon of shinobi. Though it was not seen directly, it produced a lightning flash and repelled the enemies with great force. It also seems to require the kunai to be placed in a circular pattern, a possible reference to its name.
