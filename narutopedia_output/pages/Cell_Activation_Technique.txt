This technique was engineered by Tsunade after observing
Kabuto Yakushi
's
Yin Healing Wound Destruction
 technique.

Overview

Used only in the most dire of surgical procedures to increase the patient's survival rate, if even only by a single percentage, this technique employs a great level of refined
chakra
 control to activate all the cells in the patient's body simultaneously. This causes their body to start repairing itself while the
medical-nin
 is operating; restoring damaged tissues and bone structures while healing the patient during more invasive and delicate procedures. With this technique, Tsunade was able to increase
Rock Lee
's surgery success rate from 50% to 58%.
