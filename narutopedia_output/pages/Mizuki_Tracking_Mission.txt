Summary





Mizuki makes his return.



Ready to begin his three year training with
Jiraiya
,
Naruto
 was furious to learn that Jiraiya was ordered by
Tsunade
 to go gather information instead for awhile. After Jiraiya managed to sneak away from Naruto, he decided to talk directly to Tsunade. Naruto, who was spying on one of Tsunade's Hokage meetings, discovered that
Mizuki
 not only had escaped from prison, but had a connection to Orochimaru. Seeing this as another chance to find
Sasuke
, Naruto went off to look for Mizuki and met up with
Iruka
. Eventually, Naruto found Mizuki and was horrified at how much stronger Mizuki looked now. Iruka had Naruto fight against the
Legendary Stupid Brothers
 while Iruka faced off against Mizuki.

After being completely overpowered by the two brothers' insane raw strength, Naruto was saved by
Team 10
, who took over the battle so Naruto could aid Iruka. Along the way, Naruto met Mizuki's former lover
Tsubaki
. With her help, Naruto and Iruka found Mizuki's hideout, where it was discovered that Mizuki was given instructions for a special performance enhancing drug. Meanwhile Team 10 is almost defeated since the two brothers are too powerful, but Tsunade comes to their aid and convinces them that Mizuki tricked them and that they should head back to the prison. After consuming the drug, Mizuki became a behaemoth of his former self and completely overpowered Naruto and Iruka. After discovering that Mizuki's speed was rapidly declining from pouring more chakra into his raw strength, Naruto and Iruka were able to defeat Mizuki with a well-timed manoeuvre that ended with a
Rasengan
.

After Mizuki was interrogated, it was discovered that he unfortunately had no knowledge of Orochimaru's whereabouts.
