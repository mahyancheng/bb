"
Akatsuki's Invasion
" (
“暁”侵攻
,
Akatsuki Shinkō
) is episode 73 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Hidan
 finishes his
Jashin
 ritual,
Zetsu
 arrives to take the unconscious
Yugito Nii
 back to the
Akatsuki
 base. Zetsu berates them for taking their time, which Hidan blames on his partner
Kakuzu
, who is often performing side deals. Kakuzu states that as the one in charge of Akatsuki's finances, money is the most important thing in life, and claims that he only agreed to be Hidan's partner when he was told that religion could be profitable. As Zetsu leaves with Yugito, Hidan and Kakuzu set off towards the
Land of Fire
 to find themselves another
jinchūriki
.

Back in
Konoha
,
Naruto
 is discharged from the
hospital
 and is ready to resume his training. When
Yamato
 and
Kakashi
 ask him to review over what he learned so far, Naruto uses his
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 to create shadow clones and has them all perform the leaf cutting technique. However, he faints after he dispels all of them and gains their cumulative fatigue.

Kakuzu goes on a detour and brings Hidan to the
Fire Temple
 while searching for the Land of Fire's jinchūriki. Using his
Earth Release: Earth Spear
, Kakuzu breaks down the
Sealed Iron Wall
 of the temple. Inside, the monks alert
Chiriku
 about the Akatsuki's invasion. Kakuzu recognises Chiriku as a monk who possesses the
Gift of the Hermit Group
's
chakra
 and has a 30 million bounty on his head. Kakuzu and Hidan go for the attack, but Chiriku uses his
Welcoming Approach: Thousand-Armed Murder
, the ultimate technique of the Fire Temple, to block and counter all of their attacks. As Chiriku promises them a funeral, Hidan is outraged at the idea of his funeral rites being presided over by another religion, and receives Kakuzu's blessing to kill Chiriku, although he stipulates that Chiriku be recognisable at the end in order to claim the bounty. The notion of killing humans for money is found despicable by Hidan, but he nonetheless charges at Chiriku with his
Triple-Bladed Scythe
.

As Naruto wakes up, Kakashi explains that the next stage would be to complete his
nature transformation
 by converting his chakra into wind and stopping the flow of a waterfall. Yamato uses his
Wood Release
 to fashion a bridge; using his shadow clones, Naruto stands on the bridge and attempts to slice the flow of the waterfall, recalling
Asuma
's advice. Unbeknownst to him, both
Sai
 and
Sakura
 are witnessing his training from the woods.

At the Fire Temple, Hidan is finishing his Jashin ritual, having killed Chiriku and nearly every other monk, save for
Sentoki
, who decides to report the massacre to Konoha. Kakuzu takes Chiriku's body before Hidan could finish his ritual and heads to the
Land of Fire Bounty Station
 to claim his 30 million. Hidan takes his
Retractable Spear
 out of his torso, grimacing in pain, as he follows Kakuzu.

Back at the waterfall, Yamato is in place using his
Wood Release: Foo Dog Heads
 to suppress the
Nine-Tails
' chakra, should it ever leak. Kakashi is lying on a wooden bench fashioned by Yamato, reading his
Icha Icha
 book. Naruto asks for a shortcut, even asking to create more shadow clones, but Kakashi tells him that there isn't any more space left on the bridge to create shadow clones. Yamato tells Naruto that he has exceeded their expectations, as it would normally take one six months to master leaf cutting while he perfected it in mere hours. Kakashi adds that even
Sasuke
 took a few days to undergo his nature transformation so he could convert his chakra into
lightning
 in order to use
Chidori
. Naruto states that Sasuke is the very person he needs to catch up to; grabbing wind of Naruto's determination, Kakashi instructs Yamato to create two more waterfalls and extend the bridge, allowing Naruto to create more multiple shadow clones in order to accelerate his training.
