First, Hinata hits her opponent, throwing them in the air, then she jumps high in the sky and performs a giant
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
, creating a massive rotating sphere of chakra that crushes the enemy into the ground. Finally, Hinata stops rotating and lands in the centre of the huge crater, created by the
chakra
 sphere.

Though the English video game refers to this technique as 'Eight Trigrams Sky Palm', it is not to be confused with the
Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm
 technique.
