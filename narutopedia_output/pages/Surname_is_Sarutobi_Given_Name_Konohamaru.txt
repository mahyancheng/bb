"
Surname is Sarutobi, Given Name, Konohamaru
" (
姓は猿飛、名は木ノ葉丸!
,
Sei wa Sarutobi, Na wa Konohamaru!
) is episode 161 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Team Ebisu
 notices the damage being wrought on their village by
Pain
, while
Konohamaru
 decides to join the battle using a new technique that
Naruto
 had taught him. Shortly after
Shikamaru

had told him
 that it was time for him to start being a teacher, Naruto decided to teach Konohamaru the
Rasengan
. As Naruto began explaining the three-part process, Konohamaru initially believed it to be a new
Sexy Technique
; Naruto, however, told him that it was a powerful, A-ranked technique.
Moegi
 and
Udon
, however, convince Konohamaru not to enter the fray and that as
genin
, they should simply evacuate the villagers to a safe shelter, prompting Konohamaru to recall when he was among those
being evacuated
 during the
Konoha Crush
.

As he helps rescue an old lady from the rubble, Konohamaru witnesses two
chūnin
 being attacked by the
Naraka Path
, who interrogates them regarding Naruto's whereabouts and proceeds to
rip the tongues
 out of those who are withholding information. After accidentally revealing his location, the Naraka Path begins to close in on him. Konohamaru's sensei,
Ebisu
, engages in combat against Pain in order to give Konohamaru time to escape. Konohamaru is unable to move out of fear and witness his master being defeated by Pain, who threatens to kill Ebisu if he does not disclose information about Naruto. Ebisu tells Pain that when he
first met
 Naruto, he thought of him as someone who would interfere with Konohamaru's training, only for Naruto to prove himself as a
shinobi
 who could impart lessons to Konohamaru that he could not, and that he would not divulge anything about a fellow Konoha shinobi to Pain. Pain decides to kill Ebisu for his silence, but Konohamaru saves him by throwing
kunai
 at the Naraka Path's arm.

The Naraka Path is easily able to subdue Konohamaru, and summons the King of Hell in order to extract information about Naruto. However, Konohamaru reveals himself to be nothing more than a
shadow clone
 as the real Konohamaru, along with another shadow clone, rushes at the Naraka Path and strikes him in the gut with Rasengan, leaving Ebisu shocked and surprised as to how and when Konohamaru learned such a technique. Konohamaru then tells the Naraka Path that his name is Konohamaru Sarutobi and to never forget it.

Back at
Mount Myōboku
, Naruto attempts to run while gathering
natural energy
 in order to test whether he can activate
Sage Mode
 when on the move, only to fail.
Fukasaku
 tells him apologetically that the method would never work and claims that Sage Mode is not for everyone. After seeing the message
Jiraiya
 left on Fukasaku's back, Naruto tells him that it was also a message from Jiraiya telling Naruto to never give up. Fukasaku attempts to explain that the impossible simply cannot be done, comparing it to looking left and right at the same time. Naruto is stunned when he hears those words and exclaims that there is a way after all.

Trivia

In this episode,
Naruto
 is shown teaching the
Rasengan
 to
Konohamaru
 after deciphering
Jiraiya
's code, since
Shikamaru
 told him it was time they became teachers. However, in a
future episode
, it is revealed that Naruto had begun to teach Konohamaru the technique sometime after the
Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission
.

In the beginning of the episode, after Konohamaru separated from his team, several missiles, not unlike those produced by the
Asura Path
, were seen flying and destroying a building. This is likely a mistake, as the Asura Path was dispatched in an earlier episode and no other Path displayed the ability to produce missiles.
