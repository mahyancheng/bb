Indra's Arrow
 is Sasuke Uchiha's strongest offensive technique.

Usage

After absorbing chakra from all nine
tailed beasts
 and using his
Complete Body — Susanoo
 as a vessel, Sasuke creates a longbow and arrow that are infused with lightning-natured chakra. It proved to be extremely powerful, able to match
Naruto Uzumaki
's
Six Paths: Ultra-Big Ball Rasenshuriken
 despite Lightning Release's inferiority to Wind Release.

Influence

This technique draws influence from Hinduism, where
Indra
, the god of thunder and wars, used a rainbow as a bow to fire arrows made of lightning; the thunderbolt is also said to be given the name Vajra, which is synonymous with diamond or adamantine in a Japanese context.

Trivia

This technique derives its name from
Indra Ōtsutsuki
, the ancestor of the
Uchiha clan
 and, in the manga, the first user of Susanoo.

In
Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
, Indra performs a similar variation, creating a spear of electricity.
