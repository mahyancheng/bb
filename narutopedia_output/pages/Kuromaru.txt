Kuromaru
 (
黒丸
) is a
ninken
 from
Konohagakure
's
Inuzuka clan
 and
Tsume Inuzuka
's partner.

Appearance

Kuromaru is an adult canine with a
wolfish
 appearance. As his name suggests, he has black fur with a white underside. He most closely resembles a Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf. He is missing his left ear and wears an
eyepatch
 over his right eye. He appears to have grown much larger in Part II than when he was seen in his brief Part I appearance.

Abilities






Kuromaru and Tsume attack the Preta Path.



As an Inuzuka ninken, Kuromaru uses
collaborative
 attacks alongside his partner Tsume. He is also well versed in the clan's techniques, such as the
Fang Passing Fang
, which he used with enough skill to cause extensive damage to the corpse of the first
Animal Path
 during the invasion of Pain.

Out of all the Inuzuka ninken, Kuromaru is the only one that has displayed the ability to talk.

Tsume and Kuromaru confront the Preta Path.



During
Pain's assault
 on Konoha, as
Pain
's
Preta Path
 prepared to dispose of the previous Animal Path, Kuromaru and
Tsume Inuzuka
 found him in one of the morgues. The duo drop a canned
flash bomb
 and attacked it with their
Fang Passing Fang
 technique. The Preta Path, however, used the corpse of the old Animal Path as a shield and avoided the attack clinging to the roof of the building. As Tsume states that their intel was right on the mark, as this one seemed to dislike physical combat, she and Kuromaru prepares to attack again.
Kiba
 and
Akamaru
 joined them in the battle, and Akamaru
marks
 the Preta Path before escaping through a broken window but Tsume mounts Kuromaru and the two pursue him, but the Preta Path was
summoned
 away before Pain
destroyed the village
. Kuromaru survived the attack unharmed, and he and his partner were later seen celebrating Naruto's victory over Pain.
