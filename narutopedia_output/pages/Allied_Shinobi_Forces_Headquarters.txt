The Allied Shinobi Forces' Headquarters.



When the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 was formed, its headquarters was designated to be in the vicinity of
Kumogakure
 for ease of command over the course of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. Originally, members of the Five
Kage
, including
Tsunade
,
Ōnoki
, and
A
, due to the fact that he was the Supreme Commander of the Alliance, were stationed there to help with command decisions and battle plans. Both the
Intelligence Division
 and
Sensor Division
 were stationed in the headquarters so that they could give crucial intelligence and sensor reports to the various divisions through the
Sensing Water Sphere
 that
Inoichi Yamanaka
 and
Ao
 had created. The Alliance's Chief Strategist,
Shikaku Nara
, was also stationed at the headquarters, where he came up with plans to counter
Kinkaku
 and
Ginkaku
, as well as
Asuma Sarutobi
 and the
White Zetsu Army
's threat.

In the latter stages of the War, after the remaining Kage gathered to fight the
reincarnated

Madara Uchiha
, Shikaku was left in command. When it came to fight the
Ten-Tails
 itself, Shikaku commanded each part of the army seamlessly, immobilising the Ten-Tails' initial form and leaving the freshly unmasked
Obito Uchiha
 as well as his partner, Madara, vulnerable to counter-attack.
 Ultimately though, when the Ten-Tails reached its second form, the headquarters was wiped out by its massively powerful and long ranged
Tailed Beast Ball
, but not before
transmitting
 Shikaku's final
strategy
 to the Alliance.
 Ao was the sole survivor, losing his left arm and leg.
