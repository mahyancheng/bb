The
Rinne Festival
 (
輪廻祭
,
Rinne Matsuri
,
literally meaning:
 Saṃsāra Festival) is a winter holiday celebrated in
Konohagakure
 and possibly other parts of the
world
. Originally a time for praying for the deceased, the Rinne Festival has since evolved into a holiday where friends and loved ones exchange gifts.

Within the
moon
, the Rinne Festival coincides with the time of the year where the floating island — the temple of
Hamura Ōtsutsuki
 — comes near
Toneri Ōtsutsuki
's castle. That time is also called the "Rebirth Festival" (
転生祭
,
Tensei Matsuri
).

Trivia

The Rinne Festival is similar to the real-world holiday,
Christmas
. In
Naruto SD: Rock Lee no Seishun Full-Power Ninden
 and
Sasuke Uchiha's Sharingan Legend
, Christmas is the winter holiday celebrated.
