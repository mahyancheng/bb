Summary

The War Commences





The Ambush Squads battle.



The first battle to happen in the war began when
Kankurō
 and the
Surprise Attack Division
 find
Muta Aburame
, a member of Anko's search team. However, what the division did not know was that Muta was captured by Kabuto's
Surprise Attack and Diversion Platoon
 and has been placed under
Sasori
's
control
 with his insect jar filled with
Deidara
's
Explosive Clay
. Though
Zaji
 almost got himself killed to save who he thought was an injured comrade despite Muta pleading him not to come closer, Kankurō quickly saved Zaji.
Ittan
 then gets them to safety by
lowering the ground
 before Deidara detonated the explosive clay and killed Muta. In response, Sasori sends Muta's fellow enslaved team-mates
Ranka
 and
Tokuma Hyūga
 to attack as
Shin
 and Deidara emerge from hiding with Kankurō correctly deducing that Sasori was with them and behind the initial attacks.

Vowing to make the Akatsuki pay for pitting them against their friends,
Omoi
 launches himself to Deidara, but the attack is revealed to a
feint
 as his intended target was the
chakra strings
 controlling Ranka and Tokuma. Kankurō then quickly attached his own chakra strings with Sasori's to pull him down while telling Ittan to raise the ground. Now exposed, Sasori uses Shin as a puppet as the Allied ninja realised the deceased
Root
 ninja is stuffed with explosives with Kankurō and Omoi managing to contain the explosion. Furious that brother was used as a bomb, Sai knocked down Sasori and Deidara, who were
captured
 by Kankurō. After seeing the picture finished in Sai's picture book, Shin's ties to the world were severed and he could pass on, breaking the summoning bind. Chūkichi was returning to reinforce Deidara and Sasori. Sasori is then released from the summoning thanks to Kankurō telling him he was immortalised by the puppets he created. With the new found information about release the reincarnated ninja by freeing the soul, Kankurō prepares his team to launch their ambush.

Elsewhere,
Tobi
 meets up with Kabuto, who managed to defeat and capture
Anko Mitarashi
. Though sensing Sasori and Shin's release from his technique, Kabuto still has a good feeling about how things are going according to plan as he tells Tobi to go ahead to the front lines while he stays hidden and focuses on his technique. Gazing at Anko, Tobi realises that Kabuto led her near his location in the hopes that he and
Allied Shinobi Forces
 would take each other out. However, though Kabuto believes he is using him, Tobi quietly states that it is vice-versa.

The Seven Swordsmen Reunited





Naruto trying to form the Tailed Beast Rasengan.



Killer B attempts to teach Naruto how to use the
Tailed Beast Ball
, but Naruto cannot turn into the
Nine-Tails
 because his bond with it is weak. The
Eight-Tails
 then explained to Naruto that whenever he uses the Nine-Tails'
chakra
 he stocks his own and the Nine-Tails can steal it, in the end Naruto could lose it all and die if he uses the chakra constantly, and using
shadow clones
 speeds up the process, making them useless. The Eight-Tails explained that he and B were able to compromise on how much chakra each would take from the other, eliminating the risk. Naruto decides to focus on his own skills with the Nine-Tails chakra, trying to perform the Rasengan using the fox's chakra shroud to make extra hands in lieu of shadow clones. Killer B notices the technique is similar to the Tailed Beast Ball, and upon learning it was created by the
Fourth Hokage
, he tells Naruto to keep on working on it.





The previous generation of the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist reincarnated.



While the Surprise Attack Division were waiting for the incoming enemy force, they encountered
Zabuza Momochi
,
Haku
 and two other ninja:
Gari
 of
Iwagakure
's
Explosion Corps
 and
Pakura
 from
Sunagakure
. Haku was able to
defend
 against the first attack and then
attacks
 once he and the other reincarnated shinobi quickly realised their invincibility. When he and his
Third Division
 arrive to stop them from killing,
Kakashi
 engages Zabuza and Haku in brief chat over the two ninjas' impact on Naruto until Kabuto renders Zabuza's group into mindless killing machines to begin the attack. Though Kakashi said he got an idea of how to counter, Kabuto does not give him time to enact it as he has Gari and Pakura summon Zabuza's reincarnated team mates from his days as a member of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
.

Though only most of them having their traditional blades, Zabuza's
Hiding in Mist Technique
 enables them to slaughter about a dozen more Allied shinobi. Kakashi developed a plan involving
Ensui Nara
,
Santa Yamanaka
 and
Maki
 to trap Zabuza and end his Hiding in Mist Technique. However, Haku once more acts as a human shield for Zabuza, holding Kakashi in place so Zabuza can slash through them both. Kakashi survived being slashed and immediately countered, allowing Maki to immobilise the recovering Haku and Zabuza. Though the
Hiding in Mist Technique
 ended as he planned, Kakashi expresses his rage about how Impure World Reincarnation is used in such unforgivable matter.

In the Land of Lightning, Gaara picks up the presence of Second Tsuchikage
Mū
 with
Concealed Sand Picture Cat
. Kabuto decides to have Mū summon the reincarnated
Second Mizukage
,
Third Raikage
 and
Fourth Kazekage
, the four curious of how they are even alive. The Fourth Kazekage explains to his fellow Kage that they were brought back by Impure World Reincarnation, detailing the technique's history while speculating their reincarnation to be
Orochimaru
's doing before noticing that they are all being
watched
 by his son.
Ao
 informs the Kage of the reincarnation of both their predecessors and famed powerful shinobi such as the
Gold and Silver Brothers
 of Kumo. Enraged upon hearing of his father and his village's two infamous traitors being among the reincarnated,
A
 decides to enter the battlefield but
Tsunade
 keeps him from doing so.
Shikaku Nara
 formulates battle plans with portions of the
Second
,
Fourth
 and
Fifth Divisions
 to assist the
First Division
 which the Raikage approves.

Elsewhere, arriving to what appears to be the hideaway of the countries'
daimyō
,
Black Zetsu
 makes his move to take them but ends up alerting the guarding shinobi with the daimyō revealed to hidden elsewhere. Black Zetsu escapes from the guards and continues his objective.
Mei Terumī
 and
Chōjūrō
 accompany the
Frost Daimyō
 while he is escorted to the safe house while putting him at ease that the repeated moving of the daimyō from one safe house to another to hinder the enemy's search for them.

Clash of Wills






Darui begins the assault on the enemy forces.



At the Land of Lightning's Coast,
Chōza Akimichi
 confronts
Dan
 and
Asuma Sarutobi
 while
Hiashi Hyūga
 confronts his reincarnated brother,
Hizashi Hyūga
.
Darui
 reluctantly decides to take on
Kinkaku
 and
Ginkaku
, the treacherous
Gold and Silver Brothers
 who betrayed
Kumogakure
 in life, with
Samui
 and her brother
Atsui
 aiding him. However, the brothers unveil the
Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths
. A informs Tsunade that Kinkaku and Ginkaku are able to use
Sage of Six Paths
' tools as they ingested some Nine-Tails's chakra during a failed attempt to captured the unsealed tailed beast long ago.






Darui battling Kinkaku and Ginkaku.



When Kinkaku tackles Atsui and Samui with the
Kōkinjō
, Ginkaku severs their pulled word souls with the
Shichiseiken
 and placed them in the
Benihisago
. The siblings try to keep themselves quiet so not to use their most spoken word to get sucked into the Benihisago, but Atsui gets sealed once tricked into saying "hot" by Kinkaku creating a
wave of fire
 with the
Bashōsen
. Ginkaku holds Samui hostage to have Darui drop his weapon, only to slice Kinkaku's arm and aims his
Storm Release: Laser Circus
 on Ginkaku to free Samui. But as Kinkaku kicks his sliced arm wrapped with Kōkinjō at him to pull out his soul word, Darui is horrified to find Samui sealed despite her silence and that he will suffer her fate if silent for too long. Though he knew not to say it, his attempt to defend against the brothers' notion that he is pawn of the Raikage forced Darui to say a word that has a similar pronunciation to "dull". Luckily, he manages to escape the sealing when his apology habit changed his most spoken from "dull" to "sorry".






The Gold and Silver brothers sealed.



Knocking Ginkaku into the Kōkinjō while commandeered both the Shichiseiken and the Benihisago, Darui uses the Ginkaku's most used word, "Kinkaku", to seal him away. This causes Kinkaku to assume a six-tailed pseudo-jinchūriki form to demolish the First Division, with A seeing the only way to stop the rampaging monster is to seal him in the only item of the Sage of Six Paths Kumo managed to keep from the brothers: the
Kohaku no Jōhei
.
Mabui
 uses her
Heavenly Transfer Technique
 to send Darui the sealing pot while receiving aid from
Shikamaru Nara
,
Chōji Akimichi
 and
Ino Yamanaka
 as they use their
Formation Ino–Shika–Chō
 to restrain Kinkaku long enough for Darui to seal him in the Kohaku no Jōhei.






Mifune and Hanzō clash.



At the Land of Hot Water, Chūkichi receives back-up from a team consisting of
Hanzō
,
Chiyo
, and
Kimimaro
 to fight the Surprise Attack Division. Hearing their arrival, with Deidara demanding his allies to save him, Kankurō's team attempt to fall back when Hanzō summons his salamander
Ibuse
 to paralyse Surprise Attack Division. Hanzō is stopped from killing Kankurō by the arrival of his old enemy
Mifune
 and his division. Mifune fights Hanzō, impeding him of using ninjutsu by attacking when he stops to weave hand seals. He remembers having fought Hanzō in his youth, and the two discuss their ideals during the fight. Hanzō decides to have faith in Mifune, and injures himself, creating an opening, and allowing Mifune's division to seal him.






Chōji preparing to fight Asuma.



Back on the Land of Lightning's coast, Darui,
Izumo Kamizuki
 and
Kotetsu Hagane
 go against Kakuzu and his heart monsters while Team Asuma fights their reincarnated teacher. However, while noting his students' growth, Asuma uses his
Wind Release: Dust Cloud Technique
 on a hesitant Chōji before Ino saves him. Despite Asuma's words for him to fight back, Chōji could not attack his mentor as Ino
takes control
 of his body to fight in her team-mate's place. After being saved by his father and reminded of the
oath
 forged among the Ino-Shika-Chō groups. Encouraged to fight without holding back, Chōji creates
butterfly wings
 without the assistance of his clan's pills to others' amazement. Ino
controls
 White Zetsu clones to hold Asuma long enough for Chōji and Shikamaru to
hit
 and
immobilise
 him. Before being sealed, Asuma thanks them and compliments them of their great teamwork. Chōji asks his team-mates to help him finish the war once and for all to which they happily agree.

Escaping Jinchūriki and the Fall of Night






Naruto's guards bar the way.



Back at the Island Turtle, while training, Naruto suddenly sensed the Nine-Tails' chakra within the rampaging six-tailed Kinkaku far away from the temple. Wanting to investigate, Naruto was able to trick Killer B into letting him out but is confronted by
Shibi Aburame
 and a team of
Konoha
 ninja who try to persuade to explain what is happening back inside the temple. Despite
Iruka Umino
's attempted lie, Naruto assumes
Sage Mode
 to force his way out of the Falls of Truth, getting caught in a Nara clan ninja's Shadow Imitation Technique before sensing the chakra of his friends and other ninja fighting. Having no choice, Iruka tells Naruto the truth that
Tobi
 has declared war and reveals that they have been instructed to protect Naruto and Killer B from Tobi. After remembering his talk with Nagato, Naruto tells Iruka that his role is to stop the war and that he will endure the pain on his own. Despite Iruka's insistence, Naruto reminds his mentor that he was the first to recognise him for more than a jinchūriki and gave him his first forehead protector. Iruka stares down at the forehead protector and hands it to Naruto before using a
barrier technique
 that is countered with his former student's Nine-Tails chakra. As Naruto puts his forehead protector back on, he finds a hidden note slips out from Iruka telling him to come back alive. Emerging from the Falls of Truth, B follows Naruto to keep him safe.






Daimyō protection squad faces Black Zetsu.



Black Zetsu manages to find the location of the daimyō but finds himself fighting
Mei Terumī
 and
Daimyō Protection Squad
. However, sensing Naruto and Killer B breaking out of the
Self-Repairing Barrier
 covering the Island Turtle, Black Zetsu informs White Zetsu of the jinchūriki's escape. With this new information, Tobi deems the need to have the daimyō as bargaining chips for the jinchūriki no longer needed and decides to enter the front lines while giving Black Zetsu new orders to use guerilla tactics on Mei's group.






The Demonic Statue of the Outer Path is summoned into the battlefield.



Arriving to the Land of Lightning's coast as Darui and Kitsuchi's divisions have defeated all the White Zetsu and sealed most the reincarnated ninja, Kakuzu included, Tobi summons the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
. As the statue fights Chōza, Chōji, and the other the allied shinobi, Tobi uses the opportunity to obtain the Benihisago and Kohaku no Jōhei, containing the sealed Gold and Silver Brothers. Shikamaru realises Tobi actually set the event of the brothers' sealing, Tobi taking his prize as Shikamaru and Darui are saved from the statue by Chōji and Kitsuchi before it vanished. Learning of Tobi and the Demonic Statue's appearances on the battlefield along with Naruto and B leaving the Island Turtle, A leaves Shikaku in charge while he and Tsunade leave to stop the jinchūriki. As night approaches, Tobi states that his Eye of the Moon Plan will be commenced the next day. As night fall while he is heading to the battlefield, Naruto is dragged into his subconscious by the Nine-Tails as it chides Naruto for thinking he can handle both the war and Sasuke's hatred. However, Naruto is confident he can shoulder both of them and shocks the Nine-Tails with the intent to someday help the tailed beast with its own hatred.






Sakura knocking out the Neji impostor.



At
Kiba Inuzuka
's insistence, due to his overuse of his
Byakugan
,
Neji Hyūga
 is sent from Fifth Division camp to
Logistical Support and Medical Division
 compound where
Sakura Haruno
 tends to his injuries. At this time, word has spread that ninja are being killed off in the compound despite the
sensors
 not detecting an enemy presence and everyone reaches the conclusion that there is a spy among them. Sakura exposes the real spy as a White Zetsu posing as Neji. Interrogating the White Zetsu clone about how he was able to copy Neji right down to his chakra, Sakura realises that the clones can siphon a person's chakra and assume their form with no one able to tell the real ninja from a White Zetsu. As other ninja arrive to assist Sakura while she reports the information to headquarters, the real Neji is revealed to have never left the Fifth Division camp. At HQ, Shikaku receives the information and Ao informs him of chakras disappearing all over the divisions. Shikaku then begins to formulate a counter-measure against this imminent threat and find the imposters.






Tsunade and A intercept Naruto and B.



By that time, A and Tsunade appear before the jinchūriki with the former having no intention to let Naruto go any further and resolving to kill him if needed to delay Tobi's plans. However, B halts his brother's attack as he reminds him of how they formed the
A–B Combo
 and everything their been through including their time with their
cousin
 and their confrontation with Naruto's father
Minato Namikaze
.






Tsunade placing her faith in Naruto.



Though Tsunade decides that Naruto can enter the war, A refuses to allow it before being taken down by B's Lightning Release: Lariat defeats his brother. B tells A that his and Naruto's powers don't come from them being jinchūriki, and that his brother's words, saying he is important to him, has made B surpass him. B also tells him that as long as he has people he cares about, he can overcome the tailed beast in him. B calls A as his sun, the person he cares about, and Naruto calls his parents his suns. Naruto tells A how he met both Minato and Kushina, and that they believed he could control the Nine-Tails.
Tsunade
 states she will fight
A
 if he continues his attempt to kill Naruto, but A charges towards Naruto who manages to successfully dodge A's top speed punch, saying he will not fail. A reveals he was just testing Naruto to see if he can avoid his punch and tells Naruto to get going. Back at HQ,
Shikaku
 learns the only way to discover who are the White Zetsu clones is to have Naruto scatter his shadow clones at the locations as Nine-Tails Chakra can sense malice. But, knowing A will disapprove, Mabui doubts it will happen. A
Katsuyu
 clone informs them of A letting Naruto enter the war.

The Jinchūriki Enter The War






Tobi's Six Paths of Pain.



The sun rises, marking the second day of the Fourth Shinobi World War. Tobi makes his move, having his own
Six Paths of Pain
 composed of the reincarnated jinchūriki who have eyes that mirror Tobi's. Knowing Naruto can sense malice in the Nine-Tails form, Tobi knows that Naruto will be taking out the White Zetsu, saying that it is going along perfectly. Back at the Logistical Support and Medical Division compound, Shizune and Sakura learn the secrets about the White Zetsu, using the clone Sakura captured. Shizune reveals that the White Zetsu have the same DNA as Yamato, meaning they are altered plant clones of the First Hokage. A and Tsunade return to HQ and learn about the White Zetsu's clones being created from the First Hokage's cells. Believing that "Madara" developed a technique with her grandfather's cells to extend his life, Tsunade states there is no clue on how to defeat someone who is truly immortal.






Naruto sends his clones to other battlefields.



As Naruto and B head towards the battlefield, Shikaku contacts them telepathically through
Inoichi's technique
, telling them to search for the White Zetsu and explaining about Tobi, Kabuto and the
reincarnated shinobi
. Naruto and B come across a group of
ninja
 heading back to "defend" HQ, but were revealed by Naruto to actually be a small force of White Zetsu. Naruto takes out a majority of them and summons
Gamahiro
 to squish a merged white Zetsu and then to look out for more White Zetsu with B, while he sends his shadow clones to the other battlefields.






A rejuvenated Nagato attacks Naruto.



When
Nagato
 and
Itachi Uchiha
 encounter Naruto and Killer B, Kabuto planned to capture and use them to further blackmail Tobi. The battle reveals some truth on Itachi's mission and much to his chagrin, Itachi learns that
Sasuke
 has turned to Tobi instead of returning to Konoha. With this, the battle begins with Nagato (forcefully)
summoning
 his
bird
 and
multi-headed dog
 monsters to battle Naruto. Joining in the fight, Itachi eventually activates his
Mangekyō Sharingan
. This causes the
crow
 Itachi had placed inside Naruto comes out using
Kotoamatsukami
 on Itachi, freeing him from Kabuto's control as he uses
Amaterasu
 on Nagato and his summons. However, Kabuto responds by removing Nagato's personality to make him a more ideal weapon. When B enters his version 2 form to attack with
Lightning Release: Lariat
, Nagato uses the
Preta Path
's ability to
absorb
 B's chakra. Regaining his vibrant apperance, Nagato grabs Naruto and begins to
remove his soul
.






Nagato being sealed by Itachi.



Naruto tries to escape by attacking Nagato with a Rasengan but he absorbs it. B tries to cut Nagato to save Naruto, but he stops him using the
Asura Path
 ability and and almost succeeds in removing Naruto's soul and destroying B until Itachi intercepts with his his
Susanoo
 and attacks the summonings' eyes making them disappear. Nagato proceeds to use
Chibaku Tensei
 to trap the three but is stopped by the combined effort of Itachi's
Yasaka Magatama
, B's
Tailed Beast Ball
 and Naruto's
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
 to destroy the sphere at the centre of the attack. As the smoke clears, Nagato finds himself impaled by Susanoo's
Sword of Totsuka
 and his personality returns. Itachi then seals him but not before Nagato gives his last words to Naruto telling him that he was part of a trilogy that included
Jiraiya
 and himself and to correct the wrongs that he had done during his lifetime.

Once done sealing Nagato, Itachi then takes his leave to find Kabuto in order undo the Impure World Reincarnation. Seeing the youth weakened from using his Nine Tails Chakra Mode Itachi advises him not to overburden himself like he himself did and to remember those that are helping him as B tells the youth of the promise he made to Iruka. Itachi then incinerates the crow, as Shisui's eye can not be used for another decade and to ensure it would not fall into enemy hands; and Itachi then departs. Frustrated by losing Nagato and Itachi, Kabuto considers bringing out his trump card to compensate for the turn of events.

The Fourth Division vs. The Kage






The deceased Kage are summoned into battle.



Using the
Dustless Bewildering Cover
,
Mū
 was able to infiltrate the Land of Lightning undetected until
Gaara
 was able to locate him on the first day. Mū then summoned the
Second Mizukage
, the
Third Raikage
, and the
Fourth Kazekage
 with the
Fourth Division
 drawing the reincarnated Kage farther into the Land of Lightning while part of the division under Shikamaru broke off to aid Darui in his fight against Kinkaku in Land of Lightning's coast.






Clash of the Kazekage.



Once the battle on the Land of Lightning's coast was won, with the
First Division
 boxing their opponents from the rear, Gaara and
Ōnoki
 engaged the Kage with their attacks countered by their respective predecessors. As Gaara comes into sight, his father is shocked to see that Gaara is no longer a jinchūriki as the two engage with their attacks cancelling each other out. However, by attempting to protect two of the other Kage from an aerial barrage, Gaara restrains his father, and his counters continue to fail in the face of Gaara's Shield of Sand. After Gaara learns the truth about his mother, seals his father, turning his attention to the Third Raikage and Second Mizukage with new determination as the two Kage envade him and. divulge their abilities. Meanwhile, Ōnoki follows Mū, who becomes invisible and states that Ōnoki is going to die if he doesn't call Gaara over. Ōnoki tells Mū not to underestimate him as he makes several
clones
.






The Second Mizukage summons his Giant Clam.



As the Mizukage overwhelms the their forces with his clam's
mirage
, Gaara spots Mū as he is about to be attack Ōnoki from behind before noticing a Rasengan behind the reincarnated Tsuchikage. Naruto's
Planetary Rasengan
 misses at first, but then he manages to hit Mū with a second attack thanks to Gaara. Just as he is sealed by Gaara, Mū utters a warning yet is silenced once the seal is complete. After learning of Naruto's resolve to fight with them, Gaara and Ōnoki part ways with the youth to as he goes to where
Temari
 uses the
Wind Release: Cast Net
 technique to seemingly incapacitate the Raikage, offering his assistance as wind chakra users are effective against their opponent. After two missed Rasenshuriken, Naruto finally manages to hit the Raikage with the technique, but the Raikage recovers fast as the allied shinobi prepare
multiple earth walls
, supported by Dodai's
Lava Release: Rubber Wall
, to defend against the Raikage's strongest ninjutsu,
Hell Stab
. But seeing him break through all their defences, Dodai explains that the Third was very resilient, and was only injured when he fought the Eight-Tails.






Naruto causes the Third Raikage to impale himself.



Despite attempting the
Tailed Beast Rasengan
, Naruto fails to form it fully and is forced out of the Nine-Tails Chakra Mode. Naruto tells Dodai that he needs to contact B and the Eight-Tails. Kabuto focuses all of the Third Raikage's attacks on Naruto but Dodai forms a rubber ball as a decoy to buy Naruto some time. Naruto then asks the Eight-Tails how he defeated the Third Raikage. When he learned that both fought each other to a stand still, and the Third Raikage had only been injured after he fell. Suspecting what had happened, he entered Sage Mode and created a Rasengan, he plans to use
Frog Kata
 to sense the Raikage's attack faster. The Raikage attacks with a one-finger nukite, but Naruto dodges and hits the Raikage's arm with a Rasengan, knocking his attack into his own chest. The sealing team immediately seals the Raikage.

Gaara vs. The Mizukage






Gaara protects the Fourth Division from the Second Mizukage's attack.



Elsewhere, Gaara faces the Second Mizukage alone and notices how his opponent's oil is nullifying his sand as he uses his Concealed Sand Picture Cat to find the Giant Clam. After locating it, Ōnoki uses Earth Release: Fist Rock Technique combined with Earth Release: Super Added-Weight Rock Technique to destroy it, revealing the Mizukage's real body. Ōnoki throws out his back, rendering him immobile as the Mizukage uses the Water Gun Technique to shoot what he learns was a sand clone as it envelopes him. The Second starts to wash away the sand with oil, but Gaara layers the sand into his
Desert Layered Imperial Funeral
 before it explodes. As hail begins to fall, Ōnoki explains to Gaara that this is the Second's
Steaming Danger Tyranny
 as his clone reconstitutes. The explosive clone wreaks havoc, with Gaara protecting his division before fighting the clone and managing to incapacitate it with a sand clone with his father's gold dust mixed into it. with the sand clone, along with the clone's heat, to fuse the gold to its body. The clone then finds the real Gaara, and tries to attack him, only to be stopped by Gaara's sand and stopped from exploding. Greatly impressed by this feat, the Second Mizukage beams at Gaara before being sealed.






Sasuke reveals his Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan.



Earlier, at the
Mountains' Graveyard
, Sasuke recovers from his surgery yet is told by White Zetsu to keep the bandages on for the time being. However, as Naruto and Gaara fought the Third Raikage and Second Mizukage, Sasuke attacks White Zetsu with his Susanoo and sets him ablaze with Amaterasu. Saying that his eyes could see just fine in the dark that he should try them outside, Sasuke removes his bandages to see with his newly evolved Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan.

Kabuto's Trump Card: The Real Madara Uchiha






Kabuto's trump card is revealed to be the real Madara Uchiha.



In the rubble of a smashed pillar, a damaged Mū stands up. He reveals that he split his body in two, and that only half of him was sealed. He tries to remove the tags from his other half, but the seal is too strong in his weakened state. Mū then, eventually due to his weakened state, performs a summoning of the reincarnated ninja who is Kabuto's ultimate weapon. The figure, whose power is so intense that the coffin's lid bursted open, is revealed to be
Madara Uchiha
.
