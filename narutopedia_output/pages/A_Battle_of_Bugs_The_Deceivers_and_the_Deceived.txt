Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Hinata is kidnapped by a group of ninja who use a bug technique similar to the technique used by the
Aburame clan
. It is revealed that the bug users who kidnapped
Hinata
 are part of
a clan
 that was an old rival of the Aburame clan. Shino explains the feud between the both clans started when an attack on Konoha was organised by the Kamizuru clan of
Iwagakure
. However, the attack was thwarted by the Aburame clan to retain their status in Konoha, and causing the Kamizuri clan to lose their status in Iwagakure. The Kamizuru clan seek to recover a scroll using the
bikōchū
 in order to restore its former glory. Hinata's companions hide the bikōchū and attempt to rescue her, but are lured into a trap. Hinata attempts to escape, but is swept down a river while stuck in a cocoon.
