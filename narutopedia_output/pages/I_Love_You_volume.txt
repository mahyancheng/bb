 manga.

Chapter 680

"
Once Again
" (
もう一度
,
Mō Ichido
)

Plummeting to their death in the molten lava below,
Sasuke

summons

Garuda
 who cushions his fall mid-air. Relieved that they had an escape plan,
Naruto
 directs Sasuke to where
Kakashi
,
Sakura
 and
Obito
 where, quickly realising they're safe from impending doom. Thanks to Kakashi's own quick-thinking, he is able to fashion a rope out of a
scroll
 and pins Obito to a wall using a
kunai
. Naruto questions Sasuke's complete disregard for his companions' well-being but Sasuke retorts that the two of them were the last hope for humanity. While agreeing with Sasuke, Naruto however notes that there were simply times when a person's body moved instinctively to protect someone.
 Discontented with Naruto and Sasuke's survival,
Kaguya
 uses her
Byakugan
 to launch a pinpoint attack on her targets which is successful in damaging the hawk's wing despite Sasuke erecting a partially formed
Susanoo
 defensive. Simultaneously, the heat from the lava burns through the scroll and the team end up in the same predicament once more only to be saved by Naruto and his new ability to fly and his
chakra arms
. Irked by this beyond measure, Kaguya launches a full on assault noting that
chakra
 should be hers alone and she would once again unite all chakra. Meanwhile, the
Hokage
 all move towards the epicentre of the new battle as
Madara
's
Truth-Seeking Balls
 and chakra disrupting blades begin to disappear. Kaguya and Naruto proceed to go fist to fist with their chakra arms, before Naruto is buffeted by one of her attacks, leaving her open to an attack from Sasuke from overhead with his Susanoo.

Chapter 681

"
Kaguya's Tears
" (
カグヤの涙
,
Kaguya no Namida
)

Sent reeling from
Kaguya
's
attack
,
Naruto
 finds himself spinning, unable to stop while
Sasuke
 realises that not even his
Susanoo
 was effective against her. Plummeting towards the lava below them once more, Sasuke was able to use his
new technique
 to teleport to Naruto who used his
Truth-Seeking Ball
 to create a foothold for Sasuke.
 While the rest of the team retrieves
Obito
, at the same time Kaguya opens a portal and steps though it, appearing behind Naruto and Sasuke. Clutching their faces, the duo is rendered immobile as the stoic Kaguya begins to shed tears. Her will manifests and as
Black Zetsu
 covers half of the duo, he explains that they reminded Kaguya of her own sons:
Hamura
 and
Hagoromo
. As he absorbed their
chakra
, he regaled the story of how he came to be and his influence over the
shinobi
 world throughout the years all in an effort to revive his "
mother
". Finally speaking, Kaguya voices her hatred for her sons and once again declares that all chakra was hers. Freeing themselves, Naruto and Sasuke agree that now more than ever it was imperative to seal her, and prepare to going into the offensive once more.

Chapter 682

"
I'm Sure You Have Never Seen This
" (
見たことねーだろ
,
Mita Koto nē Daro
)

Free from
Kaguya
 and
Black Zetsu
,
Naruto
 tells
Sasuke
 that he plans to use a special technique that he was practising in secret, more so than the
Rasengan
, and could distract her long enough for them to use the sealing technique.
 Meanwhile, as Naruto's clone,
Kakashi
 and
Sakura
 watch on from far away, Kakashi contemplates on the mechanics of Kaguya's power to
shift

dimensions
 almost instantaneously and Naruto uses his
new power
 to revive
Obito
. Putting their plan into action, Sasuke uses
Amaterasu
 to engulf Kaguya, as she merely brushes off the attack, Naruto jumps in front of her and uses his
new technique
, much to everyone's shock and bafflement. But, much to their surprise, Naruto managed to punch Kaguya and Sasuke uses his
teleportation ability
 to transport himself and Naruto near her, but just as they were about to seal her, Kaguya encased all three of them inside a giant block of ice. With Kaguya now shifting everyone into a vast frozen mountainside, she
escapes
 the ice and prepares to use Black Zetsu to once again drain Naruto and Sasuke's
chakra
. Kakashi, meanwhile theorises that Kaguya's power to shift dimensions works the same way as
genjutsu
, except it is reality. As Sasuke uses
Kagutsuchi
 to free himself and Naruto from the ice, Black Zetsu recommends fighting them one at a time. Following his advice, Kaguya suddenly grabs Sasuke and throws him into a desert dimension.

Chapter 683

"
I Had The Same Dream As You
" (
お前と同じ夢を見た
,
Omae to Onaji Yume o Mita
)

Suddenly finding himself cut off from
Sasuke
, who was pulled into another one of
Kaguya
's
alternate dimensions
,
Naruto
 quickly rushes over and tries to use brute strength to keep the portal open but to no avail. Meanwhile, the four
Hokage
 arrive at the location where they last felt the powerful
chakra
, only to discover nothing but
Madara
's lower half. Discussing the situation, they confirm that the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 had been cast. Though it is suggested that they
reincarnate
 the seemingly dead Madara, before they can come to a decision, however,
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 manifests himself before them.
 As the battle against Kaguya waged on,
Black Zetsu
 declares Naruto's imminent defeat, but the airborne-ninja proves too elusive for Kaguya. Stepping completely into her dimensional void, the Rabbit Goddess causes the world itself to suddenly start attacking Naruto. Elsewhere,
Obito
 regains consciousness and the team soon decides that they would lend their support to Naruto after hearing about the state of things. Meanwhile the real Naruto struggles against nature itself before Kaguya reveals herself once more. Noticing her ability was akin to
Space–Time Ninjutsu
, Obito hypothesised that he would be able to enter her dimension and retrieve Sasuke, but noted that the chakra required to achieve such a feat was immense and notes that the combination of Naruto's
shadow clone
 and
Sakura
's
chakra
 would be enough to accomplish the deed. When Naruto thanks Obito, he dismisses the praise of no longer wearing a mask and states, that as someone who once shared the same dream, he wanted to at least walk before Naruto — prepared to die.

Chapter 684

"
We Should Kill Him First
" (
殺しておくべきだ
,
Koroshite Okubeki da
)

Sakura
 realises that
Obito
 was willing to die so easily because he was beyond saving but soon casts aside these thoughts when the
Uchiha
 calls her, and
Naruto
's clone forth. Though
Kaguya
 notes their presence, she pays little to no attention to them on the battlefield and instead opts to attack the real Naruto.
 As Naruto contemplates his next course of action, he settles on a combination of diversionary tactics and taijutsu.
Kokuō
 lends Naruto support with its steam-based ninjutsu bolstering Naruto's physical attacks to monstrous levels. Shocked that she was being pressured in
her own dimension
, Kaguya emerges from the rubble to find herself surrounded by a barrage of
shadow clones
. Assaulted from all sides, Kaguya is forced to retreat to another dimension — an opportunity which Naruto and Obito take to invade her dimension. Sensing the invaders,
Black Zetsu
 advises his mother to kill Naruto rather than give him the opportunity to reunite with
Sasuke
 and seal her. Though hesitant at first, she ultimately agrees with this advise and uses her All-Killing Ash Bones technique which strikes Naruto and begins to disintegrate his body. Believing that now the clones would be gone as well, she returns to her ice-clad dimension to find the clones still there much to her shock. Meanwhile, Obito and Sakura invade her main dimension, intent on finding Sasuke.

Chapter 685

"
Everything I Have Got…!!
" (
ありったけの…!!
,
Arittake no…!!
)

After successfully entering
Kaguya's dimension
,
Sakura
 makes her intentions clear, before
Naruto
's disintegrating
shadow clone
 disperses, causing the events to be relayed to him. With this, he charges forward intent on distracting
Kaguya
 until his allies could retrieve
Sasuke
. Activating her
Strength of a Hundred Seal
, Sakura
transfers
 her chakra to
Obito
 wrapping the seals of her technique around his body as well, as the
Uchiha
 uses his
Kamui
 to breach Kaguya's other dimensions.
 The feat itself takes a heavy toll on the duo and they are almost swallowed by a sea of acid from one dimension. Sakura however uses her body to shield them from the worst of it, discarding her damaged
flak jacket
 in the process. Meanwhile Kaguya battles Naruto in her frozen dimension and decides not to use her
Amenominaka
 ability in case more of what she thought to just be Naruto's clones breached her main dimension. Elsewhere, in the sand-dune dimension, Sasuke is able to make his way to the location where he felt Naruto's chakra strongly only moments before. Continuing with their toll-taking search for Sasuke, Sakura and Obito are finally able to open the dimension that Sasuke is trapped in. Calling out to him, the young Uchiha dashed towards them. With their strength wavering, however, the portal began closing; ultimately Sakura is able to pour more chakra into Obito to enlarge the closing portal once more. Their abilities at their limit, they thought their efforts had failed only to find Sasuke standing next to them. When questioned, he notes that he was able to get close enough to use his
dōjutsu
 to
swap places
 with Sakura's flak jacket.

Chapter 686

"
Those Who Remain and Those Who Pass On
" (
残せし者と継ぎし者
,
Nokoseshi Mono to Tsugishi Mono
)

Hagoromo
's spirit informs the
Hokage
 of the events that transpired after the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 was cast. He also informs them that due to
Madara
's lower half still containing Yang-
Kurama
's as well as both
Indra
's and
Asura
's
chakras
, they fully combined, resulting in his spirit finally emerging.
Minato
 questions Hagoromo on a technique he told them earlier, but he said it would require a huge amount of chakra, which he does not have at the moment, having given
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 his chakra earlier. Charging the Hokage before him, he asks them to listen and do what he asks.
 Meanwhile,
Kaguya
 fights against Naruto's
shadow clones
 in an attempt to kill the real one. She fires two
bones
 at him, but was stopped by two clones who protect the main body. As the clones disintegrate, more converge in one place forming a defensive liven between them, proving
Black Zetsu
's theory correct that the one with the
Truth-Seeking Balls
 was the real one. While Kaguya fights the clones,
Kakashi
 looks on, and begins to feel helpless. Just as he was starting to doubt himself, Naruto's words manage to shake him out of it.
Obito
,
Sakura
, and Sasuke soon arrive from the
desert dimension
 but, just as Naruto was about to come to Sasuke, Kaguya suddenly grabs him with her
hair
 and stabs him. Everyone looking in horror, Naruto began to wither away, but suddenly disappears in a puff of smoke, revealing it was yet another shadow clone. Irked by this, Kaguya concedes to the direness of the situation and once again
shifts
 everyone to another dimension, this time, to a high gravity dimension, where all the clones fall out of the sky and start to disappear and everyone else is pinned down, including Kaguya. Kaguya then sprouts more bones, aiming them both at Naruto and Sasuke, who luckily dodged them thanks to the effect of the gravity. As Kaguya prepared to fire again, both Kakashi and Obito run towards them and prepare to die, as they do so, they see a vision of
Rin
 and their younger selves holding hands. Both men were ready to sacrifice their lives, but just at the last moment, Obito uses
Kamui
 to send the bone aiming at Kakashi away, while he sacrifices himself.

Chapter 687

"
You Definitely Will
" (
お前は必ず
,
Omae wa Kanarazu
)

Kakashi
 asks the crumbling
Obito
 why he would sacrifice himself when he was still necessary in battle, but the silent
Uchiha
 muses that Kakashi was the one needed to support the next generation, before telling his comrade to focus on the enemy.
Kaguya
 decides to return to her
first dimension
 while she replenishes her chakra, but when
Naruto
 tries to use his
abilities
 to save Obito,
Black Zetsu
 launches a tirade not only about Naruto's futile efforts, but what he believes to be Obito's wasted life; and though Obito agrees to this, Zetsu's words do nothing but infuriate the touring
Uzumaki
.
 Wasting no time when he realised that his
dōjutsu
's
ability
 was useable once more,
Sasuke
 launches an attack on Kaguya, forcing her to
shift dimensions
 once more to narrowly escape the attack. Noting that this time he would be the distraction, Sasuke engages Kaguya giving her no time to relent as he dons his
Complete Body — Susanoo
 and flies towards her. Obito uses this time to impart his final words to Kakashi and Naruto, thanking them for allowing him to remember who he used to be. After telling Naruto to become
Hokage
, Obito finally disintegrates into a pile of ash, leading Black Zetsu to comment that Obito was a cockroach for having last so long rather than a regular insect. Enraged at this point, Naruto declares that because he wanted to become Hokage at one point, Obito was an awesome person in his eyes, and proceeded to fly up to Kaguya at an extreme speed, severing her left arm with his own
chakra arm
. Meanwhile, in what appears to be the afterlife, Obito finds
Rin
 and the two reconcile.

Chapter 688

"
…of the Sharingan!!
" (
写輪眼の…!!
,
Sharingan no…!!
)

Obito
 asks
Rin
 to wait just a little bit longer, noting that he wanted to help
Kakashi
 who was currently unable to contribute to the ongoing battle. Promising Rin to come back, Obito
teleports
 into the
core dimension
, manifesting as
chakra
 and inhabits Kakashi. Inside his consciousness, Obito explains that he had come back to give Kakashi an early present. Declaring that he told
Naruto
 to become
Hokage
, he states that Kakashi should become the Sixth before him. Reminding his comrade of his moniker which was feared across nations, Kakashi opens his eyes and reveals that not only he is once again "
Kakashi of the Sharingan
", but also in both eyes.
 Meanwhile,
Black Zetsu
 is pinned down by two
rods
, and
Sasuke
 is knocked back by
Kaguya
's
chakra arms
. Giving Kaguya no time to relent, Naruto draws on the power of all the
tailed beasts
 and uses
nine unique Rasenshuriken
 against Kaguya, resulting in a massive misshapen mass of the combined tailed beasts chakra pouring out of her body when she tries to transform. The mass begins pirouetting numerous arms, one of them absorbs one of Naruto's
shadow clones
. Seeing one of the arms go after
Sakura
 who attempts to flee, Naruto tells Sasuke to use his
dōjutsu
 to
save
 her and sees Sakura being saved by
Susanoo
. To everyone's shock, it is revealed that it was Kakashi that was inside the Susanoo, declaring to Obito in his mind that he will protect their comrades and the world.

Chapter 689

"
I Love You
" (
大好きだ
,
Daisuki da
)

Wasting no time to leap into battle,
Kakashi
 uses his
Susanoo
 to create Kamui-based shuriken and negate
Kaguya
's chakra-absorbing beast arms. Kaguya finally regains control of her power and transforms, emerging from her beast form and creating a large Truth-Seeking Ball intent on erasing everything from her
core dimension
. Kakashi calls his former students to him and gives them details on what will most likely be their last mission as a team.
 Their strategy finalised,
Team Kakashi
 charge at Kaguya; the latter uses her
All-Killing Ash Bones
 on them, but
Naruto
's
shadow clones
, and Kakashi's
Kamui
 abilities render them ineffective. Kakashi lands a hit on Kaguya using his
Kamui Lightning Cutter
 technique, sending her plummeting and incapacitating her right arm. As Naruto and
Sasuke
 charge at her, Kaguya uses her left arm to fire a bone projectile at Naruto and opens a portal linking her  right side and her severed arm as
Black Zetsu
 uses Kaguya's severed arm to send another bone projectile at Sasuke. To their surprise, Sasuke turns out to be a transformed clone. As Black Zetsu prepares to fire another bone at the real Naruto, Kakashi intervenes and interrupts the attack with his own space–time technique. Sasuke uses his
dōjutsu
 to
swap places
 with Naruto's disentegrating clone out from behind a wall of shadow clones just as Kaguya regains the strength to evade the two by flying upwards. At that moment,
Sakura
 — descending from above — sends Kaguya plummeting back towards her team-mates with a punch, allowing them to finally establish a physical connection to her. All the while, a reminiscent Kakashi comments on how well they worked together and cheerfully exclaims that he loves them as they are.

Chapter 690

"
…of Ninja!!
" (
忍者の…!!
,
Ninja no…!!
)

As
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 finally make physical contact with
Kaguya
, the powerful
fūinjutsu
: Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei is finally activated, and just as her sons
Hagoromo
 and
Hamura
 had done before, her
third eye
 is obscured by the moon and sun respectively leading to the
tailed beasts
 being extracted from within her body.
 Kaguya soon reverts to the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 before ejecting
Madara Uchiha
's unconscious body as the earth begins to encase her body, forming another satellite. Silently watching on as his mother is sealed away once more,
Black Zetsu
 resigns himself to the fact that he would have to bide his time and begin the process to revive his mother again, however, Naruto — who has other plans — finds Kaguya's severed arm, and after decrying Zetsu's sentiments that he created the
shinobi
 world tells Black Zetsu that the shinobi history was actually created by the lives of shinobi who all lived and died before telling Black Zetsu that it is nothing more than a snot-nosed brat too afraid to leave his mother's side. Naruto then throws the disembodied arm into the
Chibaku Tensei
 sphere. The tailed beast are all elated that they have been freed and while they praise Naruto,
Team Kakashi
 soon finds themselves in another predicament: they had no way to escape Kaguya's dimension. Just then, they are all
summoned
 to the real world, by Hagoromo who called on the spirits of all the deceased
Kage
 and used their power along with the
Hokage
's to summon them out of
Kaguya's dimension
. Looking on at the team, Hagoromo thanks them sincerely for saving the world.
