"
Tale of Naruto Uzumaki
" (
うずまきナルト物語
,
Uzumaki Naruto Monogatari
) is episode 174 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Nagato
 finishes telling
Naruto
 his story, revealing that after
Yahiko
 had died, he had scratched a horizontal line in his
forehead protector
 and became the new leader of the
Akatsuki
. He then asks Naruto to give his answer to how the latter plans to achieve true peace. Naruto responds that he does not know how to achieve peace yet, but that someday he would break the curse of hatred in their
shinobi
 world and that all he requires is the power to believe in it. Nagato is shocked at Naruto's words, recalling when he uttered those same words to
Jiraiya
, who was suffering from writer's block at the time. Pulling out
Jiraiya
's novel,
The Tale of the Utterly Gutsy Shinobi
, Naruto explains that he plucked his words from the book itself, and that the protagonist's dialogue was exactly what Nagato had said to Jiraiya then. Naruto goes on to reveal that the character of the book is named
Naruto
, and that Jiraiya had bestowed that name upon him. Naruto adds that since he does not know how to write novels, his life would serve as the sequel to Jiraiya's book, and that he would act in the same manner as the book's Naruto did, in accordance with their master's principles, and that he would find the way to true peace.

Nagato claims that Jiraiya's ideology is outdated and asks Naruto how he could have faith in him if there are no guarantees that Naruto would not stray from his optimistic path once he experiences pain, the same way he did. Naruto tells Nagato that he has already experienced pain, having been shunned and ostracised from birth due to being a
jinchuriki
, and that his pain was worsened when he
fought against
 and lost his friend
Sasuke
 as well as when he
hurt

another friend
. He explains that he still has a lot of pain buried deep within him and that he would never forgive Nagato for what he did, and that he does wish to kill him as a result. However, Naruto decides to stick Jiraiya's hope of the curse of hatred being broken and people understanding one another in true peace and harmony and promises Nagato that when he becomes
Hokage
, he would bring peace to
Amegakure
.

Touched by Naruto's words, Nagato tells him that he reminds him of himself when he was younger, and adds that while he had joked that he and Naruto should be able to understand one another due to them sharing the same master, he truly understands Naruto's ideology. Deciding to put his faith in Naruto in the hopes that he truly can achieve peace, Nagato decides to use the last of
chakra
 to use his
Outer Path — Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 to atone for his actions;
Konan
 realises that Nagato would die as a result of using the
Outer Path
 and is shocked that Nagato would give up his life in order to place his trust in the idealistic Naruto.

Back at
Mount Myōboku
,
Gamamaru
 tells
Gamabunta
 that he never expected there to be two
Children of the Prophecy
 and that he had never thought that Jiraiya's novel would play such a vital part in saving the world.
