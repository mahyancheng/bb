This shinobi clan
 is from
Kirigakure
. All of its known members appear to have shark-like features such as sharp, pointed teeth and facial features that resemble gills.
 During the
Sixth Mizukage
's era, the family name no longer appears on memorials, which
Shizuma
 attributes to his family being considered a nuisance in the peaceful time due to their reputation for being bloodthirsty and violent, especially among its most notable members.
