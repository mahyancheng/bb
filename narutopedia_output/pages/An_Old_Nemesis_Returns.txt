"
An Old Nemesis Returns
" (
宿敵との再会
,
Shukuteki to no Saikai
) is episode 265 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Receiving intel from headquarters that
enemy troops
 were travelling underfoot,
Mifune
 redeploys his division to support the others. Elsewhere,
Sai
,
Zaji
 and
Omoi
 of the
Surprise Attack Division
 launch an aerial attack using
explosive tags
 on a group of
reincarnated
 shinobi that they located, but the enemy recover from the damage quickly. Responding to the threat after
protecting

Zabuza
,
Haku
 launches an aerial attack on the three shinobi using one of his
mirrors
. Seemingly in peril, the three shinobi are saved by the
Third Division
 who had seen Zaji's signal flare. Confronting Zabuza once again,
Kakashi Hatake
 speaks to him and Haku about
Naruto
 and his growth.

This reunion, however, is cut short in its niceties as
Kabuto Yakushi
 — who had just drained
Anko Mitarashi
 of the remaining dregs of
Orochimaru
's
chakra
 — eradicates their personalities as he prepares to have them attack. As the battle gets under-way, Zabuza covers the battlefield in a
thick mist
 under the cover of which the reincarnated shinobi attack. Cautioning his troops before they attack, Kakashi tells them to get into the
Manji Formation
 in order to protect each others' backs. As the battle wages on,
Pakura
 uses her
Scorch Release

kekkei genkai
 to essentially
mummify
 the shinobi she attacks while
Gari
, who had engaged in battle with
Tajiki
, uses his
Explosion Release
 to
blow
 him to bits. Seeking reprisal, another Kumo-nin attempts to attack Gari and is almost killed by Haku if not for
Might Guy
 and
Rock Lee

intercepting
 the young man's attack and repelling him. Intending to keep the upper hand in the battle, Kabuto uses Gari and Pakura to
summon
 the previous generation of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
 much to the shock of the onlooking Third Division.

Trivia

When Kakashi is remembering when he fought Zabuza in the beginning of the episode, Zabuza's sclerae are shown black as if he was resurrected back then.

There are some inconsistencies between the flashbacks and what was shown originally:

Originally, Zabuza requested Kakashi to place him by Haku's side. In this episode, Zabuza approached Haku instead as he was dying.

Originally, Haku did not wear lipstick. In this episode, he has pink lipstick during flashbacks.

The scene when Gato kicks Haku's face was not shown originally. In this episode's flashback, the kicking scene is shown.

The scene where Haku steps in front of Naruto while he rushes toward Kakashi and Zabuza never happened originally.

Originally, Haku was beat and bleeding during his and Naruto's conversation. In this episode, he is unhurt.

While Gari performs his
Explosion Release: Landmine Fist
, he is shown to have a right sleeve.

Haku is briefly shown with normal sclearae instead of the black one common for all brought back by Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation.
