Mount Myōboku
 (
妙木山
,
Myōbokuzan
,
literally meaning:
 Mysterious/Exquisite Tree Mountain), also known as the "
Mountain of Bewilderment
" (
迷いの山
,
Mayoi no Yama
,
Viz:
 Maze Mountain)
 and the "
Land of Toads
" (
蝦蟇の国
,
Gama no Kuni
),
 is one of the big three unexplored
sage
 regions, a legendary place that is equally as famous as the other two,
Shikkotsu Forest
 and
Ryūchi Cave
.
 It's the land of
toads
 and the place where all the toads that
Naruto
,
Minato
, and
Jiraiya
 have
summoned
 live. It is home for huge and small toads alike. Mount Myōboku is a rich and beautiful land, whose ultimate authority seems to be the
Great Toad Sage
.
Shima
 and
Fukasaku
 are both elders and sages, and they seem to have an even higher authority than
Gamabunta
 himself.

Overview

For a human to get to Mount Myōboku, it either takes a month long travel on secret paths from
Konohagakure
 or, if they have a summoning contract, they can let a toad use the
Reverse Summoning Technique
. According to Fukasaku, Mount Myōboku is impossible to find by foot for those who don't know the secret route.
 In the anime, Jiraiya was transported to Mount Myōboku in his youth via using the summoning technique without a contract.





The portal allowing quick access to Konohagakure.



There is a special portal called the Distant Body Water (
遠身水
,
Enshinsui
,
English TV:
 Distance Teleportation Portal) that links Mount Myōboku and Konohagakure, that enables the smaller toads to quickly travel between the two without the use of the summoning technique.
 Combined with a toad that can perform the Summoning Technique, the toads can be summoned to aid Konohagakure in the event a living toad summoner isn't in Konoha at the time. On Mount Myōboku exists a score of musical
genjutsu
 that have passed down since an immemorial time, such as the
Demonic Illusion: Toad Confrontation Chant
, a technique that two great toad sages have mastered. These genjutsu are very powerful and can only be performed by combining the melody and the lyrics that only the toads can utter.

There is a special location known as Mount Myōboku: Rock Lodging (
妙木山・岩宿
,
Myōbokuzan: Iwayado
,
literally meaning:
 Mysterious/Exquisite Tree Mountain: Rock Lodging), where a
great, fire-breathing toad
 resides. Mount Myōboku has records of its population in a list, and the name of a Mount Myōboku toad stays there until it dies.






The Sacred Oil Fountain and all the statues surrounding it.



Some of the inhabitants of Mount Myōboku can use
senjutsu
 to gather natural energy. There is a sacred fountain on Mount Myōboku that produces a special oil which allows people to feel the natural energy around them more easily, but if the person is not perfectly still when becoming one with nature, he or she starts becoming a toad and eventually turns into stone.
 This oil can only exist in the atmosphere of the mountain and will evaporate if taken outside. There are many statues of the frog ancestors and people who tried to learn senjutsu but failed in doing so and became toad statues.
 The statues are treated with high respect.
