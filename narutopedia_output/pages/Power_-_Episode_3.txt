Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

After having what was seemingly a bad dream,
Miina
 runs to
Dokku
 in the night to seek comfort. Elsewhere, in a graveyard,
Kabuto Yakushi
 prepares to
reincarnate
 someone. When day breaks the next day,
Leo
,
Faz
, and
Lando
 are eager to start their
ninjutsu
 training with
Naruto
, who was feeling under the weather. However, after being chided by the boys since he had made a promise to them, Naruto emphatically begins the training which even
Shiseru
 decides to partake it, having found it interesting. While elsewhere a reincarnated
Deidara
 and
Hidan
's genetic clone argue over their predicament having killed several members of the
Hachō Village
 militia, and are later confronted by several more members along with
Yamato
, and
Sai
.

Plagued by vivid images all day, when they reach home Miina goes to Naruto and begins saying "
get out
" repeatedly. Thinking that Miina was simply being rude, Shiseru slaps her and Miina runs off. Later,
Disonasu
 visits their home and to everyone's surprise, the
Tonika Village Head
 is with him. Greeting his grandchildren, he notes that he had injured his eyes but presses on past that, asking Dokku for the piece of the treasure he had given to him the night of the invasion of the village. However, Miina alerts everyone to the fact that there was something strange about her grandfather and it is revealed that he had been reincarnated. As a fight subsequently breaks out when Kabuto makes an appearance, Naruto soon begins writhing in pain. Rushing towards him, Miina once again tells the young man to get out, before being able to force something out of Naruto through unknown means. The black pool soon forms into a four-tailed
Version 2
 form of Naruto which Kabuto tries to take control of with a talisman, to no avail. As the creature begins attacking indiscriminately, everyone looks on in fear.
