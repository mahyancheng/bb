Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Neji
 is badly wounded by
Kidōmaru
's arrow. However, he continues fighting; he injects some of his
chakra
 into the guiding string attached to the arrow, which travels back to and paralyses Kidōmaru. Kidōmaru falls from the tree he was hiding in, assuming that this was Neji's dying effort. Following
Naruto
's example of not allowing seemingly insurmountable odds stop him from winning, Neji meets Kidōmaru as he reaches the ground and delivers a killing blow. As Kidōmaru's life fades Neji explains that he allowed himself to be hit, knowing Kidōmaru would attack from his blindspot and therefore making it easy to avoid a fatal wound. Kidōmaru asks if it was worth it, which Neji affirms: this victory and his helping the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 has made his injuries and likely death worth it.
