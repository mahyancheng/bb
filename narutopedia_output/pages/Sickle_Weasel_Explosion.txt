Temari punches the opponent into the air, and Shikamaru connects with a kick. Then Shikamaru uses his
Shadow Imitation Technique
 to paralyse the opponent. Then he throws
kunai
 with attached
explosive tags
 while Temari uses her
Sickle Weasel Technique
 to put the opponent in a tornado and slash them with the kunai while they explode with the explosive tags.
