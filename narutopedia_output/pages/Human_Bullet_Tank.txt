This is a "showy"
taijutsu
 unique to members of the
Akimichi clan
.

 The user tucks themselves into a ball and rolls towards a target.
 Due to force of their rotation, most obstacles are pulverised upon contact. Users can take advantage of the surrounding environment to launch themselves into the air,
 increasing the damage when they fall back to the ground. The speed at which they spin has the added benefit of rendering most attacks ineffective against them.
 But the ball's speed also makes it difficult to turn, forcing users to stop spinning entirely if they want to make significant changes in direction and thus leaving them vulnerable while they do.

The technique can be combined with the
Multi-Size Technique
 to increase its destructive power,
 though it seemingly can be used without it.
 How the composite Human Bullet Tank is used depends on what form the Akimichi's Multi-Size Technique takes. In Part I, when
Chōji Akimichi
's Multi-Size Technique makes him very round, he retracts his arms, legs, and head into his body so that they don't get in the way while he rolls; because his head is submerged in his bulk, this also makes him immune to external sounds.
 In Part II, when Chōji's Multi-Size Technique simply makes him large, he folds his legs to his chest and locks his arms around them.
