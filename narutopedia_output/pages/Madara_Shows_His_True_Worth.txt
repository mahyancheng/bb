Gaara
 leaves the

Kakashi
 that he and the other
Kage
 will treat Kakashi as the new
Hokage
 because of
Danzō
's actions, and while he repeats his personal recommendation for
Naruto
 to give up on
Sasuke
, he also advises him to think and do what he thought was right for himself at least. Elsewhere, Danzō prepares for a battle with
Tobi
. While he does so,
Fū Yamanaka
 and
Torune Aburame
 fight Tobi, but are unable to land a blow. They try to hit him at a time when he is solid, but their attacks pass through him and they are ultimately warped away. With them gone, Tobi brings Sasuke and

 to Danzō, offering to let Sasuke kill him. Danzō accepts the challenge, revealing an arm filled with
Sharingan
