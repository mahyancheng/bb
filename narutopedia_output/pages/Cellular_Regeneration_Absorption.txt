While in a transformed state, Jūgo extends a needle-like protuberance from the palm of his hand, places it into a target while proceeding to quickly absorb their flesh and blood, converting them into his own cells and restoring his stamina and body. He used this technique after being left on the brink of death by the
Fourth Raikage
. This technique also restores him to his normal size should he have previously
reduced his flesh
