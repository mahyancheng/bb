Gasuka
 (
ガスカ
) was an inhabitant of the
Land of Ancestors
, as well as a friend of
Edashi
,
Taizō
 and
Asura Ōtsutsuki
.

Background






Gasuka and his friends are going to chase the boar.



When a wild boar began to come to the gardens of the inhabitants of the country and spoil the harvest, Taizō gathered friends and offered to hunt him down. Gasuka remarked that this was dangerous, but when Taizō assured him that Asura will protect them with ninshū, he agreed. After some time, they managed to reach the boar, which pursued Asura and killed
Shiro
 who was protecting him. Gasuka and the others hid in a tree while Asura was rescued by his brother
Indra
.

Many years later, as adults, Gasuka and Edashi came to Taizō, who was hiding in a hut on a hill, and informed him that
Hagoromo
 sent Asura on a mission to another village. When Asura was appointed as Hagoromo's successor, Gasuka attended the party, after helping to fight Indra, who was unhappy with his father's choice.

Personality

Gasuka was a little cowardly as a child, as he did not really want to go on a dangerous adventure in chasing a boar. However, he went after his friends without leaving them. As an adult, Gasuka showed concern for Asura, informing Taizō of his departure from the village.

Appearance

Gasuka is a guy of medium height with long brown hair and black eyes. He wears a grey kimono tied with a belt, a lilac t-shirt, and pants. His ankles owe him bandages, and Gasuka didn't wear any sandals or boots.

As a child, Gasuka had shorter hair and wore a grey kimono with white lining.

Abilities

Like almost all inhabitants of the Land of Ancestors, Gasuka was a follower of
Ninshū
, gaining the ability to use
chakra
, and also, if necessary,
transfer it
 to someone.
