The
Valley of Judgement
 (
裁きの谷
,
Sabaki no Tani
) is a location most popularly known for containing the fabled
Eye Medicine Plant
: a medicinal herb that works well for eye strain. The valley itself, however, is treacherous and is noted to be a dangerous place for even
jōnin
-level shinobi. Thick mist makes it near impossible to see except for those with a
dōjutsu
, like the
Byakugan
 or
Sharingan
. The valley is inhabited by strange humans with no eyes who walk on all fours.
Kakashi
 notes that they have
discarded
 their eyes after what could be hundreds or thousands of years of living without sunlight. They appear able to use
kunai
 suggesting they may have once been shinobi. It is noted they are unable to survive outside the mist of the valley.
