captain
.

Abilities

Hishaku was extremely skilled in methods of cleaning, such as sweeping and pegging sheets to ropes to dry, and in a form cleaning he and his crew used in which the cleaner taps the head of the broom in rhythm off the ground between sweeps.

Part II

Paradise Life on a Boat

While at sea,
Naruto
,
Guy
,
Aoba
 and the other
Konoha
 shinobi encountered his ship believing it at first to be a ghost ship. After Naruto helped him with his chores using a few
shadow clones
, he explained all the phenomena to them and his desire to become a captain one day. After encountering the
Giant Corpse Crab
 at sea, Hishaku told them the story of how it had killed his crew-mates and begged them to defeat the beast. While Naruto clashed with the beast, Hishaku used the ship as a battering ram of sorts to give Naruto an opening to attack it with the
Rasengan
. After the beast is defeated, he thanks Naruto and reveals that he was actually a spirit that could not rest as he disappears. He later meets up with his deceased crew mates that tell him that they could not pass on until he was resting in peace. Together, they begin to celebrate the defeat of the monster that had claimed their lives.
