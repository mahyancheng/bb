"
Kakashi vs. Obito
" (
カカシVSオビト
,
Kakashi tai Obito
) is episode 375 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

As the
Ten-Tails
 burns from Sasuke's Amaterasu,
Sai
 questions
Jūgo
 about
Sasuke
's true motives. Elsewhere, the rejuvenated
Kage
 make preparations to join the battle. On the battlefield,
Naruto
 instructs
Sasuke
 to put out the
flames
 once the beast is weakened so that he and
Kurama
 can extract the
tailed beasts
 but Sasuke refuses, as he intends to burn them all down and create a new system. Sai questions
Sakura
 about her views on Sasuke's return, but believes that her smile over the situation is fake. The Ten-Tails then easily separates its burning flesh from its body. Meanwhile, in
Kamui's dimension
,
Kakashi
 and
Obito
 pierce each other with a
Lightning Cutter
 and a
Fūma Shuriken
 respectively.
 Deciding to quit using
genjutsu
, Kakashi and Obito begin their real battle while thinking back to the time they
sparred
 as children. Kakashi reminisces about the young Obito's similarities to Naruto and decides that he must kill the current Obito. He impales Obito's heart with a
lightning
-
infused

kunai
, but Obito declares that he will not concede the
war
 and
teleports
 to the Ten-Tails' head. Easily dispatching
Hashirama
's
wood clone
, Madara notices Obito's return and causes
black chakra receivers
 to emerge from Obito's
right half
. Realising Madara is controlling Obito in order to fully
revive
 himself, Hashirama tells Naruto and Sasuke to deal with Obito while he and
Tobirama
 produce
clones
 to attack Madara as a contingency plan. As Obito's hair turns white from overexertion, Sasuke attempts to
attack
 him in vain, but Minato's
shadow clone

teleports
 to him and cuts him down. Shocked to learn that he was the masked man, Minato questions Obito, but he doesn't answer as the Ten-Tails is suddenly
absorbed
 into his body. Naruto informs Sasuke and Minato that Obito had resisted Madara's control, and the three observe his transformation into the Ten-Tails'
jinchūriki
.
