 The Plea…!!) is chapter 187 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

As their
chakra
 is slowly consumed by
Jirōbō
,
Shikamaru
 analyses the damage that
Kiba
 is doing to their rock prison in his attempts to break out. He offers to give up the others if Jirōbō will let him go, but Jirōbō refuses. Most of the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 concludes he is a traitor but
Chōji
, trusting Shikamaru, recognises that he has a plan. Shikamaru informs them that, although their prison repairs itself, the process is slowed at the point furthest from Jirōbō. With the help of
Neji
 they are able to pinpoint the slowest repairing point. Ashamed for doubting him, the team focuses their attacks on that area and are able to escape.
