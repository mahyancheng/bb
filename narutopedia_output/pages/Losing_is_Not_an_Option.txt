"
Losing is Not an Option!
" (
負けられない理由
,
Makerarenai Riyū
) is episode 117 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

After advancing his
cursed seal
 to its second state and creating a
bow and arrow
 with his webs,
Kidōmaru
 began shooting arrows at
Neji
's blind spot. Neji was able to block or evade the attacks enough to keep them from hitting vital areas, although was still left heavily damaged from each of Kidōmaru's attacks. Ready to finish the battle, Kidōmaru prepared his most deadly arrow for use, and fired it at Neji. Neji took the arrow at full force, although already knowing of his blind spot, moved at the last second to keep the arrow from piercing his heart. With Kidōmaru's arrow connected to him by a web thread, Neji sent his chakra into the thread, paralysing Kidōmaru. As Kidōmaru fell, Neji managed to use the last of his strength to catch up to him and attack with his
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
, hitting not only Kidōmaru's
tenketsu
 chakra points, but also his internal organs. As his injuries were too severe, Neji collapsed, leaving the retrieval of
Sasuke
 up to the others, while Kidōmaru's heart failed, killing him.
