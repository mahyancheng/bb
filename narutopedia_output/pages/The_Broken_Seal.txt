"
The Broken Seal
" (
解放された封印
,
Kaihō Sareta Fūin
) is episode 16 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Haku
 realises he can't keep being soft towards
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
, aiming for more vital spots instead of slicing their skin, although Naruto takes the full brunt of it. Refusing to accept an obvious defeat but running low on chakra, Naruto ends up fainting. Sasuke holds his own against Haku, protecting Naruto's unconscious body by activating his
Sharingan
, allowing him to track Haku's incredibly fast movements. Amazed at Sasuke also having a
Kekkei Genkai
 that awakened itself in battle, Haku realises he would have the disadvantage in a drawn out fight, as any attacks would just be deflected. Instead he targets a vulnerable Naruto with a volley of
senbon
, making Sasuke instinctively move to shield his teammate.

Elsewhere,
Kakashi
 has taken a hit from
Zabuza
's blade at a last second attempt to save
Sakura
 and
Tazuna
. Laughing, Zabuza goes on about almost losing the bridge builder as Kakashi was too worried about his students up ahead. Naruto wakes up to see Sasuke standing in front of him, struck and barely holding onto life. Shocked, Naruto catches him as he collapses and goes completely still. Believing his friend has died, Naruto’s enraged and subconsciously taps into the chakra of the
Nine-Tailed Fox
 within him. Kakashi and Zabuza sense the change, making Kakashi wonder if the seal was broken. Haku stares in disbelief as the fox’s power heals Naruto's wounds and changes his body.

Trivia

Cartoon Network
's airing of
