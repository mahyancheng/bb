"
A Binding Force
" (
繋ぐ力
,
Tsunagu Chikara
) is episode 196 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Delta
 is frustrated by
Koji
's ability to infiltrate
Konoha
 without triggering a response, as that puts him out of her oversight. At the Uzumaki household,
Kawaki
 stares at the glue tube
Boruto
 gave him.
Sarada
 and
Mitsuki
 visit Boruto, also wishing to get a look on Kawaki. Sarada asks Boruto how Kawaki is, recalling his outbursts when she spent time with him and
Naruto
. Naruto arrives and offers to postpone his
sparring
 with Boruto over the visitors. Boruto says it's no problem, and Naruto invites Kawaki to watch. Boruto and Naruto begin to spar, Kawaki recognising when Boruto uses
shadow clones
. He tells Boruto to just use the
Kāma
 already, activating his so Boruto's activates in response, as Boruto still can't activate it at will. Sparring resumes, Naruto and the spectators both noticing the increase in Boruto's performance. Boruto's
Lightning Release
 is even strong enough to dispel one of Naruto's shadow clones.
 Boruto manages to trick Naruto with a shadow clone, but ends up defeated. He's unsatisfied with his performance, but Naruto credits him on fighting smarter. The two perform the
Seal of Reconciliation
, which Sarada and
Himawari
 explain to Kawaki. Talking to Mitsuki later, Sarada feels inadequate thinking about Boruto's progress, and decides to train with her father to learn a jutsu only she can perform. Mitsuki is concerned about the risks associated with these powers. Kawaki recalls Boruto and Naruto's sparring and compares it to his own abusive training with
Jigen
. Kawaki asks Naruto about his training with Boruto, and Naruto invites him to join next time. Kawaki says he can't wield
chakra
, and is no
shinobi
, so Naruto explains the nature of chakra to him. Kawaki asks about shadow clones, believing using them to beat himself up to be an appropriate form of dealing with frustrations. Naruto advises against it, having done so himself in the past, and suggests having a rival. Boruto overhears them, and decides against complaining about the vase again. At the Uchiha household, Sarada and
Sasuke
 compliment
Sakura
's cooking, and Sarada asks her father to train her to learn the
Chidori
. The next day, Kawaki collects the broken vase and prepares to glue it back together. He is spotted by Koji, who
spies
 on him through the eyes of one of his toads.
