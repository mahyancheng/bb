The
Stone Swords
 (
石剣
,
Ishiken
) are secret
swords
 from
Mount Myōboku
. Slate grey in colour, the swords have a circular, hollow, pommel with a fairly long grip. A chain connects the pommel to the hilt of the sword which is joined to the blade. The wide blade itself has several markings resembling veins running down its length. These were used by Jiraiya after the
Demonic Illusion: Toad Confrontation Chant
 was cast to drive into his targets' body like a wedge.
