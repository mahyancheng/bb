"
The Night of the Tragedy
" (
惨劇の夜
,
Sangeki no Yoru
) is episode 359 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

With the increasing number of assignments,
Danzō
 appoints
Itachi
 to the rank of Anbu captain.
Koharu
 and
Homura
 voice their concerns at Itachi's promotion.
Kakashi
 warns Itachi not to get involved in any of the political problems of the higher-ups: the latter thanks Kakashi for all his assistance over the last two years. In the
Third Training Ground
,
Tenzō
 also voices concern over the promotion, but is stopped as
Yūgao
 appears and informs them that she is the replacement in the team. Elsewhere, Itachi informs Danzō that dissatisfaction is beginning to run high within the other members of the
Uchiha clan
.
 Back in the
Hokage Residence
,
Hiruzen
 informs Kakashi that an
intruder
 is entering the village undetected and bypassing the
barrier code
: in an attempt to find out who it is, Hiruzen tasks Kakashi with exploring all barrier placements to find out more. Within the Uchiha district, a
masked man
 appears to examine the rock, before exiting through a
warp portal
. In the
Academy
,
Guy
 watches on at the young students, when Kakashi appears and asks him to come with him. The pair walk through the
Uchiha
 district, where Kakashi notices a change in the atmosphere of the clan members, as if they did not want outsiders there. Elsewhere, Itachi reports to Danzō that the Uchiha intend on revolting. Later, Itachi asks the masked man for assistance and
annihilates the clan
. The Anbu, being too late to prevent the tragedy, are instead tasked with clearing up the field. At the same time, Itachi gives a warning to Danzō not to harm
his younger brother
 or confidential information would be leaked to every enemy nation. Before leaving, he asks for a secret meeting with Hiruzen, which talks about his forward intention and his brother's future. Hiruzen decides not to change the barrier code and permits Itachi to enter the village at any point if he is worried for Sasuke's well-being. Later, Kakashi is told of his change to become a teacher and that his time in the Anbu is over.

Trivia

In one scene, there is an animation error that an
Academy student
 is shown having an Uchiha crest on his back despite that scene happening after the incident.

The episode contradicts the statement that the Uchiha's growing resentment and mistrust towards Konoha was only known by the elders, Tobi, and Itachi, as
Kakashi
,
Tenzō
, and the rest of
Team Ro
, were told only minor details of the Uchiha's coup d'état, as they were merely told about a possible civil war, but without receiving the full details.
