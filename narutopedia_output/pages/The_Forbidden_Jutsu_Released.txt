Synopsis

Shiranami
 uses the
Tsuchigumo Style: Forbidden Life Technique Release: Creation of Heaven and Earth
 on
Hotaru
's seal in order to have her gather the
natural energy
 and
chakra
 in the surrounding environment in order to gain the power necessary to use the
Tsuchigumo clan
's
kinjutsu
.
Utakata
 and
Naruto
 follow the trail of the gathered chakra, where they see Hotaru being controlled by the
Character Bind Technique
. Shiranami reveals to them that he killed his own father and that he plans to control Hotaru, using her as the vessel for the kinjutsu, in order to challenge the Five
Kage
 and the
daimyō
 of all the nations in order to rule the world. Naruto attempts to punch him, but is stamped with the kanji through Shiranami's Character Bind technique, who proceeds to do the same to Utakata. Utakata, angered at Shiranami's use of the word 'vessel' to refer to Hotaru, uses a
bubble
 he had created earlier to
explode
 it in front of Shiranami, knocking him off his feet.

Using their
tailed beasts
' chakra, Utakata and Naruto manage to break free of the character bind, while Naruto uses his
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 to aid him in his attack. Outside,
Yamato
,
Sakura
 and
Sai
 have difficulty defeating the
Magaki Group
 as well the manipulated villagers who are attacking them. As Shiranami uses his kanji to dispel the
shadow clones
, he unleashes
Fury
, the
Tsuchigumo clan
's forbidden technique.
