The
Sage Art: White Rage Technique
 is a
senjutsu
 used by those who studied in the
Ryūchi Cave
 and mastered the
Sage Transformation
. After forming the necessary
hand seals
, the user expels a dragon-like entity from their mouth that carries an orb in its left front claw. As the dragon tightly coils itself around the orb, it releases both blinding light and deafening sound by making the air oscillate. This alone greatly hinders those in the vicinity but, due to the intensity of the resulting vibrations, paralysing pain is also induced. Thus, the technique both briefly inhibits the opponent's senses, as well as techniques that require their active concentration.

According to
Kabuto
, only he is capable of functioning normally whilst this technique is in effect, thanks to the properties of his
Sage Mode
 and his adopted abilities. Due to his
snake
 characteristics, Kabuto can close the
cornea
 of his eyes to completely block the harmful light, whilst instead relying upon the enhanced perception of his other senses to compensate for his obstructed vision. He can also
liquefy
 the insides of his body in order to negate the effects of the harsh sound vibrations.

Trivia

The name of this technique may be a pun on the Japanese word for "close attack" (
迫撃
,
hakugeki
).

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
, the dragon is depicted as white.
