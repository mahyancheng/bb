Trivia

The Hydrification Technique's name is intended to be a pun. "Suika" (
水化
) is the Japanese term for "hydration", but separately, the kanji mean "water" (
水
) and "to become" (
化
) respectively, translating to something more similar to "hydrification" ("to become water"). This explains the effect of this technique more precisely.
