This technique creates a flammable black mist that forms a small cloud. The user can then move the cloud above their target and disperse it, covering the target in flammable oil. This technique was first used to burn down
Idate Morino
's boat, after it was lit with fire.

Trivia

Although an anime-only technique, it is similar to
