" (
いのじん対ホウキ
,
Inojin tai Hōki
) is episode 223 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

On the day of the final round of the
Chūnin Exams
,
Boruto
 and
Mitsuki
 discuss becoming
chūnin
.
Himawari
 calls her brother. At the arena,
Konohamaru
 and
Shikamaru
 discuss its repair since
Momoshiki
's attack, and the broadcasting of the finals, since each village held its own exam separately. Himawari tells Boruto that she's been practising being shinobi with her friends
Ehō
 and
Yuina
, and they came across some suspicious individuals. Ehō and Yuina kept tracking them, but she was worried about it. Boruto agrees to check it, having time before the finals begin.
Naruto
 invites
Kawaki
 to watch the finals with him and cheer on Boruto, but he's not interested, so Naruto points out that as a round featuring battles, Kawaki might get to see all sorts of ninjutsu. Konohamaru explains the rules and win conditions of the fights.
Sarada
 is concerned by Boruto's and Mitsuki's absence, but they won't be disqualified if they arrive before their names are drawn for a fight.
Inojin Yamanaka
 and
Hōki Taketori
 are the first sorted to fight.
 Himawari takes Boruto and Mitsuki to meet Ehō and Yuina. The people they're tracking are talking to
Amado
, and put him on a train, which begins to leave. Boruto and Mitsuki hop on it.
Shikadai
 and
Chōchō
 discuss Hōki with Inojin. Likewise, Hōki reviews Inojin's jutsu with
Renga
 and
Hako
. Boruto and Mitsuki board the train. The first match begins with Inojin attacking with
his drawings
. Hōki counterattacks with an
Earth Release
,
raising columns
 all over the arena.
Iwabee
 is impressed by it. Inojin is disoriented by the pillars acting like a maze, and
Sai
 explains to Naruto that Hōki is going all around it memorising its layout. It allows him to strike from blindspots. Hōki recalls Sai explaining that the secretive nature of their missions means they're rarely acknowledged, but that
Kakashi
 was able to become
Hokage
 despite being former Anbu. Inojin decides to fly above the maze, but that allows Hōki to strike him with a pillar. As he falls, Inojin sends some birds Hōki's way as a distraction to allow him to hide. He's concerned by his earlier chakra expenditure. Inojin decides to use his
Mind Body Switch Technique
. Hōki tries provoking him by suggesting he concede the fight. Inojin doesn't respond, and recalling his previous fights, Hōki knows Inojin will try taking him over. Inojin leaves an ink trail to make Hōki attack him from a known position, and uses his jutsu. Inside Hōki's mind, Inojin is
attacked by a construct
 and is forced out. Hōki holds him at kunai point, and Konohamaru declares him the winner. Renga and Hako celebrate. Chōchō and Shikadai check on Inojin, who wonders what that was. Sai explains it's defensive jutsu against mind-reading, the kind taught to
Anbu
 members in the event they're captured by enemies, to safeguard information. Shikadai and Chōchō comment on how difficult and dangerous those are, and Renga and Hako arrive, saying that dangerous assignments are commonplace for them. Hōki thanks Sai for his training, and helps Inojin up, thanking him for pushing him to give his all. Everyone watching celebrates the good match. After the arena is cleared, the names for the second match are drawn, Iwabee Yuino and
Wasabi Izuno
. Sarada is concerned by her team-mates still being absent. Boruto and Mitsuki are unable to find Amado and his captors in the train.
