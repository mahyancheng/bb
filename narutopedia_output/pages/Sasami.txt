Personality

Sasami, like her brother, is a very sadistic person, delighting in the suffering of others and likewise will taunt them with equal joy. She is also obsessed with power, delighting in the feel of increased might from her cursed seal. At the same time, she is a very alert individual, able to see through deception based on the nature of her opponent's movements.

Sasami wears a black and white kimono jacket with a belt, dark shorts and knee-length shinobi sandals. She also wears two yellow ties around her head.

New Era

Jūgo Arc

Main article:
Jūgo Arc

Sasami and
Momo
 confronted and prevented
Team 15
 from requesting backup from
Konoha
. They managed to immobilise
Namida Suzumeno
 and
Wasabi Izuno
 by using the opportunity to test their device based cursed seals while
Sumire Kakei
 reluctantly escaped with
Nue
. They later disguised themselves as researchers from the Land of Rivers and brought Namida and Wasabi, both infected with the cursed seal, back to the village, informing
Team 7
 that they only found the two members of Team 15 unconscious but did not find Sumire.

After the Land of Rivers researchers took custody of the incapacitated
Jūgo
 and the entire village turned against the Konoha-nin, she and her brother stood before Jūgo with the head researcher preparing to experiment on him. Later, after delighting in watching Wasabi Izuno and Namida Suzumeno's suffering from their cursed seals, Momo and Sasami were sent to search for the Konoha shinobi wandering in the forest. There, they noticed "
Sumire
" running by. The siblings quickly pursued her. During the chase, Sasami realised it was a diversion from how their target was deliberately staying just ahead of them. Momo then fell back to the base, while she went on ahead and encountered Sarada and
Karin
.






Sasami defeated by Sarada.



Once transformed, she quickly began making sport of her opponents, treating them as prey. Karin's sensory prowess and Sarada's Sharingan let them follow her movements enough to defend themselves. However, as Sarada's chakra continued to drain from overusing her dōjutsu, Sasami managed to land a powerful blow on her. Karin was able to subdue Sasami with her
chakra chains
 long enough for Sarada to
take
 some of Karin's chakra, letting her deliver a
devastating punch
 that knocked Sasami out and destroyed her collar device.
