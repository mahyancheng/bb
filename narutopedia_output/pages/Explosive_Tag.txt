Explosive Tags
 (
起爆札
,
Kibaku Fuda
) are sheets of paper inscribed with a special seal, centering around the kanji for "explode" (
爆
,
baku
). Infused with chakra, they will explode after a set amount of time, remotely, or after being ignited by flame.
 The tags can be attached to a surface or wrapped around a weapon to be thrown at an enemy. They are very versatile and one of the most basic ninja tools. Ninja can confuse their enemies by obtaining fake explosive tags.
 They work even under heavy rain.

When an explosive tag is detonated remotely, ninja tend to use the "Rat"
hand seal
. Additionally, when used remotely, explosive tags can be detonated in sequence, allowing them to be used to trap opponents.
