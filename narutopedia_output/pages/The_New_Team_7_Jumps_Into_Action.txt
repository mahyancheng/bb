 anime.

Synopsis

At night,
Isari
 sails to
Kirigakure
 with a fleet. A governor allied with him comments on their partnership before going inside. Isari and his subordinate
Jibiki
 dislike the quiet ocean, and wish for it be a raging ocean. In
Konoha
,
Kawaki
 is officially placed into
Team 7
. Their first mission together is to escort
Katasuke
 to Kirigakure for the unveiling of their new power system. They're also ordered to covertly investigate a potential terrorist threat during the ceremony. On the train to get to their ship, Kawaki is mesmerised by the ocean, seeing it for the first time. He feels less so on the boat, getting seasick. Kawaki goes to rest inside. The rest of Team 7 reminisces about their previous visit to Kirigakure.
Mitsuki
 asks for details about the ceremony Katasuke will attend. He explains that the
Land of Water
's recent growth can be traced to advancements to their energy grid. Katasuke is among several foreign technical experts invited to the opening of their newest power plant. Kawaki is still seasick when they arrive, so they tell him to rest.
Sarada
 recalls
Team 5
 is also on a mission in the Land of Water, and Katasuke informs them of the details, and that he'll join them after the ceremony.
 They noticed the increased security, owing to the terrorist threat, and get exasperated by Katasuke constantly getting distracted and slipping away to check on electronic goods. This causes them to be late for the start of the ceremony, where only Katasuke is allowed inside. The orator presents the
Shinonome 1
 power plant in the ocean, one of 8 facilities built over a decade which can harness sea power for power generation, which the added benefit of pacifying turbulent waters and currents. Among the foreign visitors is the
Land of Lightning's daimyō
.
Boruto
 splits from the group, looking for
Kagura
, and discovers protesters against the power plant. A guard informs him that Kagura now reports directly to the
Mizukage
, but chose to act as a prison warden. At the prison, among the prisoners he oversees are
Buntan
 and
Hebiichigo
. After his speech, the orator tells his son Awaji he'll inherit it all one day.
Chōjūrō
 announces everyone will be flown to see the Shinonome 1 up close. Boruto rejoins the group, updating them on Kagura. Katasuke allows Boruto to go visit Kagura under the pretence of wanting to inspect it, since they'll have to depart once they're back from the Shinonome 1. Feeling better, Kawaki joins them and tells Boruto to hurry up. At the prison, Boruto is searched before getting inside, and meets up with Kagura. He tells Boruto that some of the swordsmen from their previous encounter are being held in the prison, but
Shizuma
 escaped and killed the previous warden.
Hassaku
 and
Ichirōta
, who helped him, were caught and moved to a different prison. He trusts that
Kyohō
, Hebiichigo, and Buntan didn't try to escape, and took over as warden because he believes that to grow Kirigakure, they need to nurture the people. Boruto praises the Land of Water's economic growth, and Kagura explains that some disagree with the daimyō's decisions. Boruto compares the complexity of the situation to his evolving stance on
scientific ninja tools
. Kagura shows Boruto around, including the highest security cells.
Araumi Funato
, head of a
pirate clan
, is suspended off the ground. His clan has plundered the opens seas of the Land of Water for years, and abducted many people. The clan supposedly scattered after Araumi's capture five years prior. Araumi is kept on an glass dome with intense heat, and Kagura warns Boruto that giving him any moisture would be dangerous. Chōjūrō begins organising the departure to the Shinonome 1 by airship. Boruto prepares to head back. The first airship takes off with the wealthy industrialists, but it crashes and explodes. Kawaki protects his group from the shrapnel. Isari watches it from a sea cliff.
