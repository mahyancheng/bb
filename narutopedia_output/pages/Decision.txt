Summary

While
Tsunade
 is busy healing all of the
Konoha
 villagers,
Danzō
 keeps his
Root
 personnel from helping in the village's defence, wishing for Tsunade to fail and thus allow him to become
Hokage
. Meanwhile,
Inoichi
 continues to probe the mind of the
Amegakure

prisoner
, and finds memories of him taking the dead body of a woman to the tallest building in Amegakure.
Shizune
 arrives to pool their findings on
Pain
, unaware that two Pains have arrived outside. Elsewhere, the
Deva Path
 leaves the site of its battle with
Kakashi
. Both Kakashi and
Chōji
 have survived, though only the latter can move. Kakashi sends Chōji to Tsunade to tell her of the Deva Path's abilities. The still-active
Asura Path
 tries to stop him. Kakashi uses his
Kamui
 to stop the attack, but he dies in the process.
