Anko rushes her target with a series of slashes with a twin-knee-leap in-between followed by another slash into a kunai reap, then finishes by
releasing snakes
 from both wrists.

In both
Clash of Ninja Revolution 3
 and
Gekitō Ninja Taisen! Special
, Anko uses the finisher straightaway instead on its own, along with the snakes/hitboxes being shot-out as a larger funnel array.

Trivia

Akin to the
Nine-Tailed Naruto Wild Attack
, this attack's entire sequence despite requiring an initial blow will scale normally with damage scaling due to not being a cinematic attack.
