Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

As he continues defending
his comrades
 from
Obito
 and
Madara
's various attacks,
Naruto
 begins to tire from micromanaging
Kurama
's
chakra
, and Kurama warns him about it. Obito confronts Naruto and ridicules him on his defensive strategy but Naruto replies that the presence of his comrades gives him power and their absence hurts him. Elsewhere, Madara grows increasingly excited at
sensing

Hashirama
's chakra. Obito remarks how the
Ten-Tails
 is beyond suppression as it unleashes the
Tenpenchii
.
Kakashi
 attempts stopping it with his
Kamui
 before he is intercepted by his former team-mate and the two go to the
other dimension
 and the former puts his trust in Naruto.
 The Ten-Tails's technique causes massive destruction yet the shinobi survive thanks to Naruto and much to Madara's shock. Unfortunately, the young jinchūriki is worn out and injured, leaving
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 and causing the cloaks of the alliance to fade away. The Ten-Tails senses several
tailed beasts
' chakra within the young ninja and increases it's power. Grateful,
Hinata
 and some shinobi stand as Naruto's defence as
Sakura
 heals him. Landing better, Kakashi gains the upper hand against Obito, having a
Lightning Cutter
 aimed at him. Obito comments on how just like before, Kakashi has a chance to finish him off but hesitates. Kakashi still tries to persuade his old team-mate into reverting to how he was before but is taunted about failing and still believing so. The
Uchiha
 explains that he is able to mock Naruto now because he was once like him. He goes on to reveal that he is aware of the true story of
Rin
's death being that
Kiri
-nin planned to use her to unleash the
Three-Tails
 on
Konoha
 and she purposely made herself to die by Kakashi's hand to protect her village. Alas, he uses
genjutsu
 to show his former team-mate that his heart is empty and the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 can help people to fill the holes in their hearts. Nonetheless, Kakashi argues that Rin is dead from her sacrifice and the dream world is nonsense. Outside, the Ten-Tails begins preparing a large
Tailed Beast Ball
 much to the horror of the Alliance.
