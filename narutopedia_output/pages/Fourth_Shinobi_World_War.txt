The
Fourth Shinobi World War
 (
第四次忍界大戦
,
Daiyoji Ninkai Taisen
,
English TV:
 Fourth Great Ninja War) was a conflict between the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 and
Akatsuki
. The battle began on the 8th of October and lasted until the 10th, with the complete victory of the Allied Shinobi Forces, the collapse of Akatsuki, and the sealing of the
Ten-Tails
.

Preparations for War





Tobi declares the Fourth Shinobi World War against the Five Great Shinobi Countries.



Its beginning was declared by
Tobi
 when the five
Kage
 and the leader of the
Land of Iron
 unanimously refused to surrender the
Eight
 and
Nine-Tails
 for his
Eye of the Moon Plan
. He then stated that he would use the seven
tailed beasts
 already captured by the
Akatsuki
 in combating the ninja world. After this the
Fifth Kazekage
, the
Fifth Mizukage
, the
Fourth Raikage
, the
Third Tsuchikage
, and General
Mifune
 agreed to form a Shinobi Alliance, pooling all their resources against Tobi. Later the
daimyō
 of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 approved the coalition and the
Fifth Hokage
 joined the alliance while
Kabuto Yakushi
 formed an alliance with Tobi.

Both factions began by gathering their strength and collecting intelligence about the other side in preparation for the upcoming hostilities.
Kisame
 gathered intelligence on
Kumogakure
's military strength and on
Killer B
 while travelling with him everywhere hidden inside
Samehada
.
Anko Mitarashi
 and her
team
 tracks Kabuto Yakushi, which led them to Tobi's
headquarters
. Other Shinobi Alliance teams have fanned out to collect other information about Akatsuki and their hideouts.

At the start, Kabuto had formed an alliance with Tobi, demonstrating his use of the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 technique and increasing the forces of Akatsuki with the reincarnation of deceased members of the organisation. Most of the Five Kage had also decided to hide the two remaining
jinchūriki
,
Naruto
 and Killer B on an
island in the Land of Lightning
. Hiding Killer B and Naruto had the unintended result of allowing Naruto to learn to control the Nine-Tails chakra, much like the way Killer B has of the Eight-Tails (in the anime, however, Tsunade had intended for Naruto to train with B from the beginning). Having been successful in his training, Naruto has exhibited increased speed and strength when utilising the controlled chakra of the Nine-Tails but lacks the same finesse that Killer B had exhibited in utilising the Eight-Tails', crashing into the wall and crushing rocks whenever he uses the Nine-Tails chakra.

Despite being captured in the end and committing suicide to keep the information he held secret, Kisame was able to finish Akatsuki's preparations for the War by sending a summon shark with a scroll to his comrades, divulging the proximate location of the Turtle Island. With the battle between the two forces seeming to be on the horizon, Tobi dispatched Kabuto to retrieve the Nine-Tails and Eight-Tails with the reincarnated
Deidara
, but was stopped by Ōnoki,
Akatsuchi
 and
Kurotsuchi
 who were going to reinforce the forces on the Island Turtle. Kabuto escaped with
Yamato
, further adding to the intelligence sources that Akatsuki has on the Shinobi Alliance and also strengthening the
White Zetsu Army
 clones with Yamato's powers.

Both the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 and Akatsuki have amassed considerable forces for this war; 80,000 shinobi and samurai total make up the Alliance versus 100,000
Zetsu
 clones and reincarnated shinobi supplied by Kabuto making up Tobi's army.

Sides

Allied Shinobi Forces





The Allied Shinobi Forces' "Great Battle Regiment".



The
Allied Shinobi Forces
 created by the Five Great Nations and the Samurai of the Land of Iron consists of five main divisions, with
Gaara
 of the Sand as the Regimental Commander. The First Division consists of mid-range fighters and is led by
Darui
. The Second Division is made up of close-range fighters and is led by
Kitsuchi
. The Third Division is under the command of
Kakashi Hatake
, and features both close- and mid-range fighters. The Fourth Division contains only long-range fighters under the control of
Gaara
.
Shikamaru
 is Gaara's right hand man and proxy commander of the Fourth Division as well. Finally, the Fifth division was created for the purpose of special operations, and features ninja with unique skills.
Mifune
 is the leader of these special operatives. There are also four special divisions formed for the war. The
Logistical Support and Medical Division
 led by
Shizune
 comprises of medical ninja, the
Surprise Attack Division
 led by
Kankurō
, has the task to ambush the enemy forces. The third is the
Sensor Division
 with
Ao
 as captain, and finally the
Intelligence Division
 headed by
Inoichi Yamanaka
 is intended to gather information and relay it to Gaara for strategy's sake.

. Their primary military force is composed of 100,000
Zetsu clones
 created through a combination of the
tailed beasts
' chakra and
Hashirama Senju
's power. Tobi plans to use
Sasuke Uchiha
 once he has recovered from his
Mangekyō Sharingan
 transplant.
Kabuto Yakushi
 has also formed an alliance with Akatsuki,
reincarnating
 a large number of once-famous and powerful shinobi to supplement the
White Zetsu Army
, including several former members of Akatsuki.

Strategies

Allied Shinobi Forces

Initial Deployment






A diagram illustrating the Allied Shinobi Force's initial deployment.



Analysing their own and their enemy's location, the Allied Shinobi Forces have decided that Akatsuki will send a small fraction of their army by sea from the
Mountains' Graveyard
 (Akatsuki's hideout) to Kumogakure, and that most of the army will travel by land. This would require the army to move through both the
Land of Frost
 and the
Land of Hot Water
. An immediate evacuation notice was sent to both countries, and they will most likely evacuate to the south, in the
Land of Fire
. The
First Division
, which is the mid-range battle division, is stationed in the northern part of the
Land of Lightning
, in order to prevent the Akatsuki from using the small gulf to infiltrate the area from Mountains' Graveyard. The
Second Division
, or short-range battle division, is on the border of the Land of Lightning and the Land of Frost, sealing a northerly path into the Land of Lightning. The
Third Division
, or the short- to mid-range battle division, was advancing fast through the middle of the Land of Frost, but was called into the northern part of the Land of Hot Water to aid the
Surprise Attack Division
. The
Fourth Division
, the long-range battle division, is on the border of the Land of Lightning and the Land of Frost, sealing a southerly path into the Land of Lightning.
Mifune
's
Fifth Division
, the special battle division, is aligned in a large arc from the north part of the Land of Frost, through the middle of the border between the Land of Frost and the Land of Lightning, all the way to just south of the First Division, in order to aid any of the divisions that need immediate response, and to finish the seal on the Land of Frost and the Land of Lightning's border.

Secondary Deployment






The initial Secondary deployment of the forces.



As the confrontation develops, resulting in both the First and Fourth Divisions opposing two separate yet equally significant contingents of the enemy's forces,
Shikaku Nara
 devises a strategy to better reflect the conflict's current developments. Confronted with two distinct groups, the decision is made not to individualise the targets and instead concentrate entirely on those facing Darui's First Division, by connecting their forces with those stationed within the Easterly end of Mifune's Fifth Division. The majority of
Kitsuchi
's Second Division will move simultaneously to this, proceeding along the ocean and sandwiching the enemy force in a pincer-manoeuvre, while the remainder attends to the adversaries that they are already battling.






The secondary deployment with support.



Consequently, this will severely thin out the Second Division but as the Fifth Division fills in the gaps left behind by the Second Division, it will match that of the Fifth Division's formation, which then provides a solitary yet solid line of defence. As this occurs, Gaara's Fourth Division will make a slow retreat while moving into a sideways chevron formation, luring the enemy into following them. Eventually the top portion of this 'line' will break away and join the First Division, giving them yet further support.

Once the first targeted group of enemies is defeated, the joint forces of the First and supporting Fourth Division will switch to the remaining opposition at Gaara's Fourth Division, approaching from behind and decimating them in a single decisive strike. However; this preliminary plan relies upon the swift mobilisation of the Second and Fifth Divisions, so as to best employ Kitsuchi's units experience in combating the current enemy, and the belief that the opposition will be unable to mount a full attack upon the retreating long-range battle division, due partially to the enemy's suspicion over why the Fourth Division would split and their inability to get in close.

Night-time Deployment

As darkness falls and the remainder of the troops reallocate their forces in favour of observation, the Alliance takes the opportunity to centralise the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
 behind their defences to attend to all the wounded shinobi. The compound is guarded by two
Akimichi clan
 members at its only entrance and the chakra of anyone entering the compound is verified and cross referenced with the Alliance's headquarters, to prevent the infiltration of hostile intruders.

However, in spite of these various precautions, the Alliance's considerable defences fail to thwart the intrusion of a significant quantity of
disguised
 White Zetsu Army clones and the resultant fatalities caused by the opposition's subsequent movements. As chaos ensues with individuals unable to ascertain friend from foe due to the chakra mimicking properties of the aforementioned clones, Shikaku Nara is tasked with the creation of a solution to counter this sudden perilous development. Despite much thought, he concludes that only Naruto's recently awakened
capability
 to
discern a person's "
evil
" intent
, presents a viable resolution and due to his
Shadow Clone Technique
, many of the issues occurring within the dispersed divisions are solved simultaneously. This decision prompts the mobilisation of both jinchūriki in preparation for the following day.

Akatsuki

Day One Deployment

Much less was initially known about the Akatsuki strategy, but it was made evident that their primary objective remained the acquisition of the surviving jinchūriki. From the small amount of information that had been divulged; Kabuto would maintain direct manipulation of the movements of the reincarnated individuals until they had reached their appointed destinations, with the intention of eradicating their personalities when the actual conflict began to turn them into mindless implements of death, while still manipulating any emotional response they could potentially illicit to full advantage, in the hopes of inflicting further damage. During the course of this approach, a small
Surprise Attack and Diversion Platoon
 (comprised of
Sasori
,
Deidara
,
Chūkichi
 and
Shin
) would attack from the air, utilising bombs and traps to disperse the enemy. However, realising that the movement of their entire army in such a large and apparent fashion would be far too conspicuous, the decision was instead undertaken to dislocate the 100,000 White Zetsu Army clones beneath the ground, in order to thoroughly conceal the approach of the main contingent of their forces. Though a large amount of these clones were eventually unearthed, thousands more were able to proceed unobstructed underground to their respective battlegrounds, due in part to the diversionary tactics made possible by the addition of Kabuto's reincarnated shinobi.

Concurrent to the developing conflict, Black Zetsu would utilise the resulting turmoil in order to infiltrate the
daimyō
's safe house as per Tobi's orders, with the sole intention of using these valued captives as bargaining chips to draw out the jinchūriki. However, with the jinchūriki's decision to expose themselves and take direct action before this assignments completion, it was deemed unnecessary and so Black Zetsu's role was altered to instead engage with the daimyō's guards, ensuring their continued separation from the remainder of the Allied Shinobi Forces.

Night-time Deployment

As the confrontation progresses and night falls upon the first day, Tobi's true intentions and the reasons behind his confidence in his original strategy, which didn't account for Kabuto's inclusion or contributions, is revealed. The two opposing sides would effectively be forced into a staring contest as the Allied Shinobi Forces focus on tightening defences and tending to the wounded or resting. Tobi, aware that this would make the Allied Shinobi completely reliant upon their
sensor
 shinobi in order to remain vigilant, then begins taking advantage of this by utilising the Zetsu clones'
Substitute Technique
 in conjunction with the chakra obtained from members of the Allied Shinobi Forces during the previous battles. By covertly placing these transformed Zetsu among the injured and scattered troops of the Allied Shinobi, they could then proceed to assassinate any isolated individuals while remaining undetected. This results in causing chaos and disagreement within the ranks of the Allied Shinobi who begin to suspect one another of committing these deeds without any definitive proof, but while also minimising the causalities suffered by the Akatsuki forces in the process. In addition, the attack of the transformed Zetsu also aimed to force the shinobi alliance to counter these insurgents, placing Naruto in the battlefield whose ability to
recognise "
evil
" intent
 Tobi has learned from the intel gathered by Kisame.

Unbeknownst to the opposition, Tobi had also begun developing further contingencies in preparation for the second day of the conflict, creating his own
Six Paths of Pain
 by utilising the former jinchūriki and customising them with both a
Rinnegan
 and a
Sharingan
.

Naruto Uzumaki
's
shadow clones
 enables the Third Division to deal with the remaining Akatsuki forces.

 to unearth them. In an opening salvo the Second Division is able to destroy scores of White Zetsu, but it quickly descends into one of attrition, tiring much of the Second Division and allowing many White Zetsu to escape. Most of the Second Division is sent in pursuit of these Zetsu by assisting the
First Division
, leaving their remaining forces to face a new threat: White Zetsu that have infiltrated the Alliance. Members of the Second Division are slowly eliminated by the Zetsu and left uncertain about who to trust until the second day when the arrival of one of
Naruto Uzumaki

When the war begins, the
First Division
 is stationed along the north-western coast of the
Land of Lightning
. They are soon confronted by the reincarnated shinobi and White Zetsu that escaped the
Second Division
's defence along the country's perimeter. The two sides engage each other, with Division Commander
Darui
 facing off with the
Gold and Silver Brothers
. Darui initially struggles with the brothers and their
Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths
, but eventually is able to turn the tools against the brothers to capture
Ginkaku
 in their own
Benihisago
. This enrages
Kinkaku
 to the point that he enters a
version 2
 form, which he uses to tear through the First Division. After reinforcements from the Second,
Fourth
, and
Fifth
 arrive and the Alliance HQ sends the
Kohaku no Jōhei
 to the battlefield, Kinaku is captured.

In order to force the Allies' cooperation,
Black Zetsu
 is sent to capture the
daimyō
 of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
. He is found and stopped by the
Daimyō Protection Squad
 almost immediately after he arrives at the secret compound. Before he begins fighting he senses
Naruto Uzumaki
's appearance on the battlefield and informs
Tobi
 of this development. The daimyō's capture ceases to matter, but Black Zetsu is instructed to keep the Daimyō Protection Squad busy. One of Naruto's
shadow clones
 arrives on the second day to help capture Black Zetsu.

Night One

At the end of the first day of the battle, both the Alliance and Akatsuki received massive casualties, having effectively halved both their battle forces. The 80,000 strong Allied Shinobi Forces were brought down to 40,000 and the 100,000 strong
White Zetsu Army
 was brought down to 50,000, on top of the several already sealed reincarnated shinobi.

During the day of fighting, members of the White Zetsu Army
infiltrated
 the Alliance's ranks. Once night falls, the disguised Zetsu begin methodically eliminating key Allied personnel all across the battlefield. The Alliance is thrown into disarray until
Sakura Haruno
 is able to determine what is happening. Despite this, there are no effective countermeasures against the Zetsu and vigilance is unable to prevent additional deaths. Suspicion reigns over the Allies.

 victory.

The
Fourth Division
 encounters the reincarnated
Mū
 on the first day of hostilities. Akatsuki responds by sending the
Second Mizukage
, the
Third Raikage
, and the
Fourth Kazekage
 to reinforce Mū. The Alliance likewise sends
Ōnoki
 to assist the Fourth Division. Despite this, the Fourth Division avoids conflict until the second day when other Divisions – their own battles won – can be called in to help.

Gaara
 launches the first attack – which in turn is countered by the Fourth Kazekage's
gold dust
 – Ōnoki engages Mū, and elements of the
First Division
 attack the Raikage and Mizukage from the rear. The Fourth Kazekage is captured and sealed while protecting the Raikage and Mizukage, but the remaining Kage are more elusive: the Raikage is largely impervious to damage, the Mizukage and his summoned
clam
 cannot be located in their
mirage
, and Ōnoki is unable to overpower Mū.

When
Naruto
's shadow clone arrives it takes Mū by surprise and, in the ensuing confusion, Mū is sealed before he can respond. Naruto next focuses on the Third Raikage, whose defences are impenetrable and whose attacks are unstoppable. When his and the Alliance's combined efforts can do nothing against the Raikage, Naruto manoeuvres the Raikage against himself, using his own attacks to break his own defences and creating an opening to seal him. Meanwhile, Gaara and Ōnoki face-off with the Mizukage. They're able to destroy the Mizukage's clam, but struggle with his
Steaming Danger Tyranny
. Gaara is ultimately able to sneak some of the Fourth Kazekage's remaining gold dust into the Mizukage's technique, neutralising it and allowing the Mizukage to be sealed.

Outcome
: Heavy Allied Shinobi casualties. All Kage critically wounded. Mū released from the Impure World Reincarnation. Madara severed contract with technique and rendezvous with Tobi.
Akatsuki
 victory.

When he was attacked by
Naruto
's shadow clone earlier,
Mū
's body instinctively
split
 in two, of which only one was sealed. The second half cannot release the first half, so
Kabuto
 uses the only option he has left: he uses Mū as a medium to summon a reincarnated
Madara Uchiha
. Kabuto encourages Madara to show what made him so legendary, which Madara obliges by attacking the nearby
Fourth Division
.
Gaara
,
Ōnoki
, Naruto's shadow clone, and the rest of the Allies present are already outmatched by Madara, which is only made worse when Madara drops two
meteorites
 upon them, wiping out most of the Fourth Division. Madara attacks the survivors with
Wood Release Secret Technique: Nativity of a World of Trees
, which Naruto does his best to defend against.

Naruto's shadow clone is beginning to run low on chakra and cannot hold out against Madara for much longer. The three remaining
Kage
 (
A
,
Tsunade
, and
Mei Terumī
) arrive on the battlefield to join Gaara and Ōnoki against Madara, instructing Naruto to trust the fight to them. Naruto's clone vanishes, remnants of the Fourth Division pursue Mū's half, and the Kage engage Madara. Although the Kage pull off some attacks that impress even Madara, they cannot hope to defeat him so long as he is an immortal reincarnation that recovers from all injuries. All they can hope to do is endure against Madara's various powers until Kabuto is defeated and the Impure World Reincarnation is broken.

As night starts to fall, the Kage cannot last much longer, Madara having
multiple clones
 that are each using
Susanoo
 to outnumber them five-to-one. Before he can wage a final attack, Madara is engulfed in light and his soul begins to ascend, Kabuto having elsewhere been defeated. Madara releases himself from the influence of the Impure World Reincarnation, granting him an immortal body. Free to do what he wants, Madara decides to go find Naruto. The Kage try to stop him, but each is brought to the verge of death in an unseen battle and Madara escapes.

Outcome
: The six tailed beasts are resealed in the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path. The six reincarnated jinchūriki are released from the Impure World Reincarnation. Ten-Tails is revived. Tactical Akatsuki victory.

Tobi
 uses the reincarnated bodies of the former
jinchūriki
 to create his own
Six Paths of Pain
, each with their old
tailed beasts
 sealed back into them. They converge on
Killer B
 and the real
Naruto
 and engage them in battle. After a brief exchange B is able to restrain and nearly seal all six, but they free themselves by entering
version 2
 forms. In the chaos created by these stronger opponents, Tobi almost captures Naruto, but he is stopped by the arrival of
Kakashi Hatake
 and
Might Guy
.

Tobi begins to have some of the jinchūriki enter
Tailed Beast Mode
 to overwhelm the Allied shinobi. The
Four-Tails
 goes after and swallows Naruto, which gives its jinchūriki,
Rōshi
, a chance to communicate to Naruto how to release them from Tobi's control. Naruto escapes from the Four-Tails' mouth and locates the
chakra receiver
 on its body. By removing it he frees Rōshi and the Four-Tails, to which Tobi responds by first reclaiming the Four-Tails and then by having all the other jinchūriki fully transform. The
Nine-Tails
 is touched by Naruto's determination to help its fellow tailed beasts and thus gives its full cooperation to Naruto. Their new and improved
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 allows them to defeat and free the other tailed beasts, but Tobi reclaims them into
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 too.

Tobi fights Naruto, B, Kakashi, and Guy by himself until he is alerted to
Kabuto
's defeat. Running out of options, he initiates a premature revival of the
Ten-Tails
 by depositing the sealed
Gold and Silver Brothers
 (who contain remnants of the Nine-Tail' chakra) and one of the
Eight-Tails
' tentacles into the Statue. He places a barrier around it as it undergoes its transformation and engages his four opponents in the meantime. Their efforts to attack Tobi fail until they notice a connection between his ability to become intangible and Kakashi's
Kamui
. By taking advantage of this connection, they are able to land a successful attack and destroy his mask, finally revealing him as Obito Uchiha.

Moments after his identity is exposed, Obito is joined by
Madara
, having just finished up with the five
Kage
. Noticing that the Statue has not had the Eight or Nine-Tails sealed into it yet, Madara attempts to take the beasts from Naruto and B before the Ten-Tails is revived. Kakashi and Guy defend them while Naruto and B try to destroy the Statue, but they are too late and the Ten-Tails is revived.

Sound Four
, the research of
Orochimaru
, and a
Sage Mode
 he's trained to perfection. The Uchiha brothers defend themselves, helped particularly by their
Susanoo
. Ultimately, Itachi traps Kabuto in the endless loop of
Izanami
. Defeated, Kabuto is compelled via genjutsu to release Impure World Reincarnation, sending Itachi and the other reincarnated shinobi back to the afterlife.

forced
 to
resurrect
 Madara.
Allied Shinobi Forces
 tactical victory.
Akatsuki
 strategic victory.

Though the
Ten-Tails
 is restored, it will still be some time before the
moon
 is in a position to complete the
Eye of the Moon Plan
.
Madara
 and
Obito
 therefore opt to eliminate the opposition in the meantime. They take control of the Ten-Tails and use it to try and destroy
Naruto
,
B
,
Kakashi
, and
Guy
, but the remaining Allied Shinobi Forces arrive in time to stop the attack. They combine their efforts to restrain and bind the Ten-Tails, but the victory is brief; the Ten-Tails transforms and frees itself.

Madara and Obito recognise the coordination involved to bring such a huge force together so effectively and use the Ten-Tails to destroy the Allied HQ to prevent future coordinating. Almost all stationed there are killed,
Ao
 being the only known survivor, but
Shikaku Nara
 is able to communicate one final attack plan to the Allies. Many ninja die as they move into position – including
Neji Hyūga
 – but they are able to pull off Shikaku's final plan and sever the connection between the Ten-Tails and the Uchihas. Freed, the Ten-Tails prepares to use
Tenpenchii
. Kakashi attempts to send the beast away, but Obito intercepts him and warps them both to the
other dimension
. Tenpenchii levels the area but none are killed due to the protective cloak Naruto coats everyone with.

Before the Ten-Tails can launch another attack it is stopped by the arrived
Hokage
, reincarnated by
Orochimaru
 at the direction of
Sasuke
.
Hashirama Senju
 restrains the Ten-Tails and he and the other Hokage trap it in a barrier. Though it can't move, the Ten-Tails spawns
miniature clones of itself
 to protect it. The Allies fight its copies but it becomes apparent that the Ten-Tails is on the verge of a final transformation. Naruto, Sasuke, and
Sakura
 join forces against it, badly damaging it.

Meanwhile, in the other dimension, Kakashi and Obito spar. Being old comrades, Obito tries to convince Kakashi that his actions are right and that the world as it is must be eliminated. Kakashi refuses to agree and badly wounds Obito, forcing him to retreat back to the real world. When Madara senses Obito's return, Madara tries to take advantage of him in his weakened state to force Obito to restore him to life. Obito resists and instead seals the Ten-Tails into his body, becoming its jinchūriki. The Hokage, no longer preoccupied with restraining the Ten-Tails, attack it, only to discover Obito's new power cancels out the regenerative advantages of their reincarnated bodies. The Allies try various methods of damaging Obito, but only
senjutsu
 has any kind of success.

With the moon nearly in position, Obito transforms into the Ten-Tails' final form: a giant tree capable of absorbing chakra from anyone it touches. With their numbers dwindling and time running out, the Allies prepare for one final assault. Naruto and Sasuke launch a final attack while the remaining allies, rallied by their respective newly rejuvenated Kage, provide support. The tailed beasts the Ten-Tails is composed of are stripped from Obito and released, leaving him defeated and unable to move. Because Obito is no longer able to resist,
Black Zetsu
 takes control of him and forces him to
revive
 Madara.

Outcome
: The nine tailed beasts (except
Kurama
's Yin half) are resealed within the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path.
Madara
 becomes the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki. Yin-Kurama and parts of Shukaku and Gyūki are sealed into Naruto. Madara activates the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
. Akatsuki victory.

Though living again, Madara is left unable to see, having forfeited his eyes shortly before his original death. Until he can reacquire them he immobilises Hashirama and absorbs his
senjutsu
 chakra to allow him to sense things around him. His first order of business is capturing the tailed beasts again. He is initially no match for the nine beasts until a White Zetsu delivers one of his
Rinnegan
 to him. He uses it to summon the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path from Obito's body and then quickly seals all the tailed beasts, including B's Eight-Tails and Naruto's Nine-Tails, into it, triggering another rebirth of the Ten-Tails. Sasuke tries to stop him, so Madara stabs him with his own sword.

Meanwhile,
Tobi
 keeps the Allied Shinobi Forces occupied with
Sage Art Wood Release: True Several Thousand Hands
 to battle them. Naruto, dying from the removal of the Nine-Tails, is delivered to the reincarnated
Minato Namikaze
 by
Gaara
 so that the half of the Nine-Tails' chakra that Minato has can be sealed into him. Black Zetsu intercepts the transfer and takes the Nine-Tails' chakra for itself, but this creates an opening for Obito to reclaim control of his body. Obito, having finally decided he was wrong, escapes to the other dimension with Naruto and Sakura (who is providing emergency life support), where he begins sealing the Nine-Tails' chakra from Black Zetsu to Naruto. Elsewhere, a dying Sasuke is approached by
Kabuto
, who also had a change of heart, and he begins healing Sasuke's wounds.

Madara, now the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, is left to deal with the stragglers. With nobody else who can perform senjutsu around,
taijutsu
 is the only means of combating him.
Might Guy
 decides that this is a worthy cause for him and decides to give his life to defeat Madara. He opens all
Eight Gates
 and assaults Madara with his
Evening Elephant
. This takes a heavy toll on his body but doesn't stop Madara, forcing him to resort to his final attack:
Night Guy
. This time Madara is badly injured, but still he survives. Spent, the life fades from Guy.

While on the border between life and death, Naruto and Sasuke each meet with the
Sage of the Six Paths
, who offers them a portion of
his

power
 to defeat the Ten-Tails at long last. Once each is restored to health, Naruto saves Guy from death and they engage Madara with their new powers: Sasuke's Rinnegan and Naruto's
simultaneous access to all of the nine tailed beasts' abilities
. No match for Naruto and Sasuke, Madara becomes determined to reacquire his remaining Rinnegan. He steals Kakashi's Sharingan and uses it to follow Obito to the other dimension where he takes the Rinnegan Obito has been using. Restored to full power, Madara returns to the real world and initiates the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
.

Outcome
: Black Zetsu uses itself and Madara as a medium to revive Kaguya. Obito is killed by Kaguya. Black Zetsu and Kaguya are sealed in a new moon within Kaguya's dimension. Madara dies as result of the Ten-Tails' extraction. The four reincarnated Hokage and all the spirits of the other deceased Kage return to the afterlife. Allied Shinobi Forces Victory. End of conflict.

The Infinite Tsukuyomi is cast upon the world. Sasuke shields himself, Naruto, Kakashi, and Sakura. All others except for the reanimated
Hokage
 are trapped in a dream and wrapped into the
God: Nativity of a World of Trees
, their chakra acting as fuel for their own confinement. The four emerge from Sasuke's protection, the last resistance against Madara. Before they can have their final battle, Black Zetsu, once more in control of Obito's body, transfers to Madara and takes control of him instead, converting him to
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
. Kaguya transports them all to one of her
dimensions
, wishing to eliminate the only remaining obstacles.

Like Madara before her, Kaguya has difficulty fighting Naruto and Sasuke at the same time. At Black Zetsu's suggestion, Kaguya sends Sasuke to a different dimension so that she can fight them individually, starting with Naruto. While Naruto keeps her busy, Sakura helps Obito – who is now back in control of his body – find the dimension where Sasuke is and reunite him with Naruto. Frustrated by Sasuke's return and her own failure to kill Naruto, Kaguya transports them all to a dimension with powerful gravity. While Naruto and Sasuke are unable to move, she attacks them with
All-Killing Ash Bones
. Obito and Kakashi use themselves as human shields to block the attacks, with Obito also using Kamui to save Kakashi as well, though at the cost of his own life.

Even though he's dead, Obito is not done fighting. His spirit rises from his remains and inhabits Kakashi, temporarily granting him the power of dual Mangekyō Sharingan. Using Susanoo, Kakashi joins Naruto and Sasuke in their fight against Kaguya, creating an opening for Naruto and Sasuke to surround her and strike. When she tries to escape, Sakura punches her, forcing her to stay put long enough for Naruto and Sasuke to initiate the seal given to them by Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, the Sage of Six Paths. The tailed beasts are removed from Kaguya's body, she is made to spit out Madara, and she and Black Zetsu are trapped in the
Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei
 that is, itself, stuck in another dimension.

The battle won, Team 7 wonders how to escape Kaguya's dimension. Hagoromo anticipates their need, combining the efforts of the four reincarnated Hokage and all the spirits of the other deceased Kage to summon them, the tailed beasts, and Madara back to the real world. Hagoromo congratulates them on their victory and Madara, before dying from the Ten-Tails' extraction, acknowledges his own defeat. With the Fourth Shinobi World War finally over, Hagoromo returns the four reincarnated Hokage and all the spirits of the other deceased Kage to the
Pure Land
.

Aftermath

Following the dissolution of Akatsuki and the sealing of Kaguya, Hagoromo explains that Naruto and Sasuke need only join hands to end the Infinite Tsukuyomi, but Sasuke has other plans first. He imprisons the tailed beasts, intending to kill them and the current Kage so that he can become the sole authority, personally deciding good from bad so that the world never gets itself involved in another war. Naruto refused to go along with this and the two battled at the
Valley of the End
, fighting into the night. When the two regain consciousness the following morning, Sasuke admits defeat to Naruto besting him, and surrenders. Together they end the Infinite Tsukuyomi, Sasuke releases the tailed beasts, and the few remaining Zetsu fade away. The combined influences of Naruto and Kakashi, who had been named Konoha's Sixth Hokage, was enough to absolve Sasuke's status as an international criminal.

In the years following, the Allied Shinobi Forces would reorganise into the
Shinobi Union
, a body that is composed of any hidden village that wishes to join, with the purpose of preserving peace among the villages. By the time Naruto had become the Seventh Hokage, relations between the villages eased considerably, with all of Kage being on good terms, allowing them to discuss common interests and deal with mutual threats without prejudice. With no need for weapons or militarisation, technology had advanced in such a short amount of time that Konohagakure would sport a modern metropolis above the Hokage Monument.

However, the sudden decrease in militarisation was not welcome for certain shinobi, who depended it on their incomes.
Hidari
 and
Ashimaru
 lost their careers as shinobi after the war, and had to become
mercenaries
 to take on more illegal missions directly.
Kido Tsumiki
 found the new era of peace a threat to the Anbu's budget, and proceeded to cause minor security disturbances to ensure their funding will not be decreased. A
group of Kirigakure shinobi
 found peace to be insulting to its reputation, and sought to revive the village's history as the "Bloody Mist".
Ao
, despite being heralded a hero for his part in the war, became disillusioned and bitter of the newfound peaceful era and the crippling injuries he suffered during the Ten-Tails' attack on headquarters made him believe his life no longer had any purpose, and he eventually joined the secret society
Kara
 while claiming he abandoned his identity as a shinobi.

Despite Akatsuki's defeat in the war, its goals of war and peace remain attractive to several, such as the
Ryūha Armament Alliance
 and
Shin Uchiha
.

Boro
 would eventually gather a
cult
, preaching to his followers that he experienced the Infinite Tsukuyomi during the war and saw it as a salvation for humanity, and that the Ōtsutsuki clan were saviours. He would further accuse the Alliance of undoing the Infinite Tsukuyomi to selfishly preserve their status quo.

, who was a member of the Alliance, lost an eye and leg during the war. He secretly harvested a splinter of the dead God Tree, and retreated to the
Land of Valleys
, where he started up a pharmaceutical company as a cover up, in an attempt to recreate a God Tree with the fragment so he could produce a chakra fruit to restore his lost anatomy and gain eternal life.

Trivia

Itachi Uchiha
 was noted to have prevented an earlier potential outbreak of the Fourth Shinobi World War by his involvement in the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
.

A Fourth Ninja War was also declared by
Hiruko
 in the
third
Naruto: Shippūden
 movie
, and would have pushed through if not for the efforts of the
Konoha 11
.

In the story portion of
Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
, Tobi, Madara, and Kabuto retreat before the Ten-Tails is revived, leaving the Allied Shinobi Forces victorious. This is because the events after that point had not been covered in the manga when the game was developed.

The Fourth Shinobi World War stretched across the four last story arcs:
Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation
,
Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax
,
Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki
, and
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes
, making the war the longest event in the series.

In the anime, there are a larger number of reanimated shinobi, rather than just a small number. This was done to extend the war arcs and create a more realistic war with more fights.

According to the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime,
Iwagakure
 was one of the few villages to suffer a direct attack by
Akatsuki
 during the War which took years to rebuild from. It is unknown when the battle took place, or if any reincarnated or White Zetsu were utilised in the battle, or whether Iwagakure was one of the many villages
struck
 with the Ten-Tails'
attack
.

Shikamaru Nara
,
Naruto Uzumaki
, and
Ikkyū Madoka
 prevented a potential Fifth Shinobi World War between
Iwagakure
 with
Kirigakure
 against the Land of Flowers with
Kumogakure
 after persuading
Land of Earth
's
daimyō
 to cancel their plan on taking over the Land of Flowers for its soil.

In
Naruto x Boruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections
,
Merz
 and his
organisation
 instigated the Fifth Shinobi World War, which was averted when
Boruto Uzumaki
 traveled back into time to deprive him of his powerful ally,
Nanashi Uchiha
.

In the anime,
Kokatsu
 claimed to be a hero of the war, a claim many doubted due to his boorish nature.
