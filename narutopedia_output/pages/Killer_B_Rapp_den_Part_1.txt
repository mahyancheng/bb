Summary

Killer B
 falls victim to the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 after surviving the tailed beast extraction. Inside his dream, B,
Yugito Nii
, and their respective
tailed beasts
,
Matatabi
 and
Gyūki
 in chibi forms plot to infiltrate
Sunagakure
 to rescue
Gaara
 and his tailed beast
Shukaku
. However, upon entering the cell where they were being held, they are confronted by a gigantic version of
Karasu
. While Gyūki restrained the puppet, B freed Gaara and explained that they had a mission that only a
jinchūriki
 could undertake and passed on the details to Gaara via a fist-bump. Rendezvousing with Yugito and Matatabi who had gone to retrieve Gaara's
sand gourd
, the two
Kumo
-nin part ways to find the other jinchūriki. B and Gaara head to
Konohagakure
 to find
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Kurama
 who have been locked up in the mouth of
Tsunade
's bust on the
Hokage Rock
.
 Causing a ruckus to be released despite being told to be quiet, ramen is soon delivered to him, revealing his true intentions. The guards are knocked out before Naruto can retrieve his meal, however, and B is able to break open the cell using
Lariat
 in his
Version 1
 state. Before they can escape, a fail-safe is activated and they are sucked into the statue and detained underground by Tsunade,
Shizune
, and an
Anbu
 detail. While B is besotted by Tsunade's figure, the
Hokage
 decides to settle things by gambling as opposed to having three jinchūriki rampaging through the village. Asking to check the dice, Gaara has Shukaku transform into a replica of them to throw the game in the favour, though Shukaku is not able to hold the form for too long after Tsunade's vigorously shakes the dice. Gyūki takes the opportunity to blow a dust cloud of ink covering their escape. Tsunade sends
Yamato
,
Yūgao Uzuki
, and a team of Anbu after them and inform them that they seem to be heading towards
Takigakure
. As they travel, they discuss the impending threat of
Akatsuki
 only to be stopped by Naruto, who spots a ramen shop. They are soon cornered by the Konoha team and a battle ensues between the two parties, forcing the Konoha-nin to retreat. As they recover, the jinchūriki arrive on the outskirts of Takigakure and are confronted by
Itachi Uchiha
,
Sasori
 and
Deidara
 of Akatsuki and another battle ensues.
