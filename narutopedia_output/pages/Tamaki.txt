Tamaki meets Kiba.



Tamaki ran into Kiba, Akamaru, and
Shino Aburame
 as they were searching for the
Beekeeper
, leading her to diffuse a situation they were having with ninneko,
Momo
. As Kiba was left in a love-struck stupor with her appearance, Tamaki happily led them to the Beekeeper's location while Kiba began to successfully gain her affection (through blatant lies and convenient truths). When they arrived in their location, Tamaki warned the trio that no one ever left the fogged bamboo forest. Once they entered, Kiba boasted his superior abilities to ease her worries.

NOTE
:
 In the anime, the events of this arc occur after the
Versus Momoshiki Arc
.

Kiba and Tamaki alongside their pets attend the Cat-Dog Festival, to visit the hot springs. While arguing over which hot spring to visit first, the pair bump into
Mirai Sarutobi
,
Might Guy
 and
Kakashi Hatake
. The couple was quickly recognised by the townspeople for their respective reputations as animal breeders. Kiba quickly enjoyed all the praises he was getting from the dog lovers, which began to cause a rift between Kiba and Tamaki, as both began getting as competitive as the town over which animal was better. Wanting to help the couple, but seeing Kiba was too caught up in all his fans, Mirai gave Tamaki an apology letter disguised as written by Kiba. The effort backfired from her lack of understanding in cats, which Kiba would have, causing Tamaki to join the cat-loving villagers in a fight against the dog-lovers. Mirai then used a
genjutsu in the form of a Cat-Dog spirit
 to calm the townspeople, making them think it was a sign to stop fighting. With the feud over, Kiba and Tamaki made up, decided to go to one of the hot springs as they originally wanted.
