Demon Shinki

Shinki
 (
シンキ
) is a
chūnin
 of
Sunagakure
's
Kazekage clan
 and the adopted son of
Gaara
. He also acts as leader of his
team
.

Background






Shinki as a child.



In the anime, as a young boy, Shinki was unable to control his
power
 prompting
Gaara
 to approach him. Fearful, he attacked the
Kazekage
, who surprised him by hugging him despite Shinki injuring him. Offering to teach Shinki how to use his power, he told Gaara his name before accepting his offer.
 Following the encounter, Gaara adopted him, and soon after began teaching Shinki proper control of his power and how to effectively use it in battle.

Personality

In the anime, Shinki was originally very nervous and easily-tempered. He was shocked at Gaara showing him such compassion.
 Since being raised by the Kazekage, Shinki is described as the calm and collected leader-like figure of his team.
 Shinki is shown to be a respectful person when interacting with others, most notably referring to Shukaku with an honourific, something the Tailed Beasts do not hear very often. He's shown to be very proud of his heritage, telling his adoptive father their team won't tarnish his name and will achieve victory. As noted by Temari, he cherishes his family very much and his greatest desire is to live up to their reputation, willing to put his mission above all else even if his heart tells him otherwise.

Despite his young age, Shinki has the seriousness of an adult to the point even his uncle
Kankurō
 is afraid of making him angry.
 He is shown to be just as mature for his age, wanting to settle things peacefully, settling problems with just enough power it requires. Likewise, he is very astute and perceptive, excelling in his team due to his observant eye
  able to see the true nature of his opponent and quickly determine how seriously they are fighting.

Shinki takes great pride in his abilities to the point of being arrogant, having no interest in fighting anyone who he views as weak.
 Once facing someone of respectable strength however, he shown a noticeably more excited side to himself, showing a strong competitive nature. He is also shown to be fixated on seeing the true power of those he finds strong, openly berating
Mitsuki
 when he hides his
true strength
 from him.
 He is also very blunt in his views of others, openly criticising their weaknesses and mistakes. While respectful of his adoptive-father's views and policies, he openly feels that the compassionate administration of the Seventh Hokage has made Konohagakure grow soft.
 Shinki is also fearless, as he was prepared to fight
Kinshiki
 and
Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki
, knowing he was no match for them,
 but instead chose to abide by Gaara's orders to confront the pair.

After joining
Boruto Uzumaki
 on a mission, while still blunt and committed to his mission, Shinki became more emotional, desiring to help his allies to the best of his abilities even when not ordered to, even viewing Boruto as a friend.

Shinki also possesses a great deal of love for Gaara, adamantly refusing to let his father die despite being told to retreat and even broke out of Gaara's
Sand Binding Coffin
 to protect his life at the risk of his own.

Appearance

Shinki has dark spiky hair, small eyebrows and green eyes. Just like Kankurō, Shinki sports face paint, which takes the shape of two red ヲ (
wo
) markings that are similar to designs on Gaara's
Sand Gourd
. Even with his face paint, he is noted to be very handsome.

flak jacket
, a brown full-body outfit that covers his throat, complete with a dark blue Suna
forehead protector
 and black calf-length shinobi sandals. He can also sometimes be seen wearing a large black coat with a fur collar, made of
Iron Sand
. As a child, Shinki had face paint that took the shape of lightning on his left side and one line under his right eye to the jaw on the right side. He wore a cream long-sleeved shirt and light brown pants with a poncho with hem draping on the right side.

In the manga, he doesn't wear a flak jacket, instead wearing a dark body suit with an asymmetrical armour plate on his chest, a long belt tied at the waist, and bandages wrapped around his wrists and ankles.

Abilities

Trained extensively by his adopted father, Shinki is considered the ace of his village.
 By the Chūnin Exams, he was noted have learned everything Gaara can teach and in certain ways have exceeded the Fifth Kazekage.
 During which, he easily defeated
Team 5
 and
Team 10
.

Boruto Uzumaki
 and the other
finalists
 were also considered as having no chance against him,
 a statement which Shinki proved in the final fight round and earned him high regard from the five
Kage
 and other
senior

shinobi
.
 By the time of Isshiki's death, he had been chūnin for a while.

Physical Prowess

While normally stationary in battle, Shinki is shown to have a deceptively quick response to those who can penetrate his defences, being able to effectively dodge physical attacks and swiftly counterattack. He is also noted to possess extraordinary
chakra
. With it he is shown to be able to perform a myriad of advanced techniques without showing any visible exhaustion.

Ninjutsu

Taught by his uncle, Shinki is a
puppeteer
, wielding a skeleton-like puppet alongside him. Using his sand instead, Shinki can control his puppets without chakra threads. In the anime, he shows noticeably advanced proficiency in
fūinjutsu
. With it, he can
store
 his puppets in scrolls for easier carriage. Alternatively, he can also perform
seals
 capable of subduing foes as powerful as a
Ōtsutsuki Clan
 member for a period of time.
 Later, his sealing prowess grew powerful enough to contain a Kage-level ninja and likewise prevent anyone else from breaking it.

Nature Transformation

Shinki possesses
Earth
 and
Wind Release
, which when combined, allows him to use
Magnet Release
. While initially lacking control of the
kekkei genkai
, under Gaara's tutelage his control of using it to manipulate Iron Sand improved to the point his skill to maintain multiple techniques at once.
 Using the durable substance in the form of a
cloak
 for him and his
puppet
, Shinki can manipulate its structure to engage in combat while remaining stationary, with it being capable of withstanding
strong

taijutsu

attacks
 with ease.
 Offensively, he can use his Iron Sand for
close-range combat
,
 or form a
large wave
 that can be used to
bind
 and
crush
 a target.
 He can also
mark
 a target to have them magnetically draw in any of his
iron sand weapons
. For supplementary purposes, he can use his Iron Sand to restrain individuals or create a
platform
 to levitate on.
 In the anime, he can also utilise
Lightning Release
 to create an electromagnetic field that strengthens his Iron Sand.
 Alternatively, he can produce multiple
sand eyes
 that grant him additional surveillance in the area and likewise can link his own sight with.

Thunder Train
 to participate in the Chūnin Exams held at
Konohagakure
, Shinki expressed his belief that his team would achieve victory and would not sully his adoptive father's name. He exclaimed that the other teams would be no problem for them. In the first round, the genin had to answer a truth or false question. To their surprise, it was trick question that automatically caused the genin to fall into an pit of ink. However, Shinki is able to use his Iron Sand in time to keep him and his teammates afloat, allowing them to pass the round. Three days later, for the second round of the exams, Shinki's team competed in a game of capture the flag against Team 5. While
Araya
 and
Yodo
 guarded their flag, Shinki managed to defeat
Denki Kaminarimon
 and
Iwabee Yuino
. Asking not to be disappointed, Shinki effortlessly blocked all of
Metal Lee
's attacks, leading to him capturing Team 5's flag after he became distracted by anger.






Shinki vs. Boruto and Sarada.



In the final exam, he was matched against Chōchō whom he defeated using his Iron Sand. In the anime Shinki participated in his semi-final match against Mitsuki instead. While his opponent's versatility was able to catch Shinki off-guard and pressure him, he ultimately
cornered
 Mitsuki with his Iron Sand in an act to force him to use
Sage Transformation
. Choosing not to activate it for
personal reasons
, Mitsuki surrendered, resulting in Shinki progressing to the finals against
Sarada Uchiha
 and Boruto. During the match, though the Konoha shinobi teamed against Shinki, he managed to defeat Sarada, before Boruto relied on using his
Shinobi Gauntlet
 to
overpower
 Shinki's Iron Sand to win. In the manga, Shinki was scheduled to face Araya in the semi-finals but was stopped before the match could begin by the attack of Kinshiki and Momoshiki.

During the devastation on the arena, Shinki tried to join the offensive against them, but was stopped by Gaara, who told him that it's not the kind of enemy he can take on and that they should focus on evacuating the civilians instead. After the ordeal a few days later, Shinki's team boarded a Thunder Train with Gaara and Kankurō in preparation to return to their village, during which he was thinking about Boruto somehow managing to defeat Momoshiki. Apologising for holding his son back during the attack, Shinki said the matter was instead about not seeing himself winning in that situation. Gaara insisted that he cannot keep comparing himself to others, but must walk his own path. Considering these words and thinking back on Boruto's actions, but against such a foe and owning up on his mistakes at the exams, Shinki came to find Boruto very intriguing.

Also during which, to make sure Urashiki would not sense its chakra, Shukaku willing sealed itself inside a kettle.

Along the way, it became clear that Shinki did not like Boruto, constantly berating him for his immature nature. The group was intercepted by four of Urashiki's puppets, prompting Kankurō to face them while the genin ventured on. Noticing a massive explosion from the battlefield, Shinki insisted to head on despite also being concerned for his uncle, but Boruto went back by himself.

sealing
 him using his skeleton puppet and Iron Sand.

Jōgan

Impressed and annoyed by their efforts, Urashiki decided to finish the winded foes, only to be stopped by Sasuke. This prompted Urashaki to retreat. The genin were then brought to Konohagakure for treatment, where their mission to deliver Shukaku had been completed. Five days later, Shinki was discharged and collected by Gaara. When Gaara asked Shinki what he learned from going with Boruto, the son simply said Boruto is a slave to his emotions. Gaara however smiled at seeing that Boruto's influence did spark a change in Shinki. Before boarding the train back home, Shinki was surprised by Boruto, who insisted that friends should say goodbye before leaving and offered to show him around the village next time.
