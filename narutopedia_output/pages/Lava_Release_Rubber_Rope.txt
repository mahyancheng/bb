Trivia

Although it is unnamed in the anime and manga, the technique was named in the game.

In this game, Dodai also uses this technique for attacks in two variations. In the first case, he swings a double rope with force like a whip, striking the opponent with lashings that are so strong that they split the ground under his feet. In the second case, he forms a large number of ropes into a semblance of a hand and, having grabbed the opponent with it, lifts him into the air and after crushing him on the ground.
