All five elemental nature transformations being used.



Nature Transformation
 (
性質変化
,
Seishitsu Henka
,
English TV:
 Change in Chakra Nature) is an advanced form of
chakra control
 that entails the moulding and defining of the nature of one's
chakra
, altering its properties and characteristics for use in
techniques
.
 Nature transformation is one of two necessary components for creating or modifying a technique, the second component being
shape transformation
. While nature transformation changes the properties of the chakra, shape transformation changes the actual form and movement, altering its abilities.
 The release of elemental chakra is typically suffixed with "Release" (
遁
,
Ton
,
English TV:
 Style).

Basic Nature Transformations

The
Five
 Basic Natures
 (
五大基本性質
,
Godai Kihon Seishitsu
) are the five elemental chakra natures, which are the foundation of all elemental
ninjutsu
.
 They are so vital to the shinobi lifestyle that each of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 is named after one of the five. Each element is naturally weaker than and stronger than another:

Fire
 (
火
,
Hi
) is strong against Wind but weak against Water.

Wind
 (
風
,
Kaze
) is strong against Lightning but weak against Fire.

Lightning
 (
雷
,
Kaminari
) is strong against Earth but weak against Wind.

Earth
 (
土
,
Tsuchi
) is strong against Water but weak against Lightning.

Water
 (
水
,
Mizu
) is strong against Fire but weak against Earth.

Basically, if an elemental technique is put against another elemental technique of the same level, but of a stronger nature, then the technique with the superior nature will prevail. However, a technique with a weaker nature can overpower a technique with a stronger nature if the former is of a higher level. For example,
fire
 can overpower a
water
 technique if it is first strengthened by a
wind
 technique.

A similar principle applies in how techniques of the same element interact, which is called counterbalancing. If two techniques of the same nature and the same level are used against each other, they will cancel each other out, as when
Lightning Release: False Darkness
 is deflected with
Lightning Cutter
. However, if the two techniques have different levels, the higher-level technique will not only prevail but will grow stronger from interaction with the weaker, as when
Amaterasu
, the highest-level Fire Release technique, grew stronger by absorbing an opposing
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
.

Affinity






The result of Kakashi's chakra in contact with the special paper: it wrinkles.



In general, every person's chakra has an affinity towards one of the five basic nature transformations. Affinity can at times be genetic, or at least common to a particular family; most members of the
Uchiha clan
 have an affinity towards the Fire nature.
 One's affinity can be identified using pieces of paper made from a special type of tree that is grown and fed with chakra. When this so-called "Chakra Induction Paper" (
チャクラ感応紙
,
Chakura Kannōshi
,
English TV:
 Litmus Paper) is exposed to even the slightest hint of chakra, it reacts according to the chakra's latent element:

Fire: the paper will ignite and turn to ash.

Wind: the paper will split in two.

Lightning: the paper will wrinkle.

Earth: the paper will turn to dirt and crumble away.

Water: the paper will become wet/damp.

Shinobi have an easier time learning to create and control a chakra nature that matches their affinity, although even then it may take a number of years. Shinobi are not limited to the nature they have an affinity for, and it is in fact common for
jōnin
 to have mastered two natures.
 However, even if a shinobi learns other chakra natures, it is
extraordinarily
 difficult and rare (under normal circumstances) to use them at the same degree of efficiency and potency as with their own natural affinity.

Although it is technically possible to master all five natures, it is very rare because of how all individuals are naturally less inclined to certain elements, requiring much more training.
Konohamaru Sarutobi
 further reiterates its rarity by noting he's only witnessed
two

shinobi
 use all five chakra natures.
 Shinobi capable of using all five natures include:
Hashirama Senju
,
Tobirama Senju
, Hiruzen Sarutobi,
Orochimaru
,
Mū
,
Kakashi Hatake
, and Victor (in the anime); these 7 are the only shinobi known to have done so via normal means. Other methods of acquiring all five natures include:

Possession of the
Rinnegan
 to shorten the learning process.

Acquiring the
Six Paths Senjutsu
 and
Truth-Seeking Balls
.

Possession of the
Bashōsen
 allows any shinobi the usage of all five natures.

Using
Earth Grudge Fear
 to gather hearts with other chakra natures.

Tobi
 using
Yamato
 to bolster its power in its
usage
 of the
Wood Release
.

In the anime,
Fūka
 got them by
stealing
 others' chakra, though due to the accumulated amounts surpassing one body's limits, she had to divide them in various combinations in
multiple bodies
.

In
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
, it was stated one who absorbs five
kekkei genkai
 with the
Chimera Technique
 would gain a mastery over all five natures.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Dragon Blade Chronicles
, Naruto gets the
Dragon Blade
, which allows him to use all five natures.

Yin and Yang






The Yin and Yang chakra of the Nine-Tails.



Aside from the five elemental nature transformations, there are two nature transformations that are the source of all non-elemental techniques, such as the
Shadow Imitation Technique
,
Multi-Size Technique
,
medical ninjutsu
,
genjutsu
, etc.
 There is
Yin Release
 (
陰遁
,
Inton
), based on the imagination and spiritual energy of a shinobi, and
Yang Release
 (
陽遁
,
Yōton
), based on the vitality and physical energy of a shinobi. Together, they are used to perform
Yin–Yang Release
 (
陰陽遁
,
In'yōton, Onmyōton
).

The transformation of Yin and Yang has to do with altering the balance between spiritual and physical energy in chakra. As explained by
Shikamaru Nara
,
Tayuya
's
spirit worms
 were forms of chakra that mostly consist of spiritual energy, thus they require stability and feed upon the physical energy they lack.

Combined Nature Transformations





Combined nature transformation relationships.



By using two or three basic nature transformations simultaneously, one can create a completely new elemental nature with unique properties that wouldn't exist on its own. However, doing this requires a
kekkei genkai
 or, if three elements are used, a
kekkei tōta
.
 In the anime, it is further stated that those with the ability to combine the elemental nature transformations possess an affinity for the chakra natures they must simultaneously use.

In the manga, nine combined nature transformations have been shown:

Ice Release
 (
氷遁
,
Hyōton
) is created by simultaneously combining the Water and Wind natures. Infamously used by the
Yuki clan
, their kekkei genkai.

In
Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow
,
Yukigakure
-nin were able to use a different kind of Ice Release by drawing on already-existing ice, snow, and cold. This was not a kekkei genkai, as
Kakashi
 could copy one of these techniques with his
Sharingan
.

Wood Release
 (
木遁
,
Mokuton
) is created by simultaneously combining the Earth and Water natures. Famed as the kekkei genkai of
Hashirama Senju
, and thus reproduced in those using his cells.

Lava Release
 (
熔遁; 溶遁
,
Yōton
) is created by simultaneously combining the Fire and Earth natures. A characteristic of the
Four-Tails
 and its
jinchūriki
, and a kekkei genkai used by ninja of
Kirigakure
,
Iwagakure
, and
Kumogakure
. Also used by ninja of
Amegakure
 in the anime and
Ishigakure
 in the novels.

It is implied that the two ways of writing this nature (熔遁; 溶遁) are pointing out that they are different in some way. Mei Terumī's
Lava Release: Melting Apparition Technique
 and Boro's
Lava Release: Planet-Branding Blast
, which utilise a strong acidic fluid, are the only Lava Release technique written with 溶. This, along with the
fourth databook
 stating that Mei's Lava Release kekkei genkai can only be used by her, indicates a difference between 溶遁 and 熔遁.

Storm Release
 (
嵐遁
,
Ranton
) is created by simultaneously combining the Lightning and Water natures. A kekkei genkai used by
Darui
 and many other unnamed
Kumogakure
 ninja.

In
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
, the ability to use Storm Release is stolen by
Hiruko
 from an unnamed shinobi. This version has significant differences from those used elsewhere in the series.

Boil Release
 (
沸遁
,
Futton
) is created by simultaneously combining the Water and Fire natures. A characteristic of the
Five-Tails
 and its
jinchūriki
, and one of the kekkei genkai used by the
Fifth Mizukage
.

Dust Release
 (
塵遁
,
Jinton
) is created by simultaneously combining the Fire, Earth, and Wind natures. A
kekkei tōta
 used by the
Second
 and
Third Tsuchikage
.

Explosion Release
 (
爆遁
,
Bakuton
) is hinted to be made of the Earth
 and Lightning natures.
 A kekkei genkai common to members of
Iwagakure
's
Explosion Corps
.

Scorch Release
 (
灼遁
,
Shakuton
) is implied to be created by simultaneously combining the Fire and Wind natures. A kekkei genkai only known to be used by
Pakura
.

Magnet Release
 (
磁遁
,
Jiton
) is implied to be created by simultaneously combining the Wind and Earth natures. A characteristic of the
One-Tail
 and its
jinchūriki
, and one of the kekkei genkai used by ninja of
Sunagakure
 and
Kumogakure
. In the novels, it is also used by ninja of
Ishigakure
.

In the anime, novels, and movies, additional advanced nature transformations have been shown:

Used in the anime,
Crystal Release
 (
晶遁
,
Shōton
) is suggested to be made of at least the Earth nature. Used by
Guren
.

Used in
Gaara Hiden
 and
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
,
Steel Release
 (
鋼遁
,
Kōton
) is a kekkei genkai used by
Metoro Konjiki
 and stolen from an unnamed shinobi by
Hiruko
. In
Naruto Mobile
, it is implied to be created by simultaneously combining the Earth and Lightning natures.

Used in
Akatsuki Hiden: Evil Flowers in Full Bloom
,
Mud Release
 (
泥遁
,
Deiton
) is a kekkei genkai used by
Ameyuki
 and the only known advanced nature that shares its basic natures (water and earth) with another nature, Wood Release.

Used in
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
,
Dark Release
 (
冥遁
,
Meiton
) is a kekkei genkai stolen by
Hiruko
. In Naruto Mobile, it is placed in the center of the nature transformation chart.

Used in
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
,
Swift Release
 (
迅遁
,
Jinton
) is a kekkei genkai stolen by
Hiruko
. In Naruto Mobile, it is implied to be created by simultaneously combining the Wind and Lightning natures.

Trivia

The concept of nature transformation parallels the real-life art,
Onmyōdō
 (
陰陽道
,
literally meaning:
 The Way of Yin and Yang), which is a mixture of natural sciences and occultism. It largely features
Wu Xing
 and
Yin and Yang
.

In chapter 316, Naruto asks about the nature transformation of Shikamaru's Shadow Imitation Technique and
Chōji
's Multi-Size Technique, as well as medical ninjutsu and genjutsu. Of those four, only medical ninjutsu have not been specifically connected to either Yin or Yang Release.

Techniques such as the
Toad Oil Bullet
 and the
Poison Mist
 mention "converting" or "kneading" chakra into materials or substances, but have never been mentioned to use certain chakra natures.

Certain other techniques involved in manipulating substances are also often confused to be chakra natures, such as
silk
,
bone
, and
ink
. However, these substances cannot be produced from chakra alone, meaning the chakra is not changed in nature, and it is rather used to change already-existing substances.

In
Naruto: Shippūden
 episode 63
, Yamato incorrectly says that no known shinobi has ever mastered all five nature transformations.

In
Naruto
 episode 174
,
Kunihisa
 used "techniques" he called "Money Release Technique" (
金遁の術
,
Kinton no Jutsu
,
English TV:
 Money Style Jutsu) which was used to simply buy whatever he wanted.

In some games,
Shizune
 uses
Hog Release
 (
豚遁
,
Tonton
), a technique where she uses
Tonton
.

In the novel
Sasuke Shinden: Book of Sunrise
,
Nowaki
 uses
Typhoon Release
 (
颱遁
,
Taiton
), a variant of Wind Release.

Sasuke Uchiha uses
Blaze Release
 (
炎遁
,
Enton
), a variant of Fire Release. In Naruto Mobile, it is implied to be created by simultaneously combining the Fire and Lightning natures.

The
Yata Mirror
 was said to be imbued with all nature transformations to change its own characteristics to deflect any attack.

In the trailer announcing in Naruto Mobile content from
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
, the game appears to reference an outdated version of the wiki's nature transformation chart.
