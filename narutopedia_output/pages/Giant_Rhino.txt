This
rhinoceros
 was a summon of
Nagato
.

Appearance

Resembling a normal rhinoceros but with small wings on its back, it had a number of body piercings and
Rinnegan
, implying it is being controlled by Pain as well as dark marking around its eyes. It also had a giant
chakra receiver
 stuck in its forehead. It also had big pointy ears and a small tail.

Abilities

Because of its sheer size and nature, it had great brute force, able to destroy an entire building after charging into it. Like the rest of Pain's summons, it shares a visual link through the Rinnegan. It also had a small pair of badly damaged wings, though it is unknown if it was ever able to fly.

Part II

Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant

In the anime, it was summoned by Pain's
male Animal Path
 in
Amegakure
, to fight
Jiraiya
. As it charges his
shadow clone
, he barely dodges it. As it goes to attack him again, it was intercepted and defeated by
Gamaken
.

Pain's Assault

In
Konohagakure
, after the
village's Intelligence Division
 building was discovered, it was summoned by Pain's
female Animal Path
, and bursts inside. In the anime, it fought
Ibiki Morino
, but was ultimately immobilised after being
imprisoned
. However, after Ibiki was defeated by the Animal Path, it broke out of its confinement and charged at the
Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force
.
 It was later de-summoned before Pain destroyed the village, only to be re-summoned again afterwards to fight
Naruto Uzumaki
. As it charged at Naruto, it was stopped in its tracks and thrown in the air by him, where it was then finished off by Gamaken.
