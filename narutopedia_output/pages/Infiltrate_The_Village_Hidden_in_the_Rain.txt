"
Infiltrate! The Village Hidden in the Rain
" (
潜入! 雨隠れの里
,
Sennyū! Amegakure no Sato
) is episode 129 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Using his
Hiding in a Toad Technique
,
Jiraiya
 manages to successfully infiltrate
Amegakure
.
Pain
 of the
Akatsuki
 is able to sense through
the rain
 that an intruder has set foot inside their village, and tasks
Konan
 with locating him, the latter forming
tiny origami birds
, who fly around the village.

Jiraiya stops at a gentleman's club, where he attempts to get close to
Tezuna
, who reminds him of
Tsunade
. He attempts to ask her of the whereabouts of Ame's leader,
Hanzō
, only for Tezuna to tell Jiraiya that Hanzō is not around anymore and that their village is ruled by Lord Pain. Using his
Summoning: Toad Shop Technique
, Jiraiya lures Tezuna's husband
Ryūsui
 and his partner
Yūdachi
 into what they believe is a bar, which in actuality is the stomach of a toad. Trapped within the amphibian, Jiraiya attempts to extract information from them; when Yūdachi refuses,
turns him into a frog
.

Threatening Ryūsui with the same fate, Ryūsui reveals that Hanzō, the previous leader, had been killed by Pain himself. Jiraiya finds this unbelievable, as the three
Sannin
 themselves were unable to defeat Hanzō. Jiraiya adds that Ame is in a civil war, with Hanzō leading one side, but Ryūsui reveals that their civil war ended long ago and that they were ushered into a world of peace by Pain. The holdovers from Hanzō's reign attempted to take their village back, only for Pain to murder all of Hanzō's friends, associates, relatives, and even the infants of those distantly connected to him. Jiraiya then decides to ask Ryūsui about the Akatsuki, but Ryūsui refuses to talk. Inside
his tower
, Pain opens a
hidden doorway
, where he puts his
present body
 to sleep so that he may awaken in
another
.
