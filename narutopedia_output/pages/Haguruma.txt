Boruto takes Haguruma out of the bank.



After falling on hard times, Haguruma was manipulated by the Byakuya Gang into barricading himself inside a Konoha bank. The
Military Police
 surrounded the bank, but did not breach it over fears of an explosion. Boruto infiltrated the bank and sympathised with Hagura, learning of his plights. Having vented, Haguruma set off his explosives, but changed his mind after learning that Boruto enjoyed his games. Because the device jammed, he was unable to deactivate it, forcing Boruto to fry it with
Lightning Release
. Haguruma was taken in custody, and later interrogated, exposing the Byakuya Gang's role in his heist. Boruto had Denki look for a job for Haguruma in the Kaminarimon Company.
