Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Having lost control of the
Doki
,
Tayuya
 sends them away to keep
Shikamaru
 from using them against her. She once again does as Shikamaru had planned; not only has she got rid of the Doki, something he could not do, but in doing so she did not notice his shadow approaching her, allowing him to catch her. Tayuya activates level two of her
cursed seal
 to escape his control and traps him in a
genjutsu
. Shikamaru
unsuccessfully
 throws a
kunai
 at her. Tayuya picks up the kunai and approaches him to kill him with it, only to be trapped by his shadow again. Having broken the genjutsu, it was revealed that Shikamaru threw the kunai to Tayuya to trick her into coming close enough that she couldn't overpower his shadow again.
