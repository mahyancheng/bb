) is chapter 188 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Jirōbō
 is impressed that the
Sasuke Recovery Team
 was able to escape but, having consumed most of their
chakra
, is confident he can defeat them.
Shikamaru
 suggests splitting the team up, the others going ahead while he catches Jirōbō with his shadow and
Naruto
 fights him. Jirōbō ridicules the plan and Shikamaru's jutsu, expressing his sympathies that the team has a leader as useless as Shikamaru.
Chōji
 demands that he, and only he, be allowed to fight Jirōbō while the others follow the rest of the
Sound Four
. He gives them
Military Rations Pills
 to restore their chakra which Shikamaru, confident in Chōji, accepts. They leave and Jirōbō tries to go after them, but Chōji takes the first of his
Three Coloured Pills
, the green Spinach Pill (
ホウレン丸
,
Hōrengan
) to stop Jirōbō.
