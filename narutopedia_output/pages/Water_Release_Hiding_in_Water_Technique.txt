A technique that allows the user to fuse with water, even in water as shallow as a puddle.
 By doing so, the user can take advantage of their hidden presence and launch a surprise attack on their target.

Trivia

In later anime appearances, when the user comes out of concealment, water rises up around them before they are revealed.

A member of the
Nokizaru Group
 made use of this technique.
