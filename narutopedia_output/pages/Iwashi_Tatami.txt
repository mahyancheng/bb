Personality

Appearance

He has dark eyes, brown hair and a small goatee. When first introduced, he wore a simple button up grey uniform like the one worn by the shinobi in the
Konohagakure Intelligence Division
. When seen after that, however, he wore the standard attire of the Konoha shinobi complete with
flak jacket
 and
forehead protector
 which he wears like a bandanna.

Abilities

Though little to nothing is known of his abilities, Iwashi did note during the
Chūnin Exams
 that even he wasn't able to finish the second test of the examination in the time that the Sand Siblings had.
 He was also strong enough to be placed on a mission that his
Tokubetsu Jōnin
 teammates called challenging.

 as he is able to use the

Trivia

"Iwashi" (
鰯
) is the name of the
Japanese pilchard
, while "
Tatami
" (
畳
) are traditional mats from Japan.

According to the databook(s):

His favourite foods are
nikujaga
 and buttered maize, while his least favourite is seafood.

Because he is younger than the other members of the Hokage Guard Platoon, he was likely scouted by the Fourth Hokage when he was still very young, as he cannot have been older than ten during the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
.
