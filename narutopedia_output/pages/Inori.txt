Infinite Tsukuyomi
.

Kawaki Arc

When a small village was
plagued
 by Boro, Inori and his other followers approached the villagers with the intention to heal and recruit them to their cult. Afterwards, Inori informed Boro that the new followers were performing the purification ritual, with the latter leaving the rest to her.

After one of his sermons, Boro introduced a group of children who had recently joined to Inori, also sharing a similar background as her. Suddenly, her
older brother
 arrived to save her from Boro's deceit. Despite having found a doctor to treat her, Inori only asked her brother to leave. Inori's brother
attacked
 Boro, but to no avail thanks to his "
indestructible body
 granted by the gods". While her brother was in shock that his fatal attack was unsuccessful, Boro asked Inori to procure clothes for the children while he escorted her brother out, killing him instead after she left.

Some time later, after Boro's death,
Konohamaru Sarutobi
 and
Sai
 were given a tour of the facility by Inori. Later,
Tsuzumi
 was pursued by the
Konoha
 shinobi when he had attempted to contact Boro. When he ordered the other followers to apprehend them, Konohamaru exposed Boro's deceit to them, revealing he was responsible for the plagues and that they were all being used by him for
Kara
's purposes. The revelation fell on deaf ears as
Shirabe
 reminded the cult the reason that they had joined, which Inori had applauded. Suddenly,
Delta
 attacked the facility in order to destroy Boro's
Space-Time Gate
 from being used by outsiders. Still adamant in her beliefs, Inori remained with the ones still loyal and was disintegrated by Delta.
