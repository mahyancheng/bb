Gozu
) was a member of
Konohagakure
's
Anbu
 faction
Root
 led by
Danzō Shimura
.

Background

Gozu and his younger twin brother,
Mezu
, were surgically altered to look like
Kagen Uchiha
, allowing them to take turns spying on the
Uchiha clan
 by impersonating Kagen. When not in the village impersonating Kagen, Gozu wore a red marked mask resembling a monkey. Both reported directly to Danzō about their findings for several years, but in the year leading up to the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
, they also helped
Itachi Uchiha
 as he tried to avert the clan's attempted coup. After the clan was wiped out, Gozu was apparently killed by Itachi so that Itachi could impersonate him and get close to Danzō.

Trivia

Gozu and Mezu shared their Anbu mask design, a monkey. Despite the identical design, the colors were different; Gozu's mask was red, while Mezu's mask was blue.
