Shibai using Shinjutsu.



Shinjutsu
 (
神術
,
literally meaning:
 Divine Techniques) are
chakra
-based
techniques
 of the highest order, mainly used by members of the
Ōtsutsuki clan
. These jutsu, which are unlike
ninjutsu
 or
senjutsu
, require no
hand seals
 to be performed and enable users to bring upon phenomena resembling "the works of gods" (
御業
,
miwaza
).
Amado
 considers ninjutsu as attempts at reproducing the effects of shinjutsu.

Shinjutsu can be passed down to humans when DNA from the users are infused into their bodies. However, the chances of receiving at least one, along with which ones they receive, are up to chance, as most of the known recipients did not awaken any Shinjutsu. It is also possible for the DNA recipient to awaken a Shinjutsu at the brink of death, as evidenced by
Koji Kashin
.

Trivia

Omnipotence
 is said to be the most powerful shinjutsu there is.

Momoshiki
 has claimed to hold intimate knowledge of all extant shinjutsu.

Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
's mastery of
Ninshū
 bears many similarities with shinjutsu, including his ability to
create life from nothing
 and not needing
hand seals
 to perform his jutsu.

It is possible that
Kekkei Mōra
 techniques derive from (or fall under) shinjutsu, as those jutsu not only predate the invention of ninjutsu, but also bear many similarities to shinjutsu in their functioning, such as not requiring hand seals. However, the
Fourth Databook
 classifies several of Kaguya's techniques as ninjutsu, despite them predating Indra's development of ninjutsu from ninshū.
