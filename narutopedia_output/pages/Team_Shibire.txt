This was a
genin
 from
Konohagakure
, which consisted of
Minoji
,
Shibire
, and
Tanzō
. The team participated in the
Chūnin Exams
, making it to the second stage, but didn't pass due to Minoji and Shibire opening their scroll early on while
Tanzō
 was absent, resulting in them being knocked out by summoned Konoha
shinobi
.

In the anime, the three genin participated in the joint Chūnin Exams between Konohagakure and
Sunagakure
. With the help of
Neji Hyūga
, they figured out how to solve the first problem of the written test. They also managed to solve the second problem by turning in a blank paper (which means "not to abandon their comrades"), leading them to pass the first round.
 However, when most of the teams had already gathered their scrolls they decided to forge a fake one by reading the one they already had not knowing there was a trap set in them that paralysed them and rendered them unconscious. They were not among the first 30 teams to arrive at the Suna checkpoint, and as a result, they were disqualified and ordered to return to Konoha by
Asuma Sarutobi
 and
Kurenai Yūhi
.
