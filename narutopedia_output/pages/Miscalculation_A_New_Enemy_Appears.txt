Synopsis

As
Sakon
 chases
Naruto
,
Shikamaru
 and
Kiba
,
Akamaru
 has been setting traps using
explosive tags
. After getting hit by one, Sakon retaliates by trapping Akamaru, who is standing next to an explosive tag. Kiba jumps down to save Akamaru and Sakon heads after Kiba. As the tag explodes, Sakon, Kiba and Akamaru both plummet off the end of a cliff and fall down. Before Naruto and Shikamaru can further assess the situation,
Tayuya
 comes after them. However, she stops her attack when she instantly notices
Kimimaro
, who has snuck up behind Naruto and Shikamaru. He manages to kick the container containing
Sasuke
 off the tree branch and goes after it, catching it. Telling Tayuya that she has disappointed
Orochimaru
, he wishes to kill her; however, he tells her he will refrain from doing so as she has a duty to perform. Taking Sasuke with him, Kimimaro instructs Tayuya to eliminate Naruto and Shikamaru.

As they cannot let Sasuke get away, Shikamaru and Naruto devise a strategy; Naruto and Shikamaru rush toward Tayuya, but Shikamaru pulls back at the last second while Naruto soars over Tayuya. As Tayuya stands there confused, Shikamaru attempts to trap her using his
Shadow Imitation Technique
, but Tayuya manages to avoid being caught just in time. However, Naruto manages to get away, and follows Kimimaro. His anger towards the
Sound Four
 and Kimimaro causes him to release some of the
Nine-Tails
'
chakra
. Naruto manages to catch up to Kimimaro in a clearing, and the latter is surprised to see that Naruto possesses much more chakra than most. Naruto demands to know why Orochimaru wants Sasuke. Kimimaro explains that Orochimaru wishes to live forever; while his soul can live forever, his body cannot, therefore Orochimaru must need new host bodies to use as vessels. Angered that Orochimaru is planning to take over Sasuke's body, Naruto uses the Nine-Tailed Fox's chakra to produce a
thousand shadow clones
. Back in the forest, Tayuya mocks Shikamaru's leadership, believing he has sacrificed a member of
his team
 every time they engage one of the Sound Four one-on-one. Shikamaru states that he does not believe any of his team members are dead, and tells Tayuya not to insult them. Tayuya responds by
summoning

three giants
, whom she controls with her
Demonic Flute
. At the same time, Kiba is fighting Sakon, who manages to kick Kiba away.
