Summary

The
Kage
 prepare for the
Kage Summit
, each leaving their respective villages with two bodyguards. Before
Danzō
 sets out he issues orders for
Kabuto
's capture, wishing to use Kabuto's knowledge to repair his right arm and eye. In
Konoha
,
Karui
 and
Omoi
 interrogate Naruto about
Sasuke
 but he cannot bring himself to say anything against his friend since killing him would not save
Killer B
