Synopsis

As
Asuma
 and
Kazuma
 continue their bout,
Sora
 continues to fight against the
Konoha
 shinobi in his
three-tailed form
. Naruto attempts to stop him, but the anger and hatred of the
Nine-Tailed Fox
's chakra sealed within Sora resonates with the real fox sealed inside Naruto, causing Naruto to instantly transform into his one-tailed form.
Yamato
 attempts to use his
Hokage-Style Sixty-Year-Old Technique — Kakuan Entering Society with Bliss-Bringing Hands
 to suppress Naruto's transformation, but to no avail, as it is Sora's chakra that is causing Naruto's transformation. Naruto attempts to fight against his transformation, but after Sora continues to attack him, Naruto sprouts two extra tails and enters his third-tailed form as well.

During their battle, Kazuma proudly thanks Sora for awakening Naruto's spirit, claiming that the real demon fox will now destroy Konohagakure. When Asuma questions his motives, Kazuma explains that they are mere pawns meant to serve their king, and that he would do anything for that cause, even transform his son into a mere weapon of mass destruction.

Sora's skin begins to burn off as he enters into his
four-tailed form
. Naruto's skin begins to do the same, but Naruto attempts to prevent the transformation with his willpower, berating the fox for attempting to come out when not called upon. Desperate to halt his transformation, Naruto uses one of the severed claws from Sora's
Chakra Enhanced Triple-Bladed Claw
 to stab himself in the leg, his pain overriding the negative emotions spurring the fox on. Naruto's transformation subsides and he returns to normal, although Sora remains in his four-tailed form. The sight of Naruto stabbing himself awakens a part of Sora inside his four-tailed form, where he contemplates on his being alone, watched on by adults who despise him. He then hears the sound of Naruto's voice calling out to him.
