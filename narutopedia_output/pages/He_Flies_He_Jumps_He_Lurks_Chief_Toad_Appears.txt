) is episode 57 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

While falling to his death,
Naruto
 manages to
summon

Gamabunta
. Angry that a child summoned him, Gamabunta starts asking where
Jiraiya
 was. In order for Gamabunta to accept Naruto as his underling, he told Naruto that he must stay on his back the whole day without falling off. Meanwhile in
Konoha
,
Temari
 recalls the time a year ago in
Sunagakure
 when she argued with
Baki
 over breaking the treaty alliance between Konoha and Sunagakure. Later in Suna, Baki reports to the
Fourth Kazekage
 that everything was going according to plan. Gamabunta still tries to shake Naruto off as Jiraiya is doing "research" for his novel by spying on a group of girls. In an attempt to shake Naruto off, Gamabunta lands in a waterfall, scaring off the girls, much to Jiraiya's dismay.  This then caused Naruto to fall off the toad's back, but in an effort to stay on the toad's back, he makes a chain of
shadow clones
 to not let Naruto fall off. Tired out, Naruto finally falls off the Chief Toad's back. As a reward for lasting so long, Gamabunta catches Naruto with his tongue and claimed that no one since the
Fourth Hokage
 had stayed on his back for so long. Knowing that Naruto is depleted of his strength, Gamabunta drops off Naruto at the
Konoha Hospital
.

Trivia

Naruto's efforts to stay atop Gamabunta are unique to the anime.
