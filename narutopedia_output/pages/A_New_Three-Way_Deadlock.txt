Viz:

Naruto
 manga.

Summary

After
Sasuke
,
Naruto
, and
Sakura
 summon
Aoda
,
Gamakichi
, and
Katsuyu
 respectively, Naruto is surprised that
Gamabunta
 didn't appear. Gamakichi states that his father was busy, and Naruto exclaims about Gamakichi's growth spurt. He then instructs Gamakichi to attack the original
Ten-Tails
. Meanwhile, Sasuke instructs Aoda to go straight ahead, while he would attack the original himself. Sakura tells Katsuyu to split into several parts to
heal
 the
Shinobi Alliance
.
Minato
 acknowledges the trio, stating that this is the new three-way deadlock summoning leading
Hiruzen
 to remember his students and acknowledge that it was truly the dawning of a new era. Gamakichi leaps high into the air, using his tantō to destroy the attacks of the guards as Sasuke, riding atop Aoda,
cuts

through
 the beast's
clone minions
. Naruto then directs a
Wind Release: Ultra-Big Ball Rasenshuriken
 towards the Ten-Tails, while Sasuke brings out his
Susanoo
 to fire Blaze Release: Susanoo Kagutsuchi towards the Rasenshuriken. All of the
Rookie Nine
 cheer them on, including a happy Sakura, who sheds a tear. Naruto remembers what he had said some time ago to
Yamato
 that only wind was able to make fire stronger. The Rasenshuriken merges with the flaming arrow, forming a
swirling mass of black flames
 which struck upon the Ten-Tails. As they watched the Ten-Tails burn,
Sai
 questioned
Jūgo
 about Sasuke's true motives while Sakura looked on solemnly. Elsewhere,
Orochimaru
,
Suigetsu
, and
Karin
 arrive at their destination, with the Sannin commenting on
Tsunade
's bad condition.

Trivia

Shizune
 is depicted wearing a
Konohagakure
's
forehead protector
 instead of the Allied Shinobi Forces'. This wasn't corrected in the tankōbon version.
