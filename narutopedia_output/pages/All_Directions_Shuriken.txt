After using the
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
,
Naruto Uzumaki
 and his shadow clones simultaneously throw
shuriken
 at a target. Because of how many shuriken there are and how many directions they're thrown from, the target, regardless of how skilled they may be, cannot reasonably dodge all of them.
 As such, their only real option is to try and shield themselves to minimise the damage.
 This focus on the shuriken inevitably creates blind-spots in the target, which is the actual purpose of this technique: the many Narutos can focus on these blind-spots to execute
additional attacks
.

Trivia

"Four directions, eight directions" (
四方八方
,
Shihōhappō
) is an idiom meaning "from everywhere", "in all directions". The four directions are the cardinal directions: North, East, South, and West. The eight directions are these four and their halfway points: North-East, South-East, South-West, and North-West.
