Naruto
 merges his
Rasengan
 with
Minato
's to create a Rasengan that drills through the opponent, causing massive damage. The Supreme Ultimate Rasengan, like the
Tornado Rasengan
, has several streams of
chakra
 spiralling around the centre, but it has far more streams, completely covering the users' bodies. These streams are capable of deflecting attacks. The sphere itself appears unstable, with the shape fluctuating wildly unlike the solid sphere shape of other Rasengan techniques.

Trivia

The
Supreme Ultimate
 (
太極
,
Taikyoku
) is a Taoist concept which refers to the undifferentiated absolute and infinite potentiality, encompassing the entire universe.

Minato states that when two similar chakra are near each other, they resonate. And when they are combined, the strongest Rasengan can be formed.
