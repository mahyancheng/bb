Lyrics

Rōmaji

Daitai itsumo doori ni

Sono kado wo magareba

Hitonami ni magire komi

Tokete kiete iku

Boku wa michi wo nakushi

Kotoba suranaku shite shimau

Dakedo hitotsu dake wa

Nokotteta nokotteta kimi no koe ga

Warau kao mo okoru kao mo subete

Boku wo arukaseru

Kumo ga kireta saki wo mitara kitto

Nee wakaru desho?

Nee wakaru desho?

Kanji

だいたいいつも通りに

その角を曲がれば

人波に紛れ込み

溶けて消えていく

僕は道を無くし

言葉すら無くしてしまう

だけど一つだけは

残ってた残ってた

君の声が

笑う顔も怒る顔も全て

僕を歩かせる

雲が切れた先を

見たらきっと

ねえ わかるでしょ?

曖昧に生きていても

心が未熟でも

それでいいほらそこには

大事な人が居る

君が迷うのなら

僕が道しるべになろう

後は信じればいい

確かめる術は持った

恐れないで

光集め空に放っている

君に分かる様に

そして歩む道を

もっと照らそう

どこまでも…

髪・声・口・指先へ届け

今だけでもいい

English

Just as usual,

When I turn around that corner,

I merge into the sea of people.

and melt away into nothing.

I lose myself completely.

and can find no words to say

Yet, one thing, your voice

Still remains, still remains

Everything about you, your smile, and your anger

Keeps me walking forward

If I just look up where the clouds start to break

I think you know what I mean?

I think you know what I mean?

Rōmaji (Full Version)

Kimi no kokoro e

Kimi no kokoro e

Todoke, todoke, todoke

Boku no kokoro ga

Kimi no kokoro e

Toduku you ni

Utayou…

Daitai itsumo doori ni

Sono kado wo magareba

Hitonami ni magire komi

Tokete kiete iku

Boku wa michi wo nakushi

Kotoba suranaku shite shimau

Dakedo hitotsu dake wa

Nokotteta nokotteta kimi no koe ga

Warau kao mo okoru kao mo subete

Boku wo arukaseru

Kumo ga kireta saki wo mitara kitto

Nee wakaru desho?

Nee wakaru desho?

Aimai ni ikiteite mo

Kokoro ga mijyuku demo

Sore de ii hora soko ni wa

Daiji na hito ga iru

Kimi ga mayou no nara

Boku ga michishirube ni narou

Ato ha shinjireba ii

Tashikameru sube wa motta

Osore nai de

Hikari atsume sora ni hanatte iru

Kimi ni wakaru you ni

Soshite ayumu michi wo

Motto tera sou

Doko made mo…

Doko made mo…

Doko made mo…

Doko made mo…

Kami koe kuchi yubisaki he todoke

Ima dake demo ii

Ima dake demo ii

English (Full Version)

To your heart (x2)

Reach, reach, reach.

My heart to your heart.

To reach you, I sing…

Just as usual,

When I turn around that corner,

I merge into the sea of people.

and melt away into nothing.

I lose myself completely.

and can find no words to say

Yet, one thing, your voice

Still remains, still remains

Everything about you, your smile, and your anger

Keeps me walking forward

If I just look up where the clouds start to break

I think you know what I mean?

I think you know what I mean?

My life has been vague,

My heart has been raw.

Up there, look ahead,

A dear person is there.

If you get lost, I will be your guiding path,

Only if you believe,

Making sure of its ways,

Without fear.

Light gathers, shooting across the sky,

It understands you.

And this path that we walk,

Will shine brighter,

Wherever it goes…

Wherever it goes..

Wherever it goes…

Wherever it goes…

Wherever hair, mouth, fingertip meet,

For now, this is just fine.

For now, this is just fine.
