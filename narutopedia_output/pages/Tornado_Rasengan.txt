The
Tornado Rasengan
 is a
Rasengan
 formed from the released chakra of
Kurama
. The Rasengan formed is red similar to the
Demon Fox Rasengan
 from
Naruto the Movie: Legend of the Stone of Gelel
, but with several streams of red chakra spiralling around the sphere. The Rasengan can then be further compressed giving the sphere more power.
