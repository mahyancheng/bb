Summary

Mirai
 removes her civilian clothing and dons her
forehead protector
. This allows
Ryūki
 to identify her as a
shinobi
, prompting him to berate
Tatsumi
 for bringing her. Mirai demands to know his reasons for kidnapping so many young women, to which Ryūki responds that he is trying to save the world by achieving immortality. Tatsumi is upset to hear that Ryūki's offer to help her meet her dead mother was a lie, but Ryūki insists that that part can still be true: she can see her mother after he's killed her. Mirai saves Tatsumi, though is injured in the process.

Mirai recognises the name of the deity that Ryūki worships:
Jashin
. She recalls when she secretly read about her
father
's killer,
Hidan
, a follower of Jashin who could not die. She and Ryūki discuss Hidan, with Ryūki insisting that Hidan was a hero to the world, saving those he killed from the tyranny of peace. Mirai scoffs at the concept and vows to stop him. Ryūki instructs his followers to attack Mirai. She quickly defeats them all with
Flying Swallow
, her father's
jutsu
 taught to her by
Shikamaru
.
