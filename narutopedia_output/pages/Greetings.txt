 Salutations) is chapter 492 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Naruto
 and his
Konoha
 bodyguards disembark on the
Land of Lightning Island
. Naruto approaches
Killer B
 and asks for his help in learning to control a
tailed beast
. B initially appears uninterested, so Naruto tries to sell him on the idea by acting like him. In doing so he accidentally insults B, so B refuses. Naruto asks
Motoi
, the island's caretaker, how he can convince B, claiming that B is too conceited. Motoi grows angry by Naruto's accusations, but lets it go. He tells Naruto that B probably had his reasons and directs him to the
Falls of Truth
. He tells Naruto to enter the falls to face his inner self. A "dark Naruto" confronts him, asking why he didn't humour the earlier, "shallow" Konoha villagers with autographs.

Trivia

In the U.S.
Shōnen Jump
 magazine version of this chapter, when Naruto uses his
Harem Technique
 on Killer B, more clouds were added for censorship, while the English tankōbon version kept the original artwork.
