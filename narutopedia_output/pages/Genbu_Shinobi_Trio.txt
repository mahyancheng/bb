 (

History

Despite a strong appearance, they fail early in the first stage of the exam, tripping on a tree root and activating one of the traps prepared by
Tenten
. Their early failure caused the
Fourth Tsuchikage
 to ensure they start their training again from the beginning once they return to Iwagakure. The three genin have a
cooperation ninjutsu
 in their arsenal, called "Ninja Art: Genbu Winter Wind High King Formation: No.108 — Revision" (
