"
The Five Great Nations Mobilise
" (
動き出す大国
,
Ugokidasu Taikoku
) is episode 218 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

The
daimyō
 of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 communicate in a hastily arranged teleconference where they all give their approval to the formation of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. As the five
Kage
 then return to their respective villages,
Kakashi

summons
 his
ninken
 to relay the news about
Danzō
's death to their allies.

In
Sunagakure
,
Gaara
 holds a meeting with the
Suna Council
 and relays to them to events that transpired at the
Five Kage Summit
. One of the councillors debates the idea of being allied with
Konoha
, since Danzō is the
Hokage
 and Danzō is known for his duplicitous and shady tactics. However, a fellow
shinobi
 interrupts the meeting to notify them that
Team Kakashi
 had encountered
Madara
 and
Sasuke
, and that the latter killed Danzō.
Kankurō
 remarks how far Sasuke must have fallen in order to kill a Hokage and wonders whether
Naruto
 would truly be able to save him from the darkness.
Temari
 reminds him that it was Naruto who saved Gaara when they could not and Gaara tells them that such is Naruto's power and what he does concerning Sasuke is up to him.

Back in the village,
Shikamaru
 is notified by his
father
 regarding the recent events. He heads to the front gates with
Chōji
 and
Ino
 to meet the incoming squad. Naruto tells them that he fought Sasuke but that he would share the details later, and asks Shikamaru if he would gather the other members of the
Konoha 11
 as he has news to share.
Konohamaru
,
Udon
 and
Moegi
 also come running up to Naruto, wanting to interview him for their newspaper, but Naruto tells them that he is busy and would do it some other time. As he walks through the village gates, he notices the restoration process and smiles.

Trivia

The Kazekage's garbs are once again miscoloured blue instead of green in this episode.

A few
Kiri
 ninja mention a Kiri ninja named
Ganryū
 who makes a later appearance in
episode 242
.
