literally meaning:

Background






The first ever summit of the five Kage is convened.



Before becoming the Second Raikage, he had a long tenure as the
First Raikage
's guard.
 During his service, he accompanied him to the first ever Five
Kage Summit
. There he stood behind the First watching diligently as the proceedings unfolded.

Eventually, his long service and dedication earned him the appointment of Second Raikage.
 During his tenure, A entered Kumogakure into a formal alliance with
Konohagakure
, however, during the ceremony both he, and the
Second Hokage
 were ambushed by the
Gold and Silver Brothers
, who were attempting to stage a
coup d'état
. Both A and the Second Hokage were brought to the verge of death during that battle.
.
 Overall A's actions helped Kumogakure a lot in the way of achieving peace.

Personality

A inherited the strong will of his predecessor to protect Kumogakure. He was also described as being friendly and intelligent, seen by his versed knowledge in politics.

Appearance






A as the Raikage.



A was a dark-skinned man with a broad, flat nose and dark eyes which had markings underneath them. He had shoulder-length, black hair which he wore in a peculiar style, along with a stylised beard which tapered off into a goatee. He also had sideburns which curved inwards, just underneath his eyes. He wore the standard attire of the Kumo-nin which included a white
forehead protector
, along with a high-collared shirt with mesh armour underneath. Over all this he wore a slight variation of Kumogakure's modern
flak jacket
 which was seemingly decorated with medals of sorts. He also wore plated armour that covered his right shoulder reminiscent of those worn by
samurai
. He also has a gold-coloured, rectangular marking on his nose.

Before becoming the Second Raikage, he wore a long sleeved dark-coloured shirt which was opened to reveal the mesh-armour shirt underneath along with a scarf that hung around his neck, dark-coloured pants and a simple headband.

Abilities

Though not much is known about his abilities, the fact that he was the appointed the Second Raikage indicates he was undoubtedly a powerful shinobi. Even before becoming a Kage, his skills were such that he was appointed to be the guard of his
predecessor
 — something he gained much renown for. He was also credited to be well versed in political aspects, indicating a decent amount of intelligence.
