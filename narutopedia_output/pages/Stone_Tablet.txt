The stone tablet.



The
stone tablet
 (
石碑
,
sekihi
) is a monument which was created by
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 in order to discourage his
son
's descendants from attempting to recreate the
Rinnegan
.
 The tablet can only be deciphered fully by the Rinnegan, while the
Sharingan
 and
Mangekyō Sharingan
 are able to partially decipher it.

History

Some time after Hagoromo's death, certain details on the tablet were forged by
Black Zetsu
 as part of its plan to revive
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
.
 The tablet eventually fell into the possession of the
Uchiha clan
, the descendants of
Indra Ōtsutsuki
, where it was secretly passed down for generations.
 After the formation of
Konohagakure
, the tablet was kept in the underground bunker of the
Naka Shrine
 for decades, before being relocated to a forest.

More specifically, the following sentences were quoted:

"Seeking stability, one god was divided into yin and yang, these opposing two acting together obtain all things in creation" (
“一つの神が安定を求め陰と陽に分極した 相反する二つは作用し合い森羅万象を得る”
,
"Hitotsu no kami ga antei o motome in to yō ni bunkyokushita, aihansuru futatsu wa sayōshiai shinra banshō o eru"
)

"When someone who possesses the power of Saṃsāra approaches the moon, an eye will open that is reflected on the moon to grant the eternal dream." (
「輪廻の力を持つ者が月に近づきし時、無限の夢を叶えるための月に映せし眼が開く」
,
"Rinne no chikara o motsu mono ga tsuki ni chikazukishi toki, mugen no yume o kanaeru tame no tsuki ni utsuseshi me ga hiraku."
)

Trivia

Despite having neither the Rinnegan, nor the Sharingan, Black Zetsu was able to read and rewrite the text on the tablet.

Kabuto Yakushi
 and
Orochimaru
, while unable to read the tablet, managed to come up with a hypothesis of the secrets based on many years of research.

Obito (as Madara) states that the creation of the moon using the
Chibaku Tensei
 was written on the tablet; however,
Black Zetsu
 later reveals that the
Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei
 was the real cause. It is unknown whether
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 really wrote that version or
Black Zetsu
 merely rewrote that part. In a similar matter Madara states that
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 acted alone defeating the
Ten-Tails
 without mentioning
Hamura Ōtsutsuki
.
