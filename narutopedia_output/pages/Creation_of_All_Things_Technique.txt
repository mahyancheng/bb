The
Creation of All Things Technique
 was a technique possessed by Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki that allowed him to turn fantasy into reality. The process he used is explained to have initially involved the administration of imagination, and the spiritual energy which forms the basis of
Yin

chakra
 to create physical forms from nothingness. Then, through the application of vitality, and the physical energy which forms the basis of
Yang
 chakra, he would breathe life into the resulting creations. The
tailed beasts
 were created from the
Ten-Tails
' chakra with this technique.

In the anime, when using this ability, the beings created are minuscule and surrounded by a magatama-like green energy pod.

Trivia

It is said that Izanagi is simply a practical application of this technique.

According to
Obito Uchiha
, the Sage of the Six Paths used this ability to create many things besides the tailed beasts.

During his fight with
Naruto Uzumaki
,
Sasuke Uchiha
 merged all of the tailed beasts' chakra using
Susanoo
 as a vessel.
Kurama
 described this act as being on par with Hagoromo's creation of the tailed beasts, except in reverse.
