Summary

Neji
 successfully strikes
Kidōmaru
 with his
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
. Kidōmaru covers himself with a special golden version of his webbing at the last second, allowing him to avoid damage and prevent Neji from sealing his
tenketsu
. Knowing he cannot win a close-combat fight, Kidōmaru starts attacking from afar. Neji is able to block his attacks with
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
. Surprised by the defence and Neji's ability to react to attacks from behind, Kidōmaru tries to find a weakness in his abilities. After activating his
cursed seal
 he douses Neji in webbing.
