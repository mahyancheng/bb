"
Coup d'État
" (
クーデター
,
Kūdetā
) is episode 358 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Despite
Hiruzen
's misgivings,
Danzō
 persuades the
Konoha Council
 to side with his decision to have the
Uchiha
 put under surveillance as they become the main suspects in the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
 due to the ocular ability of the
Sharingan
. Danzō insists that the
Anbu
 put the Uchiha under 24-7 surveillance.
Kakashi
 who also disagrees with this tact is assigned to the mission alongside the dutiful
Itachi
 who comments that the clan were already aware of the fact that they were under suspicion.
 Members of the
Konoha Military Police
 become more and more belligerent in their duties despite
Fugaku
's efforts and the complaints from the citizens soon reach the ears of the higher-ups who seem determined to increase pressure on the clan against the Third's better judgement. Elsewhere on a mission, two members of
Ao
's team suddenly fall, clutching their heads. Using the stolen
Byakugan
 in his possession the
Kirigakure
-nin uncovers that it was the work of
Shisui Uchiha
 and retreats. Reporting in, Shisui's
team
 informs the Council of the success of the mission and then, he requests a private audience with Hiruzen where his request to act independently to clear up the suspicion on the Uchiha is granted. He then informs Itachi of this as well as the fact that he was assigned the task of spying on him since he had lost the trust of some of the clan's members. Realising that he would not be able to stop the coup d'état, Shisui shares his plan to use
Kotoamatsukami
 on Fugaku in order to dissuade the clan from their actions with Hiruzen and Danzō — the latter of whom is sceptic that it will work. In his last meeting with the young Uchiha, Shisui initially foils Danzō's attempt to attack him but is caught off guard when he uses
Izanagi
 and is able to steal one of his eyes. Escaping from Danzō and his Anbu, Shisui meets with Itachi and notes that it was too late to stop the Uchiha before entrusting Itachi with his remaining eye as well as the task of protecting the village and the name of the Uchiha. Shisui's suicide causes Itachi to awaken his
Mangekyō Sharingan
 which he uses to read even more of the
stone tablet
 in the
Naka Shrine
. Over time, things deteriorate even more between the clan and the village, leaving Itachi to contemplate his next course of action to try and honour his friend's last wishes.
