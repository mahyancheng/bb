Mitsuo
 (
ミツオ
) was a former thief and a follower of
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
.

Background






Mitsuo after joining Hagoromo's Ninshū sect.



In the days following the battle
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 and the
Ten-Tails
, Mitsuo took residence near one of many destroyed bridges. He would claim to aid travellers to cross the bridge, only to rob them. One day, Hagoromo and
Futami
 came by the bridge. Mitsuo began talking them up, before recognising Futami, who he knew as a fellow thief. Angered at the perceived intrusion on his territory, Mitsuo began to argue with Futami, only to discover he was no longer a thief, and that he and Hagoromo intended to rebuild the bridge. The same change that happened to Futami happened to Mitsuo, who became the second of Hagoromo's many
Ninshū
 followers.

Personality

Initially, Mitsuo was quick to enrage, such as when he detected Futami in his territory uninvited. He also seemed to be prone to violence, but Hagoromo's teachings changed his mind and he became a humble follower of Ninshū.

Appearance

Mitsuo had short, cheek length black hair and his bangs hung just above his eyes. He had black eyes. As a thief, he wore a long, light-grey shirt, held together by a white sash. He also wore plain shorts. As a follower of Ninshū, he donned the typical high-collared, light-coloured kimono, tied by a dark sash. The collar of the kimono was additionally adorned with magatama.
