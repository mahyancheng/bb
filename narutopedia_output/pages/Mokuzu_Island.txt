Mokuzu Island.



The
Mokuzu Island
 (
モクズ島
,
Mokuzu-jima
) is an island where travellers resupply their stocks and weapons. The island has a shape of the moon, where the two sides almost form a closed circle. The water between the sides is calm.

The island is home to criminals, expecting travellers. They power
various traps and mechanisms
 and wait for the mist to rise, whirlpools and rocks to emerge. They wait for the ship to sink, and then wait for the valuables to float so they could claim them. There is also a ramen shop located on the island, which serves as a hideout for the members of
Mokuzu Gang
.

Shikamaru

Tenten
 went there to buy the tools for the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 by
storing
 them inside of Tenten's
scrolls
.
