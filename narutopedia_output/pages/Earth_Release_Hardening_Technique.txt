By utilising earth-based
chakra
, the user encases their body in surrounding rock creating an armour. This casing can also be used to create extendible weapons to strike a target with.

Sadai
 has demonstrated that he could use the armour to alter his physical appearance, akin to a costume and mask, giving himself a larger physique and different face. However, his usage also adds weight to him, slowing him down.
