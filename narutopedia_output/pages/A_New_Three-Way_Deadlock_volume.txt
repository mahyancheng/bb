A New Three-Way Deadlock
 (
新たなる三竦み
,
Aratanaru Sansukumi
,
Viz:
 The New Three) is volume 66 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 628

"
Now and Hereafter
" (
ここに、そしてこれから
,
Koko ni, Soshite Kore Kara
)

As the situation on the battlefield gets dire, with attacks coming at
all

ends
 from
Obito
,
Madara
, and the
Ten-Tails
,
Chōji
 notes that
Naruto
's chakra cloaks were protecting them from the worst of the attacks. As
Sakura
's cloak deflects the giant
kunai
 and
magatama
 respectively, she wondered if keeping up a feat like this would not harm Naruto in the end. Evading an attack from Obito thanks to
Kakashi
's warning, Naruto once again decries Obito's ideals, noting that a loner like him could never understand his euphoria to have all his comrades around him. As Obito finds a flaw in Naruto's sentiments, Kakashi looks on wondering why Obito was testing Naruto in that manner. While Kurama wonders how Naruto was doing as he controls its distributed chakra simultaneously, Madara — his face contorted into a maniacal smile — senses
Hashirama
's chakra on the battlefield. With the Ten-Tails letting out a shriek on the battlefield, it undergoes yet another, albeit slight transformation. Kurama warns Naruto of the impending danger as the atmosphere begins to change on the battlefield; Obito muses that this was the consequence of the
Alliance
 separating him and Madara from the beast and wonders if he should just become the beast's
jinchūriki
. The situation prompts Kakashi to attempt to
warp
 the beast away. However, he is intercepted by Obito and as Kakashi calls out to Naruto to handle there, he and Obito warp each other away to
Kamui's dimension
. Elsewhere, Madara notes the fun was about to begin, and cloaks himself with his
Susanoo
's ribcage. The Ten-Tails' power creates
earthquakes, thunderstorms, and tornadoes
 all over the battlefield.

Chapter 629

"
Windhole
" (
風穴
,
Kazaana
)

The
Tenpenchii
 technique used by the
Ten-Tails
 culminates disastrously, still causing powerful twisters and lightning strikes, leading a
Susanoo
-clad
Madara
 to assume that most of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 had been wiped out by the attack. However, as the battlefield clears, the shinobi are all revealed to be alive and well, having been protected by their respective shrouds. Before the seemingly confused Ten-Tails,
Naruto
 stands bleeding and exhausted, but still smiling confidently. Looking on, the Ten-Tails sees the images of the
tailed beasts
 (sans
Gyūki
 and
Shukaku
) behind Naruto, and ultimately a
silhouette
 with the
Rinnegan
 staring back at him. Shocked, the beast undergoes another transformation, as the shrouds vanish from around the
shinobi
, and Naruto falls to one knee, very fatigued. Madara — who notes that the fight had started to bore him, and he had already found
something else
 to preoccupy his time — turns in time to see the Alliance rally around Naruto, providing a defence for him while
Sakura
 begins to
heal
 him. Elsewhere, as
Kakashi
 and
Obito
 enter
Kamui's dimension
, Kakashi is the first to regain his footing and attack, but stops just short of driving his
Lightning Cutter
 through Obito's heart. Trying to speak sense to his former friend, even though Obito decries his actions and tries to play on his conscience, Kakashi notes that he had long since realised that Obito was trying to overlap his old self with Naruto. Obito, however, notes that he was doing it for the exact opposite reason and then declares that he did not wage a war in the world just for
Rin
. With this, Obito phases through Kakashi's Lightning Cutter, then recreates the scene where Kakashi had killed Rin in the same manner. He then reveals that he knew the truth of how
Kirigakure
 had made Rin into
Isobu
's
jinchūriki
 with the sole intention of destroying
Konohagakure
, and how Rin had impaled herself on Kakashi's Lightning Cutter in order to protect the village. He then states that it was the system of the villages, and the
shinobi
 that he intended to destroy because no good came of it. With this, Obito announces that he is incapable of feeling pain, and shows Kakashi that there was no heart in his chest, just a windhole which was caused by the hell of this world.

Chapter 630

"
What Can Fill a Hole
" (
埋めるもの
,
Umeru Mono
)

Further elaborating his point,
Obito
 offers
Kakashi
 consolation to join a
world where he may fill the hole in his heart
, and goes as far as to
recreate

Rin
, and himself as young children to persuade Kakashi. Kakashi, however, shrugs off the idea and tells Obito that delusions could not fix the empty hole in his heart. Meanwhile on the battlefield, the
Ten-Tails
 begins to transform once again as it charges its
attack
.
Gyūki
 warns
B
 that if it reaches its final stage, it would be hopeless to win and that it is their turn to lead the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. As he watches the progressing battle, Madara notes that the Ten-Tails has started to become impatient after seeing the
tailed beasts
 inside
Naruto
 and is dismayed that his "fun" was about to end. Noticing the enormous attack, various
shinobi
 start to despair having lost Naruto's chakra shroud.
Sakura
 rallies the shinobi to continue fighting as she
heals
 Naruto, declaring that they had to do everything in their power.
Shikamaru
, having thought of a plan, contacts
Kitsuchi
 via
Ino
's
telepathy
 and inquires from him the
hand seals
 used to perform the simplest
earthen defence
 intending to use the quantity of the shinobi to overwhelm the Ten-Tails' attack. Having learned the seals, Ino informs all of the shinobi of them as they begin to initiate the strategy. Within
Kamui's dimension
, Obito questions Kakashi how reality may mend the hole in one's heart. Kakashi calmly tells Obito that being trash has taught him a valuable lesson — that the hole can always be filled up by the feelings of his friends — going as far as to consider those who abandon those feelings way worse than those who abandon their friends. Obito is startled at his words as it was the very words he uttered to Kakashi when they were young. With this, Kakashi states that he won't let the feelings of the old Obito go to waste even if he himself refuses them. Meanwhile at the battlefield, the Tailed Beast Ball starts to best the various earth walls created even with B's support to change the trajectory. Just as the walls were about to breach, the attack
disappears
 following the arrival of the
Fourth Hokage
 — who questions his son if he had arrived too late to which Naruto informs him that he was right on time.

Chapter 631

"
Team 7
" (
第七班
,
Dainanahan
)

As
Sakura
 questions who the man before them was,
Minato
 introduces himself and advises her to get ready for the explosion. Just then the sea rises up behind them, leading Minato to explain to the confused
Allied Shinobi Forces
 that he had sent the
Ten-Tails
'
Tailed Beast Ball
 to the sea.
Akamaru
's growls alert everyone in the vicinity that something was not right with their would-be saviour, and the shinobi soon notice that he is a
reincarnated
 shinobi.
 However, Minato tells them not to worry as he was on their side, and asks Sakura if she was
Naruto
's girlfriend. Naruto suggests they are, causing Sakura to strike him and demand he focus on the matter at hand; the action reminds Minato of
Kushina
 and her own short temper. As Naruto notes that he has felt their chakra in
Tailed Beast Mode
, and that others were coming as well, the shinobi on the battlefield turn in shock to see the three other previous
Hokage
 arrive. With their arrival, both
Tobirama
 and
Hiruzen
 praise Minato for the speed.
Madara
 who can barely contain himself, shouts to
Hashirama
 that he had been waiting for him, to which Hashirama notes — with matched exuberance — that he would take care of him later after stopping the Ten-Tails. Calling the other Hokage to action, Minato dons a chakra mantle similar to that of Naruto's, much to the others' shock, and leads his son to brag about his father once again to
Kurama
 who retaliated that it knew this better than he did. With the Hokage all positioned, they perform the
Four Red Yang Formation
 technique to trap the beast, with Hashirama adding an
additional seal
, pinning down the beast's tails and arms. Just then
Sasuke
 and
Jūgo
 arrive on the battle, and as the other
Konoha 11
 members rally around Naruto and Sasuke, some in disbelief, other on the defensive, Sasuke notes that a great deal had happened, and declares that he would become
Hokage
. Though the others explain this was basically impossible for him who had abandoned the village and committed such heinous crimes, Sasuke simply noted that he didn't care what they thought of him, and that he would change the village. Naruto, all healed, stands beside Sasuke and claims in response that it was he who would actually become Hokage, all of which leads Hashirama to reprimand the two boys telling them to concentrate on the task at hand. Telling Sakura to rest then, he and Sasuke move to the battlefield, though Sakura follows as well, telling them that she was not a weak woman, and had been trained just as well as any of the two of them by a
Sannin
. This prompts Naruto to note that
Team 7
 had been reborn as the three look on, prepared to fight.

Chapter 632

"
Fighting Together
" (
共闘
,
Kyōtō
)

With the arrival of
Sasuke
, despite everyone not fully acknowledging him, the reformed
Rookie Nine
 prepare themselves for the upcoming battle against the
Ten-Tails
. Noticing the surrounding
barrier
, the Ten-Tails begins to charge yet another
Tailed Beast Ball
 only to be contained, surprising many
shinobi
 regarding the prowess of the
reincarnated

Hokage
.
Hashirama
, taking this opportunity, creates five
wood clones
 — four to help the
alliance
 counter-attack and one to do battle against
Madara
, who decides to simply wait until the original is available. With the momentary release of the barrier,
Naruto
,
Sakura
, Sasuke and various shinobi charge in to face several
replications
 of the restrained
tailed beast
.
 Upon entering, Sakura contemplates the times wherein she was always protected by her teammates and her resolve to walk side by side with them. As she reminisces the time she was called as
Tsunade
's disciple, Sakura stores up three years' worth of
chakra
 gaining a
considerable amount of strength
 which surprises both Naruto and Sasuke. Hashirama is surprised to see such a feat while
Shizune
 notes the difficulty of such chakra control. Sakura, having let her guard down momentarily, is saved by the techniques of
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
. With both her teammates by her side, Sakura happily notes that she was finally on par with them.

Chapter 633

"
Forward
" (
前へ
,
Mae e
)

As
Team 7
 stand together,
Naruto
 examines
Sasuke
's
Fire Release
 and
dōjutsu
 while Sasuke examines Naruto's
new form
. Wildly impressed by his son,
Minato
 notes that his son was even able to
change the shape and the nature of his Rasengan
.
Kiba
 exclaims that
Team 8
 will be going too, declaring they won't lose to Team 7. He then reveals he can create
shadow clones
 like Naruto, who isn't impressed since he only produced one clone. Kiba, stating he still has three times the power, uses the
Human Beast Mixture Transformation — Three-Headed Wolf
 technique with it, and
decimates
 several of the
Ten-Tails
'
clone minions
. Evading an attack and moving into close-range
Shino
 punches one, activating the
Parasitic Giant Insect — Bug Bite
 technique using his special
kidaichū
.
Hinata
, encouraged by thoughts of
Neji
 and Naruto, finishes the
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
 on a mini-clone, noting that Naruto has always been working hard and she's always been by his side; activating her
Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists
 she declares that she'd use the two attacks together this time.

Team Asuma
, not to be outshone by the other
Rookie Nine
, use
Ino–Shika–Chō
 "Formation E":
Human Bullet Yo-Yo
, wiping out several clones.
Sai
, who notes that he's also part of Team 7, makes an attempt at the main body via an aerial strike while flying on his
ink bird
. When one of its clones starts attacking him, Naruto uses his
chakra arms
 to save him. The
Allied Shinobi Forces
 note that the fight is pointless for the clones continue to multiply and grow. Sai asks Naruto if he can
give chakra to the alliance
, but he explains he cannot since he has not saved up enough of
Kurama
's
chakra
. Sai suggests that it would be best to defeat the largest of the clones, and slip close enough to beat the Ten-Tails itself, but it would be too far to jump at one go. He explains, however, that if they were to suffer severe wounds, the medical group would not be able to make it up front. Naruto,
Sakura
 and Sasuke simultaneously use the
Summoning Technique
, saying that they fortunately have a solution to the problem. Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke summon
Gamakichi
,
Katsuyu
,
Aoda
, each the solution to one problem.

Chapter 634

"
A New Three-Way Deadlock
" (
新たなる三竦み
,
Aratanaru Sansukumi
)

After
Sasuke
,
Naruto
, and
Sakura
 summon
Aoda
,
Gamakichi
, and
Katsuyu
 respectively, Naruto is surprised that
Gamabunta
 didn't appear. Gamakichi states that his father was busy, and Naruto exclaims about Gamakichi's growth spurt. He then instructs Gamakichi to attack the original
Ten-Tails
. Meanwhile, Sasuke instructs Aoda to go straight ahead, while he would attack the original himself. Sakura tells Katsuyu to split into several parts to
heal
 the
Shinobi Alliance
.
Minato
 acknowledges the trio, stating that this is the new three-way deadlock summoning leading
Hiruzen
 to remember his students and acknowledge that it was truly the dawning of a new era. Gamakichi leaps high into the air, using his tantō to destroy the attacks of the guards as Sasuke, riding atop Aoda,
cuts

through
 the beast's
clone minions
. Naruto then directs a
Wind Release: Ultra-Big Ball Rasenshuriken
 towards the Ten-Tails, while Sasuke brings out his
Susanoo
 to fire Blaze Release: Susanoo Kagutsuchi towards the Rasenshuriken. All of the
Rookie Nine
 cheer them on, including a happy Sakura, who sheds a tear. Naruto remembers what he had said some time ago to
Yamato
 that only wind was able to make fire stronger. The Rasenshuriken merges with the flaming arrow, forming a
swirling mass of black flames
 which struck upon the Ten-Tails. As they watched the Ten-Tails burn,
Sai
 questioned
Jūgo
 about Sasuke's true motives while Sakura looked on solemnly. Elsewhere,
Orochimaru
,
Suigetsu
, and
Karin
 arrive at their destination, with the Sannin commenting on
Tsunade
's bad condition.

Chapter 635

"
A New Wind
" (
新しい風
,
Atarashii Kaze
)

Arriving to where
Tsunade
 and the other
Kage
 were and upon seeing
Katsuyu
, a mischievous
Suigetsu
 wonders how much salt it would take to kill it. This causes an argument to strike up between him and
Karin
 who can not make up her mind whether or not she loved
Sasuke
 despite trying to kill her previously. Using fear tactics,
Orochimaru
 gets the two to comply, and the trio turn their attention to the Kage. A wary Katsuyu, however, prepares to
attack
 them, but stood down after Orochimaru declared they were there to help as the healing process was going very slowly because of Tsunade's current state. With this, Suigetsu puts the two halves of Tsunade's body back together, Karin
heals her
 which in turn allows Katsuyu to reconnect Tsunade's bisected halves. With Tsunade healed and able to stand, she questioned her fellow
Sannin
 about his motives.
 Orochimaru claimed that he had changed from his previous views of wanting to move the world, and wanted to be around when a certain other person did — leading Tsunade to note that
Jiraiya
 would have been alive if Orochimaru had made this discovery earlier. Turning their discussion to the war, Katsuyu interjects that it would brief them on what was happening, much to Tsunade's shock that the slug was also back on the battlefield. As Orochimaru and the others took their leave, back on the battlefield,
Sai
 questions
Sakura
 about her views on Sasuke's return, her answer to which leads Sai to believe that although the words were sincere, her smile was a fake. As the
Ten-Tails
 burned,
Naruto
 instructs Sasuke to put the
flames
 out once the beast was weakened so that he and
Kurama
 could extract the
tailed beasts
 but Sasuke refuses, noting that he would burn them all down to create a new system. Not intending to go peacefully, however, the Ten-Tails removes the part of its body which was burning much to the Uchiha's shock. Briefed on the situation — the Kage now all healed — made preparations to head to the battlefield. Meanwhile, in
Kamui's dimension
,
Kakashi
 and
Obito
 battle wages on, with Kakashi piercing Obito with his
Lightning Cutter
 and Obito stabbing Kakashi with a large
shuriken
.

Chapter 636

"
The Current Obito
" (
今のオビトを
,
Ima no Obito o
)

Asking
Obito
 if he'd had enough of their
genjutsu
 battle,
Kakashi
 and Obito form the
seal of confrontation
 as they begin their real battle. They start to think back to their childhood days as young ninja, when they
fought
 under the instructions of their
sensei
. Kakashi remembers the "old Obito", who was just like
Naruto
, and resolves that to protect Naruto and the old Obito, he will have to defeat the current one. As both men deliver final blows, Kakashi impales Obito through his chest with a
lightning
-
infused

kunai
, while Obito stabs Kakashi with one of his
black rods
. Obito, unwilling to give up, states that defeating him will not gain any advantage to winning the
war
 despite having won their battle and
warps
 back to the battlefield. Meanwhile,
Madara

impales

Hashirama
's
wood clone
, and notes that Hashirama was putting too much energy into restraining the
Ten-Tails
. Though the clone attempts to dispute Madara's words, it is split in half before it can complete its statement. As Obito arrives atop the Ten-Tails' head, Madara decides that Obito had served his purpose to him, and though he wanted to fight Hashirama before he became a
jinchūriki
, the situation could not be helped. Forming a seal which affects Obito whose right side begins to spike out black rods and turn black, Madara declares that it was time to revive him with the
Outer Path: Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
. As this occurs, Obito remembers
Rin
 once again before forming a seal of his own and letting out a cry which draws the attention of many on the battlefield.

Chapter 637

"
The Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki
" (
十尾の人柱力
,
Jūbi no Jinchūriki
)

With
Obito
's cry resounding throughout the battlefield,
Madara
 muses that he had once told Obito that eventually, he would have to repay the legendary
Uchiha
 for saving his life. Noting Madara's intentions,
Hashirama
 tells both
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 to deal with Obito since they were the closest to him. As a contingency plan, Hashirama and
Tobirama
 create
wood
 and
shadow clones
 respectively to take on Madara in case it was too late to stop Obito. Meanwhile, Obito — whose hair was beginning to become thinner, and greyer due to the
Outer Path: Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 — begins to reminisce his life as part of
Team Minato
. Sasuke, riding atop
Aoda
, begins to slither on the
Ten-Tails
 to get close to Obito, and launches a
black arrow
 only to be retaliated by the
chakra receivers
 jutting out of the latter.
Minato
 — having formed a shadow clone himself —
teleports
 to Obito, who was reminiscing about the advice of his former sensei, and cuts him down. With shock, Minato realises that Obito had been the one who orchestrated the
destruction
 of
Konohagakure
. As Sasuke notes that only Madara was left to be sealed to end the war, Obito simply smirked at their plan as it is revealed he had prevented Madara's control much to the surprise of Naruto, Sasuke and Minato, who had regrouped after witnessing the escape of the Ten-Tails and Obito's transformation as he became the Ten-Tails'
jinchūriki
.

Author's Note

“

Naruto
 is really starting to enter its climax. It's gone on longer than I expected, but it's definitely inching closer to the finale. This volume's cover is an updated version of the
chapter 4
 title page illustration from volume 1. The image I thought up back then is finally coming true in this volume...
