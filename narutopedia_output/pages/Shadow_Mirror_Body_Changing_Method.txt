A technique passed down in the
Land of Demons
, it was used by Taruho to alter his appearance into that of
Shion
.

Overview

Before initiating the technique, the user must set up the area with patterned circle symbol. After performing special hand seals while standing within the prepared area, the technique will activate: ribbons of light extend out from various places on the user's body, covering them completely as they transform the user into what they desire, including any necessary items such as the suitable attire. However, the user's voice does not change.

Unlike a regular
transformation
, this variant is permanent, with purportedly no way for the user to return to their original form.
