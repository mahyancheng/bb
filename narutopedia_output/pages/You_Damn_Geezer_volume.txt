Shikamaru
 comes by
Naruto
's office, informs him that their children passed to the next phase of the Chūnin Exams, and that they're likely to face off against one another in the next phase. Naruto celebrates after Shikamaru leaves. Naruto meets with
Sasuke
, who is waiting on the decryption of
Kaguya
's scroll. When Sasuke turns to leave, Naruto confirms with Sasuke that he is training
Boruto
. Sasuke asks if Boruto told him, but Naruto answers it was
Konohamaru
. Naruto concedes to Sasuke's earlier claim that the essence of a shinobi never changes. At home, Boruto is congratulated for passing to the next phase of the exams by his mother and sister. He thanks them, says not to bother with dinner, and goes to his room.
 Boruto contemplates his
Kote
, when someone knocks on the door. Boruto covers the tool, stressing his earlier words, only to be surprised by Naruto. Naruto congratulates Boruto, mirroring Shikamaru's earlier words that important things should be said in person. Naruto tries fist-bumping Boruto, telling him not to lose to
Shikadai
. Boruto is appreciative of the words, but doesn't return the fist-bump, as not to expose his Kote. Naruto bumps his fist on Boruto's chest instead, and says he'll be watching him. After Naruto leaves, Boruto tries down-playing the event to himself, but smiles and tears up. At his office, Naruto looks at his old outfit.

The day of the third phase,
Lee
 as a proctor explains how the matches will be proceed. Boruto is matched against
Yurui
. The two exchange a few blows, before Yurui begins blowing his explosive bubblegum. When the smoke of the first explosion clears, Yurui has covered the arena with more bubbles. Knowing his father is watching, Boruto almost uses the shurikenjutsu he learned from Sasuke, but opts to use the Kote at the last moment, throwing a special shuriken that makes a very tight turn, causing the bubble Yurui is creating to blow up on his face. In the audience,
Sarada
 and
Mitsuki
 note the tight turn. Sarada, Shikadai, Mitsuki,
Araya
, and
Shinki
 defeat
Tarui
,
Yodo
,
Toroi
,
Inojin
, and
Chōchō
, respectively. Boruto fights Shikadai, who tries to immobilise Boruto's clones. Boruto almost lands a blow, but Shikadai expands his shadow over a wide area at the last moment, catching Boruto and all his clones. Determined not to lose, Boruto manages to release several small scrolls from his Kote, generating many more clones out of Shikadai's reach. Naruto notices the scrolls. Shikadai forfeits, not wanting to bother with countering so many clones. In the audience,
Temari
,
Sakura
, and
Ino
 recall when Shikamaru forfeited his fight against Temari.
Katasuke
 tells his subordinate they'll make their move soon. Naruto stands up, bothered. Sasuke receives the scroll's decrypted contents, and goes to tell Naruto about it immediately, certain the exams will have to be suspended. Naruto jumps down to the arena. Boruto tries fist-bumping him, but Naruto catches his hand, exposing the Kote, and asks Boruto what is going on.
Kinshiki
 and
Momoshiki
 fly towards the arena, Kinshiki sensing a lot of chakra gathering, and Momoshiki seeing Naruto with
Kurama
's chakra with his
Byakugan
.

Chapter 5

"
Momoshiki and Kinshiki!!
" (
モモシキとキンシキ!!
,
Momoshiki to Kinshiki!!
)

Naruto
 disqualifies
Boruto
 from the
Chūnin Exams
 because of his use of the
Kote
. Naruto says they'll have a talk later, causing Boruto to lash out at him, asking if he'll have the time, and saying that if he had actually taught him, things would not have come to this point.
Katasuke
 jumps in and tries to advertise the Kote.
Kinshiki
 lands on the arena, and punches the floor, severely damaging the structure.
Temari
,
Sakura
 and
Gaara
 begin protecting the audience. Gaara tells
Shinki
 not to try fighting the opponent.
Kankurō
 pulls people away from falling debris with his chakra threads. While Naruto instructs Boruto to leave,
Momoshiki
 drops in and kicks him away.

Sasuke
 swoops in to save
Sarada
, while
Mitsuki
 protects a child. Sasuke and Kinshiki exchange insults. Momoshiki pays no attention to Boruto, who tries attacking him with a
Fire Release
 from his Kote. Momoshiki absorbs it, and Boruto tries attacking him with more jutsu from his Kote, all of which are also absorbed. Momoshiki moves in to attack Boruto, but Naruto interferes, taking him away. From afar,
Shikamaru
 paralyses Momoshiki and Kinshiki with his
Shadow Imitation Technique
. Momoshiki absorbs it as well. Sasuke informs Naruto who they are, and that the contents of
Kaguya
's scroll was a warning about them, and their intention of acquiring the chakra fruit. Naruto admonishes them from attacking innocent people when he's the one they want. Momoshiki berates them as lesser beings, and ingests chakra pills, and creates a massive attack with the several jutsu he's absorbed. Feeling responsible for having empowered Momoshiki, Boruto creates a shadow clone to protect Sarada. Momoshiki throws an attack their way, but Naruto blocks it by manifesting
Kurama
's head out of chakra, as well as creating shadow clones to protect those still in the stadium. Sasuke lends Naruto his chakra. Momoshiki throws his full attack at the stadium. Naruto asks Sasuke to protect the children. Naruto prepares to go full out on Momoshiki.

Chapter 6

"
Loser
" (
ウスラトンカチ
,
Usuratonkachi
)

Naruto
 enters
Tailed Beast Mode
 and holds
Momoshiki
's attack back. He considers using a
Tailed Beast Ball
 on it, but changes his mind.
Boruto
 questions why he would do that, and
Sasuke
 explains that Naruto could just blast the attack away, but doing so would destroy much of the surrounding land. Momoshiki takes Naruto's course of action as proof of being an inferior form of life. Naruto takes the full force of the attack, as Boruto recalls Sasuke's words about Naruto's past struggles. Boruto wakes up at the hospital, where everyone was brought to after the attack.
 He finds his mother being treated by
Sakura
, with
Himawari
 by her side. Sakura explains
Hinata
 was injured trying to keep Momoshiki and
Kinshiki
 from taking Naruto. Full of regret, Boruto runs out of the hospital, tripping on a medical kit. He notices he's still wearing his
Kote
, and angrily removes and tosses it aside. He goes to the
Hokage
's office, and recalls his previous criticisms of Naruto. He finds and puts on Naruto's old jacket, and considers himself a loser. Sasuke agrees with him. Sasuke points out the similarities between Boruto's current situation and Naruto's when he was his age, prompting Boruto to ask Sasuke what Naruto did back then. Sasuke thinks Boruto is starting to overcome his weaknesses. Sasuke tells Boruto to ask Naruto himself, as Sasuke is still able to sense his chakra. Boruto asks Sasuke why he would look after him, and Sasuke replies that he is his student. Sasuke states Boruto is a strong shinobi, though Boruto has his doubts. Sasuke points out he is Naruto's son, is studying under Sasuke, and is a bigger loser than Naruto was. Boruto asks what he means, and Sasuke explains Boruto grew to hate losing, unwilling to give up or back down. The other
Kage
 volunteer to help rescuing Naruto.
Gaara
 says Boruto looks like Naruto did back then, but Sasuke points out he is missing something. On the
Academy
's roof, Sasuke
opens
 a portal with his
Rinnegan
 to where Naruto was taken. Sakura, Hinata,
Sarada
 and
Mitsuki
 come see them off. Boruto puts on Sasuke's scratched
forehead protector
, reminding Hinata how much he looks like Naruto. Hinata tells him to protect his father, and Sasuke notes he is finally acting like a shinobi. As he goes to enter the portal, Boruto promises to come back.

Chapter 7

"
Clash…!!
" (
激突…!!
,
Gekitotsu…!!
)

In a
barren wasteland
 with a
God Tree
,
Momoshiki
 drains
Kurama
's chakra from
Naruto
, complaining how much there is, and how long it's taking. Naruto assures him they won't go down easy, because they're shinobi. The branch Naruto is bound to is cut down, Momoshiki and
Kinshiki
 noting the arrival of
Chōjūrō
 and
Darui
, both with their swords out. Momoshiki surmises
Sasuke
 brought them with his
Rinnegan
.
Boruto
 cuts the remaining branches holding Naruto. Sasuke breaks Naruto's fall.
Gaara
 and
Kurotsuchi
 join the group.
 Regaining his senses, Naruto notices Boruto wearing his old clothes. Sasuke tells Naruto Boruto's become a shinobi, and goes to battle. Naruto tells Boruto how much he looks like him in those clothes. Naruto apologises for the state of their relationship. Boruto tells him to tell him stories of his past. Sasuke fights Kinshiki. Chōjūrō interferes with Kinshiki's attack, noting he's fast for his size. Kinshiki changes his focus to Chōjūrō, landing one attack. He tells Chōjūrō he left himself open, but Chōjūrō tells him he's done the same. Kurotsuchi appears
from the ground
, landing a powerful punch on Kinshiki, sending him flying. As Kinshiki steadies himself, Sasuke lands a
Chidori
 from behind with his sword, sending him to the ground. There, Kinshiki is pinned down by
splinters
 from Chōjūrō, and
ash
 from Kurotsuchi. Gaara creates
sand platforms
 to give Darui footing in his pursuit of Momoshiki, who blocks his sword with
black receivers
. Naruto readies himself to join the fight, but Boruto warns him that ninjutsu won't work against Momoshiki. Momoshiki is cornered by Sasuke, who has deduced how his ninjutsu absorption works, comparing it to the
Kote
. Momoshiki notices Kinshiki has been immobilised. He turns his attention to Naruto and Boruto, looking at them with his
Byakugan
, and realising something about their fate. He points out that even if Naruto has all that power, he cannot pass it along to Boruto, much to their confusion. Momoshiki offers to show how power is passed down in his clan, turning Kinshiki into a
chakra edible
 and consuming it. Sasuke tries attacking him, to no effect. Momoshiki manifests a third Rinnegan on his forehead and begins changing, promising Naruto he's next.

Author's Note

“

Boruto
 is serialized in
Weekly Shonen Jump
, but is a special case, appearing only once a month. A weekly series is usually 19 pages per chapter, so monthly would be four times that, or about 76 pages. However,
Boruto
 is 45 to 46 pages, only 60 percent of that.

Still, it takes me about a week to produce the thumbnails, about 20 days to draw the final pages and then the rest of the time is spent on colouring and other tasks... So I end up using pretty much a whole month.
It's not something I asked for, and I have no idea whose decision it was, but I sure am glad 'Boruto
 is monthly...

This era that we live in experiences daily change. When I was a kid, each house had only one phone, and it was not cordless. Video game consoles consisted of Famicom (NES), and the world was waging a mysterious "battle" called the Cold War.

Today, the smartphone is commonplace and the internet is as ubiquitous as air. However, this too will likely become nostalgic history quite quickly. Boruto and his friends are striving in a world that is similarly evolving. Please enjoy their adventures!
