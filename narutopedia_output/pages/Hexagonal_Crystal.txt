This
Hexagonal Crystal
 (
六角水晶
,
Rokkaku Suishō
) was given to
Koyuki Kazahana
 by her father as a child.

Appearance

As its name implies, it is a hexagonal, purple crystalline stick with an indent at the bottom.  The top has a key-hook with a string, making it a necklace.

History

Though Koyuki lost faith in her father's beliefs, she still kept the crystal with her. It was later revealed to be the key to a generator to turn the
Land of Snow
 into the "Land of Spring".
Kakashi
 had replaced it with a fake key, but
Dotō
 found out the duplicity, and managed to procure the real one. Dotō incorrectly believed that it led to a great treasure, and sought to take the key for himself, only to be infuriated when he saw the truth behind it.
