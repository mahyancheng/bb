After focusing senjutsu chakra to it,
Shima
's tongue grows to its maximum limit and is reshaped with a face. The tongue will then seek out the scent of its target. When the target is found, she ensnares it to prevent escape and marks it with a corrosive chemical. After the enemy is found,
Fukasaku
 can use the
Fighting Tongue Slash
 on it.

Trivia

"Zessen"
 is written with the kanji for
"tongue"
 and
"battle"
. It can be translated as to
"battle with tongues"
. In normal use, however, it means
"war of words"
, or
"verbal dispute"
, which reflects the arguments Fukasaku and Shima have all the time. The full kanji can be translated as "War of Words Bind".
