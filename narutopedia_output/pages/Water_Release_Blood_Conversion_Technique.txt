The user extracts all the blood in their target to convert into pure water, causing the victims to shrivel into dry husks which results in their immediate death. This technique is useful if there are no nearby sources of water to perform ninjutsu. If the user's body is in a weakened state resulted in a severe lack of water, they can use this technique to revitalise themselves.
