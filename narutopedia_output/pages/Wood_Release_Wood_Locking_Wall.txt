An extremely versatile move, this technique uses
chakra
 to activate the roots in the ground and, using the user of the technique as a reference point, makes wooden pillars appear from left and right. The wooden pillars join together in a dome-shape with the user at the centre. In the case that the user confronts the enemy at a short distance, the enemy can be locked up inside the dome, catching the enemy in a double sided attack. Furthermore, it can function as an easy shelter against an enemy's long-distance attacks, like the
shockwave
 created from
Naruto Uzumaki
 in his
Version 2
 state.

Trivia

Madara Uchiha
's storyline in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations
, Hashirama seemingly uses a form of this technique, but creating a much larger wood dome capable of resisting
Kurama
's
Tailed Beast Ball
.
