Mud Release
 (
泥遁
,
Deiton
) is a
nature transformation

kekkei genkai
, a combination of
water
 and
earth
, the same natures used to create
Wood Release
. Few people have ever heard of Mud Release, to the point that
Hidan
 was surprised it exists.
 In addition to the persecution experienced by most kekkei genkai users, Mud Release users are stuck with a stigma of being dirty and unclean because their ability tends to leave their hands constantly caked with mud.

Ameyuki
 was the only known practitioner of Mud Release. Shortly before he died, he deposited a large quantity of mud in the
Valley of Lies
. The mud eventually hardened somewhat into a clay that was ideal for
Hanasaki
 ceramics.
