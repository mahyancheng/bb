Synopsis

Recognising
Momoshiki
 as an
Ōtsutsuki
,
Boro
 attacks, but Momoshiki destroys his arm and delivers a kick that sends him flying. Noticing how
chakra
 depleted
Boruto
 is, Momoshiki lands by
Naruto
 and
absorbs
 some of his chakra. He resumes kicking Boro around.
Mitsuki
 regains consciousness just in time to see Momoshiki kill Boro with a gigantic
Rasengan
.
Kawaki
 also regains consciousness. Momoshiki comments that Boruto is still ways away from losing everything as Boruto's
Kāma
 recedes. Mitsuki
catches
 Boruto as he falls. Boruto wakes up with no recollection of what happened. Mitsuki and
Sarada
 are concerned by his Kāma. Two days later, Naruto wakes up in the
hospital
 and is informed of what happened. Boruto rushes to inform Kawaki, and Naruto asks about
Sasuke
.
Sakura
 informs Sasuke that Naruto woke up.
Katasuke
 speculates that Kawaki's body might be rejecting the prosthetic, and Kawaki refuses painkillers that would dull his senses. Katasuke is unable to think of a treatment as Kawaki's body is beyond his understanding, but Kawaki is unconcerned. Boruto arrives with news of Naruto's awakening.
 He takes Kawaki to see Naruto, who's also being visited by Sasuke,
Sai
,
Shikamaru
, Sarada, and Mitsuki. They all coordinate what they know. Shikamaru asks for confirmation that
Jigen
 is an Ōtsutsuki. Sasuke reveals that Jigen had a
Ten-Tails
 hidden in
another dimension
, which he can no longer access. Sai speculates they might have changed its coordinates. Boruto details how Boro fought, and that Sarada successfully used
Chidori
 against him. Sarada explains what Boro said about making people
believe in miracles
 with his
virus
. Kawaki explains that all
Kara
 members, including himself, were modified by a scientist named
Amado
. He also reveals one more Kara Inner,
Code
, though he knows nothing about his abilities. Shikamaru finds Kawaki's lack of knowledge strange, and asks if he knows why he's called a vessel. Boruto recalls
Delta
 saying that Kawaki's body didn't belong to him. Kawaki explains many others were experimented on alongside him and died. Boruto confesses to not remembering the end of the fight with Boro. Sarada and Mitsuki exchange looks. Sakura arrives and insists Naruto must rest. Kawaki calls Boruto aside and tells how he grew a horn when his Kāma expanded. Boruto recalls Momoshiki's words. Back in her room, Sarada details Boruto's defeat of Boro to Sasuke. Mitsuki reveals Boro called Boruto Momoshiki's vessel. They speculate that the Kāma is a way for Ōtsutsuki to resurrect themselves, but Sasuke believes Jigen himself is a vessel for
another entity
.
Shikadai
 and
Inojin
 arrive at the hospital, bringing taiyaki for Kawaki as a thank you for protecting Naruto. Kawaki is amazed at the custard one, which Sarada recommended before. They play
Extreme: Shinobi Picture Scrolls
.
Sumire
 arrives and stresses Kawaki has to rest. The others leave, and Kawaki asks Sumire why tell call her "class rep". She explains they're from the same class in the
Academy
. He asks her for the painkillers. She says that Naruto was worried about him, and suggests Kawaki should visit him. He overhears Shikamaru stressing the danger of another attack through Kawaki's Kāma to Naruto. At home, Boruto ponders on his Kāma and Momoshiki's words. At the hospital, Kawaki thinks about everyone who has been nice to him in
Konoha
.
