Lyrics

Rōmaji

You're my friend aa ano hi no yume

Ima demo mada wasuretenain desho

You're my dream aa hajimatta bakka kimi no one longest way

Oh ima tabidatsu yo

Everyday kono saki mo shining day

Kawarazu singin' hikaru asa no smile

Kore de miosame no funny days

Tobidatsu future mezashita go far kokoro no dream of

I'll go the distance mihatenu sora wa blue

Norikonda star ship kore ga saigo no forever trip

You're my friend aa ano hi no yume

Ima demo mada wasuretenain desho

You're my dream aa hajimatta bakka kimi no one longest way

Oh ima tabidatsu yo

Thank you my friend aa ano hi no koto

Ima de mo mada oboeteru kara

You're my dream aa mou nidoto sou modoranai days

Oh I'll go the distance

English

You're my friend, ah, you haven't forgotten

The dream from that day yet, have you?

You're my dream, ah, your one longest way has begun

Oh, let's go now!

Everyday ahead is a shining day

Unchanging singin', your shining morning smile

Here, a last glimpse of funny days

I'll jump to the future, I've aimed to go far, dreaming of your heart

I'll go the distance, in the endless blue sky

Embarking on a star ship, this is the most extreme forever trip

You're my friend, ah, you haven't forgotten

The dream from that day yet, have you?

You're my dream, ah, your one longest way has begun

Oh, let's go now!

Thank you my friend, ah, even though I

Still remember what happened that day

You're my dream, I still can't turn back to those days again

Oh, I'll go the distance

The lie I've told that's too big for me to keep hiding

I've come to terms with it, this is the end of my trip

It's a game I'll forever lose, from here on, my one dream has begun

You're my friend, ah, you haven't forgotten

The dream from that day yet, have you?

You're my dream, ah, your one longest way has begun

Oh, let's go now!

Thank you my friend, ah, even though I

Still remember what happened that day

You're my dream, I still can't turn back to those days again

Already on the move towards tomorrow, my flame of heart cannot be put out

That's right, I'll go the distance
