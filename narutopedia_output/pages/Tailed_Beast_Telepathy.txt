An innate skill possessed by all the
tailed beasts
, which allows them to communicate with one another on a deeper plain of their subconscious minds known as the
Mental World
 (
精神世界
,
Seishin Sekai
). This kind of communication differs from the one used by
jinchūriki
 and their tailed beasts, since there are no seals or other restrictions and it is accessible for all tailed beasts and their respective jinchūriki. However, it requires a jinchūriki and their tailed beast to be fully linked to gain access to this world. Furthermore, it is impossible for influences from the outside to reach this plane, even if the tailed beasts are being controlled.

It appears that even without a jinchūriki, the tailed beasts are able to contact humans, as Shukaku did with
Gaara
.
