A powerful technique of wind nature
chakra
 that can cut and slash through any material. Sora activates it by summoning chakra in his right hand, and then swipes a slicing chakra wave which appears to be controlled by Sora's will and thoughts. He is also able to use the technique in a rapid-fire, successive motion. This technique became stronger when Sora was in the influence of the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
's chakra and instead of the usual blue colour, it was red.
