Onē-sama

 is attached on her right sleeve of her outfit.

Abilities






Sana creates a sandstorm.



Sana is skilled in the use of a kunai, combining it with close-range fighting. She is also quite skilled in sand manipulation, being capable of
creating a vast sandstorm
 and
cloaking an ally
 with pre-existing
sand
 to provide additional defence and better mask their presence. Sana is also able to
sense chakra
, quickly noticing when a person's chakra reserves increase.

Interlude

In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths






Sana and Mamushi battling Chōji.



Sana, alongside her team, participated in the joint
Chūnin Exams
. She and her team were one of the few who managed to qualify for the second round. The next day, the second exam proctor —
Temari
, announced the start of the second round taken place within
Demon Desert
.
 On the third day of the second exam, with the goal of having to pass obtaining an Earth and Heaven scroll from an enemy team, Saya and her team found
Team Asuma
. Then, Mamushi and Sana clashed against
Chōji
. As the battle wages, a
giant
 Chōji restrains she and Mamushi, but they are soon freed from the Konoha-nin's grasp by Saya who turned her
technique
 onto Chōji after leaving Ino's body.

Ultimately, Ino succeeds in repelling Saya from Chōji's mind, to which the large ninja quickly counters and attacks the Suna team, forcing them to retreat. After regrouping, Saya demands to take revenge on Team Asuma for the recent humiliation. After finding Team Asuma, Sana produces a sandstorm to keep the Konoha-nin at bay while Saya unleashes a swarm of sand puppets to attack them. Sana also masks Mamushi with sand for an additional sneak attack. Despite this effort, Sakura emerges through the sand and defeats the team with
a single punch
.






Sana and her teammates listening to Gaara's speech.



Later, Sana's team arrived at the main building to await the end of the second exam. However, the Chūnin Exams were ended early before starting the finals due to controversy happening in the second exam. Instead, it was decided by
Gaara
 that a report on each participant would be sent to their respective village leader for them to decide if they would be promoted.

Trivia

Sana addresses to Saya as "Elder Sister", but whether she does it out of respect or to signify a family relationship is unknown.

Sana's techniques require certain dance-like arm movements in her
hand seal
 weaving.
