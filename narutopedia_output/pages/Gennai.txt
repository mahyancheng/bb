Gennai
 (
源内
) is a
genin
 from
Konohagakure
.

Personality

Gennai was already doubtful that he could pass the Chūnin Exams and become a chūnin but after he saw his teammate Komugi quit the Exams, Gennai became even more doubtful and quit as well. He, like his teammates, is overconfident in his abilities.

Appearance

Gennai has a short crop of dark brown hair and dark eyes. He wore a high-collared brown suit with matching pants and a beige sash. He also has a blue-clothed Konohagakure
forehead protector
 which he wore in a traditional method.

Abilities

In the anime, Gennai was shown to be able to use
Fire Release
, although he appears to need more time to use it as he was countered before he could perform a technique.
 He also has some
taijutsu
 skills as he fought hand-to-hand against the
Sunagakure
 ninja the night before the exam, but was knocked out by a blow to the neck from a more powerful opponent. Like the members of his team, Gennai is quite tough and fast, being one of the thirty people who managed to reach Sunagakure from Konohagakure in three days.

Gennai crying about their team passing the first round.



In the anime, about two years later, Gennai and his team partake in the joint
Chūnin Exams
 co-sponsored by Konoha and Sunagakure. For the first phase of the exams, Gennai and his teammates were split into different rooms, with him being placed in room two. After settling in,
Shikamaru Nara
, the first exam proctor, explained the goal of the written test on a monitor.
 His team ultimately passed the first round since their combined score equalled 100 points as it was supposed to, and by leaving the bonus question unanswered. However, a preliminary round had to be held to lessen the many participants there were. The preliminary round involved a race to Suna where only the first 30 teams to arrive at the destination would being qualify for the second phase.

Ultimately, his team were among the 30 teams to make it to the checkpoint. The next day, the second exam proctor,
Temari
, announced the start of the second round taken place within
Demon Desert
.
 In the desert, Gennai and his team clashed with
Team Ajisai
. He attempted to use a
Fire Release
 attack, but was interrupted by
Ajisai
's
Unsealing Technique: Paper Snowstorm
.
 Later, the team again found the Ame-kunoichi, battered and one teammate short. While seeing this as easy win for a scroll,
Team Guy
 stepped in to help. While shocked that a fellow Konoha team would stand against them to side with a Ame team,
Neji Hyūga
 insisted that they needed their help and ultimately, there is no alliance in the exams beyond one's own team. This prompted Gennai and his team to retreat now that the numbers were against them.






Gennai and his team failed the exams.



Ultimately, the Chūnin Exams were ended early before starting the finals due to controversy happening in the second exam. Instead, it was decided by Gaara that a report on each participant would be sent to their respective village leader for them to decide if they would be promoted. Gennai was later disappointed to hear from Tsunade he would have to try again next year as his performance didn't prove enough.

Trivia

Gennai's name is written with the kanji for "origin" (
原
) and "inside" or "house" (
内
). He shares his name with
Hiraga Gennai
, a famous Japanese inventor.
