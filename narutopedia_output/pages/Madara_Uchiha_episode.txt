"
Madara Uchiha
" (
うちはマダラ
,
Uchiha Madara
) is episode 322 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Kabuto
 takes control over
Mū
's body and explains to
Madara
 that he has made him stronger than when he was in his prime. With that, Madara pushes forward and takes down a large portion of the
Fourth Division
 using only
taijutsu
 and
kenjutsu
 to dominate them, with the aid of his
Sharingan
 to evade their attacks.
Temari
 tells
Naruto
 to enter
"that mode"
, but he replies that he is out of chakra and cannot do so. She later hits Madara with an attack that sends him away, but little to no damage is done. He then uses a powerful
flame technique
 on the alliance, who barely manage to counter it with their combined
water techniques
. Madara then launches plenty of
fireballs
 at the alliance and also reappears in the smoke to fight.

As he proceeds to defeat even more of them, he is stopped by
Gaara
's sand. Gaara,
Ōnoki
 and Naruto manage to corner Madara with their techniques. However, Madara activates his
Susanoo
 to shield himself from Naruto's
Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan
. Naruto enters
Sage Mode
 and after Gaara takes Madara away from the Susanoo, Naruto attacks him with a
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
. However, he activates his
Rinnegan
 and absorbs Naruto's attack, confirming Kabuto's hypothesis on the Sharingan's potential to evolve into the Rinnegan. Madara
drops a meteorite
 on the Fourth Division, but while Ōnoki
stops
 it, he is unable to stop the second meteorite. It falls on them, crushing and killing a large number of them.  There are few survivors, but they are wounded, including Ōnoki. Madara then attempts to summon the
Nine-Tails
 but fails because it is still sealed within Naruto. He then proceeds to test
Hashirama
's cells inside of him by using the
Wood Release Secret Technique: Nativity of a World of Trees
, leaving Naruto and the other surviving shinobi of the Fourth Division in shock.

Trivia

In the manga, Madara attacks the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 first with his Fire Release
technique
 and then combats them with
taijutsu
. However, in this episode, he first engages them with taijutsu and then uses his Fire Release technique.

Before the Alliance engaged Madara, Ōnoki told the sensors to watch out for the Second Tsuchikage, even though it was stated that he cannot be detected by normal means.

When Naruto attacks Madara with his
Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan
, Madara already has his Rinnegan activated for a second, but then switches to his
Mangekyō Sharingan
.

When Naruto attacks Madara with the Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan, a Sunagakure shinobi is seen that looks exactly the same as a Sunagakure shinobi Kabuto reincarnated in the
Power arc
.
