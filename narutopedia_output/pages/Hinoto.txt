Hinoto
 (
丁
) is a former member of
Konohagakure
's
Anbu
 faction
Root
.

Background

To prevent
Hiruzen
 from being reinstated as
Hokage
,
Danzō
 gave Hinoto and nine other Root members a mission to assassinate him. Disguised as a foreign kunoichi, she fought the Anbu accompanying her target, who turned out to be a disguised Kakashi, resulting in the mission's failure.

Three years later, Hinoto and
Hinoe
 were guarding the entrance to the Root chambers when the two Anbu members
Yūgao Uzuki
 and
Kakashi Hatake
 appeared with the order to bring Danzō Shimura to
Hiruzen Sarutobi
, the Third
Hokage
. After Yūgao left with the message that Danzō was absent, Kakashi revealed his face and
subdued
 Hinoe with his
Sharingan
. Hinoto tried to attack him but was quickly overpowered. Kakashi then used a
genjutsu
 to extract the information about
Kinoe
's whereabouts from her.

Appearance

Hinoto has long smooth black-bluish hair that she keeps held in a ponytail and she wears the typical attire of the Anbu along with a sword strapped to her shoulder and a cat-like mask with purple markings. She also has red pearl earrings.

Abilities

Being a member of the Anbu, Hinoto is most likely talented. She is presumably skilled with the
sword
 and
bō
 she carries.
