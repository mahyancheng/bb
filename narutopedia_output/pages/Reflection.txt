This shinjutsu allows the user to reflect any incoming attacks back at the opponent. Even the thought of attacking the user will reflect the predicted move back at the attacker. The stronger the attacker's killing intent, the more powerful the reflection will be.
 In order to activate this ability, Daemon's palms must be touching another person, which extends the ability to them as well.

Trivia

While it is required for Daemon's hand to be touching another person for this ability to work, he has been shown not doing so on several occassions.
