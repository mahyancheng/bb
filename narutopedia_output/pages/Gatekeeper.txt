The
Gatekeeper
 was a giant
fiddler crab
 that served as the guardian of the

's puppets and presumably the
Ōtsutsuki clan
 members.

Appearance

Though resembling a normal crab, it was enormous in size. It had a red-coloured exoskeleton with yellow and blue stripes in its eight legs and two asymmetric pincers, along with many sharp teeth. It also had a white crown-like structure in its head.

Abilities






The Gatekeeper using Water Release: Wild Water Wave.



This crab was able to use
Water Release
 techniques such as the
Water Release: Wild Water Wave
 technique. It also mastered a degree of
genjutsu
, as it was capable to
trap
 its victims. Its enormous pincers made it capable to shred humans into pieces. It was also very durable, as its armour made the crab very difficult to kill.
