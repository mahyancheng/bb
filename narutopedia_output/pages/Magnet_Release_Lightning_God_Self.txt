The user uses
electromagnetic powers
 to absorb the
iron sand
 in a swirling vortex around themselves and expand their body's size to that of a 20-meter tall giant.
 Due to their size, their footsteps then crush the graphite in the earth and cause electric discharge.
 The thunderclap of these discharges were powerful enough to cause
Suna
 shinobi to lose their footing.

Kankurō
 described it as an
absolute defence
 (
絶対防御
,
zettai bōgyo
) technique, noting its incredible speed.
 Additionally, the electromagnetic field used to maintain the form caused anyone who came into direct contact with the body to be scattered into bits the instance they touch it.
