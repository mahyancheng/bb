Possession
 is a unique ability possessed by Black Zetsu allows it to take advantage of its malleable body to coat itself over a target. This technique is mainly used to restrict the movement of the target by coating a target's body,
 and forcibly make them do its bidding by directly channelling its will through them. In possession of the target's body, Black Zetsu is also able to use target's techniques,

kekkei genkai
,
 as well as any other ability they may possess. By using this technique, Black Zetsu can perform various feats including controlling the target, and even stabilising their life force allowing them to live following a
mortally-taxing
 event.

Once in contact with a target, they can also
absorb
 the target's
chakra
 and transfer it to others,
 and even show the target events it has
recorded
.
 One drawback of this technique, is that if the target has a strong enough will as in the case of Obito they can suppress Black Zetsu's influence, and take advantage of Black Zetsu being attached to them.

Trivia

As shown with
Obito
, any invulnerability Black Zetsu has, such as immunity to the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
, is transferred to its host at the time.
