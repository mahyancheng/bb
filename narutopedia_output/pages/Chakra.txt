Kakashi visibly molding Chakra.



Chakra
 (
チャクラ
,
Chakura
) is a supernatural substance
 native to lifeforms on some planets. Due to it being the component to create
Chakra Fruit
, the
Ōtsutsuki Clan
 travel from planet to planet to absorb all the chakra on them in order to create the fruit to consume. To release chakra means to bring out physical and spiritual energy and mix it together within one's body.

Origin





Hagoromo connecting with others through ninshū.



According to
Madara
, whose knowledge comes Hagoromo's
Stone Tablet
,
 which was adulterated by
Black Zetsu
,
 humans on
Earth
 didn't have chakra until
Hamura
 and
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 were born with it,
 which was a result of their mother
Kaguya
 eating their planet's chakra fruit from the
God Tree
. Hagoromo
spread
 chakra to others through a practice called
ninshū
, intending to create peace by using the chakra to connect people's spiritual energy so that they would understand one another without even talking. However, the people did not use chakra in the way Hagoromo hoped, instead using it to connect their inner spiritual and physical energies. They kneaded their inner chakra to amplify and weaponise it, creating what is now known as
ninjutsu
.

According to
Jura
, a God Tree who gained self-awareness, their purpose is collect the chakra of all living things, all current and past life on a planet, and create a chakra fruit,
 suggesting that some form of chakra predates Kaguya's eating of the chakra fruit, on Earth and other worlds consumed by the Ōtsutsuki.

Overview

Chakra is essential to even the most basic
jutsu
. Through various methods, the most common of which is
hand seals
, chakra can be controlled and manipulated to create an effect that would not be possible otherwise, such as
walking on water
,
exhaling fire
, or
creating illusions
. Chakra is ordinarily not visible to the unaided eye unless it is highly concentrated or manifested in large amounts. This is rarely seen due to the restrictions of eight specific
tenketsu
 known as the
Eight Gates
, which limit the amount of chakra an individual can release at a single given time.





The Chakra Pathway System.



Since being spread by Hagoromo, better known as the Sage of Six Paths, chakra has become a form of life energy that all individuals produce to some degree; those who expend all their chakra will die.
 Produced within and manipulated by organs such as the heart,
 the energy circulates throughout the body in a network called the "
Chakra Pathway System
", which is similar to the cardiovascular system. Groups such as
shinobi
 have learned to generate more chakra and release it outside their bodies through pressure points called tenketsu in order to perform
jutsu
.






The two components of chakra: physical energy and spiritual energy.



Chakra is created when two more primal energies, known collectively as one's "
stamina
" (
スタミナ
,
sutamina
), are moulded together.
Physical energy
 (
身体エネルギー
,
shintai enerugī
) is collected from each of the body's cells and can be increased through training, stimulants, and exercise.
Spiritual energy
 (
精神エネルギー
,
seishin enerugī
,
English TV:
 Mental Energy) is derived from the mind's consciousness and can be increased through studying, meditation, and experience.
 These two energies becoming more powerful will in turn make the created chakra more powerful. Therefore, practising a technique repeatedly will build up experience, increasing one's spiritual energy, and thus allowing more chakra to be created. As a result, the ninja is able to do that same technique with more power. This same cycle applies for physical energy, except the ninja needs to increase their endurance instead. Some
unique individuals
 have substantial potential that enables them to exponentially increase their chakra reserves in a relatively short amount of time.

At any given time, a ninja will have a "maximum" amount of chakra that they can form and use before it runs out and they need to rest to replenish it. With practice this maximum can be increased, but to a certain extent as they are limited to the quantity and strength of chakra that their genetics grants them.
 For instance,
Kakashi Hatake
 has average chakra reserves, but no amount of training can grant him the same amount of chakra as
Naruto Uzumaki
 whom he stated had more chakra than himself.
 If a body is given far more chakra than it is able to handle, then the body would potentially be killed by the overwhelming chakra, as
Fūka
 had to divide the chakra she
absorbed
 into
different bodies
, a
Kumo
-nin who ate
Gyūki
's chakra meat tentacle died instead of acquiring part of its power, and the reason why
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki
 chose not to
resurrect
 in
Jigen
's body due to it being unable to handle his massive chakra. On the opposite spectrum, if somebody runs out of chakra, they potentially risk death.

Each person's chakra is different and as such gives off a unique chakra signature, which
sensor type
 ninja are able to
detect
. Chakra signatures are passed genetically, allowing a person's
clan
 to be identified by their chakra;
 over time, entire populations can have perceptibly different chakra.
 One's chakra signature can be altered by absorbing DNA from multiple people, mixing various chakra signatures together to become a whole new one.
 In the anime, chakra signatures that are similar to each other (such as those of siblings, or a parent and child) are suggested to resonate when near each other.
 Each person's chakra also has a unique "colour" that can be seen by those with
dōjutsu
 (the anime tends to colour all normal chakra light blue). Even if they are
separated
, changes made in the chakra signature of the original will result in the separated chakra mimicking those changes.

While practically all types of jutsu require chakra to be performed,
taijutsu
 does not; stamina is all that is needed. While the ninja still needs a set amount of chakra to live, regular taijutsu doesn't require any active moulding or manipulation of chakra, with few exceptions. A standard attack like a punch or kick falls into this technique category.

Chakra Control

Because chakra takes time and a great deal of training to gradually build up, the key to its use is not actually having large amounts of chakra but instead being able to sufficiently control and conserve it.
 This is called
Chakra Control
 (
チャクラコントロール
,
Chakura Kontorōru
). In order to have good chakra control, a ninja should only mould as much chakra as they need to perform any given jutsu or ability with maximum efficiency.
 If they mould more chakra than is needed, the excess chakra is wasted and they will tire out faster from its loss.
 If they don't mould enough chakra, a technique will not be performed effectively, if at all, likely creating problems in a combat situation.
 Because chakra consists in part of spiritual energy, the user is more easily able to mould the correct amount of chakra by remaining calm and focused.

General training methods for improving one's moulding and manipulation of chakra are the
Leaf Concentration
,
Tree Climbing
, and
Water Surface Walking
 exercises. A good way to build up chakra in the body is to spin it into a tight spiral; Whether to spin the chakra left or right is dependent on the way the user's hair grows.

Hand seals
 are often used to manipulate chakra more easily, allowing shinobi to execute their techniques faster and more effectively. Shinobi who are extremely skilled at chakra control often specialise in
genjutsu
 or become
medical-nin
.

A more casual use is using chakra control to sober one's self after consuming alcohol.
Mei Terumī
 displays this ability when
Shino
 advises her not to get too drunk during their meeting.

Chakra can also be used for general performance enhancement. By moulding the chakra into key points of the body, usually the hands or feet, it will greatly augment their physical prowess. Certain shinobi are able rely on this skill to gain a
speed boost
, acquire a
sixth sense
, and even perform
superhuman strikes
. As shown in the anime, moulding one's chakra can also improve mental prowess, allowing them to process information more efficiently.

When creating a
ninjutsu
, the two methods of manipulating chakra are referred to as
shape transformation
 and
nature transformation
:

Shape transformation deals with controlling the form, movement, and potency of one's chakra, determining the size, range, and purpose of a technique.

Nature transformation deals with the moulding and defining of the nature of one's chakra, altering its properties and characteristics for use in techniques. There is also the nature transformations of
Yin
 and
Yang
, which deals with changing the ratio of spiritual and physical energies within chakra.

These two methods can be implemented separately or together in order to create a technique, though ninja who can use both simultaneously are said to be rare.

Types of Chakra

Tailed Beast Chakra






Tailed beast chakra.



Main article:
Tailed Beasts

The
tailed beasts
 (
尾獣
,
bijū
), sometimes referred to as "
Chakra Monsters
" (
チャクラのバケモノ
,
Chakura no Bakemono
),
 are the nine titanic living forms of
chakra
 created by the
Sage of Six Paths
 out of the chakra from
Earth
's
Ten-Tails
.
 They are differentiated by the number of tails they have, ranging from one to nine.
A tailed beast's chakra is coloured red.

Senjutsu Chakra






Senjutsu chakra.



Main article:
Senjutsu

Senjutsu
 (
仙術
,
English TV:
 Sage Jutsu,
literally meaning:
 Sage Techniques) are a specialised field of
jutsu
 that involve the use of
natural energy
. Senjutsu practitioners, known as
sages
, learn to draw natural energy inside their bodies, blending it with their own
chakra
 to create
senjutsu chakra
 (
仙術チャクラ
,
senjutsu chakura
,
English TV:
 Sage Jutsu Chakra). This chakra adds a new dimension of power to the user's techniques, while also allowing for the use of techniques that would not otherwise be possible.

Absorption Chakra






Absorption chakra.



Absorption Chakra
 (
吸引チャクラ
,
Kyūin Chakura
)
 is produced by the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, and can be released from its mouth in the form of phantom dragons. Any chakra that touches these dragons sticks to them,
 which allows them to kill human beings in an instant. The
Sealing Technique: Phantom Dragons Nine Consuming Seals
 utilises nine of these dragons to extract tailed beast chakra from a jinchūriki or directly seal the beast into the statue, though sealing such a large amount of chakra requires several days.

Six Paths






Hagoromo gifting Naruto and Sasuke.



Six Paths
 (
六道
,
Rikudō
) is a term used frequently towards the end of the series with little explanation of what it actually is. Several characters are mentioned to have the
chakra
 or
power
 of Six Paths, but it's unclear to what extent these terms differ:

Six Paths Chakra
 (
六道チャクラ
,
Rikudō Chakura
) — used by
Naruto Uzumaki
 and Madara Uchiha to float.

Six Paths Sage Chakra
 (
六道の仙人チャクラ
,
Rikudō no Sennin Chakura
) — applied by Naruto to his
Truth-Seeking Balls
, allowing him to damage Madara's
shadows
.

Sage of Six Paths Power
 (
六道仙人の力
,
Rikudō Sennin no Chikara
) — said to be the source of
Sasuke Uchiha
's
Amenotejikara
 and Naruto's Truth-Seeking Balls.

Six Paths Power
 (
六道の力
,
Rikudō no Chikara
) — temporarily gained by
Kakashi Hatake
 while his body is inhabited by the spirit of
Obito Uchiha
, enhancing the power of his
eye technique
.
 Sasuke can also apply it to his
Chidori
, darkening its colour and also allowing it to damage Madara.

Six Paths Yin Power
 (
六道の陰の力
,
Rikudō no In no Chikara
) and
Six Paths Yang Power
 (
六道の陽の力
,
Rikudō no Yō no Chikara
) — two special powers given to Naruto and Sasuke by
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
, which can be used to seal Madara
 or even
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
.

Hamura's Chakra






Hinata using Hamura's chakra.



Like Hagoromo's,
Hamura Ōtsutsuki
's chakra has special properties and is essentially the same as Six Paths Chakra, passed through the bloodlines of the
Ōtsutsuki
 and
Hyūga clans
. Only those with Hamura's chakra can touch (and thus destroy) the
Tenseigan
 and are immune to its effects. Interestingly, when using the chakra she received from Hamura,
Hinata Hyūga
's chakra turned a dark purple in colour.

Gift of the Hermit Group






Gift of the Hermit Group chakra.



Main article:
Gift of the Hermit Group

The
Gift of the Hermit Group
 (
仙族の才
,
Senzoku no Sai
,
English TV:
 Gift of the Sages) is a special kind of
chakra
 used by the
ninja monks
 of the
Fire Temple
. It requires daily, unrelenting training to master. This chakra is required to unseal the
Sealed Iron Wall
 granting access to the Fire Temple. It is also required for the technique
Welcoming Approach: Thousand-Armed Murder
.

Star Chakra






Mysterious Peacock Method chakra.



Main article:
Mysterious Peacock Method

Seen in the anime, shinobi from
Hoshigakure
 can manipulate their chakra into a wide variety of skills by using the chakra-enhancing
meteorite
, albeit at the cost of extreme damage to their bodies. Hoshigakure's method gets its name, Mysterious Peacock, from the chakra's raw manifestation as pinkish-purple chakra tails similar to a peacock's tail feathers.

Negative Chakra






Negative Chakra.



Negative Chakra
 is used as nourishment for
Nue
 to explode.
 It is also used by Nue and
Sumire
 to, when given to another person, take control of them and their negative emotions.

Dark Chakra






The Zero-Tails' shadow arms.



Main article:
Zero-Tails

Seen in
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: Bonds
,
Dark Chakra
 (
闇のチャクラ
,
Yami no Chakura
) is a special chakra formed from the negative emotions of the heart. Created by the Zero-Tails as it feeds on the negative emotions of the people around it, it is shown to be extremely powerful, being used to power the
Land of the Sky
's Ancor Vantian and grants
Shinnō
 powerful techniques with seemingly no drawbacks. However, it requires proper chakra control to use, and disruption in the control can cause a damaging backlash, as Shinnō's body heavily deteriorated when his control was sabotaged.

Priestess Chakra






The priestess light chakra.



Main article:
Bell (charm)

Seen in
Naruto Shippūden the Movie
,
Priestess Chakra
 (
巫女チャクラ
,
Miko Chakura
) has a bright and unique aspect. It can
send pink rays of severing light
 at the user,
Shion
's, opponents, create a
light barrier
 to shield her from darkness, and
transform her into an angelic form
. She also used the mystical chakra of the bell to create a protective sphere around a designated target, as she did for
Naruto Uzumaki
, and use the chakra with Naruto to form the
Super Chakra Rasengan
.
Miroku
 feared that if Shion is corrupted, her powers would be deadlier than a
gigantic demon
's.

Ryūmyaku Chakra






The Ryūmyaku chakra source.



Main article:
Ryūmyaku

Seen in
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower
, the
Ryūmyaku
 (
龍脈
,
English TV:
 Ley Line,
literally meaning:
 Dragon Veins) is an ancient source of chakra that flows under
Rōran
, granting anyone who harnesses it infinite chakra reserves. Only the heirs of the kingdom's royal bloodline can open or close the flow, but after it's opened, anyone can use it.

Trivia

In Hinduism, chakra refers to each of seven centres of spiritual power in the human body: the tailbone, sacrum, stomach, heart, throat, forehead and crown.

The etymology for the word
Chakra
 (चक्र) translates as "Wheel", "Circle"; this also pertains as to how chakra is produced within one's body: physical energy and spiritual energy are effectively "spun" into functional chakra. The direction of this spinning (clockwise or counter-clockwise) can be determined by checking how one's hair grows, as it influenced such spinning.

Chakra and how it's formed/blended/spun-together from the combination of spiritual and physical energies parallels the real-world Daoist-Shinto belief of
Konpaku
 (
魂魄
); the belief of a two-fold soul, the spiritual soul and the physical soul.






Sasuke's dark chakra as he delved deeper into the Curse of Hatred.



Chakra seems to reflect its owner's personality and emotions to some extent:
Karin
 describes Naruto's chakra as bright and warm, while she says Sasuke's — while in the grips of his
Curse of Hatred
 — is dark and cold. She also sensed the
evil chakra
 inside Naruto and found
Suigetsu
's chakra to be disgusting.
Ino
 also commented that Sasuke's chakra was much darker, when he used the
Cursed Seal of Heaven
 the first time.

Individuals can create imprints of their consciousness out of chakra that act separately from themselves and may outlive them, as seen with
Minato Namikaze
 and
Kushina Uzumaki
's presence within their son's
Eight Trigrams Sealing Style
. Being pure chakra, they cannot replenish themselves, and once their chakra is spent they will disappear.

Chakra is an energy that can connect the physical world and the spiritual one. It can act as a bridge for spirits to leave the afterlife and return to the physical world temporarily. Obito returned as a spirit from the afterlife with the use of chakra to inhabit Kakashi's body. This parallels chakra's nature as the fusion of physical and spiritual energies.

Chakra can be transmitted across long distances in the form of
Chakra Signals
 (
チャクラ信号
,
Chakura Shingō
).
 To create the strongest possible connection, these signals must be transmitted from a place of high elevation that is relatively close to their destination.
 It is also possible to adjust the frequency of these signals to prevent them from being traced back to their source.

Another being's chakra can cause temporary and permanent changes to one's body. The
Gold and Silver Brothers
 had whisker marks on their cheeks similar to Naruto's after gaining Kurama's chakra from eating its flesh. After transplanting Hashirama's flesh, which contained chakra, into his wounds, Madara would, decades later, awaken the Rinnegan in both of his eyes, and restored the vision lost in his right eye due to using Izanagi. After being given chakra by Hagoromo, Sasuke permanently developed a
Rinnegan
 in one of his eyes. Kakashi's regular eyes temporarily transformed into
Sharingan
 after Obito's spirit and chakra temporarily inhabits his body. These changes can be on a genetic level such as the whisker marks inherited from Naruto by his children:
Boruto
 and
Himawari
.

In
Naruto the Movie: Legend of the Stone of Gelel
,
Temujin's Continent
 is completely unaware of chakra or how to use it.
Haido's Knights
 instead use another
source
 to power their
abilities
.
