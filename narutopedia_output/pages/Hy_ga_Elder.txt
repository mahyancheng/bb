This
Konohagakure
 citizen is the former head of the
Hyūga clan
.

Background

It was apparently his idea to have his son
Hizashi
 act as
Hiashi
's body double after
the incident
 with the
Head Ninja of Kumogakure
. Even though his elder son struggled with the decision, he told him that at some point in time, each head of the clan has had to protect it in some way or the other and that this was why the branch family existed.






The elder watching Hinata and Hanabi duel.



In the anime, he and Hiashi watched Hinata and Neji sparring each other during training. However, it ended when Neji tried to attack Hinata, only for Hiashi to stop the sparring training and later punish Neji, using the
cursed seal
 to control him. He also noticed his younger granddaughter
Hanabi
 was peeking earlier and then later had a conversation with her. He explained what had happened as well as the destiny of the branch house to protect the Byakugan. Later, with Hinata's progress, he also suggested Hiashi on training Hanabi to become the heiress after seeing her training. Before accepting his suggestion, Hiashi asked his father a request.

The next day, he attended the duel between his two granddaughters along with Hiashi and the other clansmen to decide the future of their clan.

Personality

He has been shown to be very loyal to the clan putting the safety of the Byakugan and its secrets even above the life of his own son.
 This fierce loyalty, however, comes off as callousness, and it often times seems that his only concern is protecting the clan's
kekkei genkai
 at any cost. However in the anime, the elder is shown to admit to when he is proven wrong, openly applauding Hinata for exceeding his expectations.

Appearance

He is a man of short stature with long, grey hair that reaches down to his back, and like all members of his clan, he possesses featureless white eyes. He wears traditional robes which consist of a loose fitting kimono that is held closed with a simple sash under a brown, waist length haori.

Abilities

Although nothing is known of the extent of his abilities, it can be assumed that he was well-versed in the clan's secret techniques as he was the head of the clan. He also has the
Byakugan
, which grants him near 360° vision amongst other abilities. In the anime, during the invasion of Konoha from Sunagakure and Otogakure, the elder was seen fending off his enemies with a Hyūga style taijutsu stance, implying he is highly capable at it. He also showed himself to be very agile for his age, able to jump great distances in his effort to save Hinata from her kidnappers.

Hyūga Elder

"
The advanced blood of the Hyūga clan is a valuable trump card to this village. Protecting that has been the duty of the main family. That is why the branch families exist.
"

(To
Hiashi
) "
Hiashi… The time has come where each generation has protected the Hyūga blood in this way. You must have the heart to let go of even a sibling to protect the blood. That is the destiny of the main family and the destiny of those born as Hyūga.
