Shizune
transforms
 Tonton into a copy of herself who uses
chakra scalpels
 to stun their opponent. Tonton changes back and jumps up as Shizune slices though the opponent, side-to-side with two chakra scalpels herself. However, she caught the tip of Tonton's tail while the pig was doing a flip; the opponent collapses. Shizune then notices Tonton's tail is burning and begins healing her as an angry Tonton repeatedly hits her.
