The
Kohaku Clan
 (
Kohaku Ichizoku
) was a
shinobi
 clan that had a village near the border of the
Land of Fire
 to that of
Amegakure
. This village was one of many villages that was attacked by
Furido's 4-Man Team
, and all villagers subsequently massacred.






Kohaku clan members revived as zombies.



The deceased members of this clan were later
revived as zombies
 by their killers and used in
Furido
's attack on
Konohagakure
.

Despite having their own village, the clan was also seen to be affiliated with Konoha, since one of their revived members was seen wearing a Konoha
flak jacket
. The members had the symbol of black futatsudomoe (double
tomoe
 shaped like yin and yang) tattooed on their upper arm with two lines going around it.
