Killer B and Motoi
" (

Kirābī to Motoi
) is episode 244 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Struggling with the
Falls of Truth
 and his darker side,
Naruto
 requests help from
Motoi
, asking how
Killer B
 overcame his dark side. Due to the seriousness of the situation and the effect on peace that Naruto gaining control of the
Nine-Tails
 would have, Motoi agrees, telling him and
Yamato
 of B's past. After Motoi's
father's
 death at the hands of the
Eight-Tails
, who had rampaged after his
jinchūriki
 was unable to control it, B was chosen and subsequently shunned as the new Eight Tails
jinchūriki
. As he had blamed the
tailed beast
 for his father's murder, his hatred shifted to Killer B himself and twice tried to kill him with a
kunai
; while B seemed to recognise him the first time, the second time, Motoi witnessed the villagers of
Kumo
 bombarding Killer B with eggs, only for the latter to smile and shrug it off. Naruto leaves for a moment of solace, only for Motoi and Yamato to be attacked by the
Giant Squid
, with Motoi being captured.

Yamato uses his
Wood Release: Smothering Binding Technique
 to restrain the squid, athough Naruto refrains from attacking, believing the squid to be Killer B in his Eight-Tails form angrily attacking Motoi; however, the real Killer B arrives and quickly defeats the squid. Motoi asks Killer B why he would save someone who tried to kill him in the past, Killer B responds that he does not remember that incident, and that all he remembers is the good memories he had growing up with Motoi, who he proclaims is his best friend. As he gives Motoi a fist bump, which Motoi reciprocates, Naruto adopts Killer B's verbal tic, while Killer B does the same.
