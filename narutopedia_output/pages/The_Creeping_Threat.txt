 manga.

Summary

Kakashi
 says that
Naruto
 will need to create a new technique, something he will be able to do in a very short period of time thanks to the training regiment Kakashi has come up with. Before Kakashi can elaborate they are interrupted by
Team 10
, who offers to take
Team 7
 out to lunch. Kakashi and
Asuma
 stay behind while the others go out to mingle.
Sai
 tries once again to use nicknames to make friends. He begins to call
Chōji
 fat, but is advised against it by
Naruto
. Turning his attention to
Ino
, and remembering that
Sakura
 did not like hearing how she actually appeared, Sai concludes that women prefer hearing the opposite of what is true. He therefore calls Ino "beautiful". Sakura becomes angry, having expected him to insult Ino. Elsewhere,
Akatsuki
 members
Hidan
 and
Kakuzu
 attack
Yugito Nii
.
