Author's Note

“

My morning always begins with a cup of coffee...
 ...which sounds hardboiled, but really I can only drink it if it's not black because that's too bitter.
 I like it sweet. And since I've got a kid's tongue, I add a ton of milk and sugar. I want to become an adult and appreciate black coffee, but I feel like I'll never get there! Because it's so, so bitter! It's just a bitter sap!
