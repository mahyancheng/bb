During the
era before the hidden villages
, ninja wore armour that was  similar to that of
samurai
. Dating back to at least
Indra Ōtsutsuki‎
's era, it boasted a higher defence than the simple stealth-orientated clothing that the shinobi would wear on missions that stressed concealment over combat. Shinobi in Konoha continued to wear the armour until at least the
First Shinobi World War
, when in the
second
 the transition into
flak jackets
 began.

The
Akimichi clan
 of
Konohagakure
 seems to have persisted in the use of armour, sometimes even combining it with the current flak jackets.
Hiruzen Sarutobi
 had a small custom set of armour that gave him far more flexibility on top of a kabuto helmet over the usual plate armour.
