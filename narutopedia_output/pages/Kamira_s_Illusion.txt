Kamira casts an illusion onto her opponent, causing the area around the target to be enveloped by darkness. Once inside the black space, the target will see grotesque figures, which are thought to be the previous victims of the technique: Kamira claims that these are people who betrayed
Haido's faction
, and became tortured criminals of the "Land of Death" (
死の国
,
Shi no Kuni
), being punished with the "power of time" (
時間の力
,
jikan no chikara
). These figures then grab the target and pull them into the void where they are at the mercy of a spectral dragon. The horrifying
oni
 can even extend from the target's own body to attack them. All of these creatures can transfix the victim with fear and shock while Kamira will appear from above and personally choke and kill the opponent.

Trivia

It is unknown whether or not this technique is a true
genjutsu
, considering neither
Haido
 or his
knights
 even knew what
chakra
 was.

This appears to be more of
holographic projection
 than an actual illusion, as when Kamira realises that she was strangling not
Kankurō
 but
Karasu
 in disguise, the darkness dispelled, meaning the images were occurring around the puppet instead of a person's mind.
