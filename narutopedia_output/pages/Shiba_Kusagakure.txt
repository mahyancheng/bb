Shiba
 (
シバ
,
Shiba
) was a
chūnin
 from
Kusagakure
.

Personality

Shiba seemed to be very confident in his own abilities, and showed no arguments in using underhanded tactics to help his sponsor win a bet.

Appearance

Shiba had cheek length brown hair and his bangs hanged out just under his
forehead protector
. He had dark-coloured eyes. He wore a bandanna-styled Kusagakure forehead protector which was black and tied in the back.

Part I

Chūnin Exams

Main article:
Chūnin Exams

Shiba and
Midori
 observe the final round matches of the
Chūnin Exams
 in
Konohagakure
. When the match between
Sasuke Uchiha
 and
Gaara
 is about to begin, they approach Gaara as he heads to the arena (in the anime, they are sent by a
daimyō
 they were hired to guard). Many daimyō place bets on the matches and, as such, Shiba and Midori try to coerce Gaara into throwing the match so that bets on Sasuke can pay out. Gaara is insulted and promptly kills them both, soaking his
sand
 in their blood. Killing Shiba and Midori quenches Gaara's blood-lust, causing him to ignore
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Shikamaru Nara
 when he runs into them shortly afterwards.

Trivia

"Shiba" (
シバ
) literally means "brushwood".

In the anime, when Shiba was covering himself as the light bulb shattered above him, his forehead protector symbol changed to the Suna symbol.
