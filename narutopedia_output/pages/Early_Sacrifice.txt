Itachi jumps over his opponent while balancing himself over the opponent's shoulder (allowing the user to dodge an attack should it happen). Once landing, still holding onto the opponent's shoulder, Itachi throws them over himself onto the ground.

Trivia

In the anime, the technique's performance is expanded, including a swinging around of the target to cause them disorientation before the throw is done.

This move was only named in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2
.

This technique's name is also an abbreviated form of "mozu no hayanie" (
百舌の早贄
), which refers to the prey of the
bull-headed shrike
 when the bird impales it, usually with sharp twigs or thorns. The bird does this so the prey can be ripped in more conveniently-sized bits for consumption.
