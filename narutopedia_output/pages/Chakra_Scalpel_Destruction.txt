Kabuto moves towards his opponent with tremendous speed. After disabling them the chakra scalpel on the chest, he grabs his opponent by their shoulders, disabling them with the chakra scapel. With them momentarily disorientated by this, Kabuto quickly gets behind his opponent and delivers a series of diagonal strikes. He moves away, and a moment later, the effects of his hits take hold; his opponent falls foward. As the opponent falls, he casually kicks the opponent in the face, knocking them on their back.

Trivia
