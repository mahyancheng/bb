Karai
 (
カライ
) is a
shinobi
 from
Kumogakure
.

Background

While returning from a covert mission in the
Sugi Village
 having stolen their
kinjutsu
 Karai,
Nigai
 and the
Fourth Raikage
 are set upon by the mercenary
Nokizaru Group
 who had been hired to retrieve the
scroll
. Though they fled, an
Exploding Insect
 was implanted into them microscopically and after they berated the Raikage, an irate Nigai
attacked
 the group only to explode. Following the same vein, Karai attacked them but stopped before he could be killed. Later,
Amai
, another comrade and medical-nin attempted to heal him but to no avail. Eventually, despite his initial protest,
Tsunade
 was sought out to heal him, and the insect was removed by
Shizune
 while Amai helped conduct the surgery.

Personality

Karai is very loyal towards his village and A, to the point of refusing aid from anyone outside it and considering his life less worth than that of Raikage's pride. He even reprimanded Amai for referring to Tsunade with the honourific "-sama", due to her being from another village.

Appearance

Karai is a dark-skinned young man, with dark eyes and blond, spiky hair which has a streak of dark orange on the left side. He is seen wearing the common uniform of Kumogakure with an upturned collar and sleeves, which are frayed at the shoulders.

Abilities

Karai is capable of manipulating the
Lightning Release

nature transformation
 as shown when he used the
Lightning Strike
 technique in an attempt to take out the Nokizaru group.

Trivia

辛い
) literally means "bitter; spicy; salty; strict".
