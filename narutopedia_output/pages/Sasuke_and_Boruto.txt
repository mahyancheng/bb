"
Sasuke and Boruto
" (
サスケとボルト
,
Sasuke to Boruto
) is episode 54 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Boruto
 wants to go after his father, but
Sasuke
 stops him. Sasuke leaves to meet
Naruto
, and finds Naruto's old clothes on the street. At his office, Naruto berates himself for messing up
Himawari
's birthday as well.
Shikamaru
 helps him handle the paperwork. Sasuke arrives with a scroll from
Kaguya's palace
. Sasuke recounts how he was attacked in Kaguya's palace by
Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki
, and asked about
Kaguya
 by another Ōtsutsuki, who noticed Sasuke's
Rinnegan
, alarming Naruto and Shikamaru. Sasuke hands Naruto his old clothes he found on the street, and says he met Boruto. They discuss him, and the soul of shinobi. On his way out, Sasuke notices Boruto arriving. He obstructs Boruto, impressing him, so he asks to be Sasuke's disciple. Boruto explains how Naruto broke his promise to be there for his sister's birthday.
 Sasuke asks if he can use the
Rasengan
. Boruto says he'll learn it if that's what it takes to be Sasuke's student. Boruto asks
Konohamaru
 to teach him the Rasengan. Konohamaru teaches it, but Boruto is unenthusiastic about his water balloon training. The next day, Boruto's friends notice his exhaustion, and
Sarada
 assumes it has to do with her father, who showed up unexpectedly. While making pancakes for Himawari, Boruto gets a handle of the rotation aspect of the Rasengan. For the following days, Boruto continues training with a rubber ball, Sarada watching him from afar. Boruto shows his progress to Sasuke, who comments on Boruto's Rasengan's small size. Boruto throws his Rasengan away in frustration and leaves. Sarada thinks Sasuke is being too strict, and comments how Boruto has been uncharacteristically committed to learning the Rasengan. Sasuke says they've both jumped to conclusions, and that Sasuke was about to accept Boruto as his student. He notices the damage of Boruto's thrown Rasengan on a distant tree. Boruto vents to Katasuke, who offers him a
scientific ninja tool
 that stores ninjutsu.
Mitsuki
 speaks with
Orochimaru
, who advises him not to reveal his true strength during the exams. Boruto performs the Rasengan for Sasuke, who accepts him as his student, despite knowing Boruto is using a scientific ninja tool.

Trivia

Shikamaru erroneously said the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 took place ten years ago, when it's been established to take place fifteen years ago.

The episode has a number of differences from
Boruto: Naruto the Movie
 including:

Shikamaru is present when Sasuke arrives at Naruto's office.

The castle in Sasuke's flashback looked more damaged.

Sasuke is shown picking up the scroll before being attacked by Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki. Their battle then quickly moved to the outside.

Boruto rushes to Naruto's office to confront his father and meets Sasuke there, instead of ambushing Sasuke on the street.

When Boruto arrives at Konohamaru's house, he doesn't wear his
forehead protector
.

When Boruto forms a Rasengan with his
Shinobi Gauntlet
, he uses only one hand, instead of two.
