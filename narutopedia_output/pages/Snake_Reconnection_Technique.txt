If
Orochimaru
 is bisected by an opponent,
snakes
 are able to emerge from both halves of his body and pull him back together, seemingly undoing the damage he sustained.

Trivia

In the manga, the snakes used for this technique resemble those that emerge from Orochimaru's body in his
true form
, whereas in the anime, they appear to be regular
summoned
 snakes.
