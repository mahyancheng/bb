Genbu
 (

,
Genbu
) was a minister in the
Land of That
.

Background

Ages before the establishment of hidden villages, Genbu visited the
Land of Ancestors
 to confer with its lord,
Tenji
. After
Suzaku
 made his case for having a lake in the Land of Ancestors' territory be passed to the Land of That, Genbu assured Tenji that returning rightfully owned territories would be the right thing to do, implying that failure to comply would result in an armed conflict between the two countries. When Suzaku brought up
Kaguya
, Genbu voiced interest in meeting her. A few nights later, he and Suzaku brought a great army to the border. When Suzaku received word from a spy about Kaguya moving to the capital, Genbu said there wass no need to hurry in seizing her, as they would soon take the entire country. The next day, Genbu attended peace negotiations with Tenji, making up excuses for moving such a large army to the border. He listens as Suzaku recounts the events of the previous night. After Tenji left, Genbu asked Suzaku about his condition, only to be dismissed. He and Suzaku began taking over the country that night, but they along with their army were taken by Kaguya's
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 and bound to the roots of the
God Tree
.

Appearance

Genbu had short, spiky, black hair that hang down his forehead in three strips. He also had small black eyes.
