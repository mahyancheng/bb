The
Flaming Arrow of Amazing Ability
 is a technique used by
Nagato
 through the
Asura Path
.

Overview

Using the body modification ability of the
Asura Path
, the user compresses a high amount of
chakra
 at the slit of its wrist before releasing it, causing its detachable hand to be fired with tremendous force. It has enough destructive power to easily break through thick bedrock. As the hand portion is protected with chakra, it allows it to remain unscathed. When the attack is complete, the hand is drawn back like a magnet by chakra in the wrist, reattaching itself.

Trivia

The kaiwan (
怪腕
) in
Kaiwan no Hiya
 can be translated in two ways. The first and most common way is the idiomatic way: "an amazing or remarkable ability". The second way is by translating the kanji directly: "mysterious or suspicious arm", making the name a pun.
