This is a more practical application of the
Multi-Size Technique
. Rather than increase the size of their entire body, the user increases the size of only specific body parts, typically the arms and legs. Because of the larger size, physical attacks made with the expanded limbs do greater damage than normal. The limbs' growth is very fast, giving users a way of taking opponents by surprise. In the anime, the expanded mass can also be used a powerful defense from
blunt-force assaults
, cushioning the impact to negate it.

As with other techniques of the
Akimichi clan
, its
chakra
 requirements are quite high,
 to the point that, in Part I,
Chōji
 takes one of the
Three Coloured Pills
 before using this technique.

Trivia

In
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2
, Chōji uses this technique under the name "Super Fly Swatter" (
超ハエたたき
,
Chō Haetataki
).

In
Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja 4
, he says "Super Expansion Jutsu", the English name for
Super Multi-Size Technique
. This doesn't occur in the Japanese dub.
