A powerful barrier formation noted to only be usable by those of
Kage
 calibre, whereby four
shinobi
, standing in a square formation, erect a large barrier that is red in colour. It was stated to be several times stronger than the
Four Violet Flames Formation
, and is highly malleable and elastic. When assaulted by a
Tailed Beast Ball
 from the
Ten-Tails
, the barrier simply distorted its shape, forcing the brunt of the attack upwards while it was left completely intact and reformed to its original position.
 Its users can create openings within the barrier to allow passage.

This barrier is apparently very chakra-taxing since at least two of its users are limited in the usage of other techniques, such as
clone techniques
, while maintaining the barrier at the same time.

Trivia

In the
anime
, within
Tsunade
's
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 dream, she and
Kushina Uzumaki
 could perform this technique.
