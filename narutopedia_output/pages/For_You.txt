ここにあるのは

君が今まで選んだ道の

答え達よ

ほら自信もって進めばいい

とても自然なの

雨上がりのアスファルトに

虹が架かるように

Lonely 風が吹いて

Feeling 気がついたよ

答えはどこにも無いけど

Call me 分かってるわ

With you 愛はいつも

与え合うもの

For You

きっと君はいつの日か

この空を飛べるはずだから

何度つまずいたとしても

For You

大切な事は1つ

夢見る事

心だけは閉ざさないでいて

傷ついても涙こらえ

我慢してたよね?

そんな君を一番近くで

見てきたから

何も言わなくても

分かってるよ

どんな時も頑張ってた事

Runaway 迷ったなら

Try again 何度だって

やり直す事できるから

I'm here 側にいるわ

Believing 恐れないで

信じ合うこと

For You

きっと君もいつの日か

この空を飛べるはずだから

何度傷ついたとしても

For You

大切な事は1つ

夢見る事

瞳だけはそらさないでいて

君が描く勇気がほら

かけがえのない宝物に変わるよ

今両手ひろげ Fly high

きっと君はいつの日か

この空を飛べるはずだから

何度つまずいたとしても

For You

大切な事は1つ

夢見る事

心だけは閉ざさないでいて

English

Here are the answers of the path you chose up to now.

Look, just go on by yourself

It's very natural, like a rainbow over

Asphalt after a rainfall

A Lonely wind blew and

A Feeling dawned on me

There aren't any answers anywhere

Call me, I got it already

With you, we'll always

Love each other

For You

I'm sure one day you will

Be able to fly in the sky

No matter how many times we've stumbled For You

There's only one thing important

Which is to dream

So at least, keep your heart open

There's only one thing that's important

Which is to dream

So at least, keep your heart open

Even if you got hurt, you stifled your tears and endured it

Because I came to see you like that from the closest point

Even though you don't say anything, I understand

How hard you've tried no matter what

Lonely, if you get lost

Try again, however many times

You can do it over

I’m here, I’m beside you

Believe me, It is a thing to

Believe each other without fearing

For You

Because surely someday, you are

Meant to fly in that sky

No matter how many times you stumble

For You

There's only one thing that's important

Which is to dream

Just don't divert your eyes

The courage you’ve drawn out praises

To treasures like none other

It talks.

Spread both your hands out now, Fly High

Because surely someday, you are

Meant to fly in that sky

No matter how many times you stumble

For You

There's only one thing that's important

Which is to dream

So at least, keep your heart open.
