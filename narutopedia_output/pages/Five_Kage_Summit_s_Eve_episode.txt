"
Five Kage Summit's Eve
" (
五影会談前夜
,
Gokage Kaidan Zenya
) is episode 198 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 is held against a wall by
Karui
, who attempts to force him into giving up information regarding
Sasuke
. Naruto tells her that if he does sell out his friend, then they would succeed in finding and killing Sasuke, forcing Sasuke's friends from
Konoha
 to kill them;
Kumo
 would retaliate, thereby giving birth to another cycle of hatred. In order to defuse Karui's hatred, Naruto offers himself as a punching bag. Naruto is severely beaten, but is saved by
Sai
, who blocks Karui's punch. Karui's teammate
Omoi
 also restrains her, telling her that Naruto is the type to never give up or sell out his comrades, a quality which he likes.
Samui
 arrives and whisks her team away, notifying them that they have intel on Sasuke to decipher. Naruto asks if he may tag along as well in order to meet the
Raikage
, but Samui tells him that the
Raikage
 is too busy and on the move to meet him.

Elsewhere,
Zetsu
 notifies
Madara
 and
Taka
 that it was Naruto who defeated
Pain
, citing that Naruto may be stronger than Sasuke now. Sasuke smirks, and tells Taka that their new objective is to head to the
Five Kage Summit
 to kill
Danzō
. Madara approves the plan, and Zetsu splits himself into two —
Black Zetsu
 and
White Zetsu
. White Zetsu leads Taka to the summit's location while Black Zetsu stays back with Madara. Madara muses how he never expected Nagato to use the
Outer Path — Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 to revive all those he had killed during his
assault
 and that Naruto has severely affected their plans.

In the makeshift
Hokage
 office, Danzō orders his
Root
 faction to find
Kabuto
 and kill him before
Anko
 does, since Kabuto is aware of Danzō's association with
Orochimaru
. He commands Root not to kill Anko but to make sure to extract the human experimentation files that Kabuto possesses, claiming that it would be useful for his bandaged eye and arm. He tasks the remaining members to watch over Naruto, telling them that the
Nine-Tails
 is not allowed to leave the village, and assigns the two highest-ranking members,
Torune Aburame
 and
Fū Yamanaka
, as his personal bodyguards for the summit.

While he is recovering in his tent, Naruto tells
Kakashi
 and
Yamato
 that he wishes to find the Raikage and convince him to forgive Sasuke. Yamato replies that Naruto, as a
jinchūriki
, is not allowed to leave the village, especially since the
First Hokage's Necklace
 has been destroyed, as well as the fact that Naruto entered into his
eight-tailed
 form during his fight with Pain. Naruto reveals that he met the
Fourth Hokage
 and that it was he who suppressed the transformation. He adds that the Fourth told him that the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
 sixteen years ago was orchestrated by the masked man who leads the Akatsuki, who the Fourth believed was manipulating Pain. Naruto tells him that he cannot allow Sasuke to be manipulated in the same fashion and that he must save Sasuke. Kakashi theorises that the Fourth must have infused a part of his mind into the
seal
 with his
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
 technique, and that the masked man must be
Madara Uchiha
. Remembering how he
met
 his
father
 in the afterlife, who was waiting just to speak to him, Kakashi asks Naruto if the Fourth ever said anything to him, since fathers usually have something to say to their sons. Naruto smiles and proclaims that his father told him that he believed in him.

He also asks Sai to notify Danzō about Madara being the mastermind over the Nine-Tails' attack as well as the fact that Madara is the Akatsuki's true leader. Despite the fact that Konoha is not allowed to dispatch any
shinobi
 to allied nations during the Five Kage Summit, Kakashi decides to bend the rules, placing his trust in his sensei's faith in Naruto. He notifies Naruto that he and Yamato, whom he calls Tenzō, are going to be Naruto's escorts for his journey to Kumogakure.

Trivia

Kakashi
,
Sai
 and
Yamato
 are revealed to have known that the
Fourth Hokage
 was
Naruto
's father. Despite it being a village secret, Sai's knowledge of the fact means that Danzō, and most likely the other members of
Root
, are also aware of it.
