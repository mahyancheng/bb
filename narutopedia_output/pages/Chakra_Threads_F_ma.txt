This article is about the Fūma clan technique. For threads used in the Puppet Technique, see
Chakra Threads
.

This is a
murder-suicide
 technique. The user creates threads of
chakra
 that are used to connect the user's heart to another person's. As long as the two are connected, any internal damage done to one will also be done to the other. This ultimately means that, if one person dies, so will the other. Only a
kunai
 wrapped in a special
Fūma clan
 tag can safely cut the threads and separate the two.

Trivia

It is mentioned that the threads are so resilient that even
Tsunade
, with her
fearsome strength
, cannot break them.
