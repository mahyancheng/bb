Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

The reborn
Team Kakashi
 continues to investigate the recent attack by
Kabuto
 and the
reincarnated
 shinobi when
Naruto
 gets swallowed by a
giant snake
, but manages to escape using
shadow clones
, and accidentally ingests snakes that were present in the pond which Kabuto uses to summon
Hidan
. When Naruto surfaced, Kabuto retreats and leaves with his puppets, using
Deidara
 as diversion, after revealing a village guard corpse in the snake's mouth. Meanwhile,
Dokku
 takes care of the orphans, while
Miina
, due to trauma, became mute. After the attack, Naruto and
Sakura
 join up with
Shiseru
,
Yamato
 and
Sai
 going with the rest of the guards. While Yamato and Sai investigate why Kabuto destroyed the village, Sakura and Naruto follow Shiseru to Dokku's house.

When Dokku and the orphans see them and seeing Naruto wearing the same forehead protector as the reincarnated shinobi,
Leo
 kicks Naruto and they run until they reach a broken bridge. Leo crosses first and when Dokku and Miina run, they fall down the ravine, but are saved by Naruto. Yamato and Sai ask about information when the nearby
village leader
 showed them a book revealing the origin of
The Hole
, where the
Tonika Village
 resides. Some power resided on the hole many centuries ago. Naruto dreams again, this time inside his subconscious, in front of the
Nine-Tails
' cage, showing his feet oozing with the snakes he ingested earlier. Naruto and Dokku talk about Dokku's failure to save a girl in his prime and all his failures in life, unlike Naruto, who became famous even in the
Hachō Village
, a rural area. Yamato and Sai discuss what will happen next, including "
Saezuri
" and an institution that will take care of the orphans. Kabuto, along with Hidan and Deidara, converse using scrolls in a graveyard, before putting another talisman in Deidara's head.

Trivia

Shortly before he attacked
Dokku
,
Hayate Gekkō
 was not wearing the sheath strapped on his back.
