Synopsis

Sasuke
 finally manages to catch up to
Gaara
, but
Temari
 stalls him so that
Kankurō
 and Gaara can escape. He easily deals with her and resumes his chase. At the
Hokage
 battle,
Orochimaru
 shows the
Third Hokage
 the fruits of his quest to gain immortality. Peeling away his face, Orochimaru reveals the face of a girl whose body he has taken; Orochimaru's key to living forever is to take the bodies of others to extend his lifespan, and he reveals his intentions of stealing the body of Sasuke Uchiha to use as his new body. The Third Hokage regrets not killing Orochimaru years before when he had the chance. Finally ready to take down Orochimaru, the Third Hokage musters up his chakra and summons
shadow clones
 and uses the remaining chakra to perform the
Fourth Hokage
's forbidden jutsu - the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
. Despite the
Second Hokage
 using
a genjutsu that causes complete darkness
, the Third Hokage manages to hold on. Orochimaru claims that he will destroy
Konoha
 just as he will destroy the Third Hokage. The Third states that the Hokage that succeed him will continue to be the pillar of Konoha and protect the village; he then remembers the past and current inhabitants of Konoha that he fights to protect. With that, the Third rushes forwards to begin his attack.
