The user controls the reflection of light around their body using
chakra
, causing their form, shadow, and even breathing to become invisible to the unaided eye. Because they perfectly blend in with their surroundings, the user can sneak up behind an enemy without being noticed.
 Since both their appearance and scent are camouflaged, their presence can only be revealed by the sounds they make.

Dōjutsu
 such as the
Sharingan
 or
Byakugan
 can also see through it.

Trivia

Kakashi Hatake

Nagare
 despite his use of this technique,
 while in
Naruto the Movie: Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom
,
Karenbana
 wore so much perfume that it nullified the technique's usefulness against
Sakura Haruno
.
