Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Kū
 tends to
Ōnoki
, who tries to dissuade Kū from continuing his plans, but Kū continues to believe Ōnoki's weakness is clouding his judgement.
Team 10
 is exhausted after fighting
Kokuyō
 and wonder how
Boruto
 and
Sarada
 are faring. Caught in Kirara's
genjutsu
, she controls their movements like a puppeteer. Sarada tries breaking the genjutsu on Boruto with her
Sharingan
, but
Kirara
 forces him to close his eyes. She wants to play with them like they're dolls, drawing out their injuries. Ōnoki ponders on Boruto's assessment of the Fabrications' will and Kū's own words and actions. He thinks back to first meeting and naming Kū, as well as the other four
Fabrications
. Ōnoki tries leaving his room, but his path is blocked by an
Akuta
. The doctor tends to Sekiei's deterioration, and
Sekiei
 asks him how their lives will be after receiving hearts. He's not concerned about being strong, but with protecting his friends. The doctor leaves Sekiei alone with
Mitsuki
. Sekiei tells Mitsuki he heard of Kokuyō's and
Kakō
's deaths, and recounts his feelings about it. He asks Mitsuki how that'll change once he has a heart, and Mitsuki explains having a heart doesn't make one human.
 Mitsuki relays Kū's orders to the doctor. Having made back from the
Sanzu Plains
,
Sekki
 has been avoiding the Akuta, and runs into
Akatsuchi
, who updates him on what has happened. As all other shinobi have been imprisoned, Akatsuchi tasks Sekki with rescuing Ōnoki. Mitsuki shows Sekiei a completed artificial heart. An Akuta updates Kirara on their heart situation. Not wanting to miss it, she makes Boruto and Sarada stop holding back as she leaves. Sarada is able to put herself under a new genjutsu by looking at her Sharingan's reflection on Boruto's sword, then breaks the genjutsu on him. As Mitsuki is about to deliver Kū his heart, Boruto and Sarada arrive. Mitsuki holds them at bay with a
Lightning Release
, and Kū binds their movement with an
Earth Release
. Boruto tries appealing to Mitsuki not to help Kū. Mitsuki hands Kū the heart, and while he celebrates, Mitsuki strikes him from behind. Kū drops the heart, revealed to be disguised snakes. All are shocked by the betrayal. They hear explosions from afar, those being
Konohamaru
 destroying the Akuta production site as arranged with Mitsuki.
Kurotsuchi
 frees the captured
Iwagakure
 shinobi. Ōnoki manages to escape his room.
Team 7
 faces against the remaining Fabrications.
