Quickly creating a dome-like structure in the form of a dragon's face, the user is completely surrounded. Taking advantage of the nature of Wood Release, this fūinjutsu substantially weakens incoming attacks whilst protecting the user inside.

Hashirama once used this to nullify the destructive force of
Kurama
's
Tailed Beast Ball
. On the user's command, the dome is split down the middle and can be opened.

Influence

This technique is influenced by a dragon-shaped mask that the Buddhist bodhisattva of compassion,
Avalokiteśvara
, also known as "Senju Kannon" (
千手観音
,
Thousand-Armed Kannon
) carries around.
