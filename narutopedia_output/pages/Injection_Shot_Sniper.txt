This is one of the tools used by the
medical-nin
 of
Konohagakure
. It resembles a rudimentary sniper rifle, which is used to shoot projectiles such as
injection shots
 to put the target to sleep. It consists of a metal tube roughly the size of a ruler with an opening at either end like a blowpipe, and is equipped with a scope on top and a laser-sight on the bottom. The weapon is designed to launch syringes at long range after the user hits the end with the palm of their hand.
