After setting up an area, the user can attempt to extract a
tailed beast
 from its
jinchūriki
. The jinchūriki is bound to a rock table surrounded by a large circular sealing formula with several ceremonial rocks surrounding it. During the extraction process, the jinchuriki experiences extreme pain as the beast is ripped from their body.

Harusame
 attempted to use this technique to extract
Saiken
 from its jinchūriki,
Utakata
. During the extraction process, Utakata slipped into the beast's
full form
 and ended up killing Harusame.

Trivia

Because Harusame wished to free Utakata of the burden of being the host of the Six-Tails, it is possible this technique was created as a means to extract a tailed beast without ending the life of the jinchūriki.

The place where Saiken was being extracted from Utakata by Harusame from resembles a
Stonehenge
.
