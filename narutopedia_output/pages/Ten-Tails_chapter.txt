 manga.

Summary

Shocked to the see the
Ten-Tails
 before them,
Naruto
 surmises that they must have been tricked as he was unable to
sense
 the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
's malevolent chakra. However,
Kurama
 tells the young man that it was impossible to sense the beast in the
Tailed Beast Mode
 as the beast had neither feelings nor ideals and was akin to
natural energy
 and that using
Sage Mode
 to sense how powerful it was, would be a different matter. Meanwhile,
Obito
 and
Madara
 relocate atop the beast and attach themselves to it. Obito notes that he would like to commence the
plan
 immediately, but Madara is more in favour of testing out the beast's power. As Naruto's attempt to gauge the Ten-Tails' power in Sage Mode ends in Naruto realising that it was indeed truly immeasurable, Kurama asks
Gyūki
 to hand him
Might Guy
 and
Kakashi
 so he could restore their
chakra
. Taking command, Kurama devises a battle strategy to face the beast launching a
continuous
 stream of Tailed Beast Balls, which culminates with Gyūki seemingly being decimated by the Ten-Tails' Tailed Beast Ball, but it was later revealed that Kakashi had
warped
 it away while being launched by Naruto along with the latter's clone overhead the Ten-Tails where Kakashi released Gyūki who was aiming a Tailed Beast Ball right at the giant beast.
