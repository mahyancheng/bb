"
You Better…
" (
お前は必ず
,
Omae wa Kanarazu
) is episode 472 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Kakashi
 asks the crumbling
Obito
 why he would sacrifice himself when he was still necessary in battle, but he tells Kakashi to focus on the enemy, before musing that Kakashi needed to survive in order to support the next generation of shinobi, and notes that
Naruto
,
Sakura
 and
Sasuke
 are a crucial part for the future.
Kaguya
 decides to return to her
first dimension
 while she replenishes her chakra. Naruto tries to use his
abilities
 to save Obito, as
Black Zetsu
 mocks not only Naruto's futile efforts, but Obito's wasted life; and though Obito agrees to this, Zetsu's words do nothing but infuriate Naruto.
 Wasting no time when he realised that his
dōjutsu
's
ability
 was useable once more, Sasuke launches an attack on Kaguya, forcing her to
shift dimensions
 once more to narrowly escape the attack. Noting that this time he would be the distraction, Sasuke engages Kaguya giving her no time to relent as he dons his
Complete Body — Susanoo
 and flies towards her. Obito uses this time to impart his final words to Kakashi and Naruto, thanking them for allowing him to remember who he used to be. After telling Naruto to become
Hokage
, Obito finally disintegrates into a pile of ash, leading Black Zetsu to comment that Obito was a cockroach for having lasted so much longer than a regular insect. Enraged at this point, Naruto declares that because he wanted to become Hokage at one point, Obito was an awesome person in his eyes, and proceeded to fly up to Kaguya at an extreme speed, severing her left arm with his own
chakra arm
. Meanwhile, in the afterlife, Obito finds
Rin
, who revealed she had been watching Obito all these years, and the two reconcile.
