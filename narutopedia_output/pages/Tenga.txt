Tenga
 (
天画
) comes from a small country and is a member of the
Daimyō
's intelligence bureau.

Personality

Tenga always seems to have a sunny disposition. He is easily excitable and takes great pride in his job and was shown to hold
Inoichi Yamanaka
 in very high regard; visibly flustered when he got to meet him.

Appearance

Tenga has short, black hair that he wears a headband with circular markings around, along with a cream coloured outfit with a blue hood, trimmings and the kanji
"tsū"
 (
通
) on the back. He also wears a necklace with the same kanji and has a mark under his right eye. In the Fourth Shinobi World War, he wears the standard Kumogakure flak jacket.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown

Tenga operated the transmission screens between the daimyō of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 and recorded the discussion between them as they debated the formation of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, as well as the voting process that followed the discussion. Tenga then acted as a witness to their decision.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, after the Allied Shinobi Forces was split into several divisions, Tenga was assigned to the
Intelligence Division
 under Inoichi Yamanaka's command. At the start of the war, Tenga excitedly introduced himself to Inoichi noting that he had heard a great deal about him.

Trivia

"Tenga"
 (
天画
) roughly translates to
"sky picture"
, possibly referring to his role in broadcasting live video feeds.

The kanji on Tenga's uniform and necklace is
"tsū"
 (
通
), likely short for
"communication"
 (
通信
,
tsūjin
).

During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, he was donning the
flak jacket
 of
Kumogakure
, which may suggest that he was originally intended to hail from that village.
