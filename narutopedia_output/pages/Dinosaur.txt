Several dinosaurs.



Dinosaurs
 (
恐竜
,
Kyōryū
) were a large type of reptile that lived in the
Land of Redaku
 millions of years ago. They went extinct when a meteorite struck the region. In the millennia that followed, the wetlands that the dinosaurs once lived in turned into a vast mountain range, at the peaks of which the dinosaurs' fossilised remains can commonly be found. Humans who discover these fossils more generically refer to them as "
dragons
" (
竜獣
,
Ryū-jū
).

A few years prior to the events of
Sasuke Retsuden
,
Zansūru
, a
paleontologist
, discovered a way to
revive the dead
. With the approval of Redaku's
Prime Minister
, Zansūru began excavating dinosaur fossils from the area surrounding the
Astronomy Research Institute
 with plans of reviving them to use as an army; he recruited
Jiji
 to help him. They revived one dinosaur in order to test the technique, which they named
Menō
. Once enough fossils were collected, dozens of additional dinosaurs were revived, to be used to invade the
Land of Fire
. However, before they could be used for this purpose, the Prime Minister was
overthrown
 by Prince
Nanara
, Zansūru died while fighting
Sasuke Uchiha
, and Jiji was convinced by
Sakura Uchiha
 to return all of the revived dinosaurs to the afterlife.

Known Species

Tirano
 (
肉食獣
,
literally meaning:
 Carnivore)

A bipedal carnivore, identified as the strongest type of dinosaur to be reincarnated.
Menō
, a juvenile of this species, can travel twelve meters in a single spring, making him fast enough that even Sasuke cannot outrun him. This species has a long, powerful tail that it can hit targets with, which can easily be swung at them from the side if they block its forward attacks. The species' sharps claws and powerful jaws can effortlessly separate flesh from bone. Its name, "Tirano", is presumably a reference to
Tyrannosaurus
.

Pterosaur
 (
翼竜
,
Putera
,
literally meaning:
 Winged Dragon)

Flying dinosaurs that are around ten meters tall. They possess incredibly sharp beaks, which can easily pierce deeply through flesh or bone. However, the beaks are not strong enough for actual combat and will start to dull after delivering only a few blows to a target. Weighing less than ten kilograms, they are very light, allowing them to fly to destinations quickly. This lightness works against them if captured by an opponent, as even a small number of attacks will prove debilitating to them.

Titan
 (
巨大獣
)

A long-necked dinosaur reaching thirty meters in length, it is one of the largest creatures in history. Because of its sheer size, any building it walks into will be extensively damaged. Its size is a handicap in many ways, preventing it from changing directions quickly and rendering it unable to reach any enemies attacking its back. Its great weight makes walking across certain terrains precarious, and if any of its comparatively short legs are injured, it likely will not be able to support itself, causing it to fall over. Its name, "Titan", is presumably a reference to the
Titanosaurs
.

In the
Sasuke Retsuden
 novel,
Penjira
 refers to this dinosaur as
Kubinaga
 (
クビナガ
). The reason for this is unclear.

Spino
 (
竜脚獣
,
Supino
)

A human-sized dinosaur that is highly flexible. Its relatively small size makes it easy to bite targets, at which point it runs off, leaving its victims to bleed to death. The manga depicts the species as considerably larger, with a prominent spinal sail that is characteristic of the
Spinosaurus
.

Pachycephalosauria
 (
堅頭竜
,
Kefaro
,
literally meaning:
 Hard-Headed Dragon)

A herbivore with a thick dome-shaped skull that is likened to iron. It lowers its head and charges at targets, trampling those that get underfoot and bashing them with its skull, killing them on impact. It is shown cornering targets in confined spaces and slamming its feet on the ground as intimidation before initiating its attack.

Ornithopoda
 (
鳥脚獣
,
Orunito
)

A dinosaur that is covered with brown feathers, giving it a resemblance similar to an
ostrich
. Because its hind-legs are twice the height of a human, it can pulverise those it steps on and kick targets far into the distance. A herbivore, multiples of its species are necessary to compete with other dinosaurs in combat.

Trivia






Kishimoto's dragon design.



Masashi Kishimoto
 originally planned to have
Naruto Uzumaki
 learn to
summon
 dragons. The design he came up with used the basic aesthetics of
Chinese dragons
, but made fat to evoke
European dragons
.

Sasuke Uchiha
 had a toy that looked like a dinosaur when he was a child.
