Tenten
 (
テンテン
) is a
kunoichi
 from
Konohagakure
 and a member of
Team Guy
. While initially wanting to be like the legendary
Sannin

Tsunade
, she realised that she did not have the necessary
chakra control
 to be a
medical-nin
. However, she did not give up on being a powerful kunoichi, putting her all into perfecting her
weaponry
 and
fūinjutsu
 skills. Years after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, she opened her own weapon shop and became a proctor of the
Chūnin Exams
.

Background






Tenten as a child.



Since her time as a student in the
Academy
, Tenten had a goal to become a legendary kunoichi like
Tsunade
, one of the
Sannin
, which she openly shared to others. After graduating, she was assigned to the
jōnin
 tutelage of
Might Guy
, alongside her classmates
Rock Lee
 and
Neji Hyūga
. For their final test to become genin, Guy forced his potential students to spar him and see their commitment to succeed. Ultimately, all three passed.
 During this time of trial and failure, trying to emulate Tsunade, Tenten attempted to become a
medical-nin
, building up her raw strength and such. While each failed attempt was damaging to her pride, Tenten later discovered her aptitude for
fūinjutsu
 and thus developed her unique fighting style. Realising her own nature, she stopped trying to become like Tsunade, but still has not given up on her dream of becoming a legendary kunoichi in her own right.
 Later, Tenten and her teammates were offered the chance to enter the
Chūnin Exams
 in the possibility of being promoted to said rank. However, all three decided to pass on the exams for the time being to further hone their skills.

Personality






Tenten dreams of Guy and Lee being mature.



Tenten is depicted as naturally inquisitive and observant, with a personal dream to become a legendary kunoichi like Tsunade. This has led to her to become strongly opinionated about women, defending that girls can be just as skilled as boys in
taijutsu
 when Neji thought otherwise. Tenten exhibits a distaste for weakness or being overly dependent on other people. Though she can be quite fierce at times,
 Tenten is kind and caring toward others, comforting her friends when they are going through a hard time.

Being around her overly enthusiastic teammates, particularly
Might Guy
 and
Rock Lee
, Tenten is often left exasperated at their antics and wishes they would behave more maturely; her
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 dream actually depicts this. She is more easy-going and dislikes having to travel for whole days
 or continue training when she is already tired, for which reason she enjoys her days-off from missions. However, she cares greatly about her team, helping to go save Lee during the Chūnin Exams when he didn't report back at their base. She also held great respect for her other teammate
Neji Hyūga
 and often helped him train.

Naturally Tenten, who was a ninja-tool user, loves ninja weapons to the point that she collects every ninja tool from all over the world as a hobby. Moreover, her hobby developed so much that she even opened a full-fledged ninja tool shop.
 She also appears to have a fascination with the supernatural, believing in ghosts and the like.

Appearance

Tenten has black hair and grey eyes, both of which are depicted as dark brown in the anime. She wears her hair in two Chinese-style buns on her head with short fringe-bangs framing her face. She keeps this hairstyle consistent throughout Parts I and II. In
The Last: Naruto the Movie
, her hair buns are braided and held together by a short plait that falls just below her shoulders. As an adult, her braided-buns are still kept, but her straight bangs cover her forehead.

Tenten's outfits serve as a reference to Chinese culture. In Part I, she wears a pink sleeveless qipao-style blouse (initially depicted as blue in the manga) with red sleeve trimmings and yellow fastening buttons and dark green pants. A pouch is adjusted to her thigh and her forehead protector and sandals are both blue. In Part II, Tenten sports a long-sleeved, high-collared white blouse with maroon edges, black fingerless gloves, low-heeled sandals and a black forehead protector. She wears maroon, puffy
hakama
-styled pants with the exposed parts covered in bandages and the shuriken holster removed. She usually carries a large scroll behind her back. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Tenten wears the standard Konoha infantry
flak jacket
 and assorted clothing, along with a holster around her waist that carries two small scrolls.

In
The Last: Naruto the Movie
, Tenten wears a white sleeveless, high-collared qipao dress with red trimmings and a pink flame pattern on the left, tied with a maroon obi. Underneath, she has fishnet leg stockings and black high-heeled boots. She no longer wears her gloves and forehead protector, but wears a pair of black scrolls around her wrists like bangles, and has two scrolls in the colour of green and light grey strapped on her lower back.

As an adult, Tenten once again wears the similar outfit she wore in Part II with the pants being peach-coloured. She also sports red dangling tassel-like earrings.

Abilities






Tenten destroying one of Kakuzu's elemental masks.



Tenten is a highly skilled and capable kunoichi; her skills being held in high regard by her team. By Part II, she became a
chūnin
,
 capable of pressuring the likes of
Kisame Hoshigaki
 with the aid of her teammates.
 As an adult, Tenten learned to
manipulate
 a multitude of
puppets
 to coordinate surprise attacks, even without the use of chakra threads.
 Having also been remarked as a kunoichi who excelled at
space–time ninjutsu
,
 she can
summon
 dozens of them over
vast distances
.

Bukijutsu






Tenten's fighting style.



Tenten is able to wield a variety of weapons with great proficiency, such as the
manriki-gusari
 and bō.
 She could even effectively wield a weapon that she had no prior knowledge on, like the
Jidanda
 and
Bashōsen
.
 Also, as noted by her teammates, Tenten is an excellent marksman, hitting 100/100 marks each time.
 By adulthood, Tenten is considered to be Konoha's top weapon user.

Fūinjutsu






Tenten's arsenal of weapons.



Tenten is very skilled in the use of
fūinjutsu
. Her usual method is to
store
 a numerous amount of weapons into her scrolls, which she can later
unseal
 with varying degrees of force to bombard her opponents with.
 She could attach
explosive tags
 to the weapons to make them more lethal, and use
wire strings
 to better
guide
 the weapons' trajectory.

In the anime, she can use her two small scrolls to perform the
Twin Rising Dragons
 to launch a variety of weapons in rapid succession;
 which she was limited to physically having to touch in order to execute until Part II. She equips a large scroll in Part II, which she can launch above her opponent to
rain a multitude of weapons
 down onto them.

In addition, Tenten can store and release a
fire dragon
 that explodes upon contact
 and a
metal dome
 to defend against attacks.
 She can even seal objects as large as a ship,
 or a large body of water; the latter of which she can use to wash obstacles away.

Chūnin Exams

Chūnin Exams






Team Guy finishes their training.



By having not been allowed to participate the year before, Team Guy took part in the Chūnin Exams along with the
Rookie Nine
. They initially tried to avoid attention by acting weak by being beaten around by the two Chūnin that weren't letting them pass through, but
Lee
 accidentally let slip his true strength by interfering with a fight between Sasuke Uchiha and
Kotetsu Hagane
. After Neji asked Sasuke to present who he was, Sasuke didn't answer, to which Tenten giggled to herself, thinking it was cute. During the written exam, Tenten assisted Lee in gathering answers. Using strings to adjust hidden mirrors on the ceiling, Tenten allowed Lee to see his fellow ninja's answers and copy them without being caught. To know that Lee saw the answer she sneaked in for him, Lee had to adjust his forehead protector.

She was seen again during the second part of the exam in the
Forest of Death
 with her teammates. Their team decided to split up to find weaker teams to corner and take scrolls from. She and Neji met back up at the assigned destination, but became worried when Lee didn't return. She and Neji went looking for Lee and arrived in time to find an unconscious Lee surrounded by
Team Dosu
. Tenten was seen taking over watching an unconscious Lee for
Ino
, and then proceeded to wake him by violently shaking him. During Sakura's and Ino's match, Neji not being impressed commented on the skill of their hand to hand combat, wondering whether this was as far all kunoichi can fight, to which Tenten replied that it didn't matter whether a man or woman was in battle.






Temari finishes off Tenten.



Tenten was pitted against
Temari
 during the preliminaries of the
Chūnin Exams
. Since their fight went unseen in the manga, the anime adaptation explained the circumstances that occurred. Tenten began the match by throwing a few of her weapons at Temari while keeping the best distance for offence and defence, though Temari easily blew the weapons away with her fan. She was surprised that not one weapon reached Temari. Temari explained the power of her fan and that once Tenten had seen all three moons the match would be over. Since nothing had even come close to hitting Temari, Tenten used one final technique that she was saving for the finals, the
Twin Rising Dragons
, but ultimately ineffective against Temari's fan. As Tenten ran out of weapons, she used strings to control the weapons and fling them once again back at Temari, in an attempt to surprise her. Temari however quickly used her fan to blast Tenten, along with her weapons and she hit the floor. Temari finally used her fan to trap Tenten in a
cyclone
 and propel her into the air. As the cyclone dispersed and Tenten fell to the ground, Temari had Tenten land on her closed fan, knocking her unconscious and calling the match she just had boring. Even after she was declared the winner of the match, she threw Tenten off of the fan in an attempt to have her land on the many weapons on the ground to injure her more. However, Lee jumped in to save Tenten before she hit the ground.

Before the finals began, Tenten helps Neji in his training to perfect his techniques. She was seen using her weapons to help Neji perfect his
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
 technique, commenting to him that he has surpassed all kinds of human capabilities. Later, she watched Neji's fight against
Naruto
 in the finals, where she admired Neji's skills and thought that there would be just no way that Naruto would beat a genius like him. For pretty much all of the fight she rooted for Neji and watched him in amazement. Tenten was shown to be shocked, praising Naruto and his abilities for defeating Neji. She was later seen again during Temari and
Shikamaru
's match and comment that she could never beat that kind of opponent.

Konoha Crush

Konoha Crush

In the anime, it was shown that Tenten went down to check on Neji. Chaos was heard by the two outside, witnessing giant snakes attacking the whole village. It was shown that Tenten along with Neji and
Kiba
 were sent on a different mission to get back
Hinata
 whom was captured. They then had a battle with a bunch of wolves which was a trap to not let the gang proceed. Tenten summoned a fire dragon from her scroll, obliterating many of the attackers. She then told Neji and Kiba to go save Hinata. Ultimately, she defeated the enemies she was faced with and Hinata was saved.

Later, Tenten can be seen at the
Third Hokage
's funeral alongside the other villagers, mourning his death.

Search for Tsunade

When Tsunade returns to Konoha for becoming the Fifth Hokage, Tenten can be seen when she went to Neji after his training. She tells him that Tsunade has returned and asks him to check it out with her, which Neji replied that he was not interested in.

Kurosuki Family Removal Mission

Main article:
Kurosuki Family Removal Mission






Tenten's team discover Ranmaru.



In the anime, Team Guy and Naruto were sent to get rid of the Kurosuki family. After taking care of most of the enemy members, they ran into their leader,
Raiga Kurosuki
, who was more than enough to handle her and teammates. Ultimately, Raiga was defeated. She and the others soon found a young boy named
Ranmaru
 who was not only working alongside Raiga by using his
dōjutsu
, but depended on Raiga as his arms and legs, and developed an unhealthy attachment to Raiga. They listened to Ranmaru state that without Raiga he was useless and has no reason to live. Before they continued the mission, they tied up Ranmaru inside a shed, and Tenten pointed out that the only threat Ranmaru posed was possibly being a danger to himself. Later, they came back to Ranmaru and heard him state that it didn't matter if he felt alright or not, he couldn't keep living all alone. Tenten was frustrated by all of Ranmaru's self loathing and referred to him as a weakling, affirming that everyone should be able to live even if they are alone. She couldn't stand weak, indecisive people. After this, she made a formidable opponent for
Raiga Kurosuki
 when she faced him in a one-on-one fight. Knowing that he used
Lightning Release
 techniques, she quickly deduced that her metal weapons would be a bad idea to use, and took on the
missing-nin
 using her wooden based melee weapons. She appeared to gain the upper hand in the battle when she succeeded in disarming Raiga until he ultimately overwhelmed her with his techniques. Tenten noticed that Ranmaru was hurt and took care of him in the shed. Ranmaru told her to not bother because he knew he'd be dead soon anyway. Tenten yelled that she wouldn't let that happen and that he was not allowed to get out that easy. She stated that all the people he and Raiga killed wanted to live, that he didn't get to decide who dies this time, and that he was going to live and take some responsibility for all those people whose lives he cut short. Later, she saved his life by taking him to the
Curry of Life
 shop, and once he ate the curry his body started healing. She brought Ranmaru out of his depression and convinced him to live and to stand on his own two feet.

Interlude

In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths

Main article:
In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths

In the anime, about two years later, Tenten's team entered an early Chūnin Exam hosted between Konoha and Sunagakure. For the first exam, Tenten and her teammates were randomly split into different rooms. Shikamaru, as proctor, explained that everyone only needs to answer one question on the test, but their team's combined score must equal exactly 100 points to pass.
 Neji decided to send vibrations through the wall to tell his team which question they should each answer. Afterwards, Shikamaru instructed everyone to answer a bonus question of what teammate would be sacrificed as a necessary, to which that person would be disqualified. Tenten, being loyal, chose not to answer at all, and ultimately her team passes the first round. A race to Sunagakure was then issued where only the first 30 teams to arrive would qualify for the second exam.

Ultimately, Tenten's team arrive in time to qualify. The following day, the second exam began. Each team was each given either a Heaven or Earth scroll and were required to obtain the missing scroll and bring them to the main building of the
Demon Desert
 within three days.
 As Neji's team began searching for enemies, they were soon encountered by a
Suna-nin team
.
Sen
 removed a genjutsu, revealing to Tenten's team that they were standing in quicksand and were dragged into Sand Waterfall Pit. After managing to escape the pit, they found Team Shira and saved them from their treacherous fellow Suna-nin. As Neji asked why they attacked Shira's team at all, it was explained that they had no respect for Shira as a ninja since he held no skill in ninjutsu nor genjutsu.

Recognising Shira's similar struggles, Lee angrily went after the other Suna-nin. Tenten and Shira's teams soon caught up with the overzealous Lee and saved him from the Suna-nin's group assault.
 After the other Suna-nin left, Lee challenged Shira, which the latter happily accepts. Tenten was amazed at how equal the two fought. When the two taijutsu fighters began going all-out, Lee with five of the Eight Gates and Shira using his self-created
Seven Heavens Breathing Method
, the fight was ultimately called off.






Tenten and Ajisai trapped together.



On the third day of the exam, Tenten's team ran into a team of
Ame kunoichi
. After a small skirmish, the enemies retreated, deciding that Team Guy was not the target they sought from their chakra levels. Despite this, Tenten's team pursued the Ame-nin into an old ruins. As the battle continued, the ground collapsed, swallowing Tenten and
Ajisai
. After Tenten awoke, she went to check on the seemingly unconscious Ajisai.
 After casually telling the enemy kunoichi to put her weapon away, realising she was ready to attack, Tenten convinced Ajisai to a truce. Despite this, Ajisai showed an obvious resentment to the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 for not understanding the struggles of smaller villages. Ultimately, they were able to escape their cave-in when Tenten unsealed a vast amount of water to forcibly wash away the rubble. Once on the surface and reunited with their respective teammates, the two teams parted peacefully.






Tenten and Neji about to rescue Gaara and Fū.



Later, Team Guy was caught in a massive sandstorm. Tenten summoned a protective dome for them to wait out the storm.
 After the storm cleared, they spotted
Matsuri
, who begged for them to help save Gaara. They learned there that
Fū
 is there too but that the Suna-nin
Hōichi
 was attempting to
extract
 their respective tailed beasts. Working alongside Fū's teammates, Tenten provided Neji with a chakra blade to break through Fū's
Cocoon
 as means to hold the extractions.

Later, despite lacking a matching set of scrolls, Tenten's team decided to finish the exam and head to the main building. There, it was learned that the Chūnin Exams ended early due to controversy happening in the second exam. Instead, it was decided that a report on each participant would be sent to their respective village leader for them to decide any promotions. Upon returning to the village, Tsunade decided to promote Tenten and Lee chūnin plus Neji to jōnin per Gaara's recommendation.

Part II

Kazekage Rescue Mission

Main article:
Kazekage Rescue Mission






Team Guy attacking Kisame.



Team Guy was assigned by Tsunade as back-up to assist
Team 7
 in rescuing Gaara after he was captured by the Akatsuki. While on route they met up with
Pakkun
 who redirected them to Team Kakashi's destination: an Akatsuki hideout where Gaara was being held. Not long after, they were intercepted by the Akatsuki member
Kisame Hoshigaki
. Team Guy attacked him, with Tenten using a spiked kunai bomb, but Kisame blocked the weapon with his sword and retreated under water to avoid the explosive damage. After an ongoing battle and finding Guy's students to be a problem and preferred to fight Guy alone, Kisame created three
water clones
 that trapped Tenten, Neji, and Lee in
water prisons
 to prevent their interference. After Neji broke himself and Lee out, Lee immediately attacked and defeated the water clone trapping Tenten, setting her free before suffocating. After being freed she watched on as Guy defeated Kisame. Afterwards she along with the rest of the team examined Kisame's body only to find
someone
 in his place. Realising they were being stalled Pakkun led them off towards Team 7.






Tenten defeats her doppelgänger.



When they convened with Team Kakashi, Team Guy was tasked with bringing down the
barrier
 blocking the entrance to the Akatsuki lair. Once they found the seals thanks to Neji's Byakugan, they simultaneously took them off, succeeding in removing the barrier but in the process were immediately ambushed by
copies of themselves
. Tenten fought hers but, unlike her copy, had only a finite amount of energy and thus started to get tired. Lee communicated to her and the rest of the team a solution: to become stronger than they had been when the copies had been created. Tenten pushed herself beyond her limits, raining dozens of different weapons down on her double, defeating it.






Team Guy confronts Deidara.



With their battles won, Team Guy went to meet up with Team 7 again. After Neji used his
Byakugan
 to locate
Deidara
 they snuck up behind him in time to block his escape. Deidara realised he was outnumbered, so he tried to retreat. As her team attacked she unrolled her scroll and launched several weapons at Deidara though he managed to avoid her attacks. With Team Guy on Deidara's tail, they cornered him, leading him to make a
exploding clone
, resulting in almost killing both teams were it not for
Kakashi
's
intervention
. After Gaara was rescued and their mission completed, both teams accompanied him back into the
village
 and later paid their respects at Chiyo's grave. Soon after Team Guy and Team 7 left for Konoha..

 by
Kigiri
. Though ready to help Lee, Tenten is stopped by
Yamato
, as he didn't want her to mistakenly hit Lee in the smoke. After Lee escapes the smoke, Tenten uses the Twin Rising Dragons and temporarily immobilises the enemies with explosions caused by attached explosive tags on kunai. Ultimately, her team manages to defeat Guren's men.






Tenten and Lee are confronted by Guren.



When
Guren
 personally made an attempt at disrupting the sealing of the Three-Tails, Tenten and Lee arrived in time to foul her plans for some time, but ultimately the sealing is disrupted. After recuperating, they are confronted by Guren's men and battle once again. However, due to Guren's men now being empowered by
Orochimaru's Juinjutsu
, Tenten and her team are easily defeated. Ultimately, the task to seal the beast failed again, and thus they are recalled back to the village.

She also stood up for Ino, shouting at Kiba, telling him not to talk to her like that. When Naruto came back to the village along with Sakura, he insisted that dealing with Sasuke be left to him. Tenten got angry and told him that this should not be something he undertakes on his own, and that none of them would just stand by and watch. Despite this, Naruto firmly stated that he would be the one to handle Sasuke, and that he'd tell them everything when the time came, as he walked off to Ichiraku, leaving Tenten and some of the others in mixed emotions.

Later, Tenten returned to Konoha. As she was in charge of the weapons supply room for preparations of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, she decided to round up all the Konoha girls to a Barbecue dinner so that their minds would be taken off from all the stress, and have a night surrounded by friends before the war started. Hinata, Sakura, Ino,

.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Main article:
Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Tenten part of the First Division alongside Chōza.



When the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 begins, she was placed in the
First Division
 with
Chōza Akimichi
 and
Hiashi Hyūga
. The First Division was sent to the border of the Land of Lightning to defend against an approaching portion of the
White Zetsu Army
. In the anime, Chōza told Tenten not to worry, because they had
Shikaku
, the best strategist around, and to have faith in her comrades. Reassured, with a smile Tenten agreed.

With the White Zetsu Army approaching, Tenten was overwhelmed by the amount of them as she stood alongside Choza and Hiashi. After
Darui
's
initial assault
 on the approaching enemy forces, Tenten shouted that she wouldn't let any of the enemy to pass, as she jumped into battle and launched a barrage of projectile weapons filled with kunai and shuriken at several of the opponents that hit on point. Tenten was later seen on the sidelines devastated and shocked that one guy could be doing the massive damage that was being caused by
Kinkaku
, whom was transformed as a Jinchuriki. Shortly after,
Shikamaru
, Ino, and
Chōji
 came as reinforcements. Tenten was seen aiding the alliance by launching a barrage of kunai from her scroll towards Kinkaku to help aid the Ino-Shika-Cho team to defeat the enemy by sealing it in the treasured tool,
Kohaku no Jōhei
.






Tenten attacks Kakuzu's lightning mask with the Bashōsen.



After the First Division defeated Kinkaku and
Ginkaku
, she found the lost
Bashōsen
 on the chaotic battlefield. She was eventually drawn into battle with
Kakuzu
's lightning mask and destroyed it with the Bashōsen using the wind element.
 She commented to herself that the Treasured Tool she had in possession was sweet, but that it took up a lot of chakra. This did not stop her from keeping on fighting, so she ran to find new enemies to defeat. In the anime, she's also able to take down Kakuzu's wind mask with the Bashōsen, using the fire element by sending a huge wave of fire.

Tenten was later seen collapsing on the ground, exhausted from using one of the
Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths
, having barely enough chakra to live. A fellow Konoha shinobi healed her, and told her not to touch the fan again, or it might kill her much to her dismay since she had great proficiency with the tool. After being healed later when night time hit the alliance, Tenten was seen to be pulling on Ino as she walked behind her, begging to get the Bashōsen back. After it was time to get back on track, she joined up with
Team Asuma
, aiding them in devising a strategy, though she was left despaired for not being allowed to use the Bashōsen despite her proficiency with the Treasured Tool.

 were fighting the "
masked Madara
" Tenten and the rest of the
Konoha 11
 rushed to their aid as fast as they could. As she ran alongside Ino, she worries about Guy and whether or not he was all-right and protecting Naruto. Allaying her fears, she noted that since Kakashi was there as well, everything would be fine. Later, Tenten arrived with her division which was announced by Darui, she stood alongside the remainder of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 as they prepared to face their opposition by trapping the
Ten-Tails
 which turned out to be a failure. The Ten-Tails later began its move.

After facing several attacks from the Ten-Tails, Tenten later learned of Neji's death, and appeared with Guy and Lee beside Neji's corpse with Naruto and Hinata gathering along with them. As she tried to console a weeping Lee which didn't seem to be working.

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki

Main article:
Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki

Having received chakra from Naruto, Tenten and the other members of the Alliance charged towards the Uchiha and the Ten-Tails. With the situation later turning grim as the Alliance was
trapped
 in a barrier with a
Tailed Beast Ball
-firing tree, Tenten and the other shinobi soon found themselves shrouded in the previous Version 1 mantles again which Naruto gave out again. She and the others subsequently found themselves on the outside of the barrier, escaping the near-fatal attack thanks to Naruto and Minato's
action
. The Ten-Tails transformed into its final form, the God Tree, and ravaged the Alliance. Tenten was able to escape its chakra absorbing attacks. Later on the five Kage returned to the battlefield, and charged towards the God Tree along with the rest of the Shinobi Alliance. As everyone got ready to charge, Guy, Lee and Tenten were shown to be standing together by one another, with Guy stating that their youth is limitless, with Lee and Tenten agreeing to their sensei, and getting ready to jump into battle. After Tsunade and Sakura summoned one tenth of Katsuyu's body and started healing the alliance, Tenten and her team were seen, with Guy and Lee jumping in the healing gue produced by Katsuyu. Tenten then got irritated and told the pair that if they knew what was going on, then they should get going.






Tenten and her comrades using Naruto's Rasengan to attack Obito.



When Naruto later contacted his comrades telepathically, Tenten and Lee both sensed Naruto calling them and went without hesitation. They both mobilised together with the others by jumping down to the main battle inside the Susanoo, and are shocked when Tailed Beast Mode mantles surround them upon entering Kurama's tail and as well as by being given massive
Rasengan
. Carrying out the plan spot on, Tenten and the rest of the
Konoha 11
 break through Obito's defences using the Rasengan Naruto had created giving him and Sasuke the opportunity to attack Obito directly with landing a final blow. Tenten and her comrades later assisted Naruto with wresting control of all the tailed beasts' chakra from Obito's control in order to stop the holy tree from blooming and succeed.

Tenten regrouped with Guy and Lee. A weakened Guy went on about the power of youth, which Tenten commented if only his body kept up with his heart. Then the team saw Gaara, Sakura, and a dying Naruto fly over them from above with Gaara's sand, and wonder what is going on in the place they were headed to. She is soon exasperated with the pair as Guy is determined to still fight and head over to Kakashi's location, even though severely exhausted and Lee, adamant to follow his sensei to the letter. As she asked why Neji had to leave her alone with these two extreme characters, referring to them as bone-heads, Guy and Lee are struck down by the falling Kohaku no Jōhei and
Benihisago
 that was discarded by
Madara
. This caused Tenten to fall over as well due to the impact. After she regained her conciseness, Tenten asked weather Guy and Lee were alright or not, she then recognised the Treasured Tools after Madara had expelled them from within him, leaving her in shock to their reappearance. Guy went on ahead to where the main battle was occurring later on followed by Lee. When Lee saved his sensei, Guy asked where Tenten was. The chaotic tremors later felt across the battlefield caused Tenten to fall over and drop her scroll, which was shown to be unrolled with the two treasured tools exposed. As she slowly started getting up, she noted that she needed to ask someone from the
Kumogakure
 to tell her the Treasured Tools work. The scroll is then pierced by a piece of Madara's discarded forehead protector which left her in shock.






Tenten falls victim to the Infinite Tsukuyomi.



Later, when Madara Uchiha finally succeeded with the activation of the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
, much like the rest of the world, she too was caught by the roots of the God Tree and fell under the genjutsu's power. Inside the genjutsu, Tenten dreamed of Guy and Lee acting more mature and "cool" as well as wearing mature clothing, proudly speaking about it with a still-alive Neji. In the anime, her possession of the Six Path Sage's tools appeared to have caused a unique affect to Tenten's illusion, allowing her to retain her memories of the war. Finding herself seemingly back in Konoha, she was shocked at how different all her friends and allies were acting, including Naruto being known as "
Menma
". Concluding that she was stuck in a very elaborate genjutsu she attempted to dispel it but to no avail. Ultimately, she decided to avoid conversing with any of her friends, believing they may in fact be agents of Madara.

After failing to get help from Kurenai, who in this world was only an avid fan of genjutsu but lacked the talent to perform it, she was approached by a travelling merchant, who said there was a shinobi in
Amegakure
 with advanced genjutsu prowess who could help her. Accepting his map to Amegakure, Tenten decided to leave without asking for approval. This lead to her being captured and branded a traitor as the map was revealed to have secret information on Konoha concealed. While locked up, Neji and Lee secretly met with Tenten, promising to prove her innocence. Later, the village was attacked by Amegakure. As Tenten watched in horror, Menma came and save her.

Deciding to help, Tenten joined Menma in fighting off the Ame-nin, using the two Six Paths Sage tools. After the enemies were defeated, Tenten was applauded by all, convincing her that she belonged there.

Tenten freed from the Infinite Tsukuyomi.



After Naruto was able to defeat and reform Sasuke, Tenten along with the rest of the Shinobi Alliance were released from the Infinite Tsukuyomi. Tenten then went to where Darui was, and unsealed the Benihisago from her scroll that she sealed two of the Treasured Tools in which Madara discarded earlier. After giving the treasured tool to
Darui
, he released the captured Kumo-nin:
Samui
 and
Atsui
 from it as well as showing her how to wield it for future use. She later attended Neji's funeral along with the rest of the Konohagakure shinobi.

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Tenten

The name "Tenten" literally means "heaven, heaven" (
天天
). Written as 点点, it can also mean "little by little", "this and that", "here and there" or "dot" in Japanese. Written as 転転, it means "roll", relating to her shop. It is also a possibility that her name insinuates "ten out of ten", as a reference to her
marksmanship
 or one of the names for a Japanese ellipsis meaning "mark-mark", referring to her use of targets with
bukijutsu
.

Tenten has slowly been improving her ranking in the Naruto character popularity polls. She placed 24th in the first and fifth, 30th in the second, 29th in the third and ninth and most recent poll, 22nd in the third and 15th in the seventh. That is her highest rank in all of the polls. She is not in the top 30 in the eighth poll.

In an interview, Kishimoto said he preferred Tenten out of the four
Konoha 11
 girls because he liked her design.
[

Like the rest of her team, Tenten's character seems to draw inspiration from Chinese culture as seen from her attire and hairstyle, the Chinese style Chignon and Odango.

According to the databook(s):

Her hobby is
fortune-telling
.

Tenten would like to have a rematch with
Temari
, and she would also like to fight
Tsunade
's apprentice,
Sakura Haruno
.

Her favourite foods are
Sesame dumplings
 and
Chinese food
, while her least favourite are pickled plums.

Tenten's favourite phrase is "A hundred shots, a hundred bull's-eyes" (
百発百中
,
Hyappatsu Hyakuchū
), an idiom for "always hitting the bulls-eye".

Tenten has completed 62 official missions in total: 28 D-rank, 23 C-rank, 3 B-rank, 7 A-rank, 1 S-rank.

Tenten loves to investigate.

Tenten and Neji have the same theme in the anime, but Tenten's has a slower beat.

In original colour illustrations of the manga, Tenten's costume is blue. This is changed to pink in the anime and later manga images.

In the
omake
 for episode
209
, her name is written in Chinese: 天天.

On the back of
Hyō no Sho
, her hair colour is black rather then brown.

In the
Road to Boruto
 downloadable content for
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
, Tenten is a
jōnin
.

Quotes

(To
Neji
 about
Ino
 and
Sakura
 fighting) "
It's not because they're girls you know, Neji. It's just that those two are using kid gloves. It doesn't matter if you're a man or woman in battle.
"

(To
Naruto
 about Ranmaru) "
I can't stand weak and indecisive people!
"

(To
Ranmaru
) "
I won't let that happen. No way you're not getting off that easy! The people you and Raiga killed, they all wanted to live but you didn't leave them that choice! You decided for them! Well you don't get to decide this time, okay?! You're gonna live and you're going to take some responsibility for all those people's lives you cut short!
"

(To Naruto) "
You're gonna fight Sasuke alone? And you think all of us are just gonna stand here and let you?!
"

(To Naruto) "
Three members of Team Guy specialise in close-contact battles so I often render aid from the distance. I don't mind providing back up, but I was hoping to find new ninja tools that would enable me to fight on the front lines.
"

(About
Iō
's weapons) "
Amazing… The brilliance of the blade… the design. They're all beautiful! I want to take them all home!
"

(To
Guy
) "
I want to be a great and powerful ninja! To walk in the footsteps of the legendary kunoichi, Tsunade!
"

(About
Lee
) "
Lee! You never give up, no matter what! And because you always go for it, I tell myself not to lose to you and I'm able to give it my all too.
"

(To herself) "
I no longer wish to be like Lady Tsunade anymore. But I haven't given up my dream to become a legendary kunoichi.
"
