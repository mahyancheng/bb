" (

,
Shutsugeki! Tenten-Han
) is episode 184 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

After
Pain's Assault
,
Neji
 and
Tenten
 are sent to the
Konoha Ninja Tool Research Facility: Detached Office
 in order to procure more weapons; Tenten reminisces on the last time she came to the facility.

Due to the weakened military power following the
Konoha Crush
,
Team Guy
 (with
Naruto
 filling in for the injured
Rock Lee
) was deployed to a weapon maker named
Iō
 to retrieve a thousand
shuriken
 and a thousand
kunai
. Instead of giving them the weapons, he showed them useless weapons he made. While out on a snack, Team Guy, under Tenten's command, returned to find Iō missing. They find out that he is hidden behind a wall with traps inside. Tenten managed to defeat all of the obstacles and she found a room full of Iō's greatest weapons. Meanwhile, two thugs,
Gameru
 and
Kusune
, have come to take all of Iō's weapons. They are wielding
Dakō
 and
Tsurukame
, two of Iō's prototype weapons, and with them they easily overpower Naruto and Neji. However, Tenten was able to beat them using Iō's latest weapon,
Jidanda
. After the battle, Tenten asked to keep Jidanda, only to be refused by Iō, who wished to improve upon it.

Neji snaps Tenten out of her flashback as the two cross the bridge towards the research facility, with Tenten wondering whether Iō had perfected the Jidanda.
