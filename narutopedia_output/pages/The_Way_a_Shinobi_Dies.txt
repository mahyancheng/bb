Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Kisame
 bites his own tongue in order to force himself back to consciousness and prevent
Aoba Yamashiro
 from obtaining any information about the
Akatsuki
 from him. He then creates a dome of water around himself preventing
Guy
 from attacking him and summons three sharks within it. He then remembers his first meeting with
Itachi
 and considering Itachi's words, makes his own sharks consume him before
Yamato
 has a chance to stop him. Watching Kisame sacrifice his life,
Naruto
 comments that there are those within the Akatsuki who act to protect their friends. Then Guy says that Kisame lived and died as a true shinobi should and that he will always remember him. Guy then retrieves a scroll filled with information that Kisame had collected and
Motoi
 suggests they take a look at it but when they open the scroll, it turns out to be booby trapped and a dome of water surrounds them while a shark takes the scroll and runs away with it. Meanwhile, Tobi and Konan are shown confronting each other in
Amegakure
 where Tobi asks
Konan
 where she's hidden
Nagato
 and the
Rinnegan
 to which she replies that she knew he would come and that she's been waiting to finish him off. Tobi replies by saying that he will not go easy on her just because she was a former Akatsuki member.

Trivia

In Kisame's flashback, when Itachi gets up he doesn't have a scratch on his forehead protector.
