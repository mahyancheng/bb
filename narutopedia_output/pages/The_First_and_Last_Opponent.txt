"
The First and Last Opponent
" (
最初の敵、最後の敵
,
Saisho no Teki, Saigo no Teki
) is episode 266 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Suigetsu
 and
Jūgo
 escape from their imprisonment within the
Land of Iron
 due to weakened security, caused by the mobilisation of forces for the
war
. While searching for his
sword
, Suigetsu educates Jūgo on the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
, including previous generation of members and their swords. Meanwhile, the
Third Division
 battles the reincarnated swordsmen, and
Kakashi
 formulates a plan that employs
Santa Yamanaka
,
Ensui Nara
, and
Maki
 from his division. Launching the plan of action, Kakashi nearly hits
Zabuza
, but his attack is intercepted by
Haku
, who uses himself as a shield. Zabuza cuts through Haku to get to Kakashi, but he is able to narrowly avoid the full force of Zabuza's attack and suffers only a minor wound on his abdomen. After Haku is trapped and sealed, Kakashi attacks once again and he and Zabuza strike simultaneously, but this time Kakashi manages to evade the great blade and pierce Zabuza. Zabuza and Haku are then captured and restrained. With Zabuza's and Haku's defeat, Kakashi commands the Kubikiribōchō and declares that he is going to unleash Hell on the enemy forces. Elsewhere, the
Second Division
 continues to fight the
White Zetsu Army
 clones, and
Kitsuchi
 is informed that thousands of the enemy forces had passed them underground—where the current enemy had erupted from. On another battlefield,
Gaara

discovers
 one of the
enemy
 reincarnated shinobi.

Trivia

After the Seven Ninja Swordsmen are hit by the combined jutsu in the beginning of the episode, Zabuza's Kubikiribocho is completely restored for a few frames, when it should have still been broken.

In this episode even though Kakashi and Santa had switched bodies, when Santa sensed Zabuza and released the technique, he did so from his own body instead of Kakashi's.
