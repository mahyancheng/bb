Lyrics

Rōmaji

Rasen kaidan no yōna hibi ni mayotte

Nando jibun o miushinattadarou

Deai to wakare wa futto shita shunkan de

Soshite eien ni mo natte yuku?

Akogareno kage wa tōku yami no naka

Kono mama-kaze no naka oitsukenai no ka na

Tatoe It's all in the game! Hikare bokura seishun!

Me no mae no mugen no michi no kanōsei o shinjite

Itsuka kimi to mita yūhi wa kittowasurenai

Ugoku sekai o darenimo

Tomerarenai Time of my Life

Even if it's all in the game﻿!

Kanji

螺旋階段のような日々に迷って

何度　自分を見失っただろう

出会いと別れは　ふっとした瞬間で

そして永遠にもなってゆく

憧れの影は　遠く闇の中

このまま風の中　追いつけないのかな

たとえ It's all in the game! 光れ僕ら青春

目の前の無限の未知の可能性を信じて

いつか君と見た夕陽はきっと忘れない

動く世界を　誰にも

止められない　Time of my Life

Even if it's all in the game﻿!

Rōmaji (Full Version)

Rasen kaidan no you na hibi ni mayotte

Nando jibun wo miushinatta darou

Deai to wakare wa futto shita shunkan de

Soshite eien ni mo natte yuku

Akogare no kage wa

Tooku yami no naka

Kono mama kaze no naka

Oitsukenai no ka na

Tatoe It’s all in the game hikare bokura seishun

Me no mae no mugen no michi no kanousei wo shinjite

Itsuka kimi to mita yuuhi wa kitto wasurenai

Ugoku sekai wo dare ni mo

Tomerarenai Time of my Life

Even if it’s all in the game

Ikidomari bakari no kousaten no mukai de

Tada kimi wo mite ita

Atarimae no yokogao wa kono shunkan no mono dakara

Minogashite wa ikenain da

Hontou no tsuyosa to wa ittai, nan na no ka?

Kimi no jidai wo kaetai

Kakko yoku naranakya

Tatoe It’s all in the game hikare bokura seishun

Sono mune ni kakeru mikansei no hashi no ue

Aketa mado no mukou kimi ga inai to setsunai

Ugoku riaru wa dare demo kaete yukeru

Next Generations

Even if it’s all in the game

Sou da dareka ga itte ita

“Kono yo wa subarashii tatakau kachi ga aru” to

Hoshi no kazu dake mirai ga aru nara

Bokura doko ni yuku no darou

Tatoe It’s all in the game hikare bokura seishun

Me no mae no mugen no michi no kanousei wo shinjite

Futari kiri aruita umi no iro no you na ao de

Ugoku kodou wa dare ni mo

Tomerarenai Time of my Life

Even if it’s all in the game

English (Full Version)

Like a spiral staircase I'm losing my way in everyday life

I've lost sight of myself many times,right?

An encounter and departure happened in a sudden moment,

And it might become an eternity

The shadow of yearning is

Far within the darkness

This way,I might not even

Be able to keep up with the wind

Even if it's all in the game shine on us and our youth

I believe in the infinite ways in front of me,who have potention

I won't forget the evening son I saw together with you

In the moving world no one can

Stop this time of my life

Even if it's all in the game

Facing a crossroad of only dead ends

I only looked at you

Your natural face is the thing of the moment after all

I can't overlook you

What even is real strength?

I want to change your time

I want to make it look cool

Even if it's all in the game shine on us and our youth

In the chest you're standing in an incomplete bridgh

On the other side of the window you aren't there and it's sad

The moving real will change everyone

Next Generations

Even if it's all in the game

Yes,someone said it

This world is wonderful,it's worth to fight

If there's only a future for the number of stars

Where will we go again?

Even if it's all in the game shine on us and our youth

I believe in the infinite ways in front of me,who have potention

I won't forget the evening son I saw together with you

This moving beat is unstoppable by anybody

It's the time of my life

Even if it's all in the game
