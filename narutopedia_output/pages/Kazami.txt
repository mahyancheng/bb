Interlude

In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths

Kazami and his team took part in the joint
Chūnin Exams
 held by Konohagakure and
Sunagakure
. Once entering the exams, Kazami and his teammates were randomly split into different rooms to take the written test, with him being placed in room 3. On a monitor,
Shikamaru Nara
 as the first exam proctor explained the goal of the first exam.
 His team ultimately passed the first round since their combined scored equalled 100 points as it was supposed to, and by leaving the bonus question unanswered. However, a preliminary round had to be issued to lessen the many participants there were. The preliminary round involved a race to Sunagakure where only the first 30 teams to arrive at the destination would qualify for the second phase.
 Ultimately, his team were among the first 30 teams to make it. During dinner, when his teammate was harmed, he was outraged and went to his defence. Soon enough a brawl was stirred up between the genin in the room. It eventually settled thanks to the convenience of
Fū
, who's cheerful personality caused everyone to lose their desire to fight. The next day,
Temari
 as the proctor of the second exam, announced the start of the second round being taken within
Demon Desert
.






Kazami fighting Hinata.



By the second day of the exam, Kazami's team had collected three other Heaven scrolls while hunting down a team that had an Earth Scroll. Ultimately, they engage
Team Kurenai
, with him confronting
Hinata Hyūga
. After a heated struggle, his team discover that
Kiba Inuzuka
 had the Earth scroll and they drew their attention to him. Together they took the scroll from him. Muyami then summoned his giant mole
Moguranmaru
 and they went on him, travelling underground. Team Kurenai began pursuing Kazami's team, ultimately leading the Konoha-nin into a quicksand pit.

Burami soon realised with his nose that Team Kurenai survived and returned to following Kazami and his team's trail. Burami decided to use his
odour masking technique
 to give their enemies the slip. As it soon proved not effective enough, Kazami's team decided to return and finish their enemies off. After ambushing them and soundly thrashing Team Kurenai, Kazami's team were shocked to learn that they were deceived, misdirected by the enemies'
clones
. As they asked Team Kurenai how they did this, the Konoha-nin explained that they used
Shino
's
insects
 to coat their bodies and mask their scents. While still not understanding how Team Kurenai found Kazami's team with their own scents still masked as well, Kiba explained that the lingering scent on his clothes of Burami allowed them to continue pursuing. After another heated skirmish with Team Kurenai, his team was overpowered, and he and his teammates were finished off by Kiba's
Three-Headed Wolf technique
, allowing Team Kurenai to claim both a Heaven and Earth scroll.

Trivia

Kazami looks very similar to the character represented in
Naruto Orichara
 of the
45th volume
 named Rīzen Toshio.
