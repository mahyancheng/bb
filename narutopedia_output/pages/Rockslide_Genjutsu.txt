This technique casts an illusion on multiple targets, making them perceive multiple large explosions going off. From this, the victims will see the ground around them collapsing, disorienting them and leave them confused and  panicked. This technique does not appear to be very powerful as an individual can negate it themselves and all others around them without direct contact on the fellow victims.
