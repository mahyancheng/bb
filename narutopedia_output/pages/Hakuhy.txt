Hakuhyō
 (
薄氷
) was the son of
Kahyō
. His death instigated the formation of the
Ryūha Armament Alliance
.

Background

At some point in time, Hakuhyō and his mother, Kahyō, left Kirigakure in the hope that Hakuhyō would not suffer because of how he was born and be corrupted by the village's dark practices. They would come to settle in the
Land of Waves
 and enjoyed happiness for a time. During an attempt to protect his friend from hornets using his
Ice Release
, Hakuhyō was stung. Despite saving his friend from the hornets, Hakuhyō's friend abandoned him, not wanting to have anything to do with someone who had
weird powers
. In an attempt to save her son, Kahyō went to seek doctors, only to find that there were none available due to them being hired by the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. As a result, Hakuhyō succumbed to his injuries.

Personality

Hakuhyō was very protective and loyal towards his friend, protecting him with his life. Even nearly before dying, he still continued to murmur warnings and advises to him, not realising that his friend abandoned him long ago.

Abilities

He had the kekkei genkai Ice Release, which he could create combining water with wind nature transformation. Although nobody taught him, he could use the
Ice Sword Technique
, using it to fight a swarm of hornets.

Trivia
