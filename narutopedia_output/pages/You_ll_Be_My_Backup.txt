"
You'll Be My Backup
" (
お前はバックアップだ
,
Omae wa Bakkuappu da
) is episode 417 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

After being attacked by the two traitorous escortees,
Minato
 and
Obito
 arrive to back up
Rin
 and
Kakashi
, but one of the two traitors escapes. The last escortee asks Minato to ensure that the
scroll
 is real, as two of them were given scrolls. It is discovered that the scroll was a fake and the other escortee that fell had the other scroll. Obito immediately leaves to save the escortee and the others reluctantly follow. The escortee is found by enemy shinobi and is attacked; however, Obito and Kakashi arrive in time to save him.
 In the midst of the struggle, one of the pursuers grabs the scroll and they retreat. Kakashi leaves, claiming that completing the mission is his
nindō
. He goes after the group and attacks them. Obito sends a signal to Minato and tells him of Kakashi's actions, who arrives just in time to save Kakashi and defeats the entire group.
Team Minato
 returns the scroll and completes the mission. However, it is discovered that their team was sent as a decoy and that both scrolls were fake. Another group was charged with delivering the scroll to ensure it wouldn't be stolen by enemy ninja. In the present, Madara launches
two orbs
 at Obito and Kakashi to get the
Rinnegan
 and the Yin-half of
Kurama
. Obito — with Kakashi's help —
transports
 himself to the
other dimension
. After convincing
Sakura
 of his changed nature, Obito begins
transferring
 the tailed beasts' chakra to Naruto. In the real world,
Guy
 arrives in the nick of time, saving Kakashi from Madara's attack.

Trivia

An inconsistency occurs when Kakashi utilises his
Chidori
 within the flashback. Team Minato did not canonically have knowledge of this technique until their mission to destroy the
Kannabi Bridge
.
