 escorting
Temari
 from the village, the two working together in anticipation of the next
Chūnin Exams
. They inform Naruto that he is the only member of their group to still be a
genin
, everyone else now either a
chūnin
 or, in some cases, a
jōnin

 has become the Fifth
Kazekage
. In
Sunagakure
, Gaara has a meeting with the village's council as they discuss rumours of an impeding

Yūra

Sasori
 and
Deidara
 passage. Sasori is glad to see Yūra has remained a loyal sleeper agent, and Deidara prepares to capture Gaara for the
tailed beast
 sealed within him.
