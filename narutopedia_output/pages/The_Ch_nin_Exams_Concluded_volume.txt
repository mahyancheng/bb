The Chūnin Exams, Concluded…!!
 (
中忍試験、終了…!!
,
Chūnin Shiken, Shūryō…!!
,
Viz:
 The Chûnin Exam, Concluded…!!) is volume 13 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 109

"
Tree Leaves, Dancing…!!
" (
木の葉、舞い…!!
,
Konoha, Mai…!!
)

Naruto
 leaps into the arena to ask
Shikamaru
 why he would forfeit a match he was clearly winning. The observing veteran ninja recognise that Shikamaru was fully aware of his abilities and was not willing to claim victory just to risk his safety in a later match, the true mark of a
chūnin
.
Lee
 and
Guy
 arrive at the stadium to watch the finals, but are surprised to learn that
Neji
 was defeated by Naruto. Lee is happy for Naruto. With all of the other first-round final matches done, the audience wonders if the remaining match between
Sasuke
 and
Gaara
 will occur. Sasuke arrives with
Kakashi
 at the last moment, allowing the match to proceed.

Chapter 110

"
At Last…!!
" (
いよいよ…!!
,
Iyoiyo…!!
)

The audience is glad to finally see
Sasuke
.
Naruto
 warns him not to lose if they are to fight each other before leaving the arena with
Shikamaru
.
Lee
, seeing that Sasuke will get to fight
Gaara
 and that Naruto got to fight
Neji
, feels jealous that they get to continue their lives as ninja. Gaara walks down to the arena but kills two
Kusagakure
 ninja along the way. Seeing what he has done and knowing he would have killed them if he had come across them first, Naruto and Shikamaru are paralysed with fear as Gaara quietly walks past them.

Chapter 111

"
Sasuke vs. Gaara!!
" (
サスケVS我愛羅!!
,
Sasuke Bāsasu Gaara!!
)

As the fight between
Sasuke
 and
Gaara
 commences,
Kakashi
 apologises to
Sakura
 for worrying her by being late. He then remarks to
Guy
 about the
Anbu
 presence in the stadium,
Konoha
 not knowing how or when they will be attacked.
Naruto
, knowing how dangerous Gaara is, realises that the only person who can currently satisfy his blood-lust is Sasuke. At the same moment, Sasuke begins attacking Gaara fast enough to bypass his
Shield of Sand
, oddly reminiscent of
Lee
's fighting style.

Chapter 112

"
Sasuke's Taijutsu…!!
" (
サスケの体術…!!
,
Sasuke no Taijutsu…!!
)

Kakashi
 explains that, having seen
Lee
's fighting style before with his
Sharingan
,
Sasuke
 has been training this last month to reproduce his speed. Lee knows from prior experience that speed is not enough to defeat
Gaara
, but
Guy
 recognises that the speed must serve some other purpose. After he continues to be pummelled by Sasuke, Gaara retreats into a
Shield of Sand
, which he shaped into a sphere, to give himself time to prepare. Sasuke is unable to break through this defence with speed alone.
Naruto
, worried that Sasuke will be killed, races to the arena to try and stop the match. Kakashi promises that there was a good reason for why they were late.

Chapter 113

"
The Reason He was Late…!!
" (
遅刻の理由…!!
,
Chikoku no Riyū…!!
)

Sealed within his
Shield of Sand
,
Gaara
 prepares for how he will kill
Sasuke
. Still unable to pierce it, Sasuke falls back to prepare his own attack.
Naruto
 pleads with
Kakashi
 to end the match, but Kakashi merely tells him to watch. Sasuke readies the
Chidori
, Kakashi's signature technique that he spent that last month teaching to Sasuke. Combining the Chidori's piercing potential with the speed mimicked from
Lee
, Sasuke charges at Gaara and breaks through the sphere, surprising all observers.

Chapter 114

"
Assault…!!
" (
強襲…!!
,
Kyōshū…!!
)

Not only did
Sasuke
's
Chidori
 pierce the
Shield of Sand
, but it also managed to damage
Gaara
. This being the first time he has ever been injured, Gaara is distraught and ends the transformation he was working towards midway.
Naruto
, despite having worried for Sasuke's safety moments earlier, is suddenly envious. Since Gaara's injury has ruined their original plans, the
Suna
 and
Oto
 try a different approach. A
genjutsu
 is placed over the stadium, putting most of the audience to sleep. The
Fourth Kazekage
 attacks the
Third Hokage
, beginning the
Konoha Crush
.

Chapter 115

Giant snakes
 begin assaulting
Konoha
's borders. In the stadium of the
Chūnin Exams
 finals, the
Anbu
 try to come to the
Third Hokage
's rescue. The
Fourth Kazekage
 takes the Hokage hostage and has the
Sound Four
 seal them in, preventing the Anbu's intervention. The Kazekage removes his disguise, revealing himself as
Orochimaru
, and promises to kill the Hokage, his old master. Meanwhile, the few Konoha ninja in the audience that were able to avoid the sleeping
genjutsu
 prepare to defend the village.
Gaara
 flees with his siblings, and
Sasuke
 follows them to continue the battle they started.

"
Konoha Crush…!!
" (
木ノ葉崩し…!!
,
Konoha Kuzushi…!!

Sunagakure
 ninja begin invading
Konoha

Chūnin Exams
 stadium, the conscious Konoha ninja, despite wishing to try and help the
Third Hokage
 in his fight with
Orochimaru
, engage the few
Otogakure
 ninja that managed to infiltrate the village earlier. Since
Sakura
 is also awake,
Kakashi
 protects her. He instructs her to wake up
Naruto
 and
Shikamaru
 so that can take part in a mission vital to the village. Meanwhile, Orochimaru is elated that he finally has an opportunity to kill the Third Hokage. The two prepare to fight.

" (

 tasks
Sakura
 to pursue
Sasuke
 and stop him from engaging the

 (the latter of whom is only pretending to be asleep) before sending them on their way amidst an ongoing battle between
Konoha
 and
Oto
. The
Third Hokage
 prepares for battle. He attacks and
Orochimaru

summons three coffins
. The Third attempts to stop them, but two of the coffins successfully open.

Author's Note

“

Science fiction movies are on the rise again... Right now they rank at the top of the box office in revenue, so I was thinking to myself, "Wow, everyone must really like sci-fi..." and then I realised I'm one of those people too!
