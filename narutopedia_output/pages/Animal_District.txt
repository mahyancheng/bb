"
Animal District
" (
アニマル番外地
,
Animaru Bangaichi
) is episode 185 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Konoha
 begins its rebuilding process after
Pain's assault
, an ostrich named
Condor
 tells some baby ostriches about how he once had a rival named
Naruto
 who kept trying to prevent his freedom.

After
Team 7
 had
caught
 Condor, he managed to escape and taught himself
ninjutsu
 to protect himself. As a result,
Tsunade
 dispatched a team consisting of Naruto,
Shino
,
Lee
, and team captain
Kotetsu
 to retrieve him from the
Zeroth Training Ground
. When they spotted Condor, Shino attempted to capture him, but his bugs were all eaten by insect-eating plants. After Lee lost to a
boxing kangaroo
 and Kotetsu and Naruto were unable to defeat Condor, the squad decided to retreat. However, they were found by Condor and his team, the
Four Ninja Animal Warriors
, who launched an attack against the
shinobi
.

As
Shino
 dealt with the
anteater
 that ate his insects, Lee battled the boxing kangaroo and its joey. Condor created
shadow clones
 to battle Naruto and his clones, while Kotetsu was beaten by Condor himself. In what he perceived to be his dying moments, Kotetsu thought only of his partner,
Izumo
, and how they dreamt of becoming
jōnin
 together. At that moment, Izumo, who had been upset that Tsunade had not sent him along with Kotetsu, intervened and the two used their
Water Release: Starch Syrup Capturing Field
 in combination with the
Conch Shell Mace
 to defeat Condor and bring him back to Konoha.

As Condor finishes telling his tale to the baby ostriches, he is spotted by Naruto, who asks him if he is trying to escape once more. Calling Naruto an idiot, Condor and the baby ostriches attempt to flee as Naruto chases after them.

Trivia

When Shino's
kikaichū
 are eaten, he appears distressed, even though they only live for a few hours. After being eaten by a
Venus fly trap
, it is revealed that Shino had named each one, despite their short lifespan.
