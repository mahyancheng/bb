Lyrics

Rōmaji

Kidzuite ndaro sō sekai ga kataru itsuwari to

Amai wana ni soko ni wa hontō nante nai koto o

Riyū sagashite run away Why? Sono mewotojiteru no? Tell me why can't you

Shinjitsu ni te o nobase!

Always (sakebe Shout out) All time (tsukame Catch up)

Everybody Knows (We are the seeker Get fire!!!)

Moyase moyase kokoro no honō

Tsuyoku aritai to negau nonaraba

Narase narase mezame no kane o

Koyoi tsuki no shita de kokoro sakebe

Utae utae hoero hoero

Kibō no hikari o nozomu nonaraba

Moyase moyase kokoro no honō

Akai tsuki no shita de kimi o sakebe

Ima ima ima Flame up (Catch the fire)

Ima ima ima Flame up (Blaze up!!!)

Kanji

気付いてんだろ　そう　世界が語る偽りと

甘い罠に　そこには本当なんてない事を

理由探して　run away Why? その目を閉じてるの?　Tell me why can't you

真実に手を伸ばせ！

Always (叫べ　Shout out) All time (掴め　Catch up)

Everybody Knows (We are the seeker Get fire!!!)

燃やせ　燃やせ　心の炎

強くありたいと願うのならば

鳴らせ　鳴らせ目覚めの鐘を

今宵月の下で心叫べ

歌え　歌え　吠えろ　吠えろ

希望の光を望むのならば

燃やせ　燃やせ　心の炎

赤い月の下で君を叫べ

今　いま　イマ　Flame　up (Catch the fire)

今　いま　イマ　Flame　up (Blaze up!!!)

You noticed it, right? Yeah, the world is full of lies and

Sweet traps. Find the reason why

There's no truth. Run away, why? Are you closing your eyes? Tell me why can't you?

Reach out your hand to the truth!

Always (Scream, shout out) All time (Grasp, catch up)

Everybody knows( We are the seeker Get fire!!!)

Let the flame of your heart burn, burn if you want the light of hope

Sing, sing out at loud. Tonight below the moon, our hearts will shout

Flame up Now, Now, Now ( Catch the fire )

Flame up Now, Now, Now (Blaze up!!!)

Stand up, grasp it and shout out your dream to the ends of the skies

Doubts are like clouds; they'll someday change their shape (Blaze up)

Everybody knows( We are the seeker Get fire!!!)

Let the flame of your heart burn, burn if you wish to be strong

Ring, ring the bells of awakening. Even if the world sees you as a hindrance

Sing, sing, howl, howl if you want the light of hope

Let the flame of your heart burn, burn. Below the red moon, I'll shout out to you

Flame up Now, Now, Now ( Catch the fire )

Flame up Now, Now, Now (Blaze up!!!)
