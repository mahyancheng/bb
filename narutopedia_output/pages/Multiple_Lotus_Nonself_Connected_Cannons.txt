While in the second state of their
Sage Transformation
, the user grows more of their jet booster-like appendages, extends them, and then uses them to gather
natural energy
 before releasing it as a powerful chakra blast, covering a wide range. The rate at which the chakra is gathered and released is so fast that escaping the technique is impossible through normal means.

Influence

In Buddhism and other Asian religions, the
lotus flower
 symbolises detachment, because although a lotus is living in water, its leafs do not get wet. In Jūgo's case, his second personality is detached from his normal self. The looks of this technique and the second part of its name make an allusion to
acorn barnacles
, called "fujitsubo" (
フジツボ
) in Japanese. The kanji 不自 literally mean "negative self", once again referring to Jūgo's second personality.
