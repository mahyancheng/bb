In order to help an individual advance their
cursed seal
 to its second level, the
Sound Four
 use the
Four Black Fogs Formation
.
 After the individual and the Black Fogs have been placed within a confined space, such as a coffin,
Sakon
 uses the Dark Sealing Method: he places five talismans, each inscribed with
sealing
 formulas written in his blood, around the coffin's rim. This creates a
barrier
 around the coffin, keeping the Black Fogs contained until the cursed seal's advancement has completed. So long as the barrier is in place, even the
Byakugan
 is unable to see within it.
