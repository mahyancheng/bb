Yang Release
 (
陽遁
,
Yōton
,
Viz:
 Light Style) is a
nature transformation
 that exists outside the five basic elemental natures. Like its counterpart,
Yin Release
, Yang Release is little-explored in the series. Yang Release uses
physical energy
 to control vitality, granting life to forms that have none.
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 combined Yin and Yang into
Yin–Yang Release
, notably allowing him to
create
 the nine
tailed beasts
.

Yang Release has tended to be inherited among the
Senju clan
, descendants of Hagoromo.
Jin no Sho
 notes, however, that certain other clans also employ Yang Release via their
hiden
 skills, notably the
Akimichi clan
, who use Yang Release to increase the size of their own bodies.

There have been occasional miscellaneous mentions of Yang Release:
Minato Namikaze

split
 the
Nine-Tails
' Yin and Yang chakra, sealing its Yang half within
Naruto Uzumaki
 to make him its
jinchūriki
;
 when Naruto uses the Nine-Tails' chakra via his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
, any
wood
 constructs that he is near or that he touches grow into trees;
 Hagoromo's spirit gives his
Six Paths Yang Power
 to Naruto, which takes the form of a sun marking on his right palm.

Trivia

Yang Release shares the same romanisation as
Lava Release
.

During explanations of Yang Release within the series, the manga depicts it as being coloured white and the anime depicts it as being blue.

The word "Yang" appears in the names of
Four Red Yang Formation
 and
Six Red Yang Formation
, though these have not been said to be Yang Release.
