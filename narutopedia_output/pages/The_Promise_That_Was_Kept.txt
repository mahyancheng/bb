"
The Promise That Was Kept
" (
守られた約束
,
Mamorareta Yakusoku
) is episode 387 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Though
Obito
 seemingly reaches his hand out, he instead strangles
Naruto
, claiming he has no regrets for the path he has chosen, much to Naruto's dismay. Frustrated and telling Obito he saw everything he was thinking and to stop imagining himself as Hokage, Naruto breaks free from Obito's grasp and punches him. As Naruto forcibly pulls Obito's hand to his side, the
Uchiha
 is deprived of his powers after the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 succeed in freeing the
tailed beasts
. Lying defeated, Obito looks up to the moon and grieves that he could not fill the hole in his heart. The tailed beasts then thank Naruto for freeing them.
 Meanwhile,
Sasuke
 draws his
blade
 and aims for Obito who lies defeated. Just then,
Kakashi
 arrives from the
other dimension
 and pins Obito while pointing his
kunai
. Kakashi insists Obito is his responsibility and attempts to kill him but is stopped by
Minato
's timely arrival. The Yellow Flash then convinces his pupil and says that Obito has had a change of heart, prompting Kakashi to withdraw his kunai. Elsewhere, Naruto aims to take down
Madara
, creating a
Big Ball Rasenshuriken
 — large enough to illuminate the footsteps of his comrades.
