Torifu Akimichi
 (
秋道トリフ
,
Akimichi Torifu
) was a
jōnin
 of
Konohagakure
's
Akimichi clan
. Along with his teammates,
Kagami Uchiha
 and
Danzō Shimura
, he was a direct subordinate of the
Second Hokage
.

Background

In the anime, shortly after the founding of the village, he was shown to be part of a class alongside
Koharu Utatane
 and
Homura Mitokado
. Later he watched on as
Hiruzen Sarutobi
 and
Danzō Shimura
 were about to spar, along with Koharu and
Kagami Uchiha
.

During the
First Shinobi World War
 he was part of Tobirama's
Escort Unit
. When they were being chased by Kumogakure's
Kinkaku Force
 and Kagami surmised that someone had to lure them away from the rest of the squad Torifu said whoever that person was would essentially be a sacrifice. Along with the rest of his comrades he witnessed Tobirama declare Hiruzen the Third Hokage.
 Him surviving the confrontation against the Kinkaku Force eventually made him a famous shinobi throughout the ninja world.






Torifu and the villagers confront the Nine-Tails.



Decades later he was seen alongside Hiruzen, Homura, and Koharu and other shinobi directly engaging the Nine-Tails after it was
set loose
 on the village.
 When they were finally able to drive the beast outside the village's limits, Hiruzen called for them to continue to attack the beast.

Personality

While much is not known of his personality, it was stated that Torifu prided himself on his physical strength.

Appearance

Torifu had short spiky brown hair and dark markings around his eyes. Like all other member of the Akimichi clan, he had a very robust build and markings on his cheeks - another custom of his clan. In his youth, he wore the standard black suit, a grey breastplate with faulds protecting the sides of his legs, arm guards, a
forehead protector
 modelled to resemble a hat, and a pouch tied to his back with bandages. Several years later during the Nine-Tails' attack on Konoha, Torifu now noticeably older, wore a more modern style of armour with his clan's obligatory kanji for "food" (
食
,
shoku
) on it. He also carried a
bō
 and a shield that was reminiscent of a
sakazuki
.

Abilities

Torifu was a powerful shinobi, well known throughout the ninja world. His physical prowess is remarkably high, a feat he is very proud of.
 Although the full extent of his abilities are unknown, as an Akimichi, Torifu can convert calories into chakra in order to perform his clan's
secret
 techniques. He was also seemingly proficient with wielding a
bō
 and also used a shield in battle.

Trivia

When Torifu débuted in chapter
481
, he had the custom marking on his cheeks that all known Akimichi have. However, when seen during the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
 in both the
Weekly Shōnen Jump
 and tankōbon release, these markings were not present.

Torifu's name may be short for torifutingu (
トリフティング
), meaning to lift.
