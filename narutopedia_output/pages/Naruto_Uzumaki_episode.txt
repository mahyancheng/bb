Synopsis

Sakura
 and
Kakashi
 arrive at the edge of the destroyed
Valley of the End
, and spot
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 on the ground. Sakura jumps down, and begins healing their arms. Naruto thanks her. Sasuke at first tells her not to bother with him, but when she tells them she needs to focus, a guilt-ridden Sasuke apologises for what he has done, driving her to tears. Kakashi watches his students smiling and laughing as he thinks back to first meeting them, and concludes Sasuke is finally back. Sasuke reflects on his and Naruto's paths. The roots of the
God Tree
 wither, and the victims of the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 are freed, Naruto and Sasuke performing the hand seals together with their remaining hands.
 Sasuke frees the
tailed beasts
.
Tenten
 hands
Darui
 the
Benihisago
, allowing him to free
Samui
 and
Atsui
. In
Konoha
, a funeral is held for those who died, including
Shikaku
,
Inoichi
, and
Neji
. Some time later, several hundred people flock to Konoha to see Naruto.
Tsunade
 congratulates Kakashi on succeeding her as
Hokage
, dismissing his concern about the great amount of paperwork, pointing out if she managed it, so would he. The
Raikage
 and
Kazekage
 entourages arrive at Konoha, and meet up with Naruto. They ask him about his arm, and he explains Tsunade's plan of making him an arm from
Hashirama
's cells. Sasuke is held prisoner, bound in a full body jacket, and seals over his eyes.
Guy
 is examined, and is told he can no longer be a shinobi as a consequence of his injuries, but that does not bother him. While taking Naruto to the
Academy
,
Shikamaru
 confirms to him he is an aide to the Hokage now, and tells Naruto Kakashi is Hokage now. They meet up with Kakashi and
Iruka
. Kakashi tells Naruto he would like to appoint him as
jōnin
, but he needs to study. Iruka,
Konohamaru
,
Moegi
 and
Udon
 provide him with numerous study materials that will help him become a jōnin within two years. Naruto gets exasperated, until Konohamaru reminds him there are no shortcuts on becoming Hokage. Kakashi concedes that Naruto is a fine shinobi who picks up things fast, but he needs some knowledge as well, and that Shikamaru can help him with that. Iruka spends the day teaching him shinobi history. At night, on their way to ramen, Naruto thanks Iruka for acknowledging him years before, crediting that moment for who he has become. Touched, Iruka offers to treat Naruto with as much ramen as he wants. Kakashi visits Sasuke in prison. The next day, Sasuke is free, his plea and contributions for ending the war warranting him a pardon. Sasuke wants to see the world by himself to atone and grow as a person. Sakura asks him to wait until his artificial arm is ready but he declines it. She then asks if she can accompany him but he again refuses, saying she has no part in his sins, leaving her disappointed. Sasuke bids her farewell by poking her forehead and promising to see her again. Naruto goes to see Sasuke as he leaves and hands Sasuke his scratched
forehead protector
, which Naruto kept all these years.
