Kimimaro using his kekkei genkai.



Kekkei genkai
 (
血継限界
,
literally meaning:
 Bloodline Limit) are DNA anomalies that allow their wielders to use unique
techniques
. A kekkei genkai's name describes both the anomaly and the resulting technique. Most kekkei genkai are passed down between generations of a
clan
, an exception being
Hashirama Senju
's
Wood Release
. Likewise, most individuals with kekkei genkai only inherit one kekkei genkai, however this is not always the case.

Overview

Generally speaking, there are three types of kekkei genkai:

Dōjutsu
 are unique eyes with special perceptive abilities, such as X-ray vision or acute attention to detail. Some dōjutsu, such as the
Byakugan
, are present from birth, while others, such as the
Sharingan
, won't awaken until specific conditions are met. Dōjutsu that are consistently inherited within a particular family, such as the Byakugan's
Hyūga clan
 and the Sharingan's
Uchiha clan
, often become synonymous with the clan.

Advanced
nature transformations
 combine two basic natures in order to create a new one, such as
water
 and
wind
 to make
ice
 or
fire
 and
earth
 to make
lava
. Although it is common to use more than one nature, actually combining them requires a kekkei genkai. While some natures are commonly associated with a particular clan, such as ice with the
Yuki clan
, others occur within individuals with no known relationship, such as lava being used by natives of
Iwagakure
,
Kirigakure
, and
Kumogakure
.

Certain kekkei genkai grant their users unrivalled ways of using their own bodies. Twin brothers
Sakon and Ukon
 can merge
their own
 or the bodies of
unrelated people
.
Kimimaro
's
Shikotsumyaku
 enables him to freely manipulate his bones, such as growing an additional spine for him to wield like a whip.
Jūgo
's body passively absorbs
natural energy
, allowing him to use
senjutsu
 without requiring any training.

Kekkei genkai make their users far more powerful than the average
shinobi
. In times of war they are deadly on the battlefield, and are often deployed to turn the tide of the battle. They are highly effective in this regard, but this tends to create issues for them after the conflict is over: survivors of the battle that witnessed or that lost loved ones to kekkei genkai users come to fear and hate them for their actions. They are persecuted because of their abilities, forcing them to the lower rungs of society or driving them into hiding. Even the villages that employ them may stigmatise them, relying on them in combat situations but being unconcerned with their actual survival.

Even though individuals with kekkei genkai are mistreated, the actual kekkei genkai remain coveted by many. Kumogakure, for example, has made different attempts to steal the Byakugan. The Hyūga clan has taken steps to preserve the secret of the Byakugan, first by obligating members of its branch families to sacrifice their lives for members of its main family, and furthermore by
branding
 branch members in order to destroy their Byakugan when they die. Despite these safeguards,
Ao
 of Kirigakure was able obtain a Byakugan, and he goes to
great lengths
 to ensure it cannot be taken back.

When attempting to transfer kekkei genkai to others, dōjutsu are the easiest to work with; the recipient merely needs to be implanted with it. If the recipient does not have a genetic predisposition for the dōjutsu, using it will demand far more
chakra
 than is required for natural users. For nature transformation kekkei genkai, only
Hashirama Senju
's
Wood Release
 has been shown trying to be recreated in others:
Orochimaru
 attempted to reproduce Wood Release by modifying tests subjects' DNA, succeeding only with
Yamato
;

Kabuto Yakushi
 perfected grafts of Hashirama that could be implanted in others, granting them Wood Release;
Madara Uchiha
 developed a substance that, when used for artificial limbs, allows limited Wood Release usage. For bodily kekkei genkai, transferring or reproducing them appears to be prohibitively difficult: to acquire Kimimaro's Shikotsumyaku, Orochimaru planned to simply
take over
 Kimimaro's body, a plan he had to abandon when Kimimaro's body was discovered to be dying; Kabuto succeeded to a certain extent, by creating an
external extension body
 he can use to access the ability.

If an individual cannot gain access to a kekkei genkai directly, they can try instead to use it through the kekkei genkai's original user.
Sasori
 could access the
Third Kazekage
's
Magnet Release
 via a
human puppet
 made from the Kazekage's body. Orochimaru and Kabuto use the
Impure World Reincarnation
 to revive the dead – complete with any kekkei genkai they possessed during life – which are fully under their control. Kabuto also develops a
method
 of creating mindless copies of kekkei genkai users which he generates as needed.

Yanaru's Kekkei Genkai

Main article:
Yanaru's Kekkei Genkai

Yanaru possesses a unique
Kekkei Genkai
, allowing him to mentally exchange information with his
shadow clones
, just as clones are able to transmit information to the main body. Yanara employs it to coordinate his clones for assassinations, while disguising himself as a member of his target's inner circle, where he acquires the necessary information to carry out the assassination, relaying it to his clones.

Inspiration

The concept of special ninja techniques limited by bloodline inheritance may have been inspired in part by the works of
Futaro Yamada
, which strongly influenced later depictions of ninja in fiction. In particular,
The Kōga Ninja Scrolls
 (
甲賀忍法帖
,
Kōga Ninpōchō
), published in 1959, featured a pair of warring ninja clans that, through selective breeding, had produced ninja with a variety of deformities, mutations, and special abilities, even
dōjutsu
.

Trivia

Kekkei genkai should not be confused with
hiden
 techniques. Hiden techniques are exclusive to a certain person or clan, but only because they have kept others from learning how to perform those techniques.

Some
tailed beasts
 possess kekkei genkai, such as
Shukaku
's
Magnet Release
 and
Kokuō
's
Boil Release
.

In
Sasuke Shinden: Book of Sunrise
,
Nowaki
 displays the kekkei genkai called
Typhoon Release
 (
颱遁
,
Taiton
,
English TV:
 Typhoon Style), which seems to be a more powerful version of
Wind Release
.
