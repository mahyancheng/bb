Synopsis

Forty-five minutes into the written portion of the
Chūnin Exams
,
Ibiki Morino
 announces that it is time for the tenth and final question. But, he ominously states that there is one special rule for this question. Meanwhile,
Kakashi Hatake
,
Asuma Sarutobi
, and
Kurenai Yūhi
 rest at the Academy staff room and discuss their respective teams' chances of passing the first phase. Kakashi and Asuma explain to Kurenai that Ibiki specialises in interrogation and knows how to get inside the minds of his victims. Back at the exam, Ibiki states that the candidates are free to choose whether or not they want to try and solve the tenth question. If they opt out, the entire team will fail. If they choose to answer the question but get it wrong, they will be barred from taking the

Seeing that no one else is going to leave, Ibiki passes them all.

Forest of Death
