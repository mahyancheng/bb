"
Inside the Mist
" (
霧の中で
,
Kiri no Naka de
) is episode 100 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As the
Three-Tails
 retreats, the wave from his rampage sends
Naruto
 towards the land. Separated from the others, he finds himself covered by a
mist
 that induces
genjutsu
. Within the illusion, he sees
Orochimaru
 asking Naruto to stop interfering with his plans and proceeds to begin his
Living Corpse Reincarnation
 technique in order to take over
Sasuke
's body. Naruto forms a
Rasengan
 in one hand and attempts to strike "Orochimaru" in the face, only to be stopped by
Kakashi
, as Naruto was about to strike
Kiba
. As the others regroup around him, Naruto reveals that the Three-Tails was the one rampaging on the lake. As this complicates matters for them, Kakashi has
Pakkun
 go to
Konoha
 in order to receive orders from
Tsunade
; in the meantime, they will simply wait. Naruto is impatient as he wishes to save
Yūkimaru
, but Kakashi does not allow him to go exploring on his own due to the fact that the illusionary mist, emitted by the Three-Tails, had nearly caused him to kill his own teammate.

Gozu
 swims to shore and meets up with the other members of
Team Guren
, but promptly leaves in order to find
Guren
. Elsewhere, Yūkimaru watches over Guren as she wakes up, and the latter is surprised to find out that he had done so. She expresses shock when he tells her that his home is with her, but quickly falls under the effects of a fever, caused by
Kabuto
's pills. She finds herself playing nurse for him once more, and thus, unable to regroup with the others.

Pakkun arrives in Konoha and relays Kakashi's information regarding the Three-Tails to
Tsunade
. Realising that the
Akatsuki
 may soon arrive if word gets out, she decides that they must acquire the beast first and thus appoints
Shizune
,
Ino
,
Rock Lee
 and
Tenten
 to the
Orochimaru Search Team
. Ino and Shizune, along with
Hinata
 and
Sakura
, are tasked with using their
medical ninjutsu
 to deal with the
fūinjutsu
 whilst Lee and Tenten are to take over Hinata and Sakura's combat duties.

Meanwhile, Naruto and Sakura are given patrol duty but the former shirks off by a cliff in order to contemplate on Yūkimaru's association with Orochimaru's followers. He tells Sakura that
Jiraiya
 had told him that home is where the people who care about you are, and that as long as people are thinking about you, they would always have a home. Believing that he is talking about Sasuke, Sakura comforts him by saying that they will never forget or give up on him and thus Konoha shall always be his home. As she walks off to resume patrol duty, Naruto reaffirms that so long as he always thinks of Yūkimaru, then the latter's home would be Konoha, and thus sets off to find the boy.

Trivia

Under the effects of the
genjutsu
,
Naruto
 was able to form a
Rasengan
 without the aid of
shadow clones
, proving that he has the innate ability to do so despite relying on his clones.
