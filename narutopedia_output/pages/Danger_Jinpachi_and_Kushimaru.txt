" (
脅威、甚八・串丸コンビ!!
,
Kyōi, Jinpachi - Kushimaru Konbi!!
) is episode 288 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

While en route,
Kakashi
 receives word that
Sai
 had managed to
seal
 one of the
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
. He later receives intel from headquarters on the ninja swordsmen before he rushes towards where he hears a commotion. Upon his arrival, he sees
Jinpachi Munashi
 and
Kushimaru Kuriarare
, who are affronted that Kakashi was wielding the
Kubikiribōchō
. As they begin to battle, the two
reincarnated

Kirigakure
 shinobi begin to mercilessly cut down one another in order to get to Kakashi. Kakashi is not alone for long as
Might Guy
 comes to his aide and together the two take on the swordsmen after Kakashi awakens a
kunoichi
, who had been knocked unconscious on the battlefield. After telling her to flee, the four begin to battle, and it ends up that Kakashi is left momentarily blinded by Jinpachi's explosion. Despite this, the two men press on, remembering a time they went on a mission together along with
Rin Nohara
. The two are eventually able to stave off the Kiri-nin's attack until Ran returns with the
Sealing Team
 who promptly seal away Kushimaru and Jinpachi.

Trivia

When remembering his past, Kakashi is shown to have a
Sharingan
 with three tomoe, despite him gaining the third later, when Rin died.
