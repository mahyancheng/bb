This is a sound-based
genjutsu
 sung by
toads
, their most powerful genjutsu.
 It's considered one of the most powerful genjutsu in existence.
The song's sheet music has been passed down through the generations of
Mount Myōboku
, but due to the complexity of the lyrics and melodies, only the
Two Great Sage Toads
 have ever been able to successfully perform it.
 It takes some preparation time for the two to establish the correct harmony, which in the meantime will alert opponents to their location and to what they're doing. Therefore, they rely on allies to fend off or distract opponents until they're ready.

Once the toads have harmonized and have begun singing, all opponents – regardless of number or skill – who hear it will fall under the genjutsu's influence. Within the illusion, the victim's mind and movements are sealed within a
barrier
 of water by four toad samurai. Meanwhile, the users and their victims can still interact and communicate.
 The genjutsu can only be undone when the user gives the order or by having Mount Myōboku's secret
Stone Swords
 driven into the victim's heart.
 After the song is finished, the toads' throats are left strained and require rest.
