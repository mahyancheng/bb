Aoda
 (
アオダ
) is a
summoning
 snake who resides in the
Ryūchi Cave
, that has pledged loyalty to
Sasuke Uchiha
.

Personality

In stark contrast to
Manda
, Aoda is a very mild-tempered and well-mannered being. He is highly respectful to its summoner, addressing Sasuke with the "sama" suffix and dutifully following all his orders. These mannerisms and loyalty also extend to Sasuke's family as he protected
Sarada Uchiha
 from
Garaga
's attack and followed orders only from her while helping her,
Boruto
 and
Team 10
 in their quest to find
Mitsuki
. While only loyal to Sasuke and his family, Aoda insists that he has no interest in eating humans in general.
 Aoda is also described as being simple.

Appearance

Aoda is a large blue snake with light-green eyes
 and  is easily comparable in size to the largest of summons. He towers above trees, buildings, and rock formations. Like many snakes, Aoda possesses large
infrared-sensitive receptors
 on its snout.

Abilities

As a snake, Aoda is extremely fast and nimble, successfully moving through an entire army of the
Ten-Tails' clones
, while evading all of their attacks. In the anime, it was also shown to possess a great amount of strength, easily able to strangle and toss away even the biggest of said replicas.
 He is said to have strength rivalling
Manda
's.

Aoda, Katsuyu and Gamakichi summoned to the battlefield.



After Sasuke made his way to the main battlefield of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Aoda was summoned alongside
Katsuyu
, and
Gamakichi
 by
Sakura Haruno
 and
Naruto Uzumaki
 respectively. Asking Sasuke how he could be of service, Aoda was commanded to manoeuvre through the enemy lines and get Sasuke to the main body of the
Ten-Tails
 to which he dutifully complied, slipping past clones of the Ten-Tails. While doing this, Sasuke manifested his
Susanoo
 atop Aoda and used the
Blaze Release: Susanoo Kagutsuchi
 technique on his Susanoo arrow, which he targeted the Ten-Tails with, combining it with Naruto's
Wind Release: Ultra-Big Ball Rasenshuriken
 to create the
Scorch Release: Halo Hurricane Jet Black Arrow Style Zero
. Later, when
Obito Uchiha
 was being controlled by
Madara Uchiha
, Sasuke commanded Aoda to take him to Obito, only for the great snake to be grabbed by the Ten-Tails. Sasuke then told Aoda to leave as his assistance was no longer needed.

New Era

Mitsuki's Disappearance Arc

Main article:
Mitsuki's Disappearance Arc

In the anime, when a bunch of Konoha genin who wandered into the Ryūchi Cave and were attacked by
Garaga
, Aoda, realising that one of them was Sasuke's daughter, Sarada, quickly stopped the rampaging snake's attack to save Sarada. After the children ran to safety, Aoda quickly approached them, making his peaceful intentions known. As the group explained their goal of acquiring Garaga's Reverse Scale on the request of the
White Snake Sage
 to get her help in finding
Mitsuki
, Aoda insisted that their efforts were too dangerous as all other inhabitants of Ryūchi Cave stay clear of Garaga. As Sarada refused to give up, Aoda agreed to give his services to the young Uchiha. Following
Shikadai Nara
's plan, they were initially able to pin down Garaga through
Chōchō Akimichi
's
Super Multi-Size Technique
 and Aoda's constricting, until the rampaging foe used his spit to petrify Chōchō.

Ultimately, Aoda was left too battered to help as Garaga retreated to his personal lair. As Sarada refused to endanger Aoda, the snake gave a final warning that the Reverse Scale must not be directly touched as they too would be turned to stone.
