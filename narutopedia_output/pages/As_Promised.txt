"
As Promised…!!
" (
約束通り…!!
,
Yakusokudōri…!!
) is chapter 167 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Naruto
 tries to hit
Kabuto
 with his incomplete
Rasengan
. Because Naruto needs a linear, lunging motion to use it, Kabuto easily avoids it and injures his leg. He tells Naruto that his hopes of winning and his dreams for the future are impossible, which
Tsunade
 realises sounds just like what she said to Naruto a week earlier. Because he does not care about predictions or leg injuries, Naruto stands up and reminds Tsunade of their bet: if he can master the Rasengan in a week, he gets the
First Hokage's Necklace
. He creates a
shadow clone
, which Kabuto attacks. Naruto catches Kabuto and holds his hand to stop him from escaping. The shadow clone assists him with the Rasengan's formation, ensuring that the swirling chakra is contained in a sphere, and then Naruto strikes Kabuto with it.
