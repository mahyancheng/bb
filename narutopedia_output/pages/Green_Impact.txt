Naruto performs
Leaf Whirlwind
 to disable the opponent then sweep them off their feet using
Leaf Gale
. After that, he launches the opponent into the sky using
Rasengan
. Naruto can only use this technique as "Might Suit" Naruto.

Trivia

"Aoi" can mean both "blue" and "green" but given that Naruto is wearing the green jumpsuit that
Guy
 gave him, the word in this instance refers to "green".

The name refers to two techniques: one a combo in
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2
 and the other an ultimate technique in
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3
.
