Summary

Chiyo
 lacks the
chakra
 to complete her
One's Own Life Reincarnation
 as she would die for nothing. Eager to help
Gaara
 and ignorant of what it means for Chiyo,
Naruto
 offers to help her bring him back. Glad to see that Naruto, a
Konoha

ninja
, is so willing to help Gaara, a
Suna
 ninja, Chiyo accepts. As the transfer nears completion she encourages Naruto to continue forming the bonds of friendship with rival villages her own generation discouraged. She also tells
Sakura
 not to risk her life for an old woman again in the future. Gaara wakes up and finds himself surrounded by all of the Sunagakure ninja that went to look for him.
