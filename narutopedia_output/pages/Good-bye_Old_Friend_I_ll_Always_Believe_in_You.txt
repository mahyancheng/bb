"
Good-bye Old Friend…! I'll Always Believe in You!
" (
さらば友よ…!それでもオレは信じてる
,
Saraba Tomo yo…! Soredemo Ore wa Shinjiteru
) is episode 114 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

With the second
pill
 in his system,
Chōji
 used the
Super Multi-Size Technique
 to dramatically increase his size before
throwing
 himself upon
Jirōbō
. To escape the crushing weight of Chōji's increased bulk, Jirōbō advanced to level two of his
cursed seal
, giving him the strength to lift Chōji and toss him aside. Outmatched, Chōji considered taking the last pill. While all of the pills he had taken thus far had been harmful to him, the third almost completely guaranteed death to the user. Faced with death either way, Chōji took the pill, allowing him to easily overpower and kill Jirōbō. His battle won, Chōji began to follow his friends' path, but fell unconscious before making it very far.
