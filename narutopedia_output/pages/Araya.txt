Araya fighting in the Chūnin Exams.



While en route to
Konohagakure
 to participate in the Chūnin Exams, Araya expressed his readiness to
Gaara
 and
Kankurō
 when asked if they were ready for the examinations. Following attending the entrance ceremony for the exams with
Shinki
 and
Yodo
, the team met
Team Konohamaru
 at
Lightning Burger
. Afterwards, the three raced towards the first exam venue in the time provided in order to not get eliminated. Bypassing all traps and obstacles on their route, the team made it to Exam Venue B without using their
jutsu
. There, the team participated in a true or false question, which resulted in all competitors falling into a pit that contained a pool of ink. Saved by Shinki's
Iron Sand
, the team passed the first round of the Chūnin Exams.






Araya facing Inojin.



Three days later, for the second round of the exams, Araya's team competed in a game of capture the flag against
Team 5
. Upon Shinki capturing the enemies flag, the team proceeded to the next round. In the third round, he was matched against Inojin, whom he effortlessly defeated. In the anime, during the semi-finals, Araya faced off against
Sarada Uchiha
. Exploiting a loophole in the rules of the tournament, Araya secretly put his puppet in place of him while he controlled it from afar. While initially repelling all of Sarada's attacks with ease and quickly cornering her, she soon realised through her Sharingan the Araya she was fighting was a fake, using her
Lightning Ball
 to expose him. Now flustered at so many people watching him, Araya's focus was ruined, letting Sarada easily defeat the puppet, and as a stand-in for the match, eliminated Araya.

In the anime, as Gaara and
Sasuke Uchiha
 were battling
Urashiki Ōtsutsuki
, Araya joined Yodo and Kankurō to aid their allies. Upon arrival, Sasuke was warped to a different dimension by Urashiki, but Gaara was able to temporally seal away the foe with the timely aid and arrival of
Shukaku
. Afterwards, it was decided that Yodo and Araya would escort Gaara back to Suna to tend to his injuries while Kankurō went with Shinki and Boruto to safeguard Shukaku at Konoha.

Along the way, Araya carried Gaara on Kankurō's Sanshōuo. They were later approached by
Temari
 and Shikadai, as the former was growing concerned for her brothers. The two genin explained the situation, directing the Konoha-nin to Shinki and Boruto's last location. Soon afterwards, the winded Kazekage muttered that the seal would soon break.

Ultimately, the two genin were able to successfully return the Kazekage to the village, relieved when he recovered.

Deepa
. The man demanded to be given the puppet. When they refused, Deepa
pelted
 them with a barrage of carbon cubes that even Shinki's Iron Sand Wall couldn't completely resist, knocking Araya and Yodo out. Their allies were soon defeated as well. Despite the defeat and them destroying Deepa's target, Deepa decided to leave them alive. After awakening, they reported the assault.

Three years later, Suna was invaded by the sentient
God Tree
,
Matsuri
. Araya joined his team and the Fifth Kazekage to face the threat, but was quickly repelled. As Gaara was severely injured, he made the decision to restrain the children with his sand so as to keep them safe from battle. When the
Claw Grimes
 attacked Gaara, Shinki managed to break free and
sealed
 his father to protect him but as the result, he was consumed by a Claw Grime. Araya held Yodo back when she attempted to save Shinki. Shinki told his team-mates not to worry about him and warn
Kankurō
 of what happened before he was transformed into a tree.

Matsuri and Ryū Arc

Matsuri and Ryū Arc

Later, at the request of the
Eighth Hokage
, Araya and Yodo joined
Team 7
 to intercept the sudden appearance of two
Human God Trees
 in the Land of Wind. Following Shikamaru's plan to feign befriending the God Trees, having
learned
 that
Matsuri
 had feelings for Konohamaru, the team approached the God Trees. They pretended not to know who and what they were, telling the two that hunting down Boruto. It was agreed to join with the God Trees to find Boruto. Soon, Konohamaru convinced the God Trees to separate under the pretense of better searching the area, Araya and the other kids pairing up with Ryū.

When Araya and Yodo introduced themselves to the God Tree, Yodo struggled to hide her hatred towards Ryū, which Araya insisted that it was just shyness. Mitsuki asks Ryū why the God Trees want Boruto dead so badly. Ryū admits that Jura finds it too troublesome that Boruto knows about the Thornsoul Bulbs. As Sarada suggests that they use a Thornsoul Bulb to lure out Boruto, Ryū agrees and produces his own. Unable to restrain herself in the hopes of free Shinki, Yodo rushes to steal the bulb, only for it to be a fake made of Iron Sand. Having seen through the shinobi's deception, Ryū decides they must be punished. He uses his Iron Sand, which he secretly coated them with, to manipulate their bodies into attacking each other. To Ryū's surprise, Araya frees everyone with his
Magnetic Iron Sand Sealing Blade
.

With Araya's technique to protect them from Ryū's Iron Sand, the team goes on the offense. As they seemingly pin the God Tree down, he reveals his ability to transform himself into Iron Sand to escape. Ryū then summons several Claw Grimes to aid him, overwhelming the shinobi with their relentless attacks. As Araya slashes a Claw Grime, the creature quickly secures the blade in its wound. Ryū then teleports the Claw Grime away, with Araya's sword and leaving him defenseless.

As Ryū quickly overpowered his foes and captured them, he offered to spare them if they revealed any useful information on Boruto or his accomplice. Ultimately, as no one gave him a good answer, Ryū struck her down Yodo. As Yodo was still clinging to life, Ryū used his sand to force Sarada to finish the job with a kunai. At the last second, Sarada revealed her
Mangekyō Sharingan
 producing
orbs
 to suck up all the iron sand, freeing everyone. Araya then watch in awe as Sarada proceeded to soundly defeat the Human God Tree, imploding his body and producing his Thornsoul Bulb.

As Mitsuki told Araya to take the Bulb to free Shinki,
Jura
 appeared through a Claw Grime. Mitsuki instantly recognised him as the Human God Tree's leader. Araya wondered if he was here to retrieve the Thornsoul Bulb. Despite this, Jura paid them no attention, instead flying off after a long-distance blast failed to hit its target. As Araya wondered where he was going, Mitsuki quickly realised Jura was heading in Konohamaru's direction.

With his mission completed, Araya took Yodo and Ryū's Thornsoul Bulb back to Sunagakure, eager to use the latter to finally free Shinki. Upon which, Shinki was successfully freed from his tree prison, and following which, the Kazekage was freed from Shinki's seal.
