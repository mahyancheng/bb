The
Chain Wind Staff
 (
鎖風棒
,
Kusari Fūbō
) is a weapon wielded by
Tenten
. It is very similar to a short
chigiriki
, albeit it has a
weighted chain
 attached to each end. It is summoned from one of Tenten's smaller
scrolls
 and can be thrown like a boomerang of sorts. The quick rotation of the two chains was shown to be powerful enough to cut through the helmet of the
Cursed Warrior
.

Trivia

Despite only being
unsealed
 from a scroll, Tenten needed to draw blood to summon this weapon.

Its design is similar to a
cumberjung
.
