"
The Man Who Died Twice
" (
二度死んだ男
,
Nido Shinda Otoko
) is episode 193 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

When asked by
Shikamaru
 and
Shiho
 to see if he recognises anyone in the photos they were able to recover,
Naruto
 grabs one and leaves. He then thinks back to how he met the man in the photo. He remembers a time when he found a tag with the name
Kisuke
 written on it. When Naruto is sitting in his bed, he sees
a man
 sitting on the other side, and after realising he is a "ghost", he starts screaming. Naruto asks him who he is, but the man does not remember. After seeing a tulip in
Konoha
, he suddenly remembers who he is and how he became to be a ghost. He was an
Anbu
 operative investigating infiltration of spies into Konoha. His main suspect was
Sabiru
. After following him around, he was discovered, and the two clashed. The battle ended with Sabiru
sealing away Kisuke's soul
 and Kisuke's body being left in a river. Naruto (
disguised
 as Kisuke) breaks into a meeting involving Konoha's security system and accuses Sabiru of being a spy. When Sabiru says that the real Kisuke is dead, Naruto escapes with
Kakashi
 and Sabiru in pursuit. At some point in the chase, Kakashi caught Naruto, and gave Naruto a chance to prove Sabiru guilty of the murders of Kisuke and
his wife
. When Sabiru confessed to Naruto that he did kill the two, Kakashi appeared, ready to arrest him, but was promptly taken out by a hidden
Kabuto Yakushi
. At the end of the day, Kisuke's soul is ready to depart and says goodbye to Naruto. In the present, Naruto places a bouquet of tulips on the gravestone of Kisuke, just as he promised him he would do whenever he remembers him.
