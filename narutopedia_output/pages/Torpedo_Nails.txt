The user throws nails into the air. Upon impact on the ground, they dig themselves into the earth. When the opponent walks over the ground where the nails dug themselves in, nails pin their feet stopping their movement. Then, the user forms a
hand seal
 and hundreds of nails shoot out of the ground at the opponent.
