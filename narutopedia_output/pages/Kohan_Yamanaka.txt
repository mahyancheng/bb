 in the

Personality

Kohan is a very disciplined man, taking his job seriously. He dislikes tardiness and does not believe in coddling people. At the same time, he is a kind man who seeks to help where he can. He is also openly an admirer of
Ino Yamanaka
.

Appearance

Kohan is a tall man of fair complexion and pale blue eyes. He has hime-style blond hair reaching his mid-back that is tied in a high ponytail. He wears the latest Konohagakure shinobi attire, including high sandals, grey pants and a navy blue long-sleeved shirt, and green flack jacket.

Abilities

As a trained member of the Yamanaka Clan, Kohan is implied to be well-versed in his clan's mind-oriented techniques. He is a skilled sensor, working alongside the Konoha Barrier Team. He is also a capable teacher of the skill.

New Era

Kohan took part of the trial run of Konohagakure's new, automated sensing system. He was partnered with fellow clansman
Inojin
, and tasked with apprehending mock intruders. He was surprised by Inojin's poor performance, who failed to apprehend a single target. Inojin asked him for pointers, which he did, drawing a comparison with their clan's hiden jutsu. During one of the tests, Inojin claimed to detect a strange chakra, with Kohan verified and confirmed to be a registered signature. Inojin insisted there was something off, and when
Shikadai
 vouched for him, Kohan allowed them to investigate, eventually discovering an actual intruder and a loophole in the sensing system. He congratulated Ino on her son's discovery. She however admitted Inojin had little aptitude for sensing, and would have to find his own way.

Later, Kohan rushed to
Chōchō
 and Inojin to clear a mistake on their assigned mission, which was based on outdated information about
Jingo Kumano
's status as a
Kumo
 missing-nin, and apologised profusely for the mix-up.
