 (
ユウダチ
) is a
genin
 from
Amegakure
.

Background

He and Ryūsui were the ones delivering corpses to the
highest tower in Amegakure
, where Pain allegedly resides. Their most recent delivery was the corpse of what would be the
second Animal Path
.

Appearance

Yūdachi has short messy brown hair and dark-coloured eyes. He wears a black forehead protector on his forehead. He has a scratch through the village symbol on his
forehead protector
 to indicate his loyalty to
Pain
. He also has a scar on his right cheek.

Abilities

According to
Jiraiya
, he had genin-level skills.

Part II

Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant






Yūdachi being turned into a frog.



He and his partner,
Ryūsui
, are captured by Jiraiya. When they refused to tell Jiraiya any information on Pain, he uses a feather to tickle-torture Yūdachi into giving him the info. When this failed, Jiraiya
transformed Yūdachi into a frog
, which cowed Ryūsui into divulging info about Pain.

Pain's Assault






Yūdachi being interrogated.



Jiraiya sends Yūdachi to
Konoha
, where he is interrogated by
Ibiki
. When Ibiki can't learn anything from him,
Inoichi

probes
 his mind. After passing through many
barricades
 that were placed in Yūdachi to negate information from being leaked, Inoichi discovers that Yūdachi used to bring dead bodies to
Konan
, not knowing what they were being used for. He is apparently killed by the Animal Path during
Pain's assault
 on Konoha, although it is possible that he was
revived
 along with everyone else Pain had killed during the invasion.

Trivia

夕立
