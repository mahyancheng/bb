"
The Dark Creeping Clouds
" (
忍び寄る暗雲
,
Shinobi Yoru An'un
) is episode 155 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

With
Raiga
 seemingly dead, the gang headed back to find
Karashi
 waiting for them. It turned out to be a trap, as the
Kurosuki family
 then ambushed them. Luckily,
Naruto
 fooled them not once, but twice, with his clones. With the enemies defeated, the villagers focused their anger on Karashi.
Rock Lee
 intercepted them and said that Karashi was still young and weak, and that it was partially his fault that Karashi had joined the Kurosuki family. Lee begged them to let Karashi return to his mother, promising to punish Karashi himself if he should fall from grace again. The villagers agreed, and the group headed back, but not before picking up
Ranmaru
. They headed back to the
Curry of Life
 shop for a meal, where Naruto tried to retrieve information from Ranmaru. Ranmaru had Karashi take him to the canyon where Raiga had fallen, and used his own chakra to revive him.
