With the help of
Chōmei
, the user creates a
cocoon
 that allows them to suppress
chakra

absorption
 from outside sources, providing additional defences at the same time. The cocoon is highly durable and can only be pierced with a
chakra blade
, and only when hit in its weak-spot, which can be found via the
Byakugan
.
