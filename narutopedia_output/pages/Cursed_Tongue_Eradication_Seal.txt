This
cursed seal
 is given to all members of the
Anbu
 subgroup
Root
 by Danzō Shimura, to ensure no information about him or the organisation fell into the wrong hands. After Danzō died, the seals disappeared from all the Root members.

When the wearer of this cursed seal speaks about anything incriminating related to Danzō or Root, their entire body will be paralysed, taking away their ability to speak or move. It is applied to the tongue and takes the shape of three solid lines and two broken lines from the back of the tongue to the tip.

Trivia

This seal is possibly a
hexagram
. It could either be the hexagram ䷞ (
咸
,
Japanese: "kan," Chinese: "xián"
), which can be interpreted as "influence," or it could be the hexagram ䷠ (
遯
,
Japanese: "ton," Chinese: "dùn"
), which can be interpreted as "concealment".
