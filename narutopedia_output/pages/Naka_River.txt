Part of the Naka River.



The

 (

Naka no Kawa
,
Viz:
 Nakano River,
literally meaning:
 River of Southern Joy) is a river flowing through
Konohagakure
. The river is located on the land where the
Uchiha clan
 once lived and prospered
 and at some point, it passes through a deep ravine. It was at this river that
Shisui
 gave
Itachi
 his
Sharingan
 and "
erased his existence
", but it was thought that Itachi had drowned him.
