"
The Angelic Herald of Death
" (
死へいざなう天使
,
Shi e Izanau Tenshi
) is episode 252 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As
Tobi
 leaves his
hideout
,
Zetsu
 appears to send him off.
Kabuto
 asks Tobi where he is going, wanting Tobi to trust him since they are allies. Tobi merely remarks that Kabuto has only joined them to fulfil his own ambitions but notifies him that he is heading to
Amegakure
 as Kabuto smirks.

In Amegakure,
Konan
 stands outside
Pain's Tower
 and smiles at the rain falling down on her village, reminding her of a time when the three
Ame Orphans
 return to their
hideout
 to see
Jiraiya
 dressed as a frog, and how they laughed. Her happiness quickly dissipates by the arrival of Tobi, who wishes to know where she buried
Nagato
, as he requires the
Rinnegan
. Using her
Dance of the Shikigami
 technique, Konan splits herself into several flying origami birds and heads out to lake. Tobi joins her at the lake, and asks why she and Nagato had betrayed the
Akatsuki
; more specifically, he inquires as to why Nagato used the
Outer Path — Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 to revive the fallen
Konoha
 civilians when the technique was supposed to be reserved for his use, adding that both she and Nagato had approved of his
Eye of the Moon Plan
.

Konan recalls when
Naruto
 had
convinced
 Pain that he would find the path to true peace no matter what, and how she had told Naruto that he now embodied both Nagato and
Yahiko
's dreams. Tobi realises that Naruto had swayed Nagato, but remarks that he did not think Konan would be easily affected by the musings of a naïve child. Konan assumes a defensive stance, and Tobi reminds her that the Akatsuki does not tolerate traitors and that he finds it amusing that she still wears the Akatsuki robes despite betraying them. Konan responds that the Akatsuki was formed by Yahiko, with the red clouds representing the bloody rain that fell upon Amegakure, and that Tobi simply retooled the organisation for his own machinations; additionally, the Rinnegan was awoken by Nagato who wished to use it for the welfare of the village, and that she would not allow it to fall into his hands. To her shock, Tobi reveals that he was the one who goaded Yahiko into founding the Akatsuki and that it was he who bestowed the Rinnegan to Nagato.

Thinking back to when Yahiko had considered himself to the pillar that would support Nagato, whom he believed to be the
Saviour of this World
 and the bridge to true peace, and how Nagato had instead believed Yahiko to be the bridge, Konan remarks that this time, she would be the pillar that held up the two bridges that were her best friends. She sends various sheets of paper serving as projectiles towards Tobi, who merely becomes intangible and allows the attack to pass right through him. As Konan rushes towards him, he grabs onto Konan and uses
Kamui
 in an attempt to transport her
elsewhere
; however, the sheets of paper have
explosive tags
 on them, which detonate. Using Kamui, Tobi manages to pull himself and Konan from the centre of the blast, although his mask partially breaks and he loses his right arm as a result. Konan, who has lost the lower half of her body, suspends herself in mid-air and uses her
Paper Person of God Technique
 to split the very lake underneath Tobi into two, creating an abyss.
