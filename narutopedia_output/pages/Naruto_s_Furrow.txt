" (

Viz:
 Naruto's Path) is chapter 652 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

As a
Susanoo
-clad
Kurama
 cuts through
Obito
,
Naruto
 and Kurama's objectives are achieved as the
chakra
 of the
tailed beasts
 are pulled out in response to Naruto's use of the chakra the beast had given him. Manifesting their chakra via Kurama's tails, Naruto begins the great tug-of-war against Obito who struggles desperately to retain the chakra of the beasts. When
Shukaku
 and
Gyūki
's chakra reject Kurama's tails as the young man didn't possess a portion of it himself,
Gaara
 — Shukaku's former
jinchūriki
 — and
Killer B
 — Gyūki's current host — aid Naruto in his struggle in order to leave Obito with nothing but the
shell
 of the
Ten-Tails
 hence halting the tree's flower from blooming.
 Recognising what he intends to do, the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 springs into action under
Shikamaru
's directive all the while as the link between the chakra open Naruto up to even more of Obito's conscience which Kurama warns against. Joining in the effort,
Sasuke
 and Naruto's
other

comrades
 all grab hold of the chakra as well and begin to pull while
Minato
 dons his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 mantle once again and sprouting tendril-like tails instructs the Alliance to grab hold of his chakra to join the effort. Within his subconscious, Obito sees himself alone against the entire Alliance, and as he begins to contemplate more and more of his decisions and visualise what his life could have been like, he grapples to come to terms with what he views to be regret. Speaking to him directly from their connection, an empathic Naruto tells Obito that despite his declaration of being no one, he was in fact someone with dreams not unlike his own, bonds with other people in the world: both friends and family, and declared that he was "Obito
Uchiha
" and that he would destroy his real mask which was the face he portrayed of being no one.
