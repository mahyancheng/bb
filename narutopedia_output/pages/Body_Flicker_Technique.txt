The
Body Flicker Technique
 is a high-speed movement technique.

Usage






The Body Flicker Technique performed without smoke.



By using the Body Flicker Technique, a ninja can move short to long distances at an almost untraceable speed. To an observer, it appears as if the user has teleported. It is accomplished by using chakra to temporarily vitalise the body and move at extreme speeds. The amount of chakra required depends on the overall distance and elevation between the user and the intended destination.

A puff of smoke is occasionally used to disguise the user's movements. Other elements or substances can be used instead to distract the opponent:
Gaara
 uses sand for the
Sand Body Flicker
 (
砂瞬身
,
Suna-Shunshin
);
 in
Shikamaru Hiden
,
Sai
 uses ink for the
Ink Mist Body Flicker
 (
墨霞瞬身
,
Sumigasumi-Shunshin
). Villages can even have their own variants, as in the
Mist Body Flicker
 (
霧瞬身
,
Kiri-Shunshin
),
Water Body Flicker
 (
水瞬身
,
Mizu-Shunshin
), and
Leaf Body Flicker
 (
木ノ葉瞬身
,
Konoha-Shunshin
,
literally meaning:
 Tree Leaf Body Flicker).

Although the Body Flicker Technique is common to almost all shinobi, some are particularly renowned for their usage of it.
Shisui Uchiha
 was feared as "Shisui of the Body Flicker" (
瞬身のシスイ
,
Shunshin no Shisui
); whenever he employed this technique, Shisui would fade away from sight, leaving no trace of his presence. In the anime, Shisui was also able to generate
clones
 through the technique. When the
Third Raikage
 utilised the technique, it looked like a bolt of lightning appeared and disappeared from the area. The
Fourth Raikage
 often combined the Body Flicker Technique with the
Lightning Release Chakra Mode
 which allowed him to dodge
Amaterasu
.

Trivia

Certain
space–time ninjutsu
 are sometimes confused with the Body Flicker Technique, as it creates the illusion of the user instantly moving from one place to another. However, whereas space–time ninjutsu actually transport the user through space, this technique is merely high-speed movement.
 Despite this, the
Flying Thunder God Technique
 is regularly mistaken for "Body Flicker Technique" by various individuals, including the technique's
creator
, due to targets not seen to be tagged for the "Flying Thunder God Technique".

Further confusion exists in some translations of the series. In Viz's English translations, the Body Flicker Technique is called "Teleportation", whereas space–time ninjutsu are generally referred to as "Transportation Techniques".

The Body Flicker Technique is similar to
Swift Release
, a
kekkei genkai
 that allows the user to
move at high speeds
.
