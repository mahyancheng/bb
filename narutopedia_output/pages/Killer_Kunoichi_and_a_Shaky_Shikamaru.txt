" (
シカマルタジタジ!?くの一達の熱き戦い
,
Shikamaru Tajitaji!? Kunoichi-tachi no Atsuki Tatakai
) is episode 43 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Tenten
 and
Temari
 are chosen to fight next. Tenten makes the first move and Temari easily dodges it.
Team Guy
 was surprised that no weapon could even scratch or hit Temari. Tenten tries another attack that Temari repels using wind from her
Giant Folding Fan
, before warning Tenten that if she sees all three stars (moons in the English anime) in her fan, the fight will be over. Tenten uses her
Twin Rising Dragons
 technique. Uncovering the second star, Temari repels the attack, then Tenten uses strings to re-use the weapons. Uncovering the third star, Temari repels the attack and traps Tenten in a
cyclone
. When Tenten falls from the cyclone, Temari makes her land on her fan, knocking her out. After being declared winner, Temari tries to throw Tenten on the many weapons scattered on the floor, but
Rock Lee
 descends and catches her. He then attacks Temari, only to be stopped by
Might Guy
, who warns the Suna shinobi to not underestimate Lee.

Shikamaru
 and
Kin Tsuchi
 are then next. Shikamaru tries the
Shadow Imitation Technique
 but Kin easily evades and throws some senbon with bells attached at him. Shikamaru recognises
the trick
 and mocks her for using such basic techniques. Kin then rings the bells on the senbon, starting her
genjutsu
. Shikamaru gets caught in Kin's
genjutsu
, unable to move, while Kin proceeds to attack him with more senbon. However, when Kin tries to attack again, she suddenly realises that she can't move. Shikamaru tells her that he extended his Shadow Imitation Technique through the shadow of the wires she's holding. He then throws a
shuriken
 at Kin, which she imitates. When Shikamaru ducks backwards to evade it, Kin is forced to imitate him, but she did not realise that she was too close to the wall, hitting her head and knocking herself out.

Shikamaru is declared the winner of the match and
Naruto
 and
Kiba
 are chosen to fight next.
