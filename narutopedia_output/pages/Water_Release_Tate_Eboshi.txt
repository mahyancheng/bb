After using his
Hydrification Technique
 to merge with a water source, Suigetsu can form a giant wave that resembles a demon-like fish. Suigetsu can use this form to battle larger opponents, or he can use it to shield allies from attack. Though it was strong enough to physically push back
Killer B
 in his
Tailed Beast Mode
, it was not strong enough to withstand a point-blank range
Tailed Beast Ball
, and rendered Suigetsu unconscious soon afterwards, causing him to fall into a jelly-like state.
