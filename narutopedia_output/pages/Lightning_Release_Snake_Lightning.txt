The
Lightning Release: Snake Lightning
 technique allows the user to generate a discharge of yellow electricity from their hand, which can electrocute a target by either emitting it around the user's body while they're submerged in water,
 thrusting it into a target,
 or manifesting a snake from the concentrated chakra to attack from a distance.
