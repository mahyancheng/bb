" (

Kirābī Rappūden: Chi no Maki
) is episode 430 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

As the fight between the
jinchūriki
 and
Akatsuki
 continues,
Naruto
 asks
Itachi
 about
Sasuke
, which makes Itachi leave, revealing that he's quitting the organisation, alongside
Nagato
. After that,
Fū
 arrives and intervenes in the battle, forcing both
Sasori
 and
Deidara
 to flee as well.
Killer B
 then encourages Fū to give him a fist bump, which flusters her, but
Gaara
 manages to persuade her to join their cause. On the way to their following destination, Killer B fills Fū in with the information, regarding the
Ten-Tails
, and their objective to protect the princess who sealed it.
 The four then arrive in
Rōshi
's village, but he does not welcome them with open arms, due to recent activity, involving suspicious characters, which leads to
Son Gokū
 calming the old man down. The five of them notice a
hawk
, spying on the group, and
Chōmei
 uses its
Scale Powder
 to knock it out, revealing it to be
Sasuke
, who has come here with
Orochimaru
 and
Kabuto
. Sasuke, however, quickly leaves, and Orochimaru
summons
 a
giant snake
, which is defeated with the combined efforts of all five
Tailed Beasts
, forcing the
Sannin
 to leave as well. A while later, the five of them join up with
Yugito
,
Han
 and
Utakata
, who have not been able to locate
Yagura
. Deciding to meet up at the castle in seven days, they split up in search for the Fourth
Mizukage
, who is eventually found by Killer B and Han and, with B's great effort, persuaded him to join. However, they are too late to join up with the rest of the group, as the castle is attacked by
White Zetsu
, leaving the six jinchūriki to protect it on their own. The
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 manages to use the
Tailed Beast Ball
 and hit the castle, but the blast doesn't destroy it. As the group is about to lose, Killer B, Yagura and Han arrive in time to save them. The nine jinchūriki combine their strength, allowing their Tailed Beasts to use the Tailed Beast Ball at once, blowing the statue and Akatsuki back. As B congratulates them in his dream, he chuckles while being trapped in the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
.

Trivia

The outfit the jinchūriki are wearing is the exact same outfit in the cover of chapter
567
.
