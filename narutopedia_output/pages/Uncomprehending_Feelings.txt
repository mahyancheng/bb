Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Although
Yamato
 hopes he will be able to convince
Sasori
's spy that he is the real Sasori, it is likely his cover will be blown at some point and they will need to capture the spy. As such, they practice their teamwork in a combat scenario the next day.
Sai
 does not hesitate to sacrifice
Naruto
 in order to complete the exercise. Naruto once again compares him to
Sasuke
, saying that Sasuke would not betray a team-mate like that. Although Sai disagrees with this point, he only reminds Naruto that his absence of emotion makes it impossible for him to think of anything but the mission's success.
