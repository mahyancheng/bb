"
A New Enemy
" (
新たな敵
,
Aratana Teki
) is episode 59 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Yamato
 sends a message from the
Fire Temple
 back to
Konoha
, where
Shizune
 reports its contents to
Tsunade
. She ponders over the latest string of events - the grave robberies of three of the
Twelve Guardian Ninja
, the
Akatsuki
's plans,
Orochimaru
 supposedly returning to hiding following his encounter against
Team Yamato
 and finally,
Danzō Shimura
 himself, a village elder who is attempting to overthrow the current regime. Wanting to deal with the internal affairs first, Tsunade has Shizune dispatch
Anbu
 members not affiliated with
Root
 to observe Danzō at all times. At home, Danzō muses over
Sai
's request to stay on Team Kakashi, but before he can give it anymore thought, he senses the presence of the Anbu. Wondering what Tsunade is up to, he tells himself not to worry as he holds all the cards in his favour.

In the woods near the Fire Temple,
Chiriku
 tells Yamato that the coffins must be heavy and that the only escape route is to the south. When they reach a valley, they notice the four coffins moving through the ground. Fearing it may be a trap, Yamato tells Chiriku to stay behind while the rest apprehend the coffins. Pairing Sai with
Sakura
 and
Sora
 with Naruto, the five pursue the coffins. As Naruto and Sora fight amongst each other to lead the mission, the coffins begin to go underground. Elsewhere,
Furido
, the man behind the operation, orders his
four-man team
 to deal with the ones following the coffins. Using her
scroll
 as a medium for her
terrain-altering technique
,
Fuen
 draws out a new terrain filled with traps. Her terrain design is brought to life by
Fudō
, using his
Earth Release: Mutability
 technique. As Team Yamato and Sora were confined within a maze riddled with traps, they were then each separated. Sakura and Sora went off to look for Naruto, who had nearly avoided being crushed by a rolling boulder. He is then faced by
Fūka
, who blames the trap evasion as a mistake on Fuen's part. Yamato uses his
Wood Release
 to avoid being buried alive, but finds himself face-to-face with Fudō, the latter being impressed over his Wood Release ability. Coating himself with
Rock Armour
, he attempts to use his
Chakra Enhanced Strength
 to kill Yamato, who manages to avoid the strike. Meanwhile,
Sai
 is riding his
giant ink bird
 in an effort to escape the maze, only to be stopped by Fuen, who manages to place a tracking device on Sai.
