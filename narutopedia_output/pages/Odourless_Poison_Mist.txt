By using an
explosive tag
, the user disperses an odourless powder which, when inhaled by their targets, affects their five senses, slowing down their reaction times. This allows the users to freely dodge attacks while attacking their opponents. The
Wandering Ninja Clan
 use this as the focal point of their fighting style, with Karenbana even creating a
genjutsu
 that requires the poison to initiate.
