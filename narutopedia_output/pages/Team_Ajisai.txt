This is a
chūnin
 team from
Amegakure
, originally consisting of
Ajisai
,
Suiren
, and
Fuyō
. The team participated in the
Konoha
-
Suna
 joint
Chūnin Exams
 where
Konan
 tasked them with finding
jinchūriki
 and if that failed, gathering intel on the strength of the shinobi from the other villages.

The team managed to pass the second stage of the exam after many hardships and all of its members were ultimately promoted to chūnin. During their first
S-rank
 mission, Ajisai died in action. It's neither known if the team still operates, nor if Suiren and Fuyō survived the confrontation that lead to Ajisai's demise in the first place.
