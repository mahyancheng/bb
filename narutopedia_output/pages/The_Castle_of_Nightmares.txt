Synopsis

Konohamaru
 uses
Mitsuki
's antibodies to heal the butler. Satisfied with Konohamaru, and willing to die for his employer, the butler is ready to take them to meet. Konohamaru insists in learning the employer's identity before meeting, and threatens to walk away. The butler relents, and reveals his employer as
Sakuya
. He also reveals that her castle is protected by a barrier that requires his presence to get through. Four purple-haired men watch them from afar.
Yubina
 transfuses Mitsuki's antibodies to her patient. The butler explains that Sakuya can't fight time, so she wants to use the
Hashirama
 Cell to restore her youth. The butler arrives at the castle with Konohamaru and
Boruto
, and discovers someone tried to break in, the barrier killing them. The butler orders the body to be disposed outside the
village
. The butler takes them inside, and Boruto notices all the mirrors are shattered. The butler explains Sakuya doesn't want to see her own reflection. Before meeting Sakuya, the butler activates one of the castle's traps, restraining Boruto. He wants Konohamaru to test his procedure on Boruto. Konohamaru claims to want a drink to steady his hands. After the butler leaves, he explains he wants to buy Boruto time to retrieve the Hashirama Cell, so Boruto leaves to continue the mission, his
shadow clone
 the one in the trap. The purple haired men follow Boruto's clone in the castle.
Victor
 informs
Deepa
 the whereabouts of the Hashirama Cell, who departs to retrieve it.
 Yubina's patient recovers. Before having his drink, Konohamaru asks for the provenance of the Hashirama Cell. The butler explains they bought it from a rogue medical firm researcher. They were doubtful at first, but were convinced after testing it on a girl, whose whereabouts they don't know or care. Boruto follows the smell of perfume and takes down Sakuya's guards outside her chamber. Boruto looks for the Hashirama Cell, but discovers Sakuya is dead, with a kunai on her back. He notices two of the four purple-haired men on the chandelier. A third one, disguised as staff informs the butler of Boruto's invasion. Boruto recognises one of the men's earrings from the women he saw with
Kirisaki
. They have the Hashirama Cell, and frame Boruto for killing Sakuya. The butler alerts the castle, and one of the purple-haired men kills him. They also kill other castle staff, taking down the barrier. Konohamaru notices the assailants' kunai are poisoned. One of the purple haired men shouts that Konoha shinobi have killed Sakuya, and that there's a reward for whoever captures them.
