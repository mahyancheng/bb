The user erects a field of
lightning
 to connect two points. Any metallic object (such as a
kunai
) that enters the field will rapidly accelerate from one point to the other, quickly surpassing the
speed of sound
. This makes the metallic object incredibly destructive as it moves towards its destination, such that a single kunai will topple trees that get in its way and decimate a cliffside that it impacts. Once mastered, users can strike targets from far greater distances than they could if simply throwing a kunai. Any metallic object can be fired in this way assuming the current of lightning is large enough: a ship's anchor caught in such a field will shoot into the sky, the rest of the ship being dragged through the air behind it.

When
Sarada Uchiha
 and
Mitsuki
 are learning to use the Lorentz Gun, they encounter three different hurdles: getting their thrown kunai into the electric field at all, keeping the field active long enough for the kunai to reach its destination, and furthermore accurately designating the target they want the kunai to hit. Their teacher,
Sasuke Uchiha
, can do all of these things instinctively and doesn't have enough experience with teaching to articulate how he does any of these things. They have more success using the Lorentz Gun in tandem, with Sarada throwing the kunai and Mitsuki maintaining the electric field, but even then still struggle with accuracy.

Trivia

This technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation. Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as "Denjiyūdō Dōteki".
