Flying Thunder God Kunai
 (
飛雷神クナイ
,
Hiraishin Kunai
) are custom-made
kunai
 (
特注クナイ
,
tokuchū kunai
) and signature tools of
Minato Namikaze
, who uses them in conjunction with his
Space–Time Ninjutsu
: the
Flying Thunder God Technique
. They differ from a standard kunai in that they have three blades instead of one and the handle (which is thicker than normal) serves as the "marker" for Minato's teleportation ability. Minato also said that these blades are a bit heavier than a normal kunai.
 Their prongs also make them more deadly in melee fighting.

Minato gave one of these kunai to his pupil,
Kakashi Hatake
, as a celebratory gift for his promotion to
jōnin
 as well as to be able to teleport to his team at any time as long as they had the kunai in their possession.
 During the
Third Shinobi World War
, in the battle between
Konohagakure
 and
Iwagakure
, the
ninja
 from the former threw these kunai behind enemy lines which allowed Minato to instantly teleport to the various locations and slay the opposing shinobi, while at the same time making it difficult for the enemy to predict where he would teleport next.
 He also kept several of these blades at
his safe houses
, so he could teleport there quickly when necessary.

In
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower
, Minato placed one of these kunai over the
source of the Ryūmyaku
 to seal it.
Mukade
 managed to remove the kunai by
absorbing the seal
, which also triggered a huge backlash of energy that propelled him backwards in time by 20 years, and
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Yamato
 by 14 years.

Trivia

Although unnamed in the manga, they were named by Minato in
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower
.

Tobirama Senju
, the creator of the Flying Thunder God Technique, used regular kunai in a similar fashion by marking them with his own formula for the technique.
