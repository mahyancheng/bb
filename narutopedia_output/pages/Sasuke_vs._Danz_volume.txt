Sai
's
ink clone
 tells
Naruto
 about
Konoha
's resolution to personally eliminate
Sasuke
. Although
Sakura
 agrees, she could not bring herself to tell Naruto and forbade her escorts from bringing it up. Sai speculates that, due to Sakura's feelings for Sasuke, she plans to kill him herself to not only repent for relying on Naruto for so long, but to make sure Sasuke doesn't sink any lower on the path of darkness. Naruto contemplates all of this, but is interrupted by the arrival of
Gaara
, who tells them what happened at the
Kage Summit
, including the actions of Sasuke. Gaara encourages Naruto to give up on Sasuke if he truly wishes to become

 leaves the

 ninja. Before he goes he informs

 that he and the other

 will treat Kakashi as the new
Hokage
 because of
Danzō
's actions, and while he repeats his personal recommendation for
Naruto
 to give up on
Sasuke
, he also advises him to think and do what he thought was right for himself at least. Elsewhere, Danzō prepares for a battle with
Tobi
. While he does so,
Fū Yamanaka
 and
Torune Aburame
 fight Tobi, but are unable to land a blow. They try to hit him at a time when he is solid, but their attacks pass through him and they are ultimately warped away. With them gone, Tobi brings Sasuke and
Karin
 to Danzō, offering to let Sasuke kill him. Danzō accepts the challenge, revealing an arm filled with
Sharingan
.

Sasuke vs. Danzō…!!
" (
サスケVSダンゾウ…!!
,
Sasuke Bāsasu Danzō…!!
)

Kakashi
 prepares to chase after
Sakura
, knowing that she is currently no match for
Sasuke
. As
Naruto
 thinks about everything everyone has told him about Sasuke, he begins to hyperventilate and passes out. Elsewhere, Sasuke asks
Danzō
 if it is true that
Konoha
 ordered
Itachi
 to kill the
Uchiha clan
. Danzō attacks him but is caught by Sasuke's
Susanoo
. Danzō admits it, then curses Itachi for putting so much importance in Sasuke, even going so far as telling Sasuke a secret that he was supposed to die with. Sasuke crushes him in anger. Despite his apparent death, Danzō appears behind Sasuke and offers to end their conversation.

Chapter 477

"
Don't Talk about Itachi
" (
イタチを語るな
,
Itachi o Kataruna
)

Sasuke
 tries attacking
Danzō
 with
Susanoo
 again. Danzō once again appears to die, only to appear elsewhere unharmed. Even
Amaterasu
 does not seem to affect him.
Tobi
 and
Karin
 study his actions to try and determine what he is doing, eventually noticing that the
Sharingan
 eyes on Danzō's arms steadily close. Danzō congratulates Sasuke for, with his
Mangekyō Sharingan
 abilities, earning the status as
Itachi
's brother. Sasuke is enraged by Danzō mentioning Itachi and only becomes more determined to kill him. After surviving additional attacks, Danzō is faced by Itachi.

Chapter 478

"
Sasuke's Susanoo…!!
" (
サスケの"須佐能乎"…!!
,
Sasuke no "Susanoo"…!!
)

Danzō
 recognises
Itachi
 as a product of
Sasuke
's
genjutsu
, though it's vastly inferior to the older brother's
Tsukuyomi
. He restrains Sasuke and tells him as much, which makes Sasuke angry enough to finally complete his
Susanoo
. Susanoo fires an arrow at Danzō, who is forced to use the
Wood Release
 abilities that he gained from the implanted DNA of
Hashirama
 to avoid the attack. Since this means he would have died, Sasuke assumes Danzō is now vulnerable and attacks again, only for him to once again survive the attack after seeming to die.
Tobi
 conduces that Danzō is using
Izanagi
.

Chapter 479

"
Izanagi
" (
イザナギ
,
Izanagi
)

Sasuke
 continues to attack
Danzō
, who, after using
Izanagi
 — an
illusion
 that completely alters one's reality at the cost of the caster's
Sharingan
 — to survive the attacks, tries to kill Sasuke before he runs out of Sharingan. Once down to his last Sharingan, Danzō clashes blades with Sasuke in a final attempt to finish each other off. They stab each other.

Chapter 480

"
Sacrifice
" (
犠牲
,
Gisei
)

With both
Sasuke
 and
Danzō
 wounded, the battle is over. Although Danzō believes
Izanagi
 protected him from harm, thus making him the victor, he finds that he has been hurt; Sasuke used a
genjutsu
 to make it look like Izanagi was still active.
Karin
 heals Sasuke's wounds. Badly injured, Danzō loses control of the
First Hokage
's DNA that allows him to use
Wood Release
 and he is forced to remove his arm. Determined not to lose, Danzō takes Karin hostage to buy his escape. Although Karin thinks that Sasuke will try to save her, Sasuke instead
stabs
 through Karin, fatally wounding both her and Danzō.

Chapter 481

"
Danzō Dies!!
" (
ダンゾウ死す!!
,
Danzō Shisu!!
)

Karin
 collapses.
Danzō
 staggers towards
Sasuke
 and
Tobi
, thinking about how he could never reach the same level as
Hiruzen Sarutobi
, namely by becoming
Hokage
. He settles for dying with honour just as Hiruzen did by trying to take Sasuke and Tobi with him. They escape his last attack and Sasuke expresses his desires to continue on to
Konoha
. As
Sakura
 nears Sasuke's location, she tries to incapacitate her escorts so that she can face him alone, but is stopped by
Sai
.

Chapter 482

"
One More Time…
" (
もう一度…
,
Mō Ichido…
)

Naruto
 wakes up and learns that
Kakashi
 has gone to stop
Sakura
. He tries to follow, but is stopped by
Yamato
. Naruto accepts that he cannot go and asks to rest some more, but only takes the opportunity to sneak out. Elsewhere, Sakura manages to knock out
Sai
 and her other escorts. Sai is able to inform Kakashi of her success before passing out. Meanwhile,
Tobi
 advises Sasuke not to go to
Konoha
 since his eyes are on the verge of blindness. He adds that it would be a good idea to finish off
Karin
. Tobi leaves and Sasuke prepares to kill Karin. He is interrupted by Sakura, who asks to join forces with him.

Chapter 483

"
Teacher and Student Once More!!
" (
再びの師弟!!
,
Futatabi no Shitei!!
)

Sakura
 tries to convince
Sasuke
 to let her accompany him, even if it means destroying
Konoha
. He agrees if she will finish off
Karin
. Sakura approaches her and tries to come up with a good way to kill Sasuke, but Karin alerts her to Sasuke's own attempts to kill her. She is saved by
Kakashi
. Kakashi, as Sasuke's teacher, offers to kill him so that Sakura doesn't need to and to redeem himself for not stopping the situation sooner, remembering how
Hiruzen
 had to do the same with
Orochimaru
. Sakura heals Karin while Kakashi makes one last attempt to convince Sasuke to give up on revenge. He refuses, so they prepare for battle.

Author's Note

“

You know, there's something that I think is really confusing: the term 3-D has been real popular lately, right? But that word has existed for a long time, from back when video games, anime, and movies first started using polygons and CG. But now, 3-D refers to three-dimensional images that appear to leap out at you, like 3-D films or 3-D live animation. I mean, I understand... I really do understand... My only question is, what should we now call what used to be called 3-D? 2.5-D? Or perhaps we should call the current stuff super 3-D?
