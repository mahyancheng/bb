Synopsis

A group of thieves is attacked in an abandoned mine tunnel after robbing the
Thunder Train
. After a mission,
Boruto
 offers to eat with his team mates, and Team 7 overhears other genin gossiping about them. This gets under Boruto's skin, who goes off on his own. Boruto thinks back to his last birthday.
Sakura
,
Sarada
, and
Mitsuki
 showed up, but
Naruto
 didn't. Boruto was frustrated, but tried to hide it. Naruto arrives home after Boruto's gone to bed, and is sad that even though he got Boruto a present, he doesn't know what games his son likes. Boruto goes to the Scientific Ninja Tool Research Centre instead of home. Boruto vents his frustrations to
Katasuke
 while he works on the Kote. Katasuke gives Boruto a Scientific Ninja Tool for his birthday. Boruto arrives home, and sees
Himawari
 marking the calendar. She says it's to give their father advanced notice of her upcoming birthday.
 Himawari is sad at the idea of Naruto missing her birthday. Boruto promises her he won't let Naruto miss it. The next day, Team 7 is assigned to find the Thunder Train thieves. Boruto is concerned that if it's not a big mission, people won't acknowledge him, and continue to measure him by Naruto's standards.
Shikamaru
 informs Naruto that another ruin related to
Kaguya
 has been discovered, Naruto wishing to check on it himself. Boruto and Naruto cross paths on their way out. Naruto apologises for missing Boruto's birthday, but Boruto dismisses it, telling Naruto not to miss Himawari's instead. Team 7 arrives at the town near the border of the
Land of Fire
, and discover that one of the robbers came out of the mines traumatised, claiming his accomplices were killed by a monster. The robber's claim that a "white one" is coming for them picks
Konohamaru
's interest. In the tunnels, they find the thieves' corpses, and footprints. They follow the footprints further inside, passing by an
Ōtsutsuki clan
 carving. They reach the end of the footprints, and realise it's a trap. They are attacked by a giant, multi-faced
White Zetsu
.

Trivia

Naruto mistakenly says it has been ten years since the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 when it's confirmed that fifteen years have passed since the end of the war. Also present in the English dub.
