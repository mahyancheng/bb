This was a
genin
 team from
Sunagakure
, consisting of
Shira
,
Yome
, and
Sen
. The team participated in the
Konoha
-Suna joint
Chūnin Exams
. While the team wasn't able to gather both needed
scrolls
 in the second stage of the exam, a sudden change in the regulations renewed the possibility for them to become
chūnin
. While Shira actually got promoted, it is unknown if this also applied to Yome and Sen.

Shortly after the exams, the team was disbanded, with Shira and Yome leaving to enlist in a special bataillon near the northern border of the
Land of Wind
, leaving Sen behind as the only member who remained in Sunagakure.
