Naruto
 manga.

Summary

A
's flashback continues. The two "brothers" go on several missions together, on one of which they are joined by
A's cousin
. A and his cousin discuss the possibility of
Killer B
 becoming the next
jinchūriki
 of the
Eight-Tails
. A wonders if B will have enough control to suppress the Eight-Tails. A's cousin reflects on what it means to be a jinchūriki, and despite outwardly appearing to have everything, what a jinchūriki really needs is something to fill the hole in their heart and give them strength. Later, A and B are shown attending A's cousin's funeral. A sets B the goal of matching his own strength, to which B replies that someday he will surpass his brother. The day arrives when the Eight-Tails will be sealed in B, and A tells B that from here on out, things will be different. They bump fists, and A says that no matter what happens, he'll be there for him. Sometime later, A clashes with
Minato
 for the first time. Minato commends B for his bravery, and tells A that he should find out his brother's values as a person — what B holds most important — before he became neither a human nor a jinchūriki.

Trivia

In this chapter, when A and B face off against several
Iwagakure
 shinobi while on a mission,
 B is first depicted with longer hair. However, in subsequent panels his hair is once again short and spiky.
