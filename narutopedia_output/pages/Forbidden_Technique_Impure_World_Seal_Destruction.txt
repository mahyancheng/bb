Orochimaru summons a coffin like the one used in the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 technique. Ghostly hands come out of the coffin, extending through the body of the opponent, damaging them, until a larger hand grasps them, crushes them, and pulls them into the ethereal dark void within the coffin. The lid closes on the coffin and begins to sink into the darkness surrounding it. Orochimaru laughs sinisterly, watching as it vanishes.
