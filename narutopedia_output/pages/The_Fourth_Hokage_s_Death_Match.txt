Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Kushina
 successfully gives birth to
Naruto
, and
Biwako
 takes the baby away, only for her and fellow midwife
Taji
 to be killed by
Tobi
, the masked man. Tobi places
explosive tags
 on the newborn Naruto and tosses him into the air, forcing
Minato
 to catch him, remove the tags and use his
Flying Thunder God Technique
 to teleport outside. Tobi uses the opportunity to use
Kamui
 to teleport himself and
Kushina
 elsewhere, where he
extracts
 the
Nine-Tails
 out of her and, controlling it with his
Sharingan
, decides to attack
Konoha
. Meanwhile, Minato teleports to one of his
safehouses
 to keep his newborn son safe and manages to teleport back to Kushina, who had the Flying Thunder God seal marked on her
Eight Trigrams Sealing Style
, and saves her from being killed by the
tailed beast
. He brings her back to the safehouse, placing her next to Naruto and dresses in his
Hokage
 attire.

In the village,
Guy
 is pestering
Kakashi
 to compete in another challenge while Tobi sneaks into the village. He
summons
 the Nine-Tails right inside the village and allows it to wreak havoc. Sensing the tailed beast, the
Third Hokage
 prepares to go into battle;
Chōza
,
Shikaku
, and
Inoichi
 prepare to defend their village as well. Minato teleports to the village to defend it, and the fox fires a
Tailed Beast Ball
 towards him. Using his
Flying Thunder God: Guiding Thunder
 technique, Minato warps the Tailed Beast Ball to a safe distance away. He is immediately engaged in combat with Tobi, who attempts to use Kamui to send Minato
elsewhere
; however, Minato teleports to a safe location just in time. Tobi follows Minato there and praises his Flying Thunder God techniques, while Minato, realising that the masked man in front of him possesses a Sharingan strong enough to control the Nine-Tails while infiltrating the village undetected, suspects Tobi to be none other than
Madara Uchiha
, albeit immediately dismissing the thought since Madara was thought to be long dead.

Minato begins his assault on Tobi, who produces chains from his wrists, but is unable to land a successful hit due to Tobi's intangibility. Noting that Tobi would have to manifest physically in order to strike back, Minato throws one of his
Flying Thunder God Kunai
 at Tobi's head while rushing towards him at the same time. Right as the kunai goes through Tobi's head, he materialises in order to grab a hold of Minato; however, Minato forms his
Rasengan
 and teleports to the kunai's location behind Tobi, and manages to land a successful hit, marking him as well. Tobi is wounded from the attack, as his left arm begins to peel and fall off. Having branded Tobi, Minato is able to teleport to him right away and places a
Contract Seal
 on him, wresting the Nine-Tails from his control.

Trivia

Team Tobirama
 as well as
Torifu Akimichi
 were not present during the episode, in contrast with
chapter 503
.

In the manga, Minato glared at the Nine-Tails and Tobi, the masked man, after telling Kushina that Naruto was safe. In this episode, it happened when Kushina told him that Tobi's objective was to destroy Konoha.

Minato notices Tobi's
Sharingan
 as the latter uses
Kamui
; however, it is a normal Sharingan eye and not the
Mangekyō Sharingan
. This goof also persists in the previous episodes up until the point where Tobi's true identity is revealed, at which point his Mangekyō Sharingan is shown whenever he uses Kamui.

After Tobi is struck with the
Rasengan
, his left arm peels off. This is apparently an error, as Tobi's left arm was his original and natural arm, while his right arm was the
artificial arm
.
