Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 arrives at
Shiranami
's cabin, only to be
bound
 by ropes. Looking up, he is shocked to see the
Magaki Group
, the four bandits who had attacked
Hotaru
 earlier. Meanwhile, Hotaru is encountered by
Shiranami
, who explains how his father
Hāto
 had been killed by enemy
shinobi
 who wanted the
Tsuchigumo clan
's
forbidden technique
, and how
En no Gyōja
 had banished him elsewhere since he knew how to use the
kinjutsu
 as well. Glad to have found Shiranami, Hotaru writes a note to
Utakata
 and sends a carrier pigeon to deliver the message; angered, Shiranami uses his
Character Bind Technique
 to have a kanji appear on his hand and take flight, in an attempt to chase down the carrier bird, while he knocks Hotaru out.

Drifting
 in his
bubble
, Utakata witnesses the carrier pigeon being chased and saves it by dispelling the kanji. Upon reading the note, he finds himself glad to be rid of Hotaru since she has found Shiranami, although he is also unsettled. Meanwhile in the cabin, Naruto is shocked to find out that Shiranami is the leader of the bandits; the bandits proceed to trap Naruto in a
purple barrier
 that siphons his
chakra
, with
Chūshin
 claiming that no one could escape from it. Naruto, drawing on the power of the
Nine-Tails
' chakra, overloads the barrier and causes the cabin to explode. The four bandits decide to up the ante and create a
more powerful
 variant of their barrier, which renders Naruto unconscious. Before they can kill Naruto, the bandits are
attacked
 by Utakata, who had heard how Shiranami was their leader. Enraged and wanting to know where Hotaru is, Utakata enters into his initial
jinchūriki form
, and the four bandits decide to leave.

At
Mount Katsuragi
,
Yamato
 is told by
Sai
 that Hotaru has gone missing. In the woods, Utakata searches the ground for clues, telling Naruto that both Hotaru's master and
his master
 have not trained them properly since they lack the basics. Naruto claims that Jiraiya did teach him the basics, as well as honed his
taijutsu
 and
ninjutsu
 while also
teaching
 him
powerful techniques
. He asks what Utakata learned from
his master
, and Utakata recalls a memory in which his master berated him for risking his life unnecessarily while also showing his gratitude that his pupil was alive.

Utakata and Naruto find themselves at the Tsuchigumo clan's village, where they find out that all the villagers are being controlled by Shiranami. Whilst trying to defend themselves without killing the villagers, they are encountered by the four bandits, who use
explosive tags
. However, the duo are saved by the arrival of
Team 7
; Yamato uses his
Wood Release
 to restrain the villagers while using his
Wood Release: Wood Locking Wall
 to shield himself, Sai and
Sakura
 while Utakata shields himself and Naruto with his
bubble dome
. Yamato tells the two to go save Hotaru while they deal with the external foes. Inside his hideout, Shiranami reveals to Hotaru, as he prepares to steal the kinjutsu, that it was he who killed his own father just to acquire the forbidden technique.
