Decryption
" (
暗号解読
,
Angō Kaidoku
) is episode 154 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

While looking at
Jiraiya
's code,
Naruto
 states that the "9" they've been looking at is actually a writing quirk of Jiraiya's penmanship, and that it is actually the katakana letter "ta"(タ), something only Naruto would have known. As Naruto reveals that he only learned of the quirk due to Jiraiya's novels, the
Konoha Cryptanalysis Team
 state that the message must have been meant for Naruto, and that the other numbers must mean page numbers from the
Icha Icha
 series. To
Kakashi
's embarrassment, he is forced to read excerpts from Jiraiya's adult books out loud until they manage to decipher the code — "The real one's not among them".

After relaying the decryption to
Fukasaku
, who remembers Jiraiya telling him that neither of the
Six Paths of Pain
 looked like
Nagato
, Fukasaku asks Tsunade's permission to bring Naruto with him to
Mount Myōboku
, in order for Naruto to learn
Sage Mode
. Naruto accepts, due to his desire to avenge Jiraiya's death, and is
reverse summoned
 to Mount Myōboku. As Naruto and Fukasaku leave, Tsunade muses how the
Great Toad Sage
 had predicted Jiraiya writing novels and how those very novels lead to the decryption of his code, and decides to believe in the toad's prognostication that Naruto is the
Child of the Prophecy
.

At Mount Myōboku, Naruto discovers that he was summoned there by
Gamakichi
, as toads can summon humans who have signed a blood contract with them. After having one of
Shima
's meals, Fukasaku explains the basics behind
senjutsu
, with Gamakichi simplifying it for the
genin
. After Fukasaku states that Naruto must learn to acquire
natural energy
, Gamakichi tells Naruto that he would have to die first.
