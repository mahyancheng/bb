Lyrics

Rōmaji

Boku ni wa wakaru nda uso o tsuite iru kimi ga

Naite ī yo koko ni zutto irukara

Sekaijū ni koborete iru

Hontō no ai no kimochi

Sagashidashite miushinatte

Yoake ga kuru no matteru

Migi no hoshi ni wa boku no namae o tsukete

Kimi ga yonde okureyo

Hidari no hoshi ni wa kimi no namae ga ne

Niau yo zutto soba ni irukara

Rōmaji (Full)

Dare ni mo wakaranai boku no shoutai to yara o

Mitsukedashite dakishimete kurenai ka?

Boku ni wa wakaru nda uso o tsuiteiru kimi ga

Naite ii yo koko ni zutto iru kara

Sekaijuu ni afureteiru yasuppoi ai no kotoba

Muri ni nonde sugu ni haite nani mo nai mado kara miteta

Tooku no sora ni wa namae mo nai hoshi ga

Bokura mitai ni futatsu

Natsu no kaze ni tobasarete shimawanu you

Tsunaida chiisa na te o hanasai

"Nande mo nai no" to tsuyogari o iu kimi ga

Nanka boku to niteiru ki ga shitanda

Sekaijuu ni koboreteiru hontou no ai no kimochi

Sagashidashite miushinatte yoake ga kuru noo matteru

Migi no hoshi ni wa boku no namae o tsukete

Kimi ga yonde okureyo

Hidari no hoshi ni wa kimi no namae ga ne

Niau yo zutto soba ni iru kara

Tooku no sora ni wa namae mo nai hoshi ga

Bokura mitai ni futatsu

Natsu no kaze ni tobasareteshimawanu you

Tsunaida chiisa na te o hanasanai

僕にはわかるんだ嘘をついている君が

泣いていいよここにずっといるから

世界中に零れている 本当の愛の気持ち

探し出して見失って 夜明けが来るの待ってる

右の星には僕の名前をつけて

君が呼んでおくれよ

左の星には君の名前がね

似合うよ ずっとそばにいるから

English

I can tell when you’re lying.

It’s okay to cry, cause I’m always right here.

While waiting for daybreak to come, we search, and lose sight of,

The genuine feelings of love that spill out along the way.

I’ll name that star on the right after myself;

Please call it by its new name.

Cause your name would be perfect for that star on the left-

Then we’d always be standing side by side.

English (Full)

Please, won't you seek out my true form

And just hold me close?

I can tell when you're lying

It's okay to cry, 'cause I'll always be right here.

Watching from an empty window, we force ourselves to drink down and promptly spit out

The cheap words of love overflowing in this world.

In the far-off sky, there are two nameless stars

Just like the two of us

So you won't get blown away by the summer wind

I'll never let go of that tiny hand in mine.

You try to act tough, saying "it's nothing"

I got the feeling that we're somehow similar.

Waiting for the daybreak to come, we search and lose sight of

The genuine feelings of love that spill out along the way

I'll name that star on the right after myself

Please call it by its new name

'Cause your name would be perfect for that star on the left

Then we'd always be standing side by side

In the far-off sky, there are two nameless stars

Just like the two of us

So you won't get blown away by the summer wind

I'll never let go of that tiny hand in mine.
