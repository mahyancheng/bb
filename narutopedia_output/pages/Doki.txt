The
Doki
 (
怒鬼
,
English TV:
 Rage Ogres,
literally meaning:
 Angry Demons) are three beings summoned by
Tayuya
. Their eyes and ears are covered and their mouths are sewn shut, a reference to the
three wise monkeys
. By playing specific melodies on her
Demonic Flute
, Tayuya can
control them
, each melody causing them to perform different actions.

Appearance

While each demon is different in appearance and each wield different weapons, they’re all very large and muscular. Each demon has a purple, rope belt tied in an inverted bow around its waist, like Tayuya and the rest of the
Sound Four
.

One wears a dark green full-body suit and its hair covers its entire head and face. It wields a giant studded metal club.

The other is shirtless and wears dark pants. It is bald, has scars on its head and wears a blindfold. It has a claw-like weapon seemingly tied to each arm.

The third has its upper body completely covered in bandages and wears brown pants. It stands backwards with its head constantly titled to the sky and has several needles protruding from its head.

Abilities

The Doki are incredibly strong and fast, being able to slam their weapons through trees. In addition, Tayuya can use her flute song to force open their mouths to release a
many-mouthed, worm-like creature
 that consist almost entirely of spiritual energy. These "spirit worms" are attracted to physical energy, and absorb it on contact, allowing them to weaken an opponent. Tayuya can send away the Doki if necessary, by making a half ram seal and saying "dispel" as seen during her battle with
Shikamaru Nara
 after he
gains control
 of them.
