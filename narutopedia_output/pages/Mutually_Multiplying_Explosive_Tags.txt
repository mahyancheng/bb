The
Mutually Multiplying Explosive Tags
 is a technique which forms part of a
fighting style
 purposely designed for those who have been
reincarnated
, and employs the use of special
explosive tags
 to create a near infinite series of explosions. By using their own body as a medium for the paper, the reincarnated individual creates several exploding tags formed from large sheets that each bear five seals on them. These special tags then attach themselves to the intended target, but just as they detonate, additional tags are created as these previous ones explode. This process is continuously repeated, leading to a near infinite chain reaction of consecutive explosions. By sacrificing themselves, this technique can also be employed by a live individual.
