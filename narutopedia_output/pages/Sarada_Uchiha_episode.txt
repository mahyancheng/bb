Synopsis

Sarada
 watches
Boruto
 vandalising the
Hokage Rock
 from afar. Meanwhile, many of her classmates train with their fathers.
Naruto
 sends a shadow clone that pursues Boruto through the village, and Sarada misinforms him when Boruto asks her not to give away his location. Sarada deduces Boruto wants to get his father's attention, which he quickly denies.
Shikamaru
 paralyses Boruto with his shadow, and chastises him for keeping Naruto busy, even if it's just a shadow clone. Shikamaru considers Boruto and Naruto to be very much alike, to Boruto's dismay. He has
Shikadai
 call Naruto's shadow clone. Later, Sarada eats with
Chōchō
, and questions the value and purpose of being a ninja with the upcoming graduation exams.
 Chōchō has to train with her father, despite not wanting to.
Chōji
 embarrasses Chōchō when he calls for her. Chōchō doesn't think she is like her father, and asks Sarada if she is like hers. Sarada tells her she has never met her father. At home, Sarada sees a picture of her father, and her vision gets blurry. At dinner, Sarada questions
Sakura
 about
Sasuke
, and gets irritated when Sakura can't give her concrete answers. After researching her clan, Sarada presses Sakura for more substantial information, even asking if she's really married to Sasuke. Sakura raises her voice and slams the ground, scaring Sarada. Sakura apologises, and assures her she and Sasuke are connected. Sakura's punch then causes their house to collapse and she faints afterwards, prompting
Shizune
 take her to the hospital. Sarada goes through the remains of their house for family pictures, and discovers that a picture of Sasuke is actually a picture of
Taka
, and wonders who the
woman with glasses
 is. At the hospital, Sarada asks Shizune about her birth, as there are no records of it in any hospital in the village. At a diner, Chōchō tells Sarada she doesn't think Chōji and
Karui
 are her real parents, and
Mitsuki
 dismisses her concerns. Chōchō asks Sarada to go on a journey to find her real parents, inspiring Sarada to find Sasuke and ask him herself. Elsewhere, Sasuke appears from a
portal
, and is attacked by a
hooded figure
.
