Created by Hinata, this is a highly versatile technique which affords both offensive and defensive capabilities whereby she emits a constant stream of
chakra
 from her palms, which are formed into extremely thin, sharp, blades.

While using this technique offensively, Hinata shapes the chakra into thin, sharp, flexible blades allowing her to hit hundreds of targets with extreme precision and can cut smaller targets, like bees, into pieces.

When used defensively, Hinata creates much larger, stronger, more flexible, arc-shaped chakra blades that spread out across her entire attack range, effectively forming a barricade between herself and her opponents, rebuffing even the
largest
 and
smallest
 of targets.

With the addition of Hinata's flexibility, the technique creates an "absolute defence" effect similar to that of the
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
, though the cutting nature of the chakra prevents any outside force from restricting it.

Trivia

Even though this technique is an anime only technique, it remains to be Hinata's standard attack throughout the game series.

This technique did not make a début in the
Naruto
 manga, but did make an appearance in the manga and anime spin-off,
Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles
.
