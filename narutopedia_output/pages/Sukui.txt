Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Sukui was assigned to the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
 during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. During a lull in the war with the body count rising and the casualties coming in to be healed, the
scroll
 which the division was using to seal away the corpses of the shinobi with
kekkei genkai
 and other unique abilities was stolen by a
reincarnated

Hayate Gekkō
 and the two other ninja. Realising the gravity of the situation, Sukui formed a team consisting of
Yokaze
,
Sakura Haruno
,
Iō
, and
Yūgao Uzuki
 to retrieve the KIA scroll. After realising that she was putting Yūgao in a terrible spot, Sukui apologised but noted that in order to have the mission turn out well, they needed her to participate in the retrieval.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

With each of the battlefields wrapping up their fights, Sakura and
Shizune
 leave to aid
Naruto
 and
B
 in their battle, leaving Sukui and the others to tend to the wounded.
