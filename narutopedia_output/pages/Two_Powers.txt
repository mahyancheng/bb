Two Powers…!!
" (
二つの力…!!
,
Futatsu no Chikara…!!
) is chapter 645 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

After the conversation between
father
 and
son
, Naruto dons his
Tailed Beast Mode
 shroud as he plans to attack
Obito
 with renewed vigour. Before so,
Tobirama
 reminds the latter that only
senjutsu
-based attacks could damage the
Ten-Tails
'
jinchūriki
, causing Naruto to panic since he had forgotten already. Inside Naruto's mind,
Yang
-
Kurama
 tells Naruto that since both of them are on friendly terms, Naruto can use
Sage Mode
 whilst using its power similar to the time the young
shinobi
 conversed with
Nagato
. On the other hand,
Yin
-
Kurama
 also tells Minato that he can also under-go a full Tailed Beast Mode transformation to provide powerful support for his son. Following the advice of the beast, Naruto goes full Tailed Beast Mode in sync with his Sage Mode while Minato unleashes his Tailed Beast Mode as well.
 Minato, with Naruto's help, prepares a
large-scale, senjutsu-infused Rasengan
, and with Tobirama's
Flying Thunder God Technique
, quickly slams it unto Obito, who uses
chakra arms
 and a
fluid barrier
 to repel the attack. Noting the barrier's durability, Naruto and Minato pool their strengths together to form a senjutsu-infused
Tailed Beast Ball
 to destroy the opponent's defences. Meanwhile,
Sasuke
, along with the surviving shinobi, watch the battle as the
Uchiha
 ponders just how far Naruto had come. Obito then undergoes his own tailed beast transformation, planning to continue the
Eye of the Moon Plan
, shocking
Madara
, who was still battling
Hashirama
.
