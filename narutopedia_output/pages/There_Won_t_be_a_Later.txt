Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Shikamaru
 explains that
Hidan
's link with
Asuma
 was created when he consumed some of Asuma's blood. However, in order for this link to do anything, Hidan must stand within the boundaries of the design he drew on the ground earlier. To break the link, Shikamaru forces Hidan out of the design and ties him down. Asuma tests Shikamaru's theory by inflicting harmless wounds on Hidan, which do do not occur to himself. Content, Asuma cuts off Hidan's head. Hidan's head yells at
Kakuzu
 for not stopping Asuma before this happened.
