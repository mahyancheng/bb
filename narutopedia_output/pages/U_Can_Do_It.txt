Lyrics

Rōmaji

Shiranai wo riyuu ni nigete bakari de

Rakuna michi wo susumu no wakantan da yo ne

Demo ima dakedo kono isshu wa

Dare no mono demo naiyo

What's going on, What's going on

Chiisai koroni egai teta

Nari tai jibun ni naru tameni

Nani shite nani wo mirebaii notte

Mayocchi yau toki mo aru yo ne dakedo

(Anytime) Kitto ima daijina mono

(Anytime) Sore ha koko ni aru kara

(Anytime) Kowagaranai de sono mama

Ikou shinjite

Shiranai wo riyuu ni nigete bakari de

Rakuna michi wo susumu no wakantan da yo ne

Demo ima dakedo kono isshu wa

Dare no mono demo naiyo

What's going on, What's going on

Hey, hey, hey I think U can do it !

Yoku mimi wo sumasete kimi wo yobu hou e

Hiru no aida no aida made sagashi temite yo

Mitsukaru yo kitto

Jibun wo ugokasu nanika

Kanji (Full Version)

知らないを理由に逃げてばかりで

楽な道を進むのは簡単だよね

でも今だけのこの一瞬は

誰のものでもないよ

What's going on, What's going on

小さい頃に描いてた

なりたい自分になるために

何して何を見ればいいのって

迷っちゃうときもあるよね

だけど

(Anytime)きっと今大事なもの

(Anytime)それはここにあるから

(Anytime)怖がらないでそのまま

行こう 信じて

知らないを理由に逃げてばかりで

楽な道を進むのは簡単だよね

でも今だけのこの一瞬は

誰のものでもないよ

What's going on, What's going on

Hey, I think U can do it !

よく耳をすませて君を呼ぶ方へ

ビルの間の間まで探してみてよ

見つかるよ きっと

自分を動かす何か

答えのない道が続く

それでも諦めきれずに

何度も落ち込んで泣いたって

まだ走り続けたいの

だから

(Anytime)悔し涙流しても

(Anytime)いつもそばにいるから

(Anytime)楽しむこと忘れずに

行こう 信じて

知らないを理由に逃げてばかりで

楽な道を進むのは簡単だよね

でも今だけのこの一瞬は

誰のものでもないよ

What's going on, What's going on

何もない1日なんてない

同じように目が覚めたとしても

振り返らないで

自分を 信じて

知らないを理由に逃げてばかりで

楽な道を進むのは簡単だよね

でも今だけのこの一瞬は

誰のものでもないよ

What's going on, What's going on

変わってく慣れない時間の中で

見えなくなるものもある、分かってるけど

でも今だけのこの一瞬は

全力で進まなきゃ

What's going on, What's going on

Hey, I think U can do it !

よく耳をすませて君を呼ぶ方へ

ビルの間の間まで探してみてよ

見つかるよ きっと

自分を動かす何か

English

Always running away, blaming it on the unknown

It's easier to continue on the easy way, right?

But this moment that is only now

Doesn't belong to anyone

WHATS GOING ON WHATS GOING ON

What I drew when I was little

In order to become what I wanted

like what should I do, what should I look at

There are times when I hesitate but

ANYTIME what is really important now

ANYTIME is right here

ANYTIME dont be afraid just like that

Lets go belive in it!

Always running away, blaming it on the unknown

It's easier to continue on the easy way, right?

But this moment that is only now

Doesn't belong to anyone

WHATS GOING ON WHATS GOING ON

HEY HEY HEY I THINK U CAN DO IT

Open your eyes to how I will call you

Try looking on what's between the buildings

You will definitely find it

What will be able to move you

English (Full Version)

Always running from a reason I don't know

Isn't it a piece of cake to walk the simple path?

But only right now, at this moment

I don't belong to anyone

What's going on, What's going on

There are times when I wander

On the thing I wrote when I was a kid

That was about "what I should do and what I should see

To become the me I want to become"

But

(Anytime) I'm sure that the important thing right now is

(Anytime) Right here, so

(Anytime) Don't be afraid, stay as you are and

Let's go, just believe

Always running from a reason I don't know

Isn't it a piece of cake to walk the simple path?

But only right now, at this moment

I don't belong to anyone

What's going on, What's going on

Hey, I think U can do it!

Perk your ears and listen to the direction your name is being called

Go searching from building to building

You'll find it, I'm sure

That something that moves yourself

The path without an answer continues on

But even so, without giving up

No matter how many times I fall or cry

I still want to continue running

That's why

(Anytime) Even if tears of frustration drip down

(Anytime) I'm always by your side, so

(Anytime) Without forgetting the fun things

Let's go, just believe

Always running from a reason I don't know

Isn't it a piece of cake to walk the simple path?

But only right now, at this moment

I don't belong to anyone

What's going on, What's going on

Hey, I think U can do it!

Perk your ears and listen to the direction your name is being called

Go searching from building to building

You'll find it, I'm sure

That something that moves yourself

There's no such thing as a day with nothing

Even if you wake up your eyes the same way

Don't look back

Believe in yourself

Always running from a reason I don't know

Isn't it a piece of cake to walk the simple path?

But only right now, at this moment

I don't belong to anyone

What's going on, What's going on

I'm changing inside of the time I can't get used to

And there are things I can't see anymore, I know that but...

But only right now, at this moment

I have to move ahead with all I've got

What's going on, What's going on

Hey, I think U can do it!

Perk your ears and listen to the direction your name is being called

Go searching from building to building

You'll find it, I'm sure

That something that moves yourself
