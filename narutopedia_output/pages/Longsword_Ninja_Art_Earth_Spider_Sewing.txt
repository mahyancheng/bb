Using the
Nuibari
, the user buries the sword's attached razor sharp
wire string
 underground. Once a person stumbles into the area, they pull the string to trap their feet in a formation of wire, cutting them off. The power and force behind the wires can be controlled by the user by applying additional strength.

Kakashi
 was able to counter the technique by landing atop the wires instead of between them.
Might Guy
 was also able to counter the technique by using a
kunai
 to stop the wires from converging.
