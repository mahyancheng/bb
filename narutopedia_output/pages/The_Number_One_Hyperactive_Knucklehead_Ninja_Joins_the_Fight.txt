Synopsis

Naruto
 finally joins the battle on the bridge, announcing himself with a big entrance. This angers
Kakashi
, who scolds him for not staying hidden, which would of been more effective and advantageous.
Zabuza
 then propels shuriken towards Naruto, which
Haku
 cancels out by throwing needles at mid-air. He begs Zabuza to let him deal with Naruto in his own way. Meanwhile as
Sasuke
 is still trapped in Haku's
Demonic Mirroring Ice Crystals
, Kakashi is unable to help, stuck with protecting
Sakura
 and
Tazuna
.

Sasuke throws a kunai at Haku as he’s talking to Naruto, turning attention towards himself once again. Submerging his body into the mirrors, Haku continues the battle. Kakashi orders Sasuke to attack the mirrors from within, while Naruto attacks from outside to discover how they work. Naruto, who’s oblivious to this jutsu, enters the imprisonment of ice. Sasuke yells that he’s a complete loser, and now they’re both trapped. Using
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
, Sasuke attempts to melt the mirrors, though the heat isn’t enough to do any damage. Naruto follows up by creating
shadow clones
 to smash them all at once, which are defeated by Haku in mere seconds. He reveals that he doesn't like to kill his enemies but will do so if he must.
