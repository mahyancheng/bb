Saisu Kamano
 (
鎌野サイス
,
Kamano Saisu
) is a
chūnin
 of
Konohagakure
.

Background






Forgetting his grudge, Saisu hides behind Itachi.



In the anime, when Saisu was a
student
 in the
Academy
, he was in the same class as
Itachi Uchiha
. During
shuriken
 practice, he was shocked to see that Itachi's aim was perfect. Later, he
challenged
 Itachi to spar with him, easily being defeated by the
Uchiha
. The next day, he was annoyed at the girls in his class fawning over Itachi, and on the way to confront him accidentally bumped into
Dokan
, an older student displeased by their behaviour. He, along with some other classmates, hid behind Itachi, who defended them and defeated Dokan with ease. Soon after, he claimed Itachi was a friend and paraded around calling him
Master
. However, one day, Dokan and many other older students targeted Saisu and Itachi's group as revenge. Saisu and his friends got beaten up, while Dokan eventually landed a hit on Itachi. Saisu, as well as everyone else present, was baffled to see that Itachi actually sent a
shadow clone
 to the academy instead of going there himself.

Personality

In the anime, as a child, Saisu appeared to be a somewhat lazy and brash individual, being bored at the Academy and quickly voicing his disdain towards everyone. He was proud and couldn't stand the prodigy Itachi, who excelled in everything, even challenging him to a duel out of jealousy. However, after Itachi saved them from Dokan, Saisu and his friends began parading around with him calling him
Master Itachi
, and even fought alongside him against a larger group of older students, despite being heavily outplayed.

Appearance






Saisu as a child.



Saisu has long, spiky brown hair reaching down to his lower back and dark eyes. He wears the standard Konohagakure attire completed with a
flak jacket
. He also wears bandages wrapped around his wrists. As an academy student, he wore a grey cloak over a black shirt, dark-blue pants and blue sandals. On his back, he carried a
kama
 hulled in white bandages.

Abilities

While his abilities are mostly unknown, in the manga he was shown wielding a collapsible
kusarigama
, while in the anime he was wielding a collapsible kama, indicating that he has some skill with wielding bladed weapons. The anime indicates that he was trained in the usage of the weapon from very early on in his Academy days.

Part II

Pain's Assault

During
Pain's assault
, he accompanied a
small

group

of

shinobi
 and assisted in
Kakashi Hatake
's confrontation with the
Deva Path
 of Pain.
 Upon arrival, he and his comrades launched a simultaneous assault on the opposition from four directions, only to be immediately defeated by the effects of
Shinra Tensei
.

Trivia

The kanji in his surname stand for "
kama
" (
鎌
), his preferred weapon, and "field" (
野
), where sickles got traditionally used for reaping crops. "Saisu" (
サイス
) is one way to write "scythe" in Japanese.
