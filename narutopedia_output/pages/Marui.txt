Kara Actuation Arc

When word that the cell of the
First Hokage
 was stolen from
Konohagakure
 spread, the
Fifth Raikage
 sent a three-man squad consisting of
Kakui
, Marui and
Omoi
 to reclaim it. Upon arriving, they learned that the previous holder of the target,
Sakuya
, had been killed and the cells allegedly stolen by Konoha-nin. Omoi's team soon found the Konoha-nin. Before a fight could break out, Omoi recognised
Konohamaru Sarutobi
, who explained the situation. After they deduced that the real culprits were
shinobi
 from the
Land of Haze
, the groups joined forces to hunt the enemy down.






Omoi's team attempts to catch Deepa off guard.



Along the way, they were intercepted by
Deepa
, who was also looking for the Hashirama Cell. Omoi's team decided to face the new threat while the Konoha-nin moved on. Despite their best efforts, Deepa proved unfazed by everything they attempted. With his body immune to their attacks, Kakui and Marui were soon defeated, leaving Omoi on his own. Ultimately, Omoi was soundly defeated, and Deepa began questioning him about the Hashirama Cell's location. While he refused to speak, Kakui and Marui soon recovered. Refusing to let Omoi die, they revealed that the target was on its way to the Land of Haze. Deepa promptly killed Kakui and Marui by thrusting his hand through their chests.
