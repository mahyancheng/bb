Summary

Orochimaru
 encourages the
Third Hokage
 to give up and die, especially since nothing he does can stop him from destroying
Konoha
 and its inhabitants. The Third ridicules Orochimaru for never having appreciated the calibre of Konoha ninja. At the same time, all across the village, the veteran ninja come to the village's defence;
Yūgao Uzuki
 vows to avenge
Hayate
;
Hiashi Hyūga
 defeats dozens of invaders; the fathers of
Team 10
 team up again for the first time in years;
Shibi Aburame
 saves his son
Shino
 from the poison he earlier inhaled;
Tsume
,
Hana Inuzuka
, and their
ninken
 prepare for battle; the two remaining invaders in the
Chūnin Exams
 stadium are surrounded;
Naruto
 and
Gaara
 leap at each other. Promising to teach Orochimaru that strength is not determined by one's techniques, the Third uses the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
 to seal away his arms. The Third looks upon his former student one last time and dies smiling, just as Naruto manages to defeat Gaara.
