This article is about Naruto's wallet. For the giant toad that resides at Mount Myōboku, see
Gama
.

Gama-chan
 (
ガマちゃん
,
English TV:
 Froggy,
literally meaning:
 Toad-chan) is
Naruto Uzumaki
's
toad
-shaped wallet. Gama-chan's presence and brief appearances in the series are used for comic relief. Naruto cares for "
Gama-chan
" and refers to it as if it were a pet, saying that it's happy when it's fat and full of money. He gets disappointed and indignant whenever
Jiraiya
's jaunts out for "
research
" would end up with Naruto broke, and Gama-chan emaciated.

When
Tsunade
 made a bet with Naruto on whether he could master the
Rasengan
 in a week, she took a money-filled Gama-chan as his part of the wager.

Gama-chan continued to survive the wear and tear (and feast and famine) of the years. As a father, Naruto continues to pay for out-of-pocket expenses through Gama-chan.

Trivia

During the
Three-Tails' Appearance
, when Naruto asks
Konohamaru
 to buy snacks for
Gamatatsu
 and
Gamakichi
, Gama-chan's eyes lack the white border around them.

On the underside of Gama-chan, a white strip can be seen. The strip roughly says Naruto's Wallet (
なるとさいふ
,
Naruto Saifu
).

It might be based on the
Chan Chu
, the
Lucky Money Toad
, a Chinese symbol of prosperity depicted as a frog sitting on top of a pile of coins with a coin in its mouth.

The Japanese word for frog, "kaeru", is a homonym that means "return / to return". It is considered lucky in Japanese culture to keep a frog in wallets (in whatever form, whether as figurines or keychains, etc.) for money to come back when it is spent.

The creator of
Naruto
,
Masashi Kishimoto
, says "One day, the following incident took place. I got stuck writing a manga just before the deadline, so I lay down behind my desk to take a short nap. When I was looking for something to use as a pillow, I found a big frog-shaped gamaguchi cushion. (This is a cushion modeled on the froggie wallet that Naruto uses in the series, it was made as a present for readers.)"

In several
Ultimate Ninja Storm
 series
, Gama-chan appears as a custom
Substitution
 item. In
Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
, it also appears as a character customisation accessory for Naruto.

In
Episode 180
 of
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
,
Boruto Uzumaki
 is seen with a similar wallet that is blue in color.

In
Episode 56
 of
Naruto
, Gama-chan was pink with a gold mouth, rather than green with a silver mouth.
