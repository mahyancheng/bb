The Land of Fangs.



The
Land of Fangs
 (
牙の国
,
Kiba no Kuni
) is a country featured in
episode 177
 of the original
Naruto
 anime. There was, at one point, tension between this nation and the
Land of Claws
. The two sides barely averted a war thanks to
Jiraiya
's
Icha Icha
 novel, which was delivered to the Land of Fangs'
daimyō
 by mistake. The
Fang Daimyō
, who was an
Icha Icha
 fan, thinking it was a peace offering from the
Claw Daimyō
 and such avoided the war. This land is seemingly marked by numerous steep peaks, probably leading to its name.
