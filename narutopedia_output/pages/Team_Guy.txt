Team Guy
 was a team led by
Might Guy
 and was formed a year before the other main Konoha teams of the series. They specialise in close-quarters combat with all of its members using some sort of
physical attacks
. Guy waited a year before entering them in the
Chūnin Exams
, though none of his apprentices were promoted at that time.

Between the events of Parts I and II,
Rock Lee
 and
Tenten
 became
chūnin
 while
Neji Hyūga
 surpassed his teammates and rose to the ranks of
jōnin
. Despite becoming more busy, Neji still goes on missions with his team. The three later join the rest of the
Konoha 11
 in deciding to personally kill
Sasuke Uchiha
 in order to prevent war between Konoha and
Kumogakure
, but were persuaded by
Naruto Uzumaki
 that he would deal with Sasuke alone.

During the events of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Neji was among those killed in the line of duty, and later Guy suffered a permanent injury which forced him to retire after the end of the war, leaving only Lee and Tenten remaining in active duty.

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Team Guy

Team 3 is notable for having a more Chinese theme to them: Might Guy and Rock Lee utilising martial arts with both characters greatly resembling
Bruce Lee
 and
Jackie Chan
, Neji's Gentle Fist fighting style based on
baguazhang
, and Tenten's attire and fighting style having a Chinese theme.

Team 3 is the only team from the
Konoha 11
 to have never been temporarily led by
Kakashi Hatake
. Although, in
Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles
, Kakashi temporarily replaces Guy due to an illness.

When
Iruka
 is assigning
Naruto
's graduating class to teams, number 3 is not on his list, possibly alluding to the fact they had been assigned the previous year.
