Boruto creates four
shadow clones
, one of which launches itself at the opponent, kicking them. The second shadow clone jumps in to continue the assault with a
Gentle Fist
 attack, after which the three other clones attack simultaneously with a series of attacks, launching their opponent into the air with
a defence-breaking combo attack
. The real Boruto then creates his
version of

Rasengan
 and, with the help of the clones, jumps into the air and throws the Rasengan at the opponent.
