Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Kabuto
 ponders that it was fortunate that
Mū
's
half
 was sealed before it could alert the Allied shinobi, and notes the reincarnated shinobi will need time to regenerate. Mū is disappointed that
Ōnoki
 failed to noticed his splitting, despite being his pupil, and praises the
fūinjutsu
 restraining his other half. Kabuto figures that since Mū's power was also split, it'll take him longer to perform a certain summon.
Naruto
 arrives at
Gaara
's location, informing him of the
Third Raikage
's sealing, while Gaara replies he's almost finished with the
Second Mizukage
, who despite viewing Naruto as being awkward and less composed than Gaara, sees that they form a good team. As he's sealed, the Mizukage is pleased with how much fun he had. Gaara orders that the HQ be updated on their situation.
Temari
 tell those injured to go for the medical team, including the Tsuchikage. Gaara confirms that the Naruto with them is a clone, and asks where the original is.
Killer B
 catches up with the original Naruto, telling him he was contacted by one of his clones. Naruto says that his clones should be reaching the battlefields. At the coast, the Allied shinobi devised a strategy so they don't fight each other trying to find
impostors
, but are left vulnerable to new attacks. A Naruto
shadow clone
 arrives, much to their relief. A
restrained

Dan
, intrigued by Naruto's resemblance to
Nawaki
, asks who he is. He's told of Naruto's status as the Nine-Tails'
jinchūriki
, his dreams of becoming
Hokage
 and
Tsunade
's faith in him by
Chōza
 and
Shikamaru

Logistical Support and Medical Division
 compound, two disguised White Zetsu almost strike
Sakura
, but are defeated by a Naruto clone. At another battlefield, another Naruto shadow clone identifies disguised White Zetsu, and saves
