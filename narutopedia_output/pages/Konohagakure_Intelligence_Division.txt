Konoha's Intelligence Division.



The
Konoha Intelligence Division
 (
木ノ葉隠れ情報部
,
Konohagakure Jōhōbu
) is one of the many organisations in
Konohagakure
. It is led by
Ibiki Morino
.

Overview

The village's Intelligence Division is a vast organisation with many sub-divisions serving various functions. One such division, the
Konoha Torture and Interrogation Force
, headed by Ibiki Morino, deals with detaining and extracting information from targets — by any means necessary. Another division, the
Analysis Team
, headed by
Inoichi Yamanaka
, specialises in extracting information
directly from the target's mind
, as seen with
Yūdachi
 — an
Ame
-nin captured by
Jiraiya
. Part of the Analysis Team is also responsible for carrying out autopsies, which was once headed by
Ranka
.

During
Pain's assault
 on Konoha, the building was destroyed by
Deva Path
's large-scale
Shinra Tensei
. In the aftermath of the assault, a makeshift building was created to temporarily house the division. After
Taka
's attack on the
Kage Summit
,
Karin
 was jailed here, where she was eventually interrogated by Ibiki himself before escaping. After the
Fourth Shinobi World War
,
Sasuke Uchiha
 was imprisoned for his crimes for almost a year until he was granted a pardon by the
Sixth Hokage
.
