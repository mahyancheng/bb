"
The Jashin Curse!!
" (
ジャシン教の呪い!!
,
Jashinkyō no Noroi!!
) is chapter 13 of the
Konoha Shinden
 manga.

Summary

Ryūki
 threatens to kill the sacrifices in order to stop
Mirai
 from arresting him. As she contemplates what to do, they are interrupted by the arrival of
Kakashi
 and
Guy
, who quickly defeat all of Ryūki's followers and release the sacrifices. Mirai is confused about how they were able to find her, so Kakashi explains that he had one of his
ninken
 track her. Mirai approaches Ryūki, inadvertently entering the
Jashin
 symbol he's prepared. By consuming some of the blood he acquired when he injured Mirai earlier, Ryūki is able to initiate
Curse Technique: Body Controlling Manipulated Blood
. Kakashi shouts a warning to her, but it is seemingly too late, as Mirai is apparently killed.

Mirai then reveals it was a mere
genjutsu
, and that what Ryūki thought was her blood was instead some of the iron-rich hot-spring water that she gathered with
Tatsumi
; she knew from her research into
Hidan
 that Jashin's curses require blood to work. Ryūki tries attacking Mirai, but he's unable to land a blow against her. Desperate, Ryūki captures Tatsumi and consumes some of her blood, thus initiating Body Controlling Manipulated Blood again. With it, he forces Tatsumi to fight Mirai.
