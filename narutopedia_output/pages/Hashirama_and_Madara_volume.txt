 (

Hashirama to Madara
) is volume 65 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 618

"
The Ones Who Know Everything
" (
全てを知る者たち
,
Subete o Shiru Monotachi
)

Orochimaru brings
Sasuke
,
Suigetsu
 and
Jūgo
 to the ruined
Uzumaki Clan's Mask Storage Temple
. Inside,
Orochimaru
 searches for a
particular mask
, disturbing
Suigetsu
 who found it strange that he knew exactly which one to choose. As they head back towards the village, Sasuke breaks away from the group to survey the village from a high point, which Orochimaru comments as something he needs to do as
Konoha
 is still his birthplace. Arriving at the
Uchiha clan
's destroyed compound, Sasuke
unseals the passageway
 leading towards the secret room of the
Naka Shrine
, lamenting its current condition. There, Orochimaru dons the mask which invokes the
Shinigami
, and explaining as he went along, slashes the Shinigami's stomach releasing the contents. These turn out to be the spirits of those the Shinigami had consumed, which returns Orochimaru's hands to him, but has the negative effect of reflecting the wound on him as well. On Orochimaru's instructions, Jūgo uses
natural energy
 to activate the
spores

Obito
 had
Zetsu
 leave on Sasuke to monitor him: six in total. Sacrificing four of them while Jūgo and
Suigetsu
 held down the other two, Orochimaru uses the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 and then transfers his being into one of the restrained Zetsu while Jūgo absorbed the other. The screaming White Zetsu spore clones are silenced once shrouded in dirt and ash, turned into the vessels of the men who collectively possessed knowledge of Konoha's history: the deceased
First
,
Second
,
Third
 and
Fourth Hokage
.

Chapter 619

"
A Clan Possessed by Evil
" (
悪に憑かれた一族
,
Aku ni Tsukareta Ichizoku
)

As the newly reincarnated
Hokage
 adjust to their circumstance,
Suigetsu
 marvels at being in the presence of
Hashirama
. When the situation of how their souls were
released
 and then they were
reincarnated
 is explained by
Hiruzen
 and
Minato
, Hashirama bluntly asks who the latter was. Announcing himself via his title of Fourth Hokage, Hashirama is pleased that the village had seemingly enjoyed such stability but was later shocked and bit apprehensive to hear that his granddaughter had inherited the title of Fifth Hokage. The banter between the Hokage is soon cut short after
Orochimaru
 allayed their outrage that he had reincarnated them to destroy Konoha and instead presented
Sasuke
 to them. From this point, Sasuke first questioned the Third about the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
 and Hiruzen sombrely confirmed all that the young man had been told, noting that this was something Itachi decided to shoulder himself. This led the conversation to segue into a conversation about the Uchiha with
Tobirama
 and his decision, as well as motives behind giving the clan the
Konoha Military Police Force
 as a sign of trust. Here it was revealed that the Uchiha was a clan possessed by evil, but above even the
Senju
, they valued love and friendship above all else, but as a result of this, its loss had an even greater-than-normal effect on them. Upon hearing all this, the young Uchiha turns towards the once-leader of the Senju clan, posing two questions to him: what the village meant, and what was the purpose of
shinobi
.

Chapter 620

"
Hashirama Senju
" (
千手柱間
,
Senju Hashirama
)

As
Sasuke
 boldly declares that
Hashirama
's response would decide whether or not he should take revenge on
Konohagakure
, an enraged
Tobirama
 states he would not allow it as he prepares to fight Sasuke. However, in a fierce exchange of silent wills that sends those around them into near-frenzied panic while the
Naka Shrine
 quakes from the energy from their stand off, Tobirama finally stands down at Hashirama's order with
Hiruzen
 breathing a sigh of relief and
Minato
 marvelled. Praising
Itachi
 to be a better shinobi than himself, Hashirama agrees to answer though it will be a long one. When he tells takes the First Hokage to make it abridged,
Orochimaru
 reveals the war occurring outside the village with
Madara
 leading the attack. While Hiruzen pleas Orochimaru to let them go and aid their people, Minato and Tobirama
sense
 the situation to confirm it, with the former glad that his
son
 was able to work with
Kurama
. Even after Orochimaru refuses to have them leave and considers having them ironically destroy Konoha on Sasuke's choice, Tobirama ignores his summoner's threat as he was about to go to the battlefield. However, thanks to now acquiring
Hashirama's genetic material
, the binding of the
Impure World Reincarnation
 had become more powerful with only Hashirama breaking free of the additional restraint. Allaying the
Sannin
's fears, Hashirama tells Orochimaru that he intends to first free Sasuke from
the darkness surrounded him
 as he casually takes a seat on the ground and begins the retelling of the story of his confrontation with Madara at the
Valley of the End
 and the history of the
Senju
 and
Uchiha
.

Chapter 621

"
Hashirama and Madara
" (
柱間とマダラ
,
Hashirama to Madara
)

When the
Tailed Beast Ball
 held by
Hashirama Senju
's
humanoid
 creation collides with
Madara Uchiha
's
Susanoo Sword
, it explodes. As the smoke clears, a Susanoo-clad
Nine-Tails
 is revealed ready to attack Hashirama as he emerged from his wooden
defence
. With Hashirama praising Madara, he quickly
grabs
 the ethereal sword and counters with several additional hands emerging from the ground to suppress the beast only for the
tailed beast
 to destroy with a swing from another blade. Not wanting the landscape of the current area to be completely decimated, Hashirama quickly retreats to the coastline prompting Madara to give chase. As the
Uchiha
 charged another Tailed Beast Ball onto Susanoo's sword and throws it, Hashirama summons
a set of barriers
 to deflect the attack. Hashirama then attempts to reason with his friend and comrade, wanting to stop the battle but Madara refuses, noting that he has gone too far. Knowing that Madara was beyond the point of being persuaded, Hashirama enters
Sage Mode
 and uses the
gigantic wooden construct
 with which he prepares to attack. As the battle progresses, Hashirama remembers the first time when he and Madara met, skipping stones by a river. When asked who he was, Hashirama noted that he was currently Madara's rival in stone skipping, at which he was winning.

Chapter 622

"
Reached
" (
届いた

Todoita

As
Madara
 and
Hashirama
 continue their conversation by the riverside, the banter between them is cut short when a body washes up near them. Moving to check the corpse out, Madara comes to realise that Hashirama is a
shinobi
 as he
stood atop the water
. Upon further inspection of the body, Hashirama realises that it belonged to a member of the
Hagoromo clan
 and he, and Madara decide to leave the riverbank. Heading back home, Hashirama is informed that
Kawarama
 had been killed on the battlefield, and as they stood by the graves with his youngest brother
Itama
 openly weeping, Hashirama questions his
father
 about the fact that innocent children were being sent on the battlefield to die. Affronted by this, Hashirama's father hits his son telling him that saying such things were an insult to Kawarama's memory who had died a proud shinobi on the battlefield. Unable to agree with this, Hashirama decries these actions further, but before his father can hit him again,
Tobirama
 intervenes offering that Hashirama was grieving and pleaded for their father's forgiveness. Later, the three brothers spoke of bringing peace to the world. Some time later on the battlefield, Itama would lose his life after being confronted by five members of the
Uchiha clan
. Affected deeply by the loss of his brother, Hashirama went back to the riverbed when he met Madara again, who caught him crying. At first, Hashirama refuses to share the reason for his shedding tears, but he eventually explains that his little brother Itama, had died. When asked if he had any siblings, Madara answers he's one of five brothers, then correcting himself, he noted that he
was
 one of five brothers. After Madara finally manages to skip the rock to the other side, the two talk about the death of their relatives and Madara offers words of comfort about a better future.

Chapter 623

"
One View
" (
一望
,
Ichibō
)

Hashirama
 and
Madara
 continued to meet in this manner by the riverside where they sparred with one another as well as talked about the future. During this time, the two grew closer as friends and worked on improving their weaknesses, all the while not revealing their last names. On one occasion, Madara almost let slip that he was an
Uchiha
, nearly bragging about the
visual prowess
 which he wielded, as Hashirama feverishly talked about creating a village where the elders would watch over the children who would be brought up to be strong and not carelessly sent to war to die. Hashirama also spoke about creating a system by which shinobi were assigned missions which played to their strengths and skill sets, after both young men relived the loss of their siblings. Creating a greeting method the two boys skipped their rocks across the river to one another until they met again, however, upon returning to the
Senju
 compound,
Tobirama
 informs his brother that their
father
 wanted to speak with him. Revealing that he had tailed them upon their father's request, Butsuma tells his son that the young boy he had been spending his time with was an Uchiha who had killed several of their strongest clansmen on his own. Coaxing his son, Butsuma told Hashirama that he was to gather intelligence on the young man and report to them, else he be seen as a traitor for his actions. Faced with the only other option to kill Madara, the pair met up by the river and, at Madara's behest, skipped their rocks across to one another as a greeting. Reacting, the two boys immediately bid each other farewell, having told one another that a trap had been laid for them via the stones they had skipped to one another. However, both Butsuma Senju and
Tajima Uchiha
 appear on the field accompanied by their sons Tobirama and
Izuna
 respectively. Both Hashirama and Madara who were in the process of fleeing look on as the two sides greeted one another — no love lost between the pair.

Chapter 624

"
Draw
" (
相子
,
Aiko
)

Knowing full-well that their power was more or less evenly matched, in order to gain the upper-hand as the four of them clashed,
Butsuma
 and
Tajima
 — again thinking along the same lines — decided to target
Izuna
 and
Tobirama
 respectively, hoping to use the shock of a parent losing a child before their very eyes as a method to gain an advantage. However, their attacks were stopped by
Hashirama
 and
Madara
, who had turned in time to see and prevent what was about to happen. Seeing the attack on his brother as an unforgivable act, Madara declared that they had reached an impasse, noting that their pipe-dreams would die there. Determined to fight, Tajima enquired whether or not Madara was prepared to take them on, but Madara noted that Hashirama was stronger than he was and the outcome would not be in their favour. As they prepared to depart, Madara stated that the next time they would see each other was on the battlefield as
Uchiha
 and
Senju
, activating his Sharingan for the first time. Thus beginning the non-stop battling between the two, and eventually, the two would inherit the leadership of their respective clans. During one such battle, Tobirama
fatally wounded
 Izuna on the battlefield. Despite the fact that Hashirama once again attempted to create peace between the two clans, Madara refused and left the battlefield with his injured brother. In time, the fact that the Uchiha were inferior to the power of the Senju became abundantly clear and defectors began to come to the Senju side. The next time they met on the battlefield, Madara had acquired the
Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan
 and remarked that his brother had died from the wound Tobirama had inflicted on him. Despite his new-found power, Madara was still defeated, but Hashirama, still seeking peace, halted his brother from killing the Uchiha and asked Madara if the two of them could not settle it like they used to. To this, Madara declared that they had lost his trust and the only way to regain this was if Hashirama were to kill himself or his brother.

Chapter 625

"
The Real Dream
" (
本当の夢
,
Hontō no Yume
)

While
Tobirama
 and the other
Senju
 present start protesting
Madara
's ludicrous proposal,
Hashirama
 — having come to a decision — thanks Madara for being so sympathetic as to have given him two choices so that he did not have to kill his brother. Removing his
armour
, Hashirama imparts his final words to his kinsmen, telling them to swear that
Uchiha
 and Senju would not fight again. However, before Hashirama stabbed himself with the
kunai
, Madara grabs his hand , noting that seeing his resolve to go through with his request was enough. After this, Madara agreed to the treaty, and in the time to follow that the
village
 was established. Meeting atop the same mountain they had met as children and seeing their dreams realised before them, Hashirama and Madara discussed the future, with Hashirama noting that he wanted to make Madara the
Hokage
 so he could watch over the entire village and
etch
 his face into the very rock they stood on. Madara would later coin the name of the village: Konohagakure — which Hashirama noted lacked imagination. They were later joined by
Tobirama
 who called away his brother for the meeting with the
daimyō
 of the
Land of Fire
, exchanging not a single word with Madara. Back in the village, Tobirama noted that they were no longer in the same time as their
father
 and that decisions such as who should be the head of the village were not to be done without democratic involvement. Tobirama also noted that Hashirama was more likely to become the village's leader, and as he broached the subject of the possible Uchiha threat, Hashirama cut across him telling him to stop thinking in that manner. Their conversation is cut short when Hashirama believes that they were being eavesdropped on. Not seeing anyone outside the window, and Tobirama not able to
confirm nor deny
 it, Hashirama finds the leaf Madara had mere moments before outside the window. Hashirama was eventually chosen as the Hokage, and during a meeting with Madara in the
Naka Shrine
's secret room, Hashirama tried to plead with Madara, noting that in time people would come to understand him and as such, he would inherit the title from him. Madara noted, however, that in all likelihood, Tobirama would inherit that title, leaving no place for him, or even the Uchiha he feared, in the village. His resolve formed, Madara declared that he was leaving the village, and that this world was nothing more than mere entertainment, and that he looked forward to fighting with Hashirama as he went about realising
his own dreams
.

Chapter 626

"
Hashirama and Madara — 2
" (
柱間とマダラ 其ノ弐
,
Hashirama to Madara — Sono Ni
)

Confused about what
Madara
 said,
Hashirama
 questions his friend, asking if what they were building in the village wasn't his true dreams. Madara rebuffs Hashirama, noting that his dream had no connection to the village. Despite the fact that Madara abandoned
Konohagakure
, other nations praised the innovative system that had been created and soon began to imitate it upon seeing what two previously rival clans could create. As time passed, the village flourished greatly, however, this was punctuated with random attacks on the village by Madara. In what would become their ultimate battle on
the edge of the Land of Fire and Land of Sound
, after the
Susanoo
-clad
Kurama
 was shattered by
a thousand punches
, the titanic battle waned down to the two men facing each other directly —
sword
 and
kama
 respectively. As Hashirama fell, Madara noted that unlike all the other times, he was the one left standing. As Hashirama tried to speak reason to his former comrade and Madara constantly ridiculed the dream they once shared, Hashirama pierces Madara from behind with a sword revealing that it was only a
wood clone
 that fell and not Hashirama himself. Declaring that he would protect his village believing it to be the best way to protect
shinobi
, and that anyone that tried to destroy that would receive no forgiveness from him. As Madara fell, Hashirama resolved himself to endure in order to protect his dream while Madara, still resolute, declared that he would one day become darkness which enveloped the village. Back in present day, Hashirama tells those present on site that he did not know how Madara survived, because he was sure he had killed him. He then goes on to tell them that it was for the sake of the village. After explaining what his vision for the village was, Hashirama goes on to explain that shinobi were people who endure to achieve their goals, but depending on what they chose as their goals, it could change who they were; like the way Madara, and he himself had changed.

Chapter 627

"
Sasuke's Answer
" (
サスケの答え
,
Sasuke no Kotae
)

With
Hashirama
 finishing his story, Sasuke iterated how ironic it was that his brother
Itachi
, who was from the
Uchiha clan
, and had never heard Hashirama's story directly from the source, was the one who had inherited his
will
 so strongly. However
Tobirama
 notes that there had been several Uchiha throughout history which had transcended the limitations of their clan and put the village first. One such person who stood out in his mind was
Kagami Uchiha
. Noting that he did not hate the Uchiha, but in his capacity as Second
Hokage
, had to find a way to mediate between clans and the village's well-being — the former being something he noted his brother foolishly thought would dissipate with the creation of the village system. In turn, both the
Third
 and
Fourth
, noted that they had fallen short of their predecessor, and the expectations people had of them respectively. Having heard all he needed from the Hokage, Sasuke comes to the conclusion that the village and people that Itachi sacrificed his life to protect should not be
wasted
, and decides to enter the battlefield in order to follow his brother's will, with
Orochimaru
 following out of interest. Motioning to Tobirama to prepare to
transport
 them, Tobirama informs his brother that they could not do so because they were bound. As they left the
Naka Shrine
, Suigetsu who decided that fighting alongside who he deemed the four strongest reincarnated shinobi and three
monsters
 was not a viable option tried to slip away, only to be met by a kick from
Karin
. She yells that she will never forgive him for what he did and Sasuke immediately apologises. Karin, who visibly cannot contain herself, runs up to Orochimaru and tells him that he stabbed her. He recommends that she should cooperate Sasuke for the time being so she reluctantly rubs against Sasuke, saying she has no other choice. As the Hokage prepare to make their way to the main battlefield, Hashirama — who can barely contain his excitement at this point upon seeing the village again — directs his fellow Hokage to their respective faces on the
Hokage Rock
 before declaring that he wanted to know what his
old friend
 had been up to, Tobirama declares that this time he would stop Madara for good, Hiruzen notes that he had not been to war in so long but vows to give his all this time, and Minato, delighted that he will finally meet his
son
, promises to make up for not being there with a huge surprise.

Author's Note

“

I've recently started going out to eat with my assistants after work. Once we get our drinks I always end up leading the toast. But my assistants' eyes seem to be stating that simply saying "thanks for your hard work today" is somewhat insufficient... Ah, but, there ain't much variation that can be had there!!!
