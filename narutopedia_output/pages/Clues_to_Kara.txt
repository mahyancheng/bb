Synopsis

After learning that
Konoha
 knows about their
Ten-Tails
,
Jigen
 has
its coordinates
 changed and orders
Code
 on guarding it.
Delta
 informs Jigen that
Boro
 is dead, having investigated it after receiving no further communication from him. She also found the remains of the
Hokage
's seal, with him absent. Jigen speculates
Sasuke
 is responsible, but Delta believes it was
someone much stronger
. Jigen sends Code on his task and orders Delta to return. In Konoha,
Shikamaru
 and
Sai
 tell
Konohamaru
 about
Boro's cult
. Because they believe the cult can give them answers about
Kara
,
Naruto
 assigns Sai and Konohamaru to infiltrate it. The two intend to find the
teleportation device

Kawaki
 told Konoha that Kara uses to move around. They're welcomed by
Akari
, who informs them Boro is busy, and might not show up that day. She tells them of her background, and that her brother was chosen by Boro to communicate with the gods directly. Akari directs them to
Shirabe
 and
Tsuzumi
, who might know when Boro will be present. They claim Boro is away, dealing with an
outbreak
 in a distant village.
 Akari asks about her brother
Kagari
, and they claim that Boro informed them that Kagari's role was expanded, and that should be proud of her brother. Sai and Konohamaru are shown around by
Inori
, who tells them about the kind of people who have come to the cult, and reveals the salvation Boro preaches is the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
. They begin investigating Akari and her brother, whom the cult claims Boro communicated about the day before, even though Sai and Konohamaru know he's dead. Akari reveals she would receive letters from her brother, but those have stopped, and that she knows no chosen cultists like Kagari who have returned. They believe Kagari was sent to Kara, so they decide to stir things up, and claim to Shirabe and Tsuzumi they heard a rumour that Boro was dead from some Konoha shinobi. Tsuzumi claims to retreat to meditate, but Sai and Konohamaru discover him in a hidden room trying to contact Boro, and question him about Kara. When they discover something in the room's books, Tsuzumi throws a virus bottle at them and runs. They catch up to him, and reveal they're immune to the virus because their friends fought Boro. Other cultists arrive, and claiming they're bandits, Tsuzumi orders them to capture Sai and Konohamaru. Konohamaru reveals that Boro was the one responsible for the outbreaks they all faced, and that Boro's chosen were actually used in experiments. Sai shows them the book with the chosen marked as deceased. Shirabe claims they don't understand Boro, who hasn't deceived them at all, and spins his actions as unrestrained devotion to saving others. Konohamaru reveals Boro is dead, and that no one has been able to contact him. Delta arrives through a space-time gate and begins destroying the place. Sai and Konohamaru begin evacuating the cultists. Tsuzumi is crushed by falling debris. Shirabe, Inori, and the others refuse to leave or believe that Boro is dead, choosing to wait for his return as they don't belong anywhere else. They're pulverised by Delta's attacks. Konohamaru sees her, and is confused by her presence, aware that Naruto defeated her before. They leave the crumbling building. Delta leaves after destroying the space-time gate as well. Akari mourns Kagari. Back at Konoha, they report Delta's return, and the information they were able to acquire on Boro's Vessel experiments. They reaffirm their commitment to stopping Kara.
