The user sends their
chakra
 into a target's nervous system, giving them full control over the target's body. Unlike the
Mind Body Switch Technique
, the user's consciousness remains within their own body while they use this technique, meaning that it can safely be used even when the user is outnumbered. It is when outnumbered that this technique is most useful, as the user's opponents can be made to kill each other. Because only their bodies are being controlled, targets remain aware of what their body is doing, though they won't understand why. Users can control targets even from a distance, allowing the user to sow confusion among the target and their allies.

Trivia

Despite
Inoichi Yamanaka
 claiming that the
Yamanaka
 can only manipulate one person at a time with their techniques,
 this technique can freely manipulate multiple bodies simultaneously.

When this technique was used in
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2
 and the later games, Inoichi suddenly appears in front of Ino in order to tell the victim he'll be his opponent. He then uses this technique, immobilizing the opponent with the intent to let her daughter attack the victim. She then runs to his opponent and punches them into the sky. Both high-five afterwards.
