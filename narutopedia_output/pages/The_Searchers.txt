Naruto
 manga.

Summary

The mark on
Naruto
's hand is meant to give him a focal point for his
chakra
 output, concentrating the
Rasengan
's strength on one specific point rather than dissipating it over a larger area. This does little to help him. Meanwhile,
Orochimaru
 is in agony from the seal placed on him by the
Third Hokage
. With
Kabuto
 unable to do anything for him, they decide to go looking for
Tsunade
. Kabuto tells him that she is in
Tanzaku Quarters
, which
Jiraiya
 also finds out in the course of his own investigation. In Tanzaku, Tsunade, a gambler with terrible luck, hits a winning streak, which causes her great concern.
