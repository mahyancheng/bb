"
Iruka's Decision
" (
イルカの決意
,
Iruka no Ketsui
) is episode 178 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Iruka
 runs into the forest, recalling how he was told by a fellow teacher that there were still enemy spies in the area. He manages to find
Naruto
, and attempts to pressure him into returning to the
Academy
. Naruto tells Iruka that the latter could not possibly understand what his life is like, being isolated and treated like dirt and that he has to do this in order to finally have friends and be accepted. Iruka remains steadfast, prompting Naruto to use his
Sexy Technique
 to distract Iruka as he escapes.

Naruto, hungry, decides to raid a bird's nest when he finds an enemy's kunai. Unaware that the kunai has a secret intel report tied to it, Naruto attempts to return to the village, only to be ambushed by
three kunoichi
, who demand that he turn over the kunai. Not willing to give it up, Naruto flees, triggering various traps to delay the
kunoichi
. As he trips and falls over a cliff, he is found by Iruka, who picks him up and attempts to flee. The duo are saved by the arrival of
Kakashi
, who had been tipped off by
Shikamaru
, and he defeats the kunoichi with ease using his
Lightning Cutter
.

Back in
Konoha
, the
Third Hokage
 muses that the intel contained Konoha's patrol patterns and that by finding it, Naruto had inadvertently saved the village. Iruka thanks the Third for making him Naruto's teacher, claiming that he rediscovered his original passion for teaching and wishes to pass on the
Will of Fire
 to students like Naruto. Outside the Academy, Iruka scolds Naruto for his reckless actions. When Iruka mentions that the Third Hokage is powerful and respected by all of the villagers, and that it was the
Fourth Hokage
 who defended the village from the
Nine-Tails
, Naruto makes it his personal goal to become
Hokage
 someday; hearing this, Iruka scratches a line into the tree with his
kunai
 and tells Naruto that once he reaches that height, he might be able to become Hokage.

In the present day, Iruka smiles fondly at the mark as he realises that Naruto has reached that height.
Yamato
, who had been alerted that Naruto had entered into his
eight-tailed
 form, rushes to the village and stares at its destruction. However,
Shikaku
 tells him that it was
Pain
 who had destroyed the village, and that Naruto single-handedly defeated him. Yamato is shocked that Naruto was able to do so, and is even more surprised when Shikaku tells him that Naruto was able to control his transformation on his own. At the same time, an
Anbu
 member appears and tells Shikaku that there is an emergency council meeting being held and that his presence is requested.

Elsewhere, a resting
Sasuke
 wonders where
Suigetsu
 is. At that moment, Suigetsu show up through the door wielding his
Kubikiribōchō
, revealing that he had travelled all the way back to the
Valley of Clouds and Lightning
 just to retrieve it. With Suigetsu's return, Sasuke mobilises
Taka
 and informs them that they are to head to Konoha right away. Meanwhile,
Zetsu
 notifies
Kisame
 and
Tobi
 that Pain has been killed and that
Konan
 has left as well. Tobi tasks Kisame with capturing the
Eight-Tails
 while he, needing the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 to further their agenda, claims that he has something to attend to.
