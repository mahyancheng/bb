Plot Overview






Tsukino being controlled.



Following Naruto's story, Kakashi mentioned that Tsukino actually succeeded her father recently. However, none of them knew that Shinga had taken over Tsukigakure and Tsukino with
his group
, as well as his
Jibakugan
. She was seen with the defeated Konoha-nin when Team Kakashi encountered her. She used her fūinjutsu to seal
Team Kakashi
's chakra and commanded her henchmen to attack them. After her fūinjutsu was dispelled, Tsukino left with Shinga and his group.

Later, she, Shinga, and
Hakui
 found the
sealed hall in Konoha
 where the kinjutsu was sealed away and she dispelled the seals on the stone. After she dispelled the seal, she was later guarding the sealed hall while Shinga and Hakui are collecting kinjutsu. When Naruto, Sakura, and Kakashi arrived, Tsukino sealed their chakra again and fought them. After her defeat, her mask was broken and her face was revealed which caused Naruto shocked as he recognised her. As Naruto tried to talk to her, she didn't respond to him because of the Jibakugan. When Shinga performed his Jibakugan on
Kotetsu
 and
Izumo
 while Jiraiya saved
Tsunade
, Naruto, and his team, Tsukino left with Shinga and Hakui after finding the kinjutsu, the
Demon Shinki
 and Naruto chased after them.

After Naruto chased after Tsukino, Shinga commanded her to attack Naruto. As Shinga left with
Dōshin
 and Hakui, Tsukino sealed the chakra from Naruto along with
Neji
 and
Tenten
 and attacked them. Naruto freed Tsukino by using the perfume she gave it to him when the Jibakugan reacted to the scent. After she returned to normal, Tsukino guided Naruto and his team to Tsukigakure.

While Kakashi and Sai fought against Dōshin, and Sakura healed a boy Tsukino knew, she broke down into tears, realising that it was her fault because of Shinga. Naruto told her about the bonds he has with his friends, experiences, and farewells, and kept them as strong, allowing him to keep going forward. It also stated that Tsukino told Naruto about forging a friendship to make it to become stronger, which made her better.

Tsukino used her fūinjutsu on Shinga to seal his chakra from recovering himself from the roots, allowing Naruto and
Sasuke Uchiha
 to defeat him. After Shinga's demise, Tsukino returned as the leader of Tsukigakure with no more regrets due to being inspired by Naruto. In the end, she believed he is the hero in the legend.

Trivia

Tsukino also makes a cameo appearance in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2
. In the story mode of
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2
, after Naruto purchases a book based on when he saved Tsukigakure, he would receive letters from Tsukino.

Quotes

(Reciting the
Tsukigakure
's legend)
"In a time of war, a wanderer from afar did happen upon Tsukigakure. Great were the trials he endured to drive off the destruction that placed the moon in such peril. He had a noble heart and a spirit bound by none. So was revealed our heroic saviour. His name rang with the pureness of his soul. Like unto a gentle breeze."
