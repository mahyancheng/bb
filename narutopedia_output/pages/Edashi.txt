Land of Ancestors

 and
Asura Ōtsutsuki

Background






Edashi and his friends are going to chase the boar.



When a wild boar began to come to the gardens of the inhabitants of the country and spoil the harvest, Taizō gathered friends and offered to hunt him down. Although Gasuka remarked that it was dangerous, Taizō assured him that Asura would protect them with
Ninshū
, who agreed, and Edashi talked about the animal ruining the gardens. After some time, they managed to reach the boar, which pursued Asura and killed
Shiro
 who was protecting him. Edashi and the others hid in a tree while Asura was rescued by his brother
Indra
.

Many years later, as adults, Edashi and Gasuka came to Taizō, who was hiding in a hut on a hill, and informed him that
Hagoromo
 sent Asura on a mission to another village. When Asura was appointed as Hagoromo's successor, Edashi attended the party, after helping to fight Indra, who was unhappy with his father's choice.
