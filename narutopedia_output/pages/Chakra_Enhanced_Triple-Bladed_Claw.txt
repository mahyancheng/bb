This type of tekagi-shuko is a claw with three blades which can be enhanced with the user's
chakra
, even the user's
chakra nature
. It has the same effect as
Asuma Sarutobi
's
trench knives
.

The original weapon that Sora wielded was broken in a battle with
Furido
. However, due to an act of kindness from Asuma, it was later reforged with the same special material that was used to make his trench knives. During
Naruto
's confrontation with the
four-tailed
 Sora, he uses a broken piece of the claw to injure himself in an attempt to prevent his own transformation.
