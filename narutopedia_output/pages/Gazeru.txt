Gazeru
 (
ガゼル
) is an
Anbu
 from
Konohagakure
.

Appearance

Gazeru is a slender woman with long purple hair that reaches past her back. She wears the typical Konohagakure-Anbu attire, including the tattoo on the right arm and her porcelain mask has a cat-motif with three vertical lines at the top and three on each side for whiskers.

Abilities

As an elite Anbu, Gazeru is a strong
kunoichi
. With her excellent observational skills, she calmly analyses her enemies.
 She was also shown wielding a
sword
, implying skills in
kenjutsu
.

Part II

Pain's Assault

Gazeru guarded the
Fifth Hokage
 during
Pain's assault
 on Konoha. She suggested allowing
Pain
 to leave the village so they can organise a counter-attack only to realise that Pain was not fleeing but preparing a massive attack. She followed Tsunade into the air to try to stop him, but they were promptly
blown out of the sky
.

Trivia

In the anime, Gazeru was replaced by
Yūgao Uzuki
 as Tsunade's guard,
 possibly due to their similar appearances and the lack of confirmation that Gazeru was a different character until the publication of the
Jin no Sho
 years later.
