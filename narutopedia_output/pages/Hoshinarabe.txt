The cards.



Hoshinarabe
 (
星ならべ
,
Viz:
 Star Lines) is a card game popular among the prisoners of the
Astronomy Research Institute
, discovered in the Institute's library a few months prior to the events of
Sasuke Retsuden
. The game uses a deck of sixty cards, with five copies of each of the twelve card types. Players are dealt a hand of six cards, and then take turns discarding and drawing new cards. After five turns, whoever has the best hand, or "role" (
役
,
yaku
), is declared the winner. The game is noted to be similar to
poker
.

The cards' pictures are based on paintings originally done by the
Sage of Six Paths
, kept as a collection known as the
Map of the Heavens
 (
天体絵図
,
Tentai Ezu
). Although the paintings themselves are unattributed, they use a type of ink not native to the
Land of Redaku
;
Sakura Haruno
 recognises the ink as being used by
Sai
 for his
Super Beast Imitating Drawing
, which leads her to suspect the Sage as the original painter. Close examination of the original paintings reveals dots throughout, signifying that they represent different
constellations
 visible from Redaku during each month of the year. This in turn connects each card with one of the
zodiac signs
, and by extension a specific
hand seal
.

The Sage created Hoshinarabe as one of the clues to acquiring
polar particles
, a strange substance that can cure an illness unique to
jinchūriki
. By performing the hand seals dictated by the two strongest roles, Star and Earth, at the location where the polar particles are hidden, the polar particles would reveal themselves.

Trivia






A card's reverse side.



The backs of the cards use a picture of what resembles a lizard on a rock.
Sasuke Uchiha
, after initially thinking the lizard looks like
Menō
, realises it is actually a picture of a
dinosaur
 and a
meteor
.

Because the cards are centuries old, each has a unique blemish, such as a tear or scratch, that can be used by players to identify which cards their opponent has. Because of the attention to detail this would require, as well as the sheer amount of memorisation it would demand, none until
Sakura Haruno
 had thought to do so.
