Summary

Naruto
 thinks about his lunch with
Iruka
. Iruka is happy with Naruto's development, but informs him that he will now need to start doing actual work. After the failed
Konoha Crush
, the
village
 is operating with a diminished manpower and ninja are being sent on more difficult missions and more often. Naruto is eager to start doing his part. After
Team 10
 has lunch,
Ino
 tells
Shikamaru
 that
Chōji
 should go on a diet. Shikamaru defends him. Chōji tells Shikamaru that, now that he is a
chūnin
, his superiority to
Sasuke
 and
Neji
 is only more apparent. Shikamaru is unconcerned since he only wants to be himself, which he tells Chōji to strive for too. Naruto visits Sasuke in the hospital. Because so many others have shown a special interest in Naruto, Sasuke demands that they fight each other. Naruto accepts.
