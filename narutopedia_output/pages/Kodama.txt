Kodama
 (
コダマ
) is the brother of
Hibiki
.

Background

After his father's murder and the investigation going nowhere over lack of evidence, Kodama and Hibiki became dedicated to avenging their father by finding the
killer
, who was a proficient
Wind Release
 user and was left with a cross shaped scar after the encounter with their father. They would go from village to village attacking ex-shinobi who were Wind Release users, though they never killed any of their victims, leaving only cross shaped tears on their clothing to identify them. Kodama and his sister would then spend a year in Konoha trying to find ex-shinobi who were Wind Release users.

Abilities

Kodama has some skill in kenjutsu. He seems to be a cook, using an oden cart as a cover for moving around without raising suspicion, and has some skill in treating injuries.

New Era

Upon seeing Hibiki talking with Mitsuki, he warned her not to befriend shinobi. The two attacked another shinobi and were pursued by Team 7. He quickly pretends to work on his oden cart, claiming the assailants jumped up to a nearby roof to Mitsuki. Back in their apartment, he tended to Hibiki's injured arm, assuring her there was only one more target for them to check before leading a normal life. The next night, the two ambushed Daizen, but his knowledge of their tactics from reading the newspaper prevented him from being knocked out by their sleeping smoke. Daizen attacked them with his Wind Release, injuring Hibiki, and convincing Kodama he's their father's killer. Mitsuki blocked his attack, the rest of Team 7 and Kōtarō catching up. After exposing and capturing Daizen, Kodama and Hibiki were only banished from Konoha, as they didn't actually kill anyone in their attacks.
