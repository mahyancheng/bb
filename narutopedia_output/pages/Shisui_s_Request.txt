Shisui no Irai
) is episode 454 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Fugaku
 feeds the fish in the
Uchiha
 District, and talks to
Itachi
 about the
Sharingan
 as he leaves. Itachi is angry that Fugaku doesn't care
Tenma Izumo
 died, but hides it.
Sasuke
 wants to play with Itachi, but he has a mission.
Shisui
 tells Sasuke he has to borrow Itachi. Itachi accompanies Shisui in a three-part training exercise. The two track a fugitive during the day, noticing decoys left along the way. At night, the two eat and talk. Tenma's death continues to weigh on Itachi.
 He tells Shisui he awakened the Sharingan. The two hear a fight and arrive to find three
Root
 members attacking a
Konoha Anbu
 for a scroll containing information about a traitor. The attacked Anbu, a water clone, dissolves. The Root members remain unconcerned, having poisoned the real one. Shisui and Itachi fight the three Root members. Itachi turns a trap one of the Root Anbu set against herself. Shisui defeats all of the other Root members, who retreat with the other two. Shisui receives a signal that his exercise is over. The injured Anbu wants to keep the incident a secret. Shisui's superiors are glad that no one got hurt, despite the fight not being a part of the exercise. Shisui tends to a small injury of Itachi's, who still needs to get used to delay between his Sharingan's perception and his reaction time. Shisui takes Itachi back to the Uchiha compound, and the two talk about the events of the day. Years later, Itachi joins the Anbu to watch Konoha from the shadows.

Trivia

In one scene, Itachi's Sharingan is mistakenly depicted with three tomoe instead of two. In another one, Itachi can be seen with Sharingan deactivated, despite already having it active during the fight.
