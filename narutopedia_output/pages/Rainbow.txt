Lyrics

Rōmaji

Wakatten'da yo

Hoka no daredemo nakute

Kono sora ippai no niji o kakete miseru yo

Itsumade tatte mo todo kanai yo

Ato nankai  mo kuri kaesu nichijou

Oikaketeru no wa itsuka jibun de egaita mirai

Mata dareka no seini shiteta

Wakatten'da yo

Kono mama ja damena koto

Kono mede midashita “ashita no jibun” wa mou shinjite ii'n desuka?

Wakatten'da yo

Ika nakucha ikenai koto

Niji no mukou de matteru mou hitotsu no mirai e

Wakatten'da yo

Wakatten'da yo

Kanji

解ってんだよ

他の誰でもなくて

この空いっぱいの虹をかけてみせるよ

何時まで経っても届かないよ

あと何回も繰り返す日常

追いかけてるのはいつか自分で描いた未来

また誰かの所為にしてた

解ってんだよ

其の侭じゃ駄目な事

この目で見出した“明日の自分”はもうしんじていいんですか？

解ってんよ

行かなくちゃいけない事

虹の向こうで待ってるもう一つの未来へ

解ってんだよ

解ってんだよ

English

I know very well

I understand better than anyone else

I'll show you the end of the rainbow.

When will I be able to reach it?

How many times will I have to repeat it?

I'll keep chasing my picture of the future.

Again, I put the blame on someone else.

I know very well

All of this is useless

After seeing my eyes, can you still believe in your tomorrow?

I know very well

You didn't have to go

Beyond the rainbow, a single future is waiting

I know very well

I know very well

Rōmaji (Full Version)

Itsumade tattemo todokanai yo

Wakatten dayo...

English (Full Version)

English Translation: No matter how much time passes, I can't reach it

How many times more do I have to repeat these days?

Even if I do reach it, it doesn't end there

for even if I grasp it, the mirage slips and fades away

I get it, it's no good like this

Where did my self that ocassionally acted as my "ideal self" go?

I get it, if it's like this it'll end

Below a downpour, I'm circling the same spot

Since when have I been like this?

I've turned against that special existence like a "rainbow"

Even if I peek through the mirror, I can't see myself

The moment I noticed that, once again I fell into solitude

The one who pierced me was my past self who told himself lies

The things I dislike about myself have increased again

I get it, this words are my own

It's just that I've been soaking in the remains of the dead

I get it, no one but I

will cross the sky full of rainbows

What I'm chasing is a future crafted by myself

I've blame it on someone else again

I get it, it's no good like this

Is it fine to believe in my "future self" that I discovered with these eyes?

I know it, I have to go

to the other side of the rainbow, where another future awaits me

I know it...
