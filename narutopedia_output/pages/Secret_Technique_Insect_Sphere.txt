The user sends their
kikaichū
 to spread over a wide range, and the moment they locate the target, the insects gather at once, forming a sphere around the target. They then attach themselves to the target and begin eating away at their
chakra
. Even if the target manages to escape, the insects will immediately follow.

Trivia

In the
Ultimate Ninja Storm series
, this technique is instead used to send a large, slow-moving sphere of insects towards the opponent.
