"
The Hidden Plot Set Into Motion
" (
動き出した陰謀
,
Ugokidashita Inbō
) is episode 410 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Gaara
 creates his
Third Eye
 to observe the events in the
Demon Desert
. At the same time,
Yōrō
 and
Kegon
 try to convince
Fū
 to go to the direction of the tower, with her speaking up that she wants to find some friends first. Her mind quickly changes, however, when her teammates bring up
Shibuki
. Meanwhile, Gaara notices
Team Matsuri
, who are heading towards the tower, with
Mikoshi
 informing his teammates about a plan, which would involve them getting the scroll they need. As the team rushes towards the tower, they get noticed by
Hōichi
.
 At the same time,
Fugi
 recalls his meeting with Hōichi and their plan to seal
Shukaku
 in a tea kettle, with Gaara being the necessary sacrifice for it, and creates a
barrier
 that overwrites the village's
Sensing Barrier
 and creates a huge sandstorm in the surrounding area. The headquarters notice the issue, with
Kankurō
 and
Temari
 quickly rounding-up the available troops and leaving to help out the
genin
 who are taking the
Chūnin Exams
 in the desert. Meanwhile, two
shinobi
 are seen standing guard in front of Gaara's office, checking up on him so that he wouldn't leave the room, only to be fooled by a
sand clone
. As the sandstorm rages on, many teams collapse from exhaustion, but are eventually saved by Kankurō, Temari and other
Sunagakure
 shinobi.
Team Guy
 manages to shield themselves from the sandstorm. Meanwhile, Team Matsuri are seen struggling, with Mikoshi accidentally falling in quicksand. As his teammates try to help him get out, Fū overhears them and rushes to their aid, recalling her past and friendship with Shibuki. As
Matsuri
 and
Yukata
 both fall into the sand alongside their teammate, they are saved by Fū's
Net-Shaped Prison
. Fū uses her
healing ability
 to treat them, only to be approached by Gaara, who tells her about
Naruto
 and notes her likeness to him. Fū tries to give
Matsuri
 her scroll, but the kunoichi refuses to accept it, recalling the training she had with Gaara. At the same time, Hōichi notices the
Kazekage
 and prepares to attack.

Trivia

The rope of Matsuri's
jōhyō
 could be seen at Mikoshi's wrist even before it was wrapped around it.
