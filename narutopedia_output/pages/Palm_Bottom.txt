 into the area of the foe where struck to either stun them, or if a more sufficient amount of chakra is used, cause severe internal damage.

 palm bottom) is short for "Shōteiuchi" (
掌底打ち

palm heel strike
" and basically consists of hitting the opponent with the thick part of the palm closest to the wrist.
