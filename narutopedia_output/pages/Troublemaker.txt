Lyrics

Rōmaji

Yumemiru toraburumeikā

Hitori de dekiru furi o shite

Furueru hiza o daite tsuyogatteru

Wagamama kogitsune fuaitā

Hatenaga uzumaita sekai

Mienai kizuna musunde

Hashitteku

Mado kara tobasu kamihikōki

Sora aokute

Anata ga naitekureta kara tsuyoku nareta no kana

Sā, yaru dake yattemiyō yo

Kore ga yume demo ī jan

Senobi toka shichattemo ī janai? (Oh)

I wanna be with you

(GO GO) Yurase emōshon

(LET'S GO) Kitto daijōbu

(GO GO) Aozora no hate made tobashiteyuke

Kanji

夢見るトルブルメイカー

一人でできるふりをして

震えるひざを抱いて

強がつてる

わがまま子狐フアイター

ハテナガ渦巻いた世界

見えないキズナ結んで

走つてく

窓から飛ばす紙飛行機

空青くて

あなたが泣いてくれたから

強くなれたのかな

さあ、やるだけやつてみよほよ

これが夢でもいいじやん

背伸びかしちやつても良いじゃない? (Oh)

I wanna be with you

(GO GO) 揺らせエモーション

(LET'S GO) きっと大丈夫

(GO GO) 青空の果てまで飛ばしていけ

English

A dream-keeper troublemaker.

Able at disadvantage, alone.

Even with trembling knee, showing courage.

A selfish young fox fighter.

In a world that's a whirlpool of wonder.

Ties together bonds the eye can't see as he runs on through.

The paper aeroplane I throw out from the window fly out to the bluish sky.

I wonder is it because you cried for me that I could become this strong?

Come now, just do whatever we can.

Cause it's alright to have a dream.

Isn't even pushing to the limit and overreaching is alright? (Oh)

I wanna be with you.

(GO GO) Shake your emotion.

(Let's go) Surely it's alright.

(GO GO) Let's leap to the boundary of the blue sky.

English (Full Version)

A dreaming trouble maker,

Pretending she can do it all alone,

Is clutching her shaking knees as she tries to play tough.

While a selfish fox cub fighter,

In a world that’s a whirlpool of wonder,

Ties together bonds the eye can’t see as he runs on through.

The paper plane I throw from this window,

Flies through a sky so blue –

I wonder… is it because you cried for me,

That I could become this strong?

C’mon, let’s try to do whatever we can –

I don’t care if this is a dream!

And we might as well challenge ourselves a bit in the process, don’t ya think? (Oh)

I wanna be with you!

(Go go) Set your emotions shakin’!

(Let’s go) I’m sure it’ll all be fine!

(Go go) Send it flyin’ to the farthest reaches of that blue sky!

Short me out with your dazzling glare –

Your eyes are a passionate sun!

Right now we could go beyond everything, even fate!

Occasionally I get sad,

My memories in a refrain,

But those lonely nights surely add their own spice to life!

I search for tomorrow with this kaleidoscope,

Through I sky so vast.

I wonder… is it because you smiled for me,

That I was able to feel less burdened?

C’mon, once we’ve cried all we can, let’s go –

We don’t need a preexisting path!

And it’s fine if we get covered in mud along the way! (Don’t ya think?)

I wanna be with you!

(Go go) Do your best, Dreamer!

(Let’s go) The skies will clear on up!

(Go go) An energy extends to the tips of your hair! So send it flyin’!

‘Round, and ’round, and ’round, and ’round the planet spins –

“Thank you!” “I’m sorry!” “Welcome home!” “I’m back!” I want to become stronger!

C’mon, let’s try to do whatever we can –

I don’t care if this is a dream!

And we might as well challenge ourselves a bit in the process, don’t ya think? (Oh)

I wanna be…

C’mon, once we’ve cried all we can, let’s go –

We don’t need a preexisting path!

And it’s fine if we get covered in mud along the way, (don’t ya think)?

I wanna be with you!

(Go go) Set your emotions shakin’!

(Let’s go) I’m sure it’ll all be fine!

(Go go) Send it flyin’ to the farthest reaches of that blue sky!
