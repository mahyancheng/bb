Summary

Jiraiya
 asks
Konan
, a former student, who
Pain
 is. She attacks him instead of answering, having orders from Pain to kill him. He quickly neutralises and captures her. Jiraiya remarks that, having thought Konan and her peers were dead, he had never imagined they would be members of
Akatsuki
. She asks if he regrets sparing their lives, causing him to think back to when he met Konan and her friends. After the
Second Shinobi World War
, Jiraiya found three war orphans that he decided to teach how to look after themselves. Soon after meeting them, Jiraiya discovered that the boy
Nagato
 possessed the
Rinnegan
