Dotō Kazahana
 (
風花ドトウ
,
Kazahana Dotō
) was the leader of the
Land of Snow
, and was the primary antagonist of
Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow
.

Background

Dotō began the revolt in the Land of Snow whilst searching for a treasure, which resulted in him killing his brother,
Sōsetsu Kazahana
 who was the
daimyō
 at the time. His niece,
Koyuki Kazahana
, fled from the Land of Snow, and became an actress named Yukie Fujikaze.

Personality

Dotō repeatedly proved to be cruel, arrogant, cold, ambitious and utterly ruthless, not shying away from murdering his own relatives if they stood in his way. Usually he was shown as being calm, this, however, could turn into murderous rage if he was thwarted in reaching his goals. He proved a highly cruel person, laughing maniacally as people were being killed at his command. Dotō's greedy and ambitious nature, is revealed by him not being content with the Land of Snow and ultimately intending to take on the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
.

Abilities

While preferring to let his subordinates do the fighting, Dotō proved to be a skilled shinobi.

Ninjutsu

Nature Transformation






Dotō's prototype Chakra Armour.



Dotō showed access to some very powerful
ice
-based techniques, manipulating the pre-existing ice and snow around him to form dragons of
black

ice
 to assault his opponents. Dotō wore a black-coloured prototype
Chakra Armour
 that granted him great defence against
ninjutsu
 and
genjutsu
, going as far as to negate a
Chidori
 (though it resulted in a crack in his armour), as well as increase his own techniques greatly. Similarly to the suit of armour worn by
Fubuki Kakuyoku
, it also had built-in wings for gliding.

Other Abilities

Besides fighting abilities, Dotō proved to be a very crafty and manipulative man. He was further shown to be rather adept in developing strategies and planning things out with great detail from how he prepared for Team Kakashi's attack. He also had knowledge of some
foreign techniques
. Dotō also proved to have a great amount of physical strength, shattering a large area of dense ice with a single blow.

Plot Overview






Dotō's mansion.



Dotō is first seen in his fortress, hearing from his minions that
Kakashi Hatake
 was protecting Koyuki. He then appeared riding on board a train that he used to find the princess. Before he could capture her, however,
Sandayū Asama
 and the rest of the warriors of the Land of Snow arrived and rushed towards the train. He used a kunai-launching mechanism to assault the samurai, killing Sandayū and many other
Yukigakure
 citizens. The train was then destroyed by
Team Kakashi
. However, he, along with
Nadare Rōga
,
Fubuki Kakuyoku
, and
Mizore Fuyukuma
, later returned in a blimp, after which Mizore successfully captured Koyuki. When Dotō found out that the necklace Koyuki was wearing was actually a fake, Koyuki suspected that Kakashi Hatake had switched them while she was sleeping. Thus, Dotō planned to set a trap at his castle. When
Naruto Uzumaki
 raided the blimp in order to rescue Koyuki, Dotō's followers easily took him and his
shadow clones
 down. Dotō was persuaded to use his
Chakra
 Negator device on Naruto.

When Kakashi,
Sakura Haruno
, and
Sasuke Uchiha
 rescued them, they were confronted by Dotō. Koyuki then gave the necklace to him before stabbing him. Her attempt failed, however, as Dotō was wearing the "newest prototype" of Chakra Armour underneath his robe. After he made off with Koyuki in the climax of the movie, he took her to the rainbow glacier where he believed the treasure was hidden. However, her necklace turned out to be a key which activated a generator that would lead to the transformation of the
Land of Snow
 into the Land of Spring, much to Dotō's dismay as he had thought it was a great treasure for him to build a mighty army to overpower the Five Great Shinobi Countries. When Naruto caught up with them, Dotō managed to knock Naruto through the ice of the lake they were standing on, causing him to sink beneath the waters. Sasuke suddenly showed up and managed to damage the armour with his
Chidori
 before being defeated.






Dotō's Ice Release: Twin Dragon Blizzard technique wreaking havoc.



With the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
's chakra helping him recover quickly, Naruto emerged from the lake with the Chakra Negator having been broken, allowing him to summon his shadow clones. Frustrated by Naruto's persistence, Dotō tried to hit him with the help of the full power of his chakra armour. He used his
Ice Release: Twin Dragon Blizzard
 to try to defeat him. Naruto, however, managed to avoid getting hit, and prepared his
Rasengan
. Having run out of power due to his last attack, Dotō feebly tried to punch Naruto, but only managed to hit his clone before he was hit directly by Naruto's new
Seven-Coloured Rasengan
, which was enhanced by the Rainbow Chakra. The Seven-Coloured Rasengan broke Dotō's chakra armour and powerfully threw him onto one of the Generator Walls, killing him, thus breaking the ice covering it and allowing spring to briefly appear in the Land of Snow (ironically fulfilling Kazahana's wish).
