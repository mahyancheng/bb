"
Kunoichi Rumble: The Rivals Get Serious!
" (
ライバル激突!オトメ心は本気モード
,
Raibaru Gekitotsu! Otome Gokoro wa Honki Mōdo
) is episode 41 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Kankurō
 easily wins his battle against
Misumi
 by tricking him into attacking
Karasu
, Kankurō's
puppet
. In retaliation, Karasu snaps Misumi's neck, though he survives due to his ability to contort himself. The fourth match is between
Sakura Haruno
 and
Ino Yamanaka
. The two begin fighting instantly, although they both fail to successfully attack the other.
Neji
 wonders if their fighting skill is the best
kunoichi
 can do, only for
Tenten
 to state that their lack of fighting prowess is not because they are female, but rather because they are restraining themselves. Sakura, unwilling to lose to Ino and not happy with the fact that Ino is pulling her punches and taking pity on her, insults Ino.

A flashback is shown, where Ino teaches Sakura about the significance of flowers in an arrangement. She uses the Cosmos Flower as an example, and that Thoroughwort works to compliment it. Sakura asks if that means she’s just there to compliment Ino’s beauty, to which she denies, adding Sakura is a bud waiting to bloom. Another memory is shown, where Sakura tells Ino that when she chooses to wear her forehead protector properly, that’s when she becomes a true shinobi.

After trading insults, Sakura removes her forehead protector from her head and places it on her forehead; Ino removes hers from her waist and also places it on her forehead. As true rivals, the pair then rush at one another, finally deciding to take the battle seriously.

Trivia

In a flashback, Sakura visits Ino in the woods to tell her that she was placed on Sasuke's team, and Ino reacts as if it is news to her; however, Ino was present in the classroom when
Iruka Umino
 placed Sakura on Sasuke's team. However, it should be noted that Ino being present during the team formations is exclusive to the anime, as she was not present in the manga.
