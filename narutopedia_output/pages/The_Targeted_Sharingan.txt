"
The Targeted Sharingan
" (
狙われた写輪眼
,
Nerawareta Sharingan
) is episode 355 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Three years after Orochimaru's defection from the village,
Danzō
 orders
Kinoe
 and
another member
 of
Root
 to retrieve
Kakashi
's
Sharingan
 so that he can replace his own right eye which is slowly losing its light. At the same time,
Yūgao
 informs Kakashi who is at the
Konoha Cemetery
 that the
Third Hokage
 has summoned him. Once there, Kakashi is informed that one of
Orochimaru
's hideouts had been found and he will be sent to investigate it.
 Once there Kakashi encounters Kinoe and though the two initially agree to team up for the mission, things soon take a turn when Kinoe begins his true mission and attacks Kakashi. Their battle is fought fiercely, and though Kakashi pleads with Kinoe telling him that comrades mustn't kill each other, Kinoe ultimately brings up the fact that Kakashi had allegedly killed his
own friend
. Being enraged, Kakashi pins Kinoe to the ground, his
Chidori
 primes to deal a fatal blow, but Kakashi's words finally reach Kinoe who remembers his past and how Danzō had recruited him into Root and resigns to his fate telling Kakashi to kill him if he wants to. All the while, a menacing creature looms over the two young men in one of the giant cylinders.
