"
A New Rasengan
" (
新しい螺旋丸
,
Atarashii Rasengan
) is episode 170 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Boruto
 is frustrated he can't make his
Rasengan
 more powerful.
Shikadai
 tells him he fought
Deepa
 during his mission, and only survived because of
Shinki
. He figures Boruto is training to fight Deepa, and threatens to stop him by force if necessary to prevent him from being so reckless. Shikadai thinks Boruto wants to get stronger because he hates Deepa, but Boruto denies it, and explains that fighting Deepa made him realise how inexperienced and lacking in power he is. Shikadai offers to help him train.
Hinata
 arrives to give Boruto a lunchbox, and considers making an extra one for Shikadai.
Sarada
 continues practising with
Sasuke
, now dodging kunai. She almost dodges them all, and Sasuke notices her problem is endurance, as she couldn't keep her
Sharingan
 active during all of it. He congratulates her on improving her perception. During a break, Sasuke asks her how her eyes are taking the strain. Sarada says they're fine, and having researched about it and not found much, she asks him about the
Mangekyō Sharingan
. She asks if he thinks she can awaken it, but Sasuke postpones the conversation.
Sakura
 arrives, and Sarada tells her of her progress. Sakura is concerned with the strain she's putting on herself, and Sasuke assures her he's making sure Sarada doesn't overdo it. Sakura gets agitated when Sarada mentions wanting to develop her Sharingan like Sasuke's. Sarada feels frustrated, believing her mother is being overprotective, and leaves.
 Sakura and Sasuke discuss Sarada and her Sharingan getting stronger. Hinata overhears their conversation. Shikadai has
Inojin
 and
Chōchō
 help him with Boruto's training. Shikadai believes that with the
nature transformation
 Boruto is capable of, he can't sustain it for long, and thinking back to his battle with Deepa, he suggests training to focus all his power into a single spot. He tries several forms of target practice and increasing how much chakra he can infuse in his Rasengan. At sundown, Inojin and Chōchō return home, while Shikadai stays with Boruto, and the two discuss his training. Their talk turns to durability, and thinking back to
Kakashi
's advice, Boruto realises a way to focus his Rasengan. Kakashi watches them from afar. He goes to ask a favour from
Ibiki
. Hinata and
Ino
 ask Sakura out for a girls' night, and they discuss their lives and children. The next day, when Chōchō and Inojin arrive, the boulder Boruto was practising on is completely crushed. Boruto goes to tell Kakashi about his progress, and wanting to see it on a worthwhile target, Kakashi arranges for him to fight an imprisoned
Shojoji
.
