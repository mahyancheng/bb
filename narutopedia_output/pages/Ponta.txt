Ponta
 (
ポン太
) is a giant
raccoon
 and the companion of the master enka music ninja,
Sabu
.

Personality

Ponta will carelessly attack any enemy head on.

Appearance

Ponta is very large in terms of size, easily towering over his partner Sabu,
 and was even mistaken for a bear by
Kisame Hoshigaki
.
 He predominantly has orange fur with some brown fur around his face, ears, feet and tail. The area directly around his mouth is white however. He also wears bandages on his front paws and has small black eyes.

Part II

Five Kage Summit

During
Killer B
's enka training with Sabu, Ponta alerted the two of Kisame's presence. Wasting no time, Ponta rushed in to attack Kisame, but was quickly defeated. As the battle between the two parties waged on, Ponta was caught in Kisame's
Water Release: Great Exploding Water Colliding Wave
 technique. However, Killer B lured Kisame — who was fused with
Samehada
 — away from Ponta and Sabu, freeing them from the moving water dome.

Trivia






Unused concept artwork of Kintarō and Pochi, who would later become Ponta.



Ponta was salvaged from an unused concept of a bear-like pet raccoon named Pochi (
ポチ
). Pochi, together with a character called Kintarō (
金太郎
), was originally planned to appear instead of
Haku
 and
Zabuza Momochi
. Instead of Zabuza's
Kubikiribōchō
, Kintarō wielded a giant axe that was also salvaged for Ponta's partner, Sabu.

Ponta is written as "ポン太". This name is a stereotypical name to give to pet
tanuki
, who are visually very similar to raccoons, a bit like "Fido" is for a dog or "Mittens" for a cat. It is also the name
Saburō Kitajima
 used when he was part of the comical duo "Gerupin Ponta Chinta" (
ゲルピンぽん太ちん太
,
literally meaning:
 Ponta and Chinta in need for Money).
