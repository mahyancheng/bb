 manga.

Summary

Remembering
Sasuke
's words during their first fight at the
Valley of the End
 about two high class
shinobi
 being able to convey their feelings through their fists,
Naruto
 tries to convince Sasuke to cease fighting, but Sasuke is adamant to kill Naruto. Naruto then questions how Sasuke's revolution will guarantee that the shinobi world does not turn out the same as before to which Sasuke claims he will watch over it eternally as his reincarnations. Sasuke is under the notion that because the threat is gone, the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 will turn against each other again despite Naruto telling him that the nations had changed. Sasuke summons the
satellites
 he encased each of the
tailed beasts
 in, and begins channelling
chakra
 from each one into his
Susanoo
.
 Self-proclaiming to be the strongest person in the world, his Susanoo begins to change into a more humanoid form, while Naruto creates three
shadow clones
 of his
Tailed Beast Mode
. Sasuke easily deflects the first attack sending one of the clones plummeting to the ground. As Sasuke prepares to charge another arrow, Naruto fuses the two remaining clones into a single, three-headed, six-armed avatar. All the while the clones below gathered
natural energy
. With both combatants ready to fire, Naruto tells to himself that he always wanted to beat Sasuke in the past, but not the Sasuke that exists now, before he and Sasuke exchange attacks again.
