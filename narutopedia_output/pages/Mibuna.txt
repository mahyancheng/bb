Mibuna, Sansho, and Tsukune perform some vandalism around the village. When Iruka catches them in the act, they claim to only be playing hide-and-seek, but he tricks them into confessing. Iruka remarks that Naruto Uzumaki was a much bigger delinquent when he was a student, which Mibuna and the others don't believe.
