These pirates use unusual tactics to attack ships and acquire any treasures they might possess.

Part II

Paradise Life on a Boat

Before any travellers go through the
Sea Route of Silence
, they stop on a small port town to stock up on food and water, since once they get into the route, it takes two weeks to leave it. While the travellers are stocking up, they find a way to put a
Moulding Mushroom
 in their rations. Due to the mushroom's properties, it destroys their rations, leaving travellers to starve to death, or poisoned to death by eating the mushrooms. When the boat leaves the route after two weeks, with its passengers dead, they come in and take anything valuable.

The group was defeated by
Naruto
 and his group when they managed to have an unexpected provision of insect-composed meals made by
Shima
, brought by
Gamatatsu
 via the
Summoning Technique
. With their energy replenished, Naruto's group defeated the gang and sent them back with only one Moulding Mushroom as their "provision", while ignoring their pleas for mercy.
