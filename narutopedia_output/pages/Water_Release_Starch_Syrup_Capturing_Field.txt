The user expels high viscosity water to cover the ground. This stream of sticky liquid can be used to form an adhesive trap that will inhibit a person's mobility. One can effectively reduce their enemy's area of activity with this technique, giving the user an advantage on the battlefield. The normal scope of this technique is normally just a few metres, but it is possible to make an entire pond of starch syrup.
 The syrup can be manipulated to move after it is created, being able to stick and travel up surfaces.

Trivia

Mizuame
 is a Japanese sweetener made by converting starch to sugars. It takes the form of a clear, thick, and most of all sticky liquid. It can be literally translated as "water candy", emphasising its likeness to water and explaining why it is used in a water release technique.

In an
omake
, it is shown that this technique's creation was inspired when Izumo knocked over a jar of syrup, which was previously being eaten plain by
Kotetsu Hagane
, and subsequently tripped in the sticky substance.
