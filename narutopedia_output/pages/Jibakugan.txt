This
genjutsu
 brings out the victim's subconscious negative or hateful emotions. The caster can take advantage of these feelings and control the victim's actions. This technique can be cancelled by smelling the
New Moon Flower Perfume
, using the
Sharingan
, or killing the caster. Those who are being controlled by the Jibakugan gains several strange markings under their eyes and on their foreheads. For this technique to be effective, direct eye contact is needed, unless the user's power is sufficient enough to use it without the need of direct eye contact.
