Focal Point: The Mark of the Leaf
" (
木ノ葉マークと額当て
,
Konoha Māku to Hitaiate
) is episode 88 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Back in
Otogakure
,
Orochimaru
 is in immense pain after having the use of his arms taken away by the
Third Hokage
. He sends
Kabuto
 to locate
Tsunade
, a famed
medical-nin
 who might be able to heal his arms. After managing to locate her, Kabuto and Orochimaru head out.

After
Naruto
 struggles with the second step of his training,
Jiraiya
 helps him by drawing a spiral on his palm to give him a point to concentrate his efforts on. Naruto recalls
Iruka
 sensei's words of advice regarding concentration from his childhood, and he changes the spiral on his palm to that of a leaf. He then focuses a lot of chakra into that point of concentration; the process causes the balloon to burst, but also for Naruto to go flying backwards, paving the dirt. He is stopped by Jiraiya, who notices that the amount of chakra used managed to burn Naruto's hands. Impressed, he tells Naruto that he has passed the second stage. Naruto is eager to begin the third, but Jiraiya tells him that for now, they must continue on their journey, for he has managed to locate Tsunade. Elsewhere, Tsunade, an avid and extremely unlucky gambler, hits a winning streak, leading her to believe something bad is about to happen. As she tries to leave the city with
Shizune
 and
Tonton
, she is met by Orochimaru and Kabuto, who greet her by
summoning snakes
 and destroying the castle she was walking past.
