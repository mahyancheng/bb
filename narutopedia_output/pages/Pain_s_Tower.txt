Pain's tower.



This is the tallest tower in
Amegakure
 and was also
Pain
's base of operations. It has four humanoid faces at each side and is connected to two smaller towers.
 The tongue of the face that Pain sat on, looking out over the city has
Rinnegan
-like eye patterns and is depicted with a pipe and has piercings, with its tongue stuck out. Somewhere inside is a chamber hidden behind a solid wall where the
Six Paths of Pain
's bodies are stored when not in use. At the base of the tower, members of Pain's forces deliver bodies. Its height allows
Nagato
 to transmit chakra signals to the Paths regardless of their position in the city.

The tower also houses a morgue, enabling Nagato to easily replace his Paths in the event a body was rendered unusable.

Trivia

During the
Akatsuki Suppression Mission
, the tower is depicted with a kimono.
 Later on, however, it was illustrated without it.
