 anime.

Synopsis

Boro
 investigates the wreckage of
Victor
's crashed airship, and collects some
evidence
. In
Kara's dimension
,
Sasuke
 examines the carved walls, triggering a hologram of
Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki
. Boro returns to
his cult
, and preaches salvation by the
Ōtsutsuki
 through the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
. He alleges that shinobi of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 murdered
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
, and lied that the Infinite Tsukuyomi was a calamity. Sasuke discovers holograms for
Momoshiki
 and Kaguya. He notices how the carvings are arranged in pairs, deducing that Kaguya also came with a
partner
, triggering his hologram. Boro takes children with questions to
Inori
, who claims to corroborate Boro's preaching.
Inori's brother
 arrives, incapacitating two cultists with
Water Release
, intent on rescuing her.
 Inori doesn't listen to him. Boro claims that he was given an indestructible body by the god he met, and gives Inori's brother a chance to believe his words. Inori's brother
slices
 through Boro with Water Release, but he simply
regenerates
. Seeing him regenerate makes the children believe him. Boro has Inori take them away and give them new clothes. Inori's brother refuses to believe Boro, who
extends his hand
 at him, causing him to die. Boro looks at what he collected from the airship, and wonders how
Koji
 will explain himself.
Boruto
 practises
shurikenjutsu
 and discusses
Kawaki
 with
Mitsuki
, who advises him to be careful with the
Kāma
 since they know so little about it. Sasuke investigates some roars, and discovers a restrained
Ten-Tails
, much to his shock. He hides as
Jigen

arrives
, noting his Kāma. He watches as Jigen
absorbs chakra
 from the Ten-Tails, and sprouts a horn like the one he saw in Kaguya's partner's hologram. Jigen recedes the horn, and plans to visit the two vessels. Going back home, Mitsuki asks Boruto what he'll do if the Kāma is permanent. Boruto remains unconcerned, choosing to focus on defeating Jigen as his mission.
