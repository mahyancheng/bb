Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Both
Naruto
 and
Kisame
 are surprised to learn that
Itachi
 and
Sasuke
 are brothers. Years ago, after Itachi killed their family, Itachi told Sasuke that he had done so in order to test his abilities. Frightened that this could be his motivation, Sasuke tried to escape, only for Itachi to assure him he was too weak to kill. He instead encouraged Sasuke to grow strong enough to kill him and avenge their family. Intending to finally do so, Sasuke attacks Itachi with
Chidori
, but Itachi easily deflects it. Naruto begins gathering
chakra
 so that he can help Sasuke when it is absorbed by Kisame. As Kisame moves to incapacitate him,
Jiraiya
 appears and stops the attack.
