 arrives with alcohol for Tsunade, who drinks up and resumes reading. Neji asks about the kidnapped shinobi, and the masked man tells him
Team Jiraiya
 will take him there. The masked man leaves Neji to reunite with his comrades. The Konoha genin join as one team, and discuss how to find the kidnapped shinobi, and are subsequently joined by Neji. The masked man appears to Team Jiraiya,
