The Reanimated Allied Forces
" (

,
Edo Tensei Rengōgun!!
) is episode 316 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

In an attempt to recover his most powerful pawns,
Kabuto
 deploys some of his
weakest reincarnated shinobi
 to ambush the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. He uses
Torune
 to summon them. The
White Zetsu
 appears in the battlefield, and he realises that those were the
Impure World Reincarnation
's failures.
 After the battle that took place, the Shinobi Alliance notices that those reincarnated shinobi were weak, their only advantage in numbers. Between the reincarnated shinobi, some are Shinobi Alliance troops' long gone friends and families.
Osoi
, who was
Toroi
's former partner and
Musai
's father, makes them aware of Kabuto's plan to rescue his stronger pawns. Conscious about the plan, the Allied Shinobi Forces informs the
HQ
 that some reincarnated shinobi are after the
Third Raikage
. Then there is a flashback of when Kabuto went around robbing graves after absorbing
Orochimaru
's cells. Torune is leading the reincarnated fugitive team that took vantage from
Heiji
's
Winding Smoke Technique
 to escape the Shinobi Alliance. When they find the sealed Third Raikage, a reincarnated shinobi starts running to release the tag, ending up being caught in a
trap
.
Daimaru
 uses his
Earth Release: Sand Dance
 to get rid of the tags, when they got near the Third Raikage's
sealing tag
,
Chūkaku
 throws a rosary to the tag and starts praying. When the sealing tag is
about to break
,
Temari
 appears and
attacks
 Chūkaku before he can break it. Daimaru shows up in front of Temari, declaring his love for her. Later on after a long conversation between Temari and Daimaru, the Allied Shinobi Forces seals Daimaru. Temari
attacks
 the last reincarnated shinobi, Torune, who is hiding behind a rock. With a second and direct attack, Temari realises that Torune is long gone, leaving a
clone
 in front of her. Kabuto gets surprised with Torune's skills and intends to use him to be successful in his demand.
