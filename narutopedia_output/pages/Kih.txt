Kihō
 (
鬼鳳
) was a
shinobi
 from
Otogakure
, and a member of
Team Guren
.

Personality

He seemed rather blunt, and went along with
Rinji
's strategies without complaints. He, like some of his teammates, wanted nothing to do with Orochimaru and wished to flee. Kihō also feared death and would do anything to live. He referred to death as "going boom" because of Kabuto.

Appearance

Kihō had pale, pasty-looking skin and white hair with dark, blue-framed glasses with orange lenses. His outfit consisted a dark purple cloak with orange outlines with blue pants and wore
geta
 that were tan with black strips and only sandal hold.

Abilities






Kihō using the Smoke Dragon technique.



Kihō was a long-range fighter, using his
wrist/arm-mounted rocket launcher
 as the key component in battle. Using the weapon, he could
fire smoke bombs
 to obscure an opponent's field of vision. He can also manipulate the smoke to form a
smoke dragon
, which can envelop and suffocate the enemy, and due to being made of smoke, is immune to physical attacks. As shown in his defeat by Yamato, his smoke attacks appeared to be weak to
Water Release
.






Kihō's cursed seal activated.



After being given a
cursed seal
, his chakra reserves and attacks were increased to such an extent that he could easily defeat enemies that he previously lost to. A drawback of this however, is that Kihō needs to take a pill after a certain amount of time, or the seal would kill him by tearing him from the inside out.

Part II

Three-Tails' Appearance

He was one of
Orochimaru
's prisoners that was selected to join forces with
Guren
. When Guren left with Kabuto and
Yūkimaru
, he was instructed to stay behind to deal with
Team Kurenai
 and
Team Yamato
. He was easily defeated by
Rock Lee
,
Tenten
, and
Kiba Inuzuka
. Later, Kabuto forcibly activated the groups cursed seals. Kihō was then ordered to attack the
Konoha
 ninja again. He and his team succeeded to defeat the first defence team consisting of Kiba, Lee, and Tenten. After doing so and retrieving Yūkimaru, Kihō and his team initially planned to run away from Orochimaru's grasp, only to find out that their cursed seals would kill them if not properly taken care of. Forced to stay, Kihō and his team were sent to stop the Konoha ninja from sealing the
Three-Tails
. He went against
Yamato
 and ended up getting killed after Yamato destroyed his
Smoke Dragons
 with his
water technique
 and crushed him with his wood jutsu. After his death,
Nurari

merges
 with him and
Kigiri
 into a monster and they fought against
Kakashi
 and the others. As Kakashi was about to kill them, they were killed by the rampaging Three-Tails.
