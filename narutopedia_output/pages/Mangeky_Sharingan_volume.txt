" (

,
Mangekyō Sharingan
)

Sarada
 thinks back to her conversations with her comrades and friends about her dream of becoming
Hokage
 and her repressed feelings for
Boruto
. In a flashback, after leaving
Konohagakure
, Boruto asks
Sasuke
 what the
Mangekyō Sharingan
 is. Sasuke explains it to Boruto but he knows that though Sarada had awakened her Mangekyo Sharingan, she is unaware of the awakening but in due time, she will learn how to use it in the future which will benefit them. Sarada coldly combats
Ryū
 with her new ability while
Mitsuki
 watches where she becomes victorious.

Mitsuki catches Sarada when she falls where he realizes that Sarada using her new technique causes her to be exhausted. Elsewhere,
Koji Kashin
 and
Ada
 communicates with one another. They are glad Sarada awakened her Mangekyo Sharingan's new ability but saddened that it had to come to
Yodo
's sacrifice. When Boruto asks Koji whether all their plans succeeding had to involve people dying, Koji tries to change the subject by ordering Boruto not to leave as
Jura
's target is Boruto. Boruto does not heed his commands and he goes to save
Konohamaru
 from
Matsuri
 which he succeeds in drawing Jura's attention to him.

Chapter 22

"
Jura
" (
十羅
,
Jura
)

After being killed by
Sarada
,
Ryū
's
Thorn Soul Bulb
 is exposed in the air.
Mitsuki
 tells
Araya
 to retrieve it and return it to
Shinki
's tree as he deals with the remaining
Claw Grime
. However,
Jura
 suddenly emerges from a
Claw Mark
, alerting Mitsuki. Much to the two's surprise, Jura ignores them as well as Ryū's Thorn Soul Bulb, immediately directing his attention to
Boruto
's location.

After Boruto swiftly cut
Matsuri
 into pieces,
Konohamaru
 comments that he is impressed. Boruto simply remarks that it was this easy to finish her because Konohamaru had already
weakened
 her. As many particles of sand surround the two, Boruto proclaims that Matsuri's Thorn Soul Bulb is manifesting. Suddenly, a small hole is formed on the ground near them, gaining their attention. Boruto confirms that it was a
Miniature Tailed Beast Ball Sniper Shot
 from Jura, discovering that he has arrived. As Jura begins to fly towards their location, Boruto throws several shuriken around the area, and orders Konohamaru to grab Matsuri's Thorn Soul Bulb and rendezvous with the other shinobi and await further instruction. When Konohamaru hesitates, Jura charges a
Tailed Beast Ball
 and fires it, prompting Boruto to grab Konohamaru and fly to avoid the attack, which causes an explosion. Boruto throws Konohamaru as Jura closes the distance. Konohamaru regains his composure and complies with Boruto, beginning to escape. As Jura looks at him, Boruto suddenly appears behind him and attacks with a
Rasengan
. Jura fires another Tailed Beast Ball, which Boruto
dodges
 and re-appears next to a shuriken which marks the spot Jura was sent flying towards. As Boruto tries to strike with his sword, Jura parries with his hand. Jura comments that while this is a bad habit, fighting a strong opponent like Boruto fills his heart with joy.

Meanwhile,
Ada
, watching the current events unfold with her
Senrigan
, confirms with
Koji Kashin
 that despite Boruto's satisfactory performance, he has no chance against Jura. Ada suggests that he teleports away, but Koji states that he can't as Boruto cannot concentrate on sensing his metal objects while fighting a strong opponent like Jura that has declared to kill him. Additionally, Boruto is fighting to keep Jura occupied while Konohamaru and the others escape, as Jura would simply deal with them and retrieve Ryū's and Matsuri's Thorn Soul Bulbs. Koji accepts that Boruto has led himself to his death.

Jura declares his intention to kill Boruto, stating that Boruto knows too much about them, while also asking if Boruto's secret accomplice is his source of intel. Boruto remains quiet, thinking to himself that Jura had to have taken damage from his Rasengan, but he cannot get a proper read on him. He states that he must use
Rasengan: "Uzuhiko"
 to finish Jura. Jura begins to ask Boruto what love is, knowing that Boruto is aware he stands no chance against him, but is engaging him anyway. Jura attacks from below Boruto's feet using
Wood Release
, but Boruto flies into the air to avoid it. Jura attacks from behind, and Boruto slashes through the attack, which causes more branches to emerge and chase Boruto. Boruto is struggling as he cannot use Rasengan: "Uzuhiko" if he cannot plant his feet on the ground.

Another Wood Release attack sends Boruto crashing to the ground, also forcing him to drop his
sword
. Boruto is then ensnared by more Wood Release branches, injuring him. With Boruto captured, Jura walks up to Boruto's fallen sword and picks it up. Boruto threatens Jura that he will meet a fate worse than death if he does anything to the sword, as it is a precious object passed down to him by his master,
Sasuke
. Jura proposes that Boruto should reveal the location of his accomplice, and Jura will agree to not do anything to the sword, although he will still kill Boruto afterwards.

Boruto admits that Jura may be right about love being a flaw and weakness to humans, and this is precisely why they will never be more than just trees, using Rasengan: "Uzuhiko" to free himself from his bindings. Boruto teleports behind Jura, having teleported to his sword still in Jura's hands, and strikes him with Rasengan: "Uzuhiko". Jura is sent flying but lands on his feet, however he shows trouble in keeping his balance. Boruto proclaims that due to his damaged sense of equilibrium, he will have trouble flying, much less standing. However, much to Boruto's surprise, Jura is able to nullify the attack and cure himself, revealing that it is similar in concept to his Tailed Beast Balls.

Chapter 23

"
The Strong
" (
強者
,
Tsuwamono
)

Mitsuki
, having re-activated his
Sage Mode
, defeated a group of
Claw Grime
 when he is approached by
Konohamaru
, carrying
Matsuri
's Thornbulb. Mitsuki informs Konohamaru that
Araya
 has taken
Ryū
's Thornbulb and is headed to
Shinki
's tree, while carrying the fallen
Yodo
. Konohamaru expresses regret of what happened to Yodo, but states that this is the level of resolve needed to deal with the
Human God Trees
, and Yodo would be happy to hear her sacrifice led to them acquiring the Thornbulbs. Mitsuki notes that he spotted
Jura
 flying towards the direction where Konohamaru was with Matsuri, while ignoring Mitsuki's group and having no interest in re-acquiring Ryū's Thornbulb. Konohamaru informs Mitsuki that he was about to be killed by Matsuri, but
Boruto
 arrived and saved him, and Jura has arrived moments later. The two hypothesize that Jura's main priority is to kill Boruto. Mitsuki wishes to help Boruto defeat Jura, but Konohamaru reminds him of their mission to acquire the Thornbulbs, which Boruto is clearly aware of and is fighting to keep Jura occupied while they retreat. Konohamaru tells Mitsuki that Boruto ordered them to head to the location where they initially met up with Araya and Yodo. Despite not knowing why, Konohamaru states that their only option right now is to trust Boruto and they should follow his orders.

Meanwhile, Boruto is continuing his battle with Jura, using his hand to assess a wound inflicted on him by Jura. Boruto notices Jura charging another
Tailed Beast Ball
 and dodges the attack, re-appearing on a nearby rock formation. Jura notes to himself that the time it takes to prepare a regular Tailed Beast Ball is its biggest drawback, and he should opt to rely on long-distance sniping or close-distance blast attacks instead. Jura fires more attacks at Boruto, who manages to dodge, getting close to Jura by throwing a kunai and
teleporting
 to it. Before Boruto can slash Jura, his sword is knocked out of his hand, but Boruto teleports to it to attack Jura from another angle, managing to slice off his leg. Jura commends Boruto's skill as the two continue to exchange blows in mid-air. As Boruto is getting overwhelmed, he notes to himself that he is clearly outclassed strength-wise. Jura grabs Boruto's wrist and tries to discharge another Tailed Beast Ball, but Boruto interrupts him with
Lightning Release: Purple Electricity
. Boruto gains some distance, and Jura, noticing Boruto's heavy breathing, states he is getting sluggish, prompting to instead beat him to death rather than try to attack him with Tailed Beast Balls. Konohamaru and Mitsuki, who is carrying the unconscious
Sarada Uchiha
, arrive at the rendezvous point, but they are unable to figure out why Boruto told them to head there.

Jura attacks Boruto with
Taijutsu
, knocking him to the ground with immense physical strength. Jura fires another Tailed Beast Ball, but Boruto manages to barely dodge. Jura blindsides Boruto and attacks further. When Boruto parries with his sword, he notices his sword getting chipped. Jura sends Boruto crashing to the ground with another solid hit during Boruto's momentary lapse, and Boruto is seemingly knocked unconscious.
Ada
, watching the events unfold with her
Senrigan
, states that she cannot watch anymore as Boruto is going to be killed at this rate. Ada tries calling for
Koji Kashin
, who has been silent for a while, but Koji tells her to be quiet as he is getting an "update". Koji's eyes roll in the back of his head, and his
Ten Directions
 activates. Koji seems to be surprised at the futures he's seeing, as Ada tells him to explain what he's seeing.

Jura stands over Boruto, noting that despite being unconscious, Boruto still has a firm grip on
Sasuke Uchiha
's sword. Jura plans to finish off Boruto with a single hit, out of respect for his grit. Suddenly, Jura is stabbed from behind through his head and right eye by a black rod, and
Kawaki
 is seen standing on top of him. Ada is surprised at Kawaki's arrival, and Koji, still going through his visions, learns of Kawaki's arrival via Ten Directions, having received new visions for the first time in 6 days. Koji states that Kawaki's involvement in this battle is a new possibility that he has not seen before, realizing that Boruto must have talked to Kawaki in the past few days.

Mitsuki tries searching for one of the metal objects that Boruto uses for teleportation, but they are alerted from behind by
Delta
, who was waiting for them at the location Boruto told them to head to. Jura tries to attack Kawaki, but he
disappears then re-appears right next to him
,
summoning smaller black rods
 to stab Jura in various spots. Jura resists the attack and fires another Tailed Beast Ball, but Kawaki evades it and re-appears next to Boruto, telling him to wake up. Boruto regains consciousness and tells Kawaki that he's late. Jura wonders how Kawaki has gained an exponential amount of power compared to their last encounter. Kawaki activates his
Kāma
, telling Boruto to hold it together otherwise he will run amok and Kawaki will have to kill him. Boruto's Kāma begins to resonate, but Boruto tells Kawaki to ignore him and go. As Jura charges towards them, Kawaki challenges him to a duel.

Chapter 24

"
Kawaki Uzumaki
" (
うずまきカワキ
,
Uzumaki Kawaki
)

A flashback commences of
Boruto
's conversation with
Kawaki
 on top of the
Hokage Rock
. Boruto instructs Kawaki to head to
Sunagakure
 after his limiters are removed by
Amado
. Boruto will arrive after he does, which will most likely cause
Jura
 to appear, but with Kawaki's presence, they will have a fighting chance. Kawaki notes that Jura is a monster and simply fighting him with numbers would not be enough. Boruto throws one of his metal symbols that Kawaki catches, explaining that their intention is to not defeat Jura, but to survive against him, and the best chance they have is to escape with the
Flying Thunder God technique
. However, there are conditions Boruto must fulfill in order to teleport long distances. By his admission, he will be unable to fulfill those conditions while he is fighting Jura, and as the scene cuts back to the present, Kawaki accepts that his role is to buy him time.

Kawaki activates his
Kāma
 as Jura charges towards him, firing a
Tailed Beast Ball
, but Kawaki
absorbs
 it. Jura appears behind him to attack, but Kawaki dodges by
shrinking himself
, and responds with
summoning large cubes
 to rain down on Jura. Kawaki engages into close-range combat with Jura and he seems to be holding his own. Using his bo-staff, Kawaki
channels his chakra and fires a close-range blast
, leaving a hole in Jura's waist. Kawaki creates more holes in Jura's body and sends him flying into a rock formation. While levitating in the air, Boruto calms himself down as his Kāma is resonating with Kawaki's, but it disappears as Kawaki deactivates his Kāma. Amado and
Sumire Kakei
 are watching the battle through Kawaki's eyes, and Sumire is impressed that Kawaki is doing so well against Jura. Amado shows a degree of concern.

Jura pulls a book from one of his
Claw Marks
 and flips through it, noting Kawaki's large increase in combat ability since their last encounter.
Himawari Uzumaki
's sudden growth was also mentioned, as well as
Sarada Uchiha
's, with Sumire surprised to hear about Sarada awakening a
new power
. Jura theorizes that these incidents all seem to have a common cause: the topic of love, which he is currently researching. Love seems to serve as not only a fatal weakness for humans, but also a factor that can influence extraordinary evolution. Jura asks Kawaki for his opinion, but Kawaki simply states that he talks alot,
blasting him close-range
. As the smoke clears, several large branches of
Wood Release
 emerge that envelop Jura, seemingly healing his injuries, as well as his right eye that Kawaki stabbed through before. Treating the branches as a throne, Jura comments on Kawaki's unusual actions of protecting Boruto, stating that the only person he should care about protecting is
Naruto Uzumaki
. Jura was surprised to hear about Naruto's death when he visited
Konohagakure
 before, but judging the look in Kawaki's eyes, he realizes that Naruto is alive, with Kawaki's expression confirming it. Jura proclaims his desire to devour Naruto, knowing he shares a deep bond with all of the
Tailed Beasts
, and he wonders if he can learn more about love by devouring him. As a riled-up Kawaki prepares to attack again, he is interrupted by Boruto, who states that he got a lock on the symbol and its time to go. Jura accepts their escape, but before they can leave, Kawaki tells Boruto that he has something to say first. Kawaki comments that while he doesn't care about love, he gives Jura credit for having the intuition to set his sights on Naruto, also vowing to kill Jura by his own hand. As Jura states to Kawaki that he's glad they got a chance to talk, Boruto and Kawaki leave.

Meanwhile,
Konohamaru Sarutobi
,
Mitsuki
,
Delta
, and the still unconscious
Sarada Uchiha
 are waiting around with Boruto's symbol on the ground. Delta was given instructions to leave it in the area, as it is hard for Boruto to sense its chakra if someone is holding it. She instructs Konohamaru and Mitsuki to take some steps back as it would be pitiful if they were to get stepped on. Suddenly, Kawaki and Boruto appear, with Kawaki stepping on Konohamaru's face. Boruto confirms that Konohamaru is still holding onto
Matsuri's
 Thornbulb, and the group prepares to head back to Konohagakure.

Ada
 states to
Koji Kashin
 that things have turned out well and they should be able to breathe easy, but Koji disapproves Boruto's actions, as they were too risky and there was a good chance that even the good futures would have been destroyed. Koji states that while Boruto surviving is a good thing, his actions had greatly shifted the future again. Ada denounces Koji's concerns as this is how life is supposed to usually work, but Koji reveals that
Mamushi
 is about to make his move and she is his target, much to Ada's disgust.

At the
Human God Tree
's base,
Hidari
 notices Jura's facial expression and asks if he is feeling sick. Jura is feeling proud that Kawaki paid him a compliment. Hidari flips through his book and states that he recently learned a modern phrase that would be appropriate to use right now: "totally ick".
