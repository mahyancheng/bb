Sanshōuo
 (
山椒魚
,
literally meaning:
 Salamander) is a
puppet
, originally created by
Sasori
 and passed onto
Kankurō
. Unlike Kankurō's other puppets, Sanshōuo stays true to its name and somewhat resembles an actual
salamander
. Sanshōuo is a puppet that has high defensive power.

It has a frill that swings up to defend against attacks from the front as well as the tail being able to tuck up to reach the frill and guard the rear, followed by an iron cloak immediately covering all sides, and a hollow body Kankurō and up to two other people can take cover in to defend against attacks coming from other directions. It has also been upgraded with a powerful suction ability which allows it to inhale even vast quantities of debris in the attempt to trap an opponent.

Its weak point is the side joint of the frill, which when struck will knock the shield off, rendering it defenceless. Kankurō later repaired it after it was dismantled by Sasori. During the
battle
 of the
ambush squads
 it was used to
trap

Shin
, but was blown apart from one of
Deidara
's
clay bombs
 that was inside Shin's stomach, though it did smother the explosion.

Trivia

In multiple video games, Sanshōuo has been known to spit fire. However, in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3
, Sanshōuo can release a steady flow of
poison
 gas.

In the
anime
, Kankurō began wielding additional copies of this puppet.
