Naruto
 manga.

Summary

As
Tsunade
 heals
Gaara
 and
Ōnoki
,
A
 and
Mei
 engage
Madara
.
Dodai
, along with the
Hokage Guard Platoon
 chase after the
Kabuto
-controlled
Mū
. Madara attacks them with
Yasaka Magatama
 but the attack fails because of Gaara's
Shield of Sand
 and Ōnoki's
rock golem
 protects them. Ōnoki joins the Kage and develops a new strategy. Employing Mei's
Hiding in Mist Technique
 to obscure Madara's field of vision, he first
lightens
 A, increasing his speed. Seeing this, Kabuto positions Mū in front of Madara but he is knocked away easily. Ōnoki then
enhances
 A's attack, breaking into Madara's Susanoo and sending him flying away. Naruto insists on helping fight Madara but Tsunade tells him to leave Madara to them while he fights the
other Madara
. As the clone disperses they leave one word with him "win". Elsewhere, the real Naruto and
B
 encounter Tobi and Naruto headbutts him head-on.

Trivia

After Dodai and the others go after Mū, a few panels later Dodai is seen standing beside Naruto, Sagan and the Gokage as if he never left.

In the same panel, Sagan seems to be missing while a few panels later he is seen with the others again.

In the English translation, Ōnoki's use of
Earth Release: Ultra-Added-Weight Rock Technique
 is incorrectly referred to as
Earth Release: Ultralight-Weight Rock Technique
.
