.

The
Sensing Barrier
 is a giant, dome-shaped barrier placed over a designated area. The barrier is not visible to the standard eye; when viewed with certain
dōjutsu
, it can be seen that there is a design of several circles which have the kanji for
boundary
 (
界
), and
barrier
 (
結界
,
kekkai
) inscribed in them. When linked with a
Sensing Water Sphere
, all
unauthorised passage
 in and out of the barrier can be detected and pinpointed.

Trivia

This barrier surrounds
Konohagakure
 and is maintained by the village's
barrier team
.

In the anime, the
Third Hokage
 promised not to change the formula of the barrier so
Itachi Uchiha
 may sneak back in from time to time to watch over
his younger brother
.

Despite a citizen's death, Konohagakure does not change the barrier to take note of that, as
Koji Kashin
, clone of the long deceased
Jiraiya
, was able to pass the barrier without triggering an alarm.
