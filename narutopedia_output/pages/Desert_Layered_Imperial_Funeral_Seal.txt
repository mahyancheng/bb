Using a large quantity of
sand
, the user covers the enemy with several successive layers of the material, before compressing it into the form of a huge pyramid which serves to imprison the target upon its completion.
Sealing tags
 can be placed onto the pyramid to increase its sealing power, or
Shukaku
 can strengthen the seal with the
juinjutsu
 that cover its body.

Trivia

The shape variants of this technique differs to fit the size of the target. A simple pyramid is used for smaller opponents, while a step pyramid is used for larger or more powerful foes.
