 manga.

Summary

Reflecting on
Itachi
's last words,
Sasuke
 is tormented with questions about important aspects of a
shinobi
's life; including
his clan
, his friends and about his own existence. While deep in thought, the ceiling of the cave breaks open, but Sasuke manages to dodge the falling debris and
Suigetsu
 appears, along with
Jūgo
, stating that they had finally found Sasuke. Meanwhile on the battlefield, the five
Kage
 are still amazed to find
Madara
 still intact even after the
Impure World Reincarnation
 was released. Madara exclaims that after fighting him, they might have realised he was not the type of shinobi to be under someone else's control. He also states that anyone that had seen his perfect form of his
Susanoo
 had to die but laments that it would be a disgrace and defeatist to manifest it once again. Elsewhere,
Naruto
,
Kakashi
,
Guy
, and
Killer B
 are still fighting
Tobi
 and the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 with Naruto provoking Tobi to take off his mask despite Kakashi's warnings not to irate the enemy. Seemingly resigned to his actions, Tobi summons the
Benihisago
 and the
Kohaku no Jōhei
, and while remembering the fragments of the chakra he had collected from the Eight and
Nine-Tails
 laments that he wanted to revive the
Ten-Tails
 in perfect condition but even at a fragments of its power, it was still the same. Back at
Kabuto
's location, Jūgo realises that
Anko Mitarashi
 is still alive and alerts Sasuke to the fact that Madara was still in the living world, shocking Sasuke. As Sasuke questions them why they were still following him, Suigetsu tells him that they had found something interesting and hands Sasuke the
scroll
 which they found at one of
Orochimaru
's hideouts. Rendered speechless for a moment by the content, Sasuke says that he is willing to meet with Orochimaru which shocked Suigetsu and Jūgo but Sasuke noted that Orochimaru was not one to die so easily even if he was killed. Standing up, Sasuke states that he was going to meet "
the ones who know everything
".
