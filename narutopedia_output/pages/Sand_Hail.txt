Sand Hail
 is a larger scale version of Gaara's
Sand Drizzle
.

Overview

Gaara gathers his
sand
 into large clumps in the shape of massive boulder-like formations and then drops them from the sky on to his opponents. It covers a wide range, making it difficult to dodge. Like the Sand Drizzle, the technique can distract the enemy with an aerial assault, leaving them open to an attack from below.
