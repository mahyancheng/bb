Using their
chakra
, the user is able to stimulate their hair, granting them the ability to freely manipulate it. Because of the malleability of the hair, the user can use it to entangle their opponents, cutting off their movements or even use it to grab their target and send them hurtling some distance away. Because this technique depends solely on the user's hair, the more volume there is, the more effective this technique can be used.
