"
Impure World Reincarnation Technique: Release
" (
穢土転生の術・解
,
Edo Tensei no Jutsu: Kai
) is chapter 589 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

The five
Kage
 look on in shock as
Madara
 unleashes his
Susanoo
. After stabilising the construct,
Tsunade
 questions whether her
grandfather
 really fought against someone who was so much stronger than five Kage put together. Madara responds by saying that Hashirama was the only one who could defeat him and then states that it was a good thing that he wasn't here as the extent of damage to the surrounding landscape would be on a much smaller scale as he sends the Kage flying with one swing from his
sword
 — destroying the mountain range behind him in the process. Realising his full power,
Ōnoki
 questions whether or not Madara had gone easy on him and
Mū
 in the past, to which Madara states that why an adult should fight seriously against children. As the Kage stand to face Madara nonetheless, Ōnoki then states that they would not back down now, causing Madara to resolve himself to crushing their beliefs. Elsewhere,
Itachi
 then commands
Kabuto
 to use the
hand seals
 he had just stated to end the
Impure World Reincarnation
.
Sasuke
 uses this time to state his resolve to Itachi and that he will destroy the village because of what it did to him before bidding farewell to Itachi. As the technique is released, the reincarnated shinobi from all-over the battlefield begin to deconstruct. Upon seeing this, a battered
Naruto
 and
B
 thanks Itachi and uses it as motivation to wrap things up with
Tobi
 as well. Before being completely decommissioned, Itachi heads towards his little brother with his hand outstretched, stating that he could still make it.
