After Naruto recovered from his week-long coma, Tsubaki surprised him by being alive as Aoi had been silent about her condition. Naruto soon left as Tsubaki was left happy now that her daughter was now cheerful again.

Much later, Naruto returned to the Forest of Delusion and took Aoi to the Crystal Cave to find the Tree of Life's seed. Tsubaki had been out collecting herbs for dinner at the time and had become worried as to where Aoi was. Upon hearing of Aoi's psychic connection to the Tree and that the village was now growing it again, Tsubaki became overjoyed and prepared a delicious dinner for Naruto as thanks for helping once again. After dinner, Tsubaki gave him a gift and bade him farewell after getting Aoi to calm down about waiting until Naruto's next visit.
