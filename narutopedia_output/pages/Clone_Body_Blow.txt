Naruto
 and four
shadow clones
 work together to deliver a physical attack from a distance. There is no set pattern, steps, or method to how this is done, instead relying on Naruto's characteristic unpredictability to be devised in the moment. When he uses this against
Gaara
, three shadow clones distract Gaara while the fourth throws Naruto at him, intended to deliver a body blow. Because one of his shadow clones is throwing him, Naruto's body blow ends up being more accurate and damaging than what he could do on his own.
