This is a technique used by Kakashi Hatake. He first creates a slightly larger Lightning Cutter than usual with both hands, but then quickly grasps the lightning and pulls it apart into two hands. He then charges at the enemy with one Lightning Cutter, uppercutting the enemy into the air. Then Kakashi appears above the enemy and releases all the lightning into the enemy, charging down with them in a giant cyclone of lightning.
