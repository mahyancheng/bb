Interlude

In Naruto's Footsteps: The Friends' Paths

Yōrō and
Kegon
 were instructed by
Shibuki
 to hide their jōnin status, and protect
Fū
 while she's attending the
Chūnin Exams
 in
Konohagakure
. Once entering the exams, Yōrō and his teammates were randomly split into different rooms, with him being placed in room 3 during the written test. On monitor,
Shikamaru Nara
 as proctor explained that everyone only needs to answer one question on the test but their combined score with their teammates will determine if they pass or fail the exam as they need exactly 100 points to pass. While everyone else began panicking on how to pass, Fū
communicated
 with her teammates which question each to answer.






Team Fū about to enter Demon Desert.



With the conclusion of the three question choice test, Shikamaru revealed a bonus question, asking to which teammate you would leave to be a decoy. The answer had to be unanimous with the person picked being disqualified. His team was able to qualify for the second round by not answering which proved to be the right choice as all members of a team would need to be present for the second round. However, a preliminary round had to be held to lessen the many participants there were. The preliminary round involved a race to
Sunagakure
 with only the first 30 teams qualifying for the primary second round. His team was the first to move out, ultimately arriving at their destination first.
 At the checkpoint base, he and Kegon locked Fū in her room to keep her from doing something troublesome, though she managed to escape anyways. After finding Fū, who took a giant scorpion down saving
Team Asuma
, Kegon and Yōrō took her back with them. The next day,
Temari
 — the second proctor, announced the start of the second phase that would be held within
Demon Desert
.

Later, despite gaining both needed scrolls, Fū was determined to no end this exam before making some friends. She was convinced however to complete the exam when reminded she was taking the exams for Shibuki's sake. Soon afterwards, a massive sandstorm rampaged the area. Hearing people shouting for help, Fū quickly rushed out to find them, much to Yōrō's annoyance.
 Later, despite catching up with Fū, the jinchūriki again ran off, deeply troubled, leaving Kegon and Yōrō annoyed and confused.
 The two later caught up with Fū only to discover she, along with the Kazekage, were having their respective tailed beasts
extracted
 by the Suna-nin
Hōichi
. Upon seeing
Team Guy
 arrive and admitting to knowing Fū's true identy as a jinchūriki, Kegon and Yōrō prepared to fight off the other team. There were quickly however surprised when Neji expressed a genuine desire to help save Fū and the Kazekage. Yōrō and Kegon joined in attacking Hōichi as a distraction while Neji went after the jinchūriki. Using his
Gentle Fist
, Neji was able to block the chakra point from which the tailed beasts were being extracted. This lead to the chakra chains embedded in the jinchūriki to be removed and ultimate attack their castor in Hōichi. With the enemy defeated and the crisis averted, Yōrō joined in laughing at Neji's awkwardness from Fū asking him to be her friend.

Ultimately, the Chūnin Exams were ended early before starting the finals due to controversy happening in the second exam. Sometime afterwards,
Akatsuki
 members
Kakuzu
 and
Hidan
 tracked the team down to capture Fū. It is unknown if Yōrō survived the encounter.
