This is a collaboration technique whereby eight people simultaneously perform the Tiger
hand seal
, forming a large sealing formula with a
jinchūriki
 at its centre. The formula then begins to glow and suppress the
tailed beast
's
chakra
.

Chiriku
 along with seven others attempted to use this technique to suppress the Tailed Beast Chakra's rage inducing influence over
Sora
, but Sora was able to easily break their formation using a chakra enhanced
roar
 and thus prevent the technique's completion.
