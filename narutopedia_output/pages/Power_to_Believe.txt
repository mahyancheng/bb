"
Power to Believe
" (
信じる力
,
Shinjiru Chikara
) is episode 158 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Konan
 and the
Six Paths of Pain
 continue their attack on
Konohagakure
 while systematically interrogating and killing
shinobi
 and civilians alike regarding the whereabouts of
Naruto Uzumaki
, the
jinchūriki
 of the
Nine-Tailed Fox
. Due to
Tsunade
's duties as
Hokage
 and
Shizune
 leading the autopsy,
Sakura
 is placed in charge of all the wounded at the
Konoha Hospital
.
Danzō Shimura
 decides to alert
Koharu Utatane
 and
Homura Mitokado
, the two elders of the
Konoha Council
, that
Pain
 of the
Akatsuki
 is destroying their village in an attempt to find Naruto, whom Tsunade is attempting to bring back to the village at the very moment.

Angered, the two elders storm into Tsunade's office, asking her to leave Naruto at
Mount Myōboku
, unsatisfied with her handling of events. As the elders mention the dangers of handing the Nine-Tails over to Pain, who had killed
Jiraiya
 of all people, Tsunade is vexed as they refer to Naruto as merely the vessel of the
tailed beast
. Pulling them off their feet by their collars, she announces that Naruto is not just a vessel, but a
shinobi
 of Konoha, a comrade, who has sworn to defend their village, recalling when Naruto saved her during her
battle with

Kabuto
; she proceeds to tell the elders that the
Third Hokage
,
Chiyo
 of
Suna
 and Jiraiya all possessed something that the two of them lack — the power to believe, to have faith, in someone like Naruto. Back at Mount Myōboku, Naruto has perfected becoming one with nature and proceeds to use his
Sage Mode
 to hone a
certain technique
.

Shizune rushes in to Tsunade's office, revealing that they found
chakra receivers
 within the
body
 Jiraiya procured, and that the very chakra receiver is still working. Musing why Pain is sending chakra to the other bodies, Tsunade orders
Kōsuke
, a messenger
toad
, to return to Mount Myōboku and relay the situation to Naruto and Fukasaku; Tsunade then proceeds to head to the roof. As everyone clears out of the office, Kōsuke prepares to dispel himself back home, only to be stabbed and killed by Danzō, who does not want the Nine-Tails to return to Konoha. On the roof, Tsunade
summons

Katsuyu
 and tells her to use her
Slug Great Division
 to split into numerous, smaller slugs and heal the wounded, swearing to protect the village as Hokage. Meanwhile, Pain's
Deva Path
 interrogates
Iruka
, who does not divulge Naruto's location. Before Pain can kill Iruka, he is saved by
Kakashi
, who prepares to deal with the Deva Path himself while Iruka escapes.
