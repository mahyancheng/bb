The village.



This unnamed village is hidden among special trees that produce a
genjutsu
-like effect, thus protecting the village from invaders.
Naruto
 and
Jiraiya
 came to the village to hone Naruto's genjutsu-repelling abilities. Villagers use
Chilli Pepper Bombs
 to counter the genjutsu-like effects.
 There, they encountered
Kandachi
 and his helpers. With the help of
Tanishi
, Naruto and Jiraiya managed to defeat their foe.
