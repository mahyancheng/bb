Sasuke throws his sword at the opponent, which is actually a transformed shadow clone of Boruto, who attacks them with a Rasengan.

Trivia

In the manga and anime, Boruto and Sasuke perform a similar manoeuvre.

This move appears to reference Sasuke's previous attacks throwing Naruto transformed as a weapon, such as against Zabuza and Momoshiki.
