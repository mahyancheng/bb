Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Even with his arm having been ignited by
Amaterasu
, the
Fourth Raikage
 continues to attack
Sasuke
.
Gaara
 appears and prevents the two from engaging further. He asks for a chance to speak with Sasuke, which will also give the Raikage an opportunity to deal with his arm. Gaara discourages Sasuke from a life of hate, citing his own experiences as proof that doing so won't solve anything. Sasuke rejects Gaara's suggestion that he can turn back. Gaara sheds tears for him. When
Temari
 and
Kankurō
 point out that if Sasuke could be convinced
Naruto
 wouldn't have failed and that Sasuke isn't Gaara. Gaara, the
Sunagakure
 bodyguards (Kankurō and Temari) and the
Kumogakure

bodyguard
 attack him simultaneously. Sasuke further develops his
Susanoo
 to protect himself from harm.
