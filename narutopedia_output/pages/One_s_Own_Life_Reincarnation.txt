The
One's Own Life Reincarnation
 is a technique that was developed in
Sunagakure
's
Puppet Brigade
.

Usage

The user, giving their life force to the target, uses all their
chakra
 as an intermediary. This technique can be used on both the living and dead. Using it on the living can save and restore the target from an otherwise fatal condition but will leave the user greatly exhausted. When used on the dead, the user will find certain death in exchange for the
soul
 of the deceased. While in use, the released chakra shines a pale-blue colour, and if the user's own chakra is insufficient, a third party can assist, but only the actual user of the jutsu will die.

Trivia

Out of humane motives, Sunagakure labelled this technique as a "kinjutsu" immediately after its development. As such, the only one who can use this technique is its developer, Chiyo, and as she is the sole known user, upon her death the technique is believed to be lost forever.

The purpose of the technique was to give life to
puppets
, increasing their efficiency in battle. Chiyo also wished to give the
Mother and Father
 puppets the souls of
Sasori's parents
.

In the anime,
Ranmaru
 was capable of restoring an almost dead
Raiga
 similar to how Chiyo restored a fatally injured
Sakura Haruno
.
