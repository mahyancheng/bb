The
Lightning Release: Double Lariat
 is a stronger version of the
Lightning Release: Lariat
, whereby two users perform the technique from both behind and in front of the opponent, creating a scissor effect, up to close to light-speed.
 Both users must use the exact same amount of opposing strength or the target will merely bend.
 When successfully done, the force of the technique will decapitate the target and send their head flying several metres into the air.

Trivia

As with many
Kumogakure
 techniques, this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation. Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as
Zetsugyū Rairi Nettō
.

This technique is used as a test to see who will be worthy to become the
Raikage
's
tag-team partner
, as the potential candidate must be able to synchronise their strength with the Raikage. As such, this technique is feared even outside of Kumogakure.

This move might be a reference to the move from the
Kinnikuman
 manga series called
Cross Bomber
 usually performed by
Neptuneman
 and
Big The Budo
.
