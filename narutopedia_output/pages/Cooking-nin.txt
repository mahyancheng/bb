Naruto
 serving a group of Cooking-nin.



Cooking-nin
 (
料理忍者
,
Ryōri Ninja
,
English TV:
 Ninja Chef) are ninja who specialise in cooking. They only work in the
Land of Lightning
. They walk around in forests and paths outside villages, waiting for hungry ninja to walk past. When they find a hungry ninja team, they make all kinds of food for them.
Hakkaku
, the only named cooking-nin, makes such good food that ninja can't stop eating and become fat. This can take a massive toll on the ninja's abilities, and can destroy a mission completely.
