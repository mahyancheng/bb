Itachi Uchiha — a shinobi whose shurikenjutsu skills are highly praised.



Shurikenjutsu
 (
手裏剣術
,
literally meaning:
 concealed hand blade techniques) pertains to techniques that entail the throwing of
shuriken
,
kunai
,
senbon
, or any other number of bladed, hand-held weapons. Shurikenjutsu can be used in combination with
taijutsu
,
ninjutsu
, and/or
chakra flow
 in order to create more devastating techniques. Additionally, shurikenjutsu can pertain to techniques used through ninjutsu-made weapons.

As a consequence of the versatility of the weapons involved, it is practised by nearly all shinobi to some extent. However, because of its value as a supplemental art, numerous more innovative techniques have been developed, including ones that can even alter the trajectory of the projectiles once they've be thrown. Expert users like
Itachi Uchiha
, can use such methods to accurately hit targets that are even located in their
blind spots
. Shurikenjutsu becomes a specialty for Itachi's brother,
Sasuke
, as well for Sasuke's daughter,
Sarada
.
