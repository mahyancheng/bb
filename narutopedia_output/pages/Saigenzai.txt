Saigenzai
 (
催幻剤
,
literally meaning:
 Hypnotic Illusionary Medicine) is a type of drug that produces
genjutsu
, mentioned in
Naruto Jinraiden: The Day the Wolf Howled
. Because the genjutsu is administered through a drug, it does not rely on a user to keep it in effect and it's able to have a stronger hold on those who it's used on. Depending on how it's prepared, saigenzai can create "malfunctions" in a person's vision, hearing, and
semicircular canals
. Members of the
Kodon clan
 are able to prepare a special version of saigenzai called
Kotarō
, which can be used to treat severe illnesses.

Saigenzai is popular in the
Howling Wolf Village
 as a narcotic, used by former
shinobi
 to cope with their uneventful and/or traumatic lives. Frequent users are identifiable by their dark eyes and pale complexion;
Sasuke Uchiha
, because he always looks like that, is initially mistaken for such a user. These former shinobi variously call saigenzai "the pill of ascent", "the powder of heaven", "the pill of affection", and "the pill of perturbation". Because saigenzai can be deadly to those who take it improperly, it is illegal within the village.
