The
Creation Rebirth
 was invented by
Tsunade
 with the resolution to protect the lives of her comrades. By
releasing
 a large amount of
chakra
 at once, the body's cell division is forcibly stimulated. Whenever the body's tissues are damaged or an organ is destroyed, the injury will instantly heal regardless of the severity. So long as Creation Rebirth remains active, the user cannot die, earning it recognition as the "pinnacle of
medical ninjutsu
" and the "ultimate regeneration technique".

Creation Rebirth does not repair the old cells, instead hastening the creation of new ones through division. Because a body's cells
can only split a certain number of times
, the user shortens their natural lifespan whenever this technique is used.
