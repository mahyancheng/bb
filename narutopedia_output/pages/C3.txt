Deidara's most powerful large scale bomb, that once activated becomes an enormous statue that Deidara drops on his target from above. Its explosive power was great enough to potentially destroy an entire village.

In its first known demonstration, Deidara had already prepared the explosive clay for this attack. Once activated, the bomb instantaneously increases its proportions before being subsequently dropped, where it extends both its "arms" outwards until they are completely horizontal.
