Naruto
 manga.

Summary

As
Sasuke
's
Susanoo
 equips itself onto
Naruto
's
senjutsu
-enhanced
Tailed Beast Mode
 mantle, combining the two young men's abilities, much to their surprise,
Kakashi
 — who is still in
Kamui's dimension
 — is able to both see and hear what is going on via the link shared between his and
Obito
's
Sharingan
. Readying himself for one last all-out counter-attack, Obito
manifests
 a gigantic shield and the
Sage of the Six Paths
'
legendary holy weapon
, the latter of which he commented was used to shape the first world, would now destroy the one he considered to be fake.
 Creating nine
Rasengan
 in
Kurama
's tails, Naruto
contacts
 his comrades from the
Konoha 11
 and
Sai
 to join the fray. As they jump directly into Kurama's tails, they themselves don Tailed Beast Mode mantles much to their shock. Naruto charges them to break down Obito's defences using the Rasengan, so that he and Sasuke could have a direct shot at attacking him. As their attack is launched, a confused Obito begins to see more of himself in Naruto and even begins to hallucinate about what his life could have been like — even without
Rin
— if he had returned to the village instead. Ultimately, the
shinobi
 are able to break through his defence, and the two young men are also able to deal a devastating blow to Obito with Susanoo's sword.
