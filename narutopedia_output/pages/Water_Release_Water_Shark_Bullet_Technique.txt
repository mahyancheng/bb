The user manipulates a volume of
water
 with their hand; by thrusting their hand in a direction, the manipulated water is sent in that direction. As it moves, the body of water takes the shape of a shark, with additional water following in its wake for as long as the user keeps their hand thrust out. Because of how quickly the shark moves and because of how much water there is, it does extensive damage when it impacts something.
 Users can also ride within the water shark as it moves, allowing them to travel faster than they're able to swim.

Trivia

In the anime, when Kisame rides the shark, it flies through the air rather than swimming through the water.

In
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes
, the shark is depicted as purple instead of blue.
