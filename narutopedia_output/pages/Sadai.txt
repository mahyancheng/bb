Sadai
 (
サダイ
) is a
mercenary

missing-nin
 who entered the
Land of Fire
 to kidnap
Naho
.

Background

During the
Third Shinobi World War
, Sadai and his group encountered and fought members of the
Uchiha clan
.

Appearance






Sadai in disguise.



Sadai in his armour guise is a large man with a toothless mouth, giving a puppet-like impression, wearing the same head hooded uniform with a raised collar as his men. In his true form, he is a brown-haired man with dashing looks and sleeveless shirt.

Abilities

Physical Prowess

Without augmentation from ninjutsu, Sadai showed a high level of speed and agility while also demonstrating great
taijutsu
 skill, enough to initially dominate
Sasuke
 in combat and force him to use his
Sharingan
.

Ninjutsu

Nature Transformation






Sadai using Earth Release: Mudslide.



Sadai demonstrated great
Earth Release
 prowess. He could easily manipulate the terrain around him to box in and turn the
ground into quicksand
 to subdue his target. He could also encase himself in a
stone armour
 that in addition to considerably altering his appearance, gave him great resistance from most forms of attack as well as enabling him to alter the stone as a makeshift weapon. Despite the density of his armour slowing him down, he is still considerably fast, surprising his enemies with his bulky appearance. He could also create a
large wall of earth
 for defensive purposes or blend in and move
in and out
 of rock undetected.

Part II

Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha

Sadai and his group intercepted
Naruto Uzumaki
,
Sakura Haruno
 and
Naho
. Naruto managed to defeat his comrades, but his
Shadow Clone Techniques
 and
Rasengan
 didn't work on him. After he captured the group,
Sasuke Uchiha
 came and battled him. After discovering his
taijutsu
 skills weren't enough, he used
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
 to burn the assailant's
armour
, thus showing his true face. Sasuke defeated him using
Chidori
, and even after his defeat, Sasuke punched him severely because of his words about
Itachi Uchiha
 and the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
, and about Sasuke being weak, up to the point where Sadai began to plead for mercy. Sasuke was only stopped by
Kakashi
, who reminded him that they should bring Sadai back for questioning.
