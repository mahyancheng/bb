This article is about the shinobi. For the episode, see
Fūshin
.

Nowaki
 (
ノワキ
) was once the leader of the
Lightning Group
. At the time, he went by the name
Fūshin
 (
風心
,
Fūshin
).

Background

Fūshin was born on a poverty-stricken island in the Land of Water. As a child, he was ostracised for his
kekkei genkai
 and was blamed for being responsible for a typhoon that destroyed his village. He was sold to a businessman named Kusabi, and endured torture and starvation by his owner. At the
Coliseum
, he fought against
Chino
 but was defeated when he fell victim to her Ketsuryūgan genjutsu, causing him to pass into the ownership of
En Oyashiro
. Fūshin was initially hostile towards Chino for winning against him but they became close friends after bonding over their mutual loneliness of being mistreated for their abilities and having no families. Fūshin also told Chino about his past, something he had never shared with anyone. Fūshin helped Chino,
Karyū
, and the rest of the En's collected children escape from his compound. Chino returned to her ancestral
Valley of Hell
 while Fūshin and the others formed the
Lightning Group
. Fūshin led their group, in their ongoing mission of stealing from criminals and distributing their plunder to the downtrodden, such as the people of the
Bamboo Village
.

After the group was betrayed by
Kirigakure
, they asked for shelter in the Bamboo Village, who refused to harbour them in fear of retaliation. Unable to find help anywhere else, Fūshin was eventually able to find Chino in the Valley of Hell, where she took care of him during the year it took him for his injuries to heal. Once he was better, they formulated a plan to take revenge against Kiri and the other hidden villages for how they treated those with kekkei genkai.

Personality

Nowaki first appears as a polite and shy individual, but he actually harbours deep hatred towards those of higher authority. He presents an innocent and childlike façade to gather information on his intended victims and, once he lets loose this persona, he becomes violent and eager to challenge his opponents. When he first meets
Sasuke Uchiha
, Nowaki treats him with respect, but once Sasuke detects deception from him, Nowaki shows how he already despises Sasuke for interfering with his and Chino's plans when he was once a criminal himself. The only person Nowaki truly cares about is Chino, whom he looks up to as an older sister.

Appearance






Nowaki disguised by Chino.



Nowaki is a fair-skinned man of slender frame described as having about the same height as Sasuke Uchiha. He has long green hair and yellow eyes. He is seen wearing a dark hooded cloak and has a scar under his left eye. While carrying out their vendetta against the hidden villages, Chino distorts his body to make him appear taller with a broader frame and face with a noticeably burly build.

In his usual outfit, he wears a sleeveless light grey shirt, long light grey pants, black stockings, light grey sandals, red headband, and a beige belt. When he returns to his normal size, those clothes become a little baggy and loose.

Abilities

Nowaki is a talented shinobi, having proven so by excelling in the Coliseum where wealthy collectors pit their ninja against each other. He is also skilled enough to briefly hold his own against Sasuke Uchiha.

Nature Transformation






Nowaki using Typhoon Release.



Nowaki possessed the
Typhoon Release
 kekkei genkai – a powerful variation of
Wind Release
. With it, he could easily conjure
powerful winds
 to mow down or otherwise limit his enemy's field of vision. With effort, he could also use a much
stronger
 variation of the technique, having shown to not only dwarf Sasuke's
Complete Body — Susanoo
 but also being capable of briefly forcing it to the defensive. The storms Nowaki can create using his kekkei genkai are severe enough to cover an entire island.

Bukijutsu

Nowaki was particularly skilled in
shurikenjutsu
. With prowess in
chakra flow
, Nowaki is able to channel his wind-chakra through his weapons to greatly increase their lethality. Not only does this enhance their sharpness and range, but also, upon impact, turns them into powerful explosives. To aide in his technique, Nowaki made use of a number of uniquely designed
Chakra Blades
.

When Nowaki and Chino pass through
Bamboo Village
, they are recruited by
Iō
 to help him deal with the
Dark Thunder Group
. When
Sasuke Uchiha
 later also passes through, they stop the villagers from attacking Sasuke in a misunderstanding. Sasuke is convinced to help stop the Dark Thunder Group is joined by Chino and Nowaki as they investigate a nearby village that the group destroyed. Bamboo Village is attacked while they're away, and when they return Nowaki and Chino help get the villagers to safety, leaving Sasuke to deal with the group's leader,
Karyū
. Once the Dark Thunder Group is dealt with, they all go their separate ways.

In the course of his investigation into attacks on
Konoha
,
Kumo
, and
Kiri
, Sasuke tracks down a man named Fūshin in the
Land of Water
. When he arrives on the island where Fūshin is supposed to be, he discovers that Fūshin is Nowaki. Nowaki attacks Sasuke with his
Typhoon Release
. Sasuke summons
Aoda
 to escape from the typhoon and uses
Lightning Release
 to electrocute Nowaki, which injures him. With Nowaki defeated, Chino steps in, uses her
Ketsuryūgan
 to distract Sasuke, and they flee.

They take refuge in the Valley of Hell, but are found by Sasuke soon afterwards. Nowaki doesn't take part in the battle between Sasuke and Chino due to his injuries, but does come to Chino's defence when she's about to be captured. Ultimately, Chino and Nowaki are swayed by Sasuke's words of working for peace and having friends that saved him from darkness, and they surrender. After being dropped off at prison, Nowaki and Chino are offered to work for Kirigakure in exchange for their freedom, which they agree to.
