"
Surpassing the Master
" (
師を超えるとき
,
Shi o Koeru Toki
) is episode 156 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 attempts to channel
natural energy
 without the toad oil to no avail, only causing himself and his
shadow clones
 to begin their frog mutation.
Fukasaku
 tells Naruto that the key is to focus, and thus leads Naruto atop a bunch of spires, telling the
genin
 to learn how to concentrate and stay still without moving, lest he plummet all the way down. After Naruto fails to do so, being caught by Fukasaku's tongue, the sage toad remembers
Jiraiya
's
training
.

After learning that Jiraiya had done the very same training but had taken years to master it, Naruto claims he does not have such time and thus creates two shadow clones to expedite his progress. After a short while, Naruto and his two shadow clones manage to balance themselves on a board placed upon a spire, sitting without moving for an entire day, even through a period of rain. As Naruto manages to enter into a perfect
Sage Mode
, Fukasaku marvels how quickly Naruto has managed to use
senjutsu
 without the aid of the toad oil and how he may surpass Jiraiya very soon. However, a bird lands on Naruto's shoulder and he loses his concentration, falling straight to the ground. After his fall creates an impact on the ground, Naruto realises that he has not been injured in anyway; Fukasaku reveals that Sage Mode grants the user much more durability, agility, and strength, making Naruto even more agile and boosting his already rapid recovery rate. Fukasaku then adds that Naruto has one more step to master — the art of the
Frog Kata
, a
taijutsu
 exclusive to those who have mastered Sage Mode.

Meanwhile,
Taka
 sequester themselves in a hideout in
Kumogakure
.
Suigetsu
 expresses dismay at the fact that his
Kubikiribōchō
 was left behind in the
Valley of Clouds and Lightning
, and asks
Sasuke
 whether the
Akatsuki
 would really hand over the power of a
tailed beast
 to them. Sasuke responds that he does not need that power now that he possesses the
Mangekyō Sharingan
, only for him to clutch his eyes as his vision becomes blurred.
Karin
, however, alerts them that she
senses
 a
chakra
 signature outside their hideout.
J
, a Kumo
shinobi
, has located them and attempts to use a
Messenger Lizard
 to communicate back with his partner,
K
; however, Sasuke kills the lizard with his
sword
 as
Jūgo
 deals with J.

At the
Raikage
's office, the
Kage
 is infuriated that Sasuke of the Akatsuki has kidnapped his
brother
 and demands to know why the
Hokage
 of
Konoha
 had not dealt with him yet. Wanting to retrieve his brother, the Raikage orders his aide to gather intel from
Tsunade
 regarding Sasuke and dispatches
Team Samui
, a squad trained by Killer B, to retrieve him from the Akatsuki's clutches; he also decides to host a
Five Kage Summit
 to deal with the problem of the Akatsuki.

Back at
Mount Myōboku
, Naruto begins to wonder whether he could try
something
 under the effects of Sage Mode, but dismisses the thought to Fukasaku. After getting the hang of Frog Kata, Fukasaku and Naruto decide to rest up for the night. However, after the sage toad falls asleep, Naruto quietly leaves and decides to attempt a technique using Sage Mode. After having succeeded, Naruto muses to himself that he shall try to continue honing this technique in secret, without anybody finding out.
