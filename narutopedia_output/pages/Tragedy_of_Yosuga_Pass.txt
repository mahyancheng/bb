The Tragedy of Yosuga Pass.



The
Tragedy of Yosuga Pass
 (
ヨスガ峠の悲劇
,
Yosuka Tōge no Higeki
) is a tragic event that happened ten years prior to the start of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

Background

Three
shinobi
 from
Kirigakure
,
Suiren
,
Ganryū
 and
Junsai
 were sent on a mission to retrieve a document taken by
Kumogakure
 with
Iwagakure
's assistance. However, when the document was retrieved, the Iwagakure shinobi immediately betrayed the Kiri team on the orders of their
Tsuchikage
 to retrieve the document although it ultimately remained in Kirigakure's possession after Ganryū was pushed from a cliff into a river. However, this resulted in Junsai's death and Suiren sacrificing herself in order to save Ganryū at
Yosuga Pass
 by blocking a barrage of kunai meant for Ganryū. Since that day, Ganryū and other Kiri ninja who disapproved the betrayal had grown to despise Iwagakure and its shinobi. This incident, known as the Tragedy of Yosuga Pass marked the beginning of hostility between Kirigakure and Iwagakure.

Near the beginning of the Fourth Shinobi World War, the
Third Tsuchikage
 sent an envoy to formally apologise for the incident, sending the Kiri ninja the personal belongings collected from Kiri's fallen shinobi.
