Remembering
Jiraiya
's words about never abandoning his
ninja way
, Naruto creates a fully charged
Rasengan
, but increases its mass and raw force. It has shown enough power to blast away an entire wall of a fortress and even decimate it in a matter of minutes. Unlike a normal
Rasengan
, which fades away after striking its target, this version does not disappear until
Naruto
 was finished destroying the entire fortress. This technique can be compared with the
Big Ball Rasengan
 having many similarities, except being much smaller.
