"
Boruto and Tentō
" (
ボルトとテントウ
,
Boruto to Tentō
) is episode 151 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Shojoji
 questions
Boruto
's presence after his escort mission is over. Boruto derides him as a shinobi. Shojoji signals his underlings to deal with Boruto, but he makes short work of them. Shojoji reveals to Boruto their previous encounters, when Shojoji was disguised as
Tsukiyo
, and later as
Kokuri
. Enraged by the revelation, Boruto attacks Shojoji. He attacks with
electrified shuriken
, and the
Rasengan
, but Shojoji
reflects
 them with his
Wind Release
. Boruto attempts attacks with
shadow clones
 from different directions, but Shojoji reflects them as well. Boruto's following attacks almost land, the previous ones being distractions.
Ikkyū
 manages to gather enough money for the ransom, but doing so draws the attention of
Sai
, who arrives at the hotel with his team. Boruto uses a
smoke bomb
 and strategises with
Tentō
. Shojoji clears the smoke, and grabs hold of the real Boruto, while
destroying
 his shadow clones, aware of his limit of four clones. Boruto suddenly can't mould chakra. Tentō hits Shojoji with a shuriken, his surprise at it creating an opening for Boruto to land a Rasengan without Shojoji reflecting it. Shojoji decides to
eat
 Boruto to take his jutsu, and Boruto's
seal
 activates, causing him pain.
 Shojoji seemingly recognises the seal, and for a moment fears Boruto might be part of a certain organisation, before realising Boruto has no idea what he's talking about. Shojoji attempts to attack, but is
restrained
 by
Mitsuki
 and
knocked out
 by
Sarada
. Sarada and Mitsuki notice the seal of his hand. Sarada questions why he kept it hidden, and Boruto explains
Sasuke
 told him to do it. Ikkyū arrives, relieved at Tentō's safety. Sai also arrives, having captured the gang's spies.
Konohamaru
 congratulates them of defeating Shojoji, but stresses they abandoned a previously accepted mission, and confirms Kokuri's disappearance after leaving Konoha.
Team 7
 sees Tentō and Ikkyū off at the train station, and Boruto returns the card Tentō gave him, wanting to get it himself. Sai and
Ibiki
 prepare to interrogate Shojoji, who claims he'll only collaborate if they offer something as valuable as the intel he can offer. Sasuke arrives, and his reputation is enough to get Shojoji talking. He doesn't know specifics about the seal on Boruto's palm, but knows of a group that takes interest in such seals, called
Kara
. He also divulges that these seals are different from
Orochimaru
's
cursed seals
.
