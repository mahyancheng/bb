Team 10
 (
第十班
,
Daijippan
,
Viz:
 Cell Number 10) is volume 36 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 320

"
Bounties…!!
" (
賞金首…!!
,
Shōkinkubi…!!
)

Asuma
 takes his
Nijū Shōtai
 team to the
Fire Temple
 to pay his respects to
Chiriku
. Since Chiriku's body was the only one to not be recovered, they theorise that
Akatsuki
 is collecting the bounty on his head. The team heads for the nearest bounty station and sends word to the other Nijū Shōtai teams to check the others. In
Konoha
,
Naruto
 is exhausted from all of his training.
Kakashi
 takes Naruto to the
Ramen Ichiraku
 and tells him there is something he wants to show him.

Chapter 321

"
Smooth Talking…!!
" (
口上手…!!
,
Kuchijōzu…!!
)

After leaving the
Ramen Ichiraku
,
Kakashi
 reminds
Naruto
 that creating a technique requires combining
nature transformation
 with
shape transformation
. By completing his
Wind Release
 training, he has the former, and since he can already perform the
Rasengan
, he has the latter. Naruto concludes that creating a new technique will be easy since he has already mastered both components, but Kakashi corrects him by showing that he can also use the Rasengan. Combining nature transformation with the Rasengan was too difficult for Kakashi and the Rasengan's creator, the
Fourth Hokage
. Kakashi is confident that Naruto will succeed where they failed. Elsewhere,
Shikamaru
 points out that
Asuma
 hasn't smoked a cigarette since learning of
Chiriku
's death, a sign that something is bothering him.

Chapter 322

"
That Guy Can't be Killed
" (
あいつは殺せない
,
Aitsu wa Korosenai
)

Asuma
 admits that he hasn't smoked recently, but insists it is not because of worry over a fight with
Akatsuki
, although he is concerned about how they will fare. In
Konoha
,
Naruto
 and his
shadow clones
 struggle to combine
Wind Release
 with the
Rasengan
, a process that is frustrating enough that some clones lose control of the
Nine-Tails
'
chakra
.
Yamato
 suppresses them. Elsewhere,
Hidan
 waits outside a bounty station for
Kakuzu
 to finish his business. Asuma appears and attacks him, though Hidan blocks the attack. Before he can retaliate he is captured by
Shikamaru
's shadow, giving
Izumo
 and
Kotetsu
 a chance to strike. They believe they have killed him, but Hidan merely asks who they are.

Chapter 323

"
God's Judgment!!
" (
神の裁き!!
,
Kami no Sabaki!!
)

Izumo
 and
Kotetsu
 rhetorically ask if
Hidan
 is immortal, which he confirms.
Asuma
 had intended to kill Hidan and capture his partner, but given this development decides to switch the fates of the
Akatsuki
 members. Since Hidan is captured by
Shikamaru
's shadow Asuma goes looking for
Kakuzu
, but finds Kakuzu attacking Shikamaru in order to release Hidan. The
Konoha
 ninja regroup while Hidan, freed, draws a design on the ground with some of his blood. Asuma engages him in battle while Shikamaru observes and Kakuzu refuses to participate. Hidan injures Asuma with his
Triple-Bladed Scythe
 and, after licking some of Asuma's blood off the scythe, transforms.

Chapter 324

"
Shikamaru's Analysis!!
" (
シカマルの分析!!
,
Shikamaru no Bunseki!!
)

With
Hidan
 in his
transformed state
,
Asuma
 finds that all the damage he does to Hidan is also done to him. This also applies to damage that Hidan does to himself, a fact he takes advantage of by stabbing himself to immobilise Asuma. He tries to stab himself in the heart to finish off Asuma, but is caught and stopped by
Shikamaru
's shadow. While straining to keep Hidan from finishing his attack, Shikamaru analyses his actions and discovers how Hidan has linked himself with Asuma.

Chapter 325

"
There Won't be a Later…!!
" (
後は無い…!!
,
Ato wa Nai…!!
)

Shikamaru
 explains that
Hidan
's link with
Asuma
 was created when he consumed some of Asuma's blood. However, in order for this link to do anything, Hidan must stand within the boundaries of the design he drew on the ground earlier. To break the link, Shikamaru forces Hidan out of the design and ties him down. Asuma tests Shikamaru's theory by inflicting harmless wounds on Hidan, which do do not occur to himself. Content, Asuma cuts off Hidan's head. Hidan's head yells at
Kakuzu
 for not stopping Asuma before this happened.

Chapter 326

"
Desired Pain…!!
" (
望んだ痛み…!!
,
Nozonda Itami…!!
)

Kakuzu
 sews
Hidan
's head back onto his body. With
Shikamaru
 exhausted,
Asuma
 tries to escape with his team, but Kakuzu blocks their exit.
Izumo
 and
Kotetsu
 attack him while Asuma goes after Hidan, intending to stop him from restoring their link. Hidan strikes with his
Triple-Bladed Scythe
. Asuma dodges and it strikes Hidan, but he discovers too late that Hidan has returned to the
Jashin
 symbol that causes them to share damage. Asuma doubles over from the pain the scythe has done to Hidan while Hidan, despite Shikamaru's attempts to stop him, stabs himself in the heart.

Chapter 327

"
Amidst Despair…
" (
絶望の中に…
,
Zetsubō no Naka ni…
)

Asuma
 collapses while his team watches helplessly.
Kakuzu
 prepares to finish off,
Izumo
, and
Kotetsu
, but is stopped by
Aoba Yamashiro
 and
Raidō Namiashi
.
Chōji
 gets Asuma to safety while
Ino
 checks on Shikamaru. Shikamaru immediately goes to Asuma's side and, finding that he is still alive, has Ino perform emergency first aid. Kakuzu, wishing to collect the bounty on Asuma's head, tries to take him back, but he is interrupted by the summons of the
Akatsuki leader
.

Chapter 328

"
Team 10
" (
第十班
,
Daijippan
)

Hidan
 and
Kakuzu
 reluctantly leave, telling the
Konoha
 ninja not to go anywhere. The
Nijū Shōtai
 members gather around
Asuma
 but
Ino
 finds that his injuries are too severe for her to heal.
Shikamaru
 tries to rush him back to Konoha but Asuma tells him it is too late for him. He only asks his students listen to his final words. He tells Ino to look after
Chōji
 and Shikamaru and encourages her to not lose to
Sakura
 in any pursuit. He asks Chōji to go on a diet, but tells him not to let that interfere with his good heart. He praises Shikamaru and secretly tells him the identity of the king from their earlier
shōgi
-Konoha analogy. After smoking one last cigarette, Asuma dies. Shikamaru finishes the rest of the cigarette, but complains that the smoke stings his eyes.

Chapter 329

"
That Goal…!!
" (
その目的…!!
,
Sono Mokuteki…!!
)

Naruto
 continues to struggle with combining
Rasengan
 with his
Wind Release

chakra
. He suggests that it is impossible, like looking to the left and right at the same time. To lighten the mood,
Kakashi
 creates a
shadow clone
 to let him do just that, giving Naruto an idea. Meanwhile,
Akatsuki
 is busy sealing the
Three-Tails
.
Hidan
, irritated that his battle had to be interrupted, asks why Akatsuki is capturing the
tailed beasts
. The
Akatsuki leader
 explains that it is to develop a monopoly over wars by using the tailed beasts as weapons, thereby gaining control over the world.

I recently bought an air purifier. My assistants are overjoyed, and I kinda feel good too.
