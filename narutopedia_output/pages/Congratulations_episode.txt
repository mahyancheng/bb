Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Kakashi
 watches proudly as
Sakura
 prevents
Kaguya
 from flying up, allowing
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 to make physical contact with her, activating the
fūinjutsu
 taught to them by
Hagoromo
. As her
Rinne Sharingan
 is obscured, Kaguya wonders how scattered pieces of her chakra were able to seal her again. Hagoromo notices the seal was applied, and prepares to bring everyone back. Kaguya's
Expansive Truth-Seeking Ball
 begins crumbling, the land begins sealing Kaguya, and Kaguya herself begins reverting into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, as the tailed beasts are separated from it.
 The rabbit head left in it spits
Madara
's body out. Sasuke and the tailed beasts meet up with Kakashi and Sakura, while Naruto goes looking for
Black Zetsu
, who is already intent on scheming Kaguya's next resurrection. Naruto denounces Black Zetsu's role in shinobi history, calls it a spoiled brat who's too afraid to leave its mother's side, and throws it toward the forming moon, sealing it as well. Naruto meets up with the others, and Sakura wonders how they'll get out of Kaguya's dimension. Hagoromo summons everyone back with the aid of the previous Kage he called from the Pure Land. Hagoromo congratulates Kakashi on coordinating the sealing, though Kakashi downplays his role. Kakashi bids
Obito
 farewell as Obito's chakra in him fades away. Hagoromo stops Sasuke from reaching Madara, who is about to die. Madara and
Hashirama
 exchange their final words as Madara dies. Hagoromo announces he'll release the summoned Kage, including the ones from Impure World Reincarnation.
Minato
 wishes Naruto happy birthday as dawn breaks. Naruto motormouths several things for Minato to tell
Kushina
 as the Kage's spirits are released and go back to the
afterlife
.

Trivia

Madara is correctly depicted with a replica of Hashirama's face on his chest, which was absent in the original publications of chapters
690
 and
691
. In the preview for this episode, this replica was depicted with the markings of Hashirama's
Sage Mode
, but they are not present in the episode itself. However, the markings briefly appear in one scene when Hashirama approaches Madara.

When Sakura panics about getting home, Kakashi is depicted without Sharingan in either of his eyes.

Throughout the episode,
Gyūki
 is depicted with the horns and tooth it lost during its battle with the
Ten-Tails
.

When Naruto envisions the deceased shinobi who inspired him, Obito is depicted without
Hashirama's artificial body
 on his right half.

In the manga, Kurama gives Naruto the middle finger during their reunion. Instead, he shows his fist to Naruto in this episode.

When the sealing process was underway, Kaguya's horn was depicted as broken as it was in the manga.
