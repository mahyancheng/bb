A
jujutsu
 technique which requires both the user and their opponent be standing within a
Jashin
 symbol, as well as obtaining the victim's blood and using it on their
puppet
. Afterwards, the puppet and victim become connected, allowing any damage done to the puppet to be shared with the connected individual. Even if the victim dies, the connection isn't severed, leaving their corpse to eternally be a puppet.

Trivia

According to
Kakashi Hatake
 and
Might Guy
, this technique was developed by Ryūki based on a common type of jutsu, and that he imitated several Jashin ceremonies based on documents he came across. Kakashi also questioned the validity of such Jashin documents.
