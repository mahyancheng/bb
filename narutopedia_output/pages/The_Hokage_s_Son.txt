"
The Hokage's Son…!!
" (
火影の息子…!!
,
Hokage no Musuko…!!
) is episode 2 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Shino
 explains how the role of the
Academy
 has changed. In addition to shinobi skills being taught as in the past, a broader curriculum of non-shinobi related courses are available.
Boruto
 returns from his two week suspension.
Inojin
 notices him through the window. After Boruto arrives in his classroom, the other students begin gossiping about him, which Boruto ignores.
Chōchō
 and
Sumire
 ask
Sarada
 about Boruto. Sarada says she finds him annoying, and the other two gush about Naruto. Inojin bluntly says what everyone else is thinking about Boruto. Boruto extends his hand in friendship, but Inojin refuses, considering him to be untrustworthy. Sumire tries defusing the situation as
 Shino arrives at the classroom. During practice to assess everyone's strengths and weaknesses,
Denki
 tells Boruto he got the second-best time. The one with the best time,
Iwabee
, isn't there. Boruto tries joining other students for lunch, but they hurry out of the classroom. Iwabee antagonizes Boruto over being the Hokage's son, seeing the current state of the Academy as being soft, despite having flunked twice. Denki speaks in Boruto's defence, and Iwabee targets him. Boruto stops Iwabee from hurting Denki. Despite promising himself he wouldn't fight, Boruto challenges Iwabē to a fight. The class watches nervously, while Inojin is amused. After talking with
Anko
, Shino arrives at an empty classroom, much to his confusion, as everyone ditched class to watch the fight. The class watches the two fighting, Iwabee even saying he won't use his weapon. Boruto and Iwabee are both impressed with each other's skills. Iwabee is frustrated he can't graduate only with shinobi related subjects. After a solid strike on him, Iwabee begins using
Earth Release
, creating an earth hammer. Inojin takes the hammer out of his reach with his
drawings
, and points out Iwabee broke his own rule on not using his weapon. Iwabee realises his mistake. The atmosphere in the class improves, Boruto becomes more popular, and Iwabē decides to start attending class again. Shino then arrives to start class.

Trivia

During the fight, when Boruto kicked Iwabee, the position that he was on the air was similar as of his father, Naruto when he kicked away
Gaara
 in his
Shukaku form
 to save Sasuke from him.

Another one, at the start of the fight, after Boruto threw shuriken at Iwabee, charged with a barrage attack similar to that of Sasuke, as a failed attempt to grab one of
Kakashi
's bells.
