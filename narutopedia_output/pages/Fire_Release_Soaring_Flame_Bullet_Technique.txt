The user gathers chakra from their stomach and spews a small ball of fire. The required hand seals needed for this technique have varied; Kawaki's first use required one hand seal (two in the anime) however, later in the anime, using four hand seals were used.

Trivia

 hand seal rather than Fire Release.
