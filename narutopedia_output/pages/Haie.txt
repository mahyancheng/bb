When Benga left a meeting with Mūjo, he complained to Haie that Mūjo was only a figurehead, and that he was the true power in the prison because he actually ran the place. Later, Haie informed Benga that
Tsukiyo
 wanted a meeting, and accompanied him to it. Later, when prisoners got agitated on account of an attempted breakout, Haie attempted to request reinforcements from Kusagakure, but was stopped and attacked by Benga.
