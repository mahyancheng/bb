Part I

Daimyō Heir Escort Mission

Fukuyokana and
his partner
 tried to trick
Kunihisa
 with some roasted fish, but was easily beaten by
Naruto Uzumaki
. They later showed up further down the river, where they found a lot of the cash Kunihisa had thrown around. With this cash they bribed Kunihisa's other bodyguards, and made them capture him. Naruto then arrived and easily freed Kunihisa, and then fled from the other men. When Naruto and Kunihisa reached a cliff, the bandits found them again, here Naruto threw a rope onto the other side and gave it to Kunihisa and then pushed him over the edge, and at the same time the bandits threw themselves onto Naruto. Fukuyokana cried out to his older brother, who had held onto Kunihisa and afterwards fell down from the cliff. The massive weight from all the people on the cliff, resulted in the cliff breaking and all Fukuyokana and all the former bodyguards falling off the cliff, and into the darkness. After this his status is unknown.
