The Artist Returns
" (

,
Geijutsuka Futatabi
) is episode 255 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Deidara
 detonates his
clay bird
, but only destroys a
rock clone
; the real
Ōnoki
 is out of range with
Kurotsuchi
 and
Akatsuchi
 by his side. Kurotsuchi greets Deidara warmly while Akatsuchi wonders how Deidara is alive, while Ōnoki explains that it is
Orochimaru
's
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 technique. Meanwhile,
Manda II
, a genetically enhanced clone of the original
Manda
, swims through the water and kills the
giant squid
 guarding the
Island Turtle
.
Kabuto
 remarks that Manda II has found the island and flies off, controlling Deidara, who protests as he is not in control over his own body.

Manda II bites one of the turtle's flippers as Deidara detonates a
clay jellyfish
 underneath the turtle, flipping it over. As the turtle flips,
Yamato
 uses his
Wood Release: Nativity of a Sea of Trees
 technique to create a forest to save them.
Naruto
 decides to check out the situation on the surface, but is dissuaded by Yamato and
Aoba
, who stress the importance of his
S-rank
 mission and how he must prioritise that. Yamato, Aoba, and
Motoi
 head to the surface where they encounter Kabuto. Deidara is tasked with fighting off Ōnoki and Akatsuchi, while Kurotsuchi engages in combat against Kabuto. She uses her
Lava Release: Quicklime Congealing Technique
 in conjugation with
Water Release: Water Trumpet
 to create a quick-drying cement to hold him in place. Yamato uses
Wood Release: Wood Spikes Ring
 to hold Kabuto in place as Aoba heads off to
extract
 intelligence from him, but Kabuto discards his body using the
Orochimaru-Style Body Replacement Technique
 and emerges out of his mouth as a serpentine snake, causing Aoba to fall into the cement while he swallows Yamato whole.

Deidara and Ōnoki duel over the air, with the former attempting to kill the
Tsuchikage
 using his
C4
 while the latter prepares to counter it with his
Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique
. However, Deidara is swiftly recalled by Kabuto, who slithers into Manda II's nostril and dispels them back to the
Mountains' Graveyard
. Ōnoki frees Aoba, pondering whether Yamato was the intended target all along and warns them that Yamato can easily be interrogated due to
Madara Uchiha
's visual prowess. Back at the hideout,  Kabuto delivers Yamato to
Tobi
 and
Zetsu
. Tobi is irritated as Kabuto did not retrieve the
Eight
 and
Nine-Tails
 like he was assigned, but Kabuto justifies his decisions by claiming that Yamato is Naruto's guardian and thus would hold valuable information, while also adding that using Yamato's
Wood Release
, he could improve both
Zetsu
 and the
White Zetsu Army
. Tobi tells him to speed the process, revealing the
Rinnegan
 eye he had transplanted from
Nagato
's corpse and telling Kabuto that the eye is craving for war.
