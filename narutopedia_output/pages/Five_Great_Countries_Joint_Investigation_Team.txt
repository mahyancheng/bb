The
Five Great Countries' Joint Investigation Team
 (
五大国による合同捜査チーム
,
Godaikoku ni yoru Gōdō Sōsa Chīmu
) is a team consisting of shinobi of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 to investigate major threats.

When several people went missing by
Ōga
, the Joint Investigation Team had several elite jōnin sent in attempts to infiltrate and investigate the disappearances, but none of them returned. One of Kiseru's friends managed to send back a single piece of information, a warning not to trust anything. The rest of the team was unsure how to make sense of it.

During the investigation, the team engaged in battle with
Mitsuki
, trapping him. After his rescue by
Sarada
 and
Kawaki
, they led
Team 7
 to an ambush. When Sarada recognised some of the members as
Konoha

Anbu
, one of their leaders revealed they had permission to share intel with them.
