 anime.

Synopsis

Despite
Naruto
's timely appearance,
Sasuke
 decides to relinquish their scroll to
Shiore
 to ensure their
team
's survival. However, Naruto stops Sasuke and punches him in the face. Refusing to accept Sasuke's mindset, Naruto takes the scroll from him. Naruto begins fighting Shiore and his
snakes
, although he is easily beaten and injured. As he is about to be devoured by the snake, Naruto taps into the
Nine-Tails
'
chakra
 and hits the snake down with one punch. Shiore manages to use the snake to toss Naruto into a tree, and then uses the snake to attack Sasuke, only for Naruto to rush in and save him, asking him if he was okay and calling him a baby, echoing the same words Sasuke
told him
 after their battle against the
Demon Brothers
.

The ninja, recognising Naruto as the Nine-Tails'
container
, uses a
seal
 to block Naruto's access to the fox's chakra, rendering him unconscious. He throws him to the the ground but
Sakura
 saves him. She then yells at a still Sasuke about how he shouldn't be a coward. Her words remind Sasuke of
his brother
 and it rejuvenates Sasuke with determination as he prepares to battle the
Kusa

shinobi
. Meanwhile,
Anko
 finds the real Shiore and his
team
, dead and
faceless
, and recognises it to be the work of
someone she knows
.
