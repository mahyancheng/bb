Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As the opposing sides converse, the
Fourth Kazekage
 is shocked to learn that
Gaara
 was no longer the host of the
One-Tail
, and even more so that he had friends and had become the
Kazekage
. Intent on testing his son's mettle, the two begin battling while
Ōnoki
 signalled the troops to move in before confronting
Mū
. As the battle waged on, the Fourth Kazekage is shocked to find himself trapped in Gaara's attack alongside the
Second Mizukage
 and the
Third Raikage
. Seeing the sand
manifest
 in the form of his
late wife
 after protecting Gaara from one of his
attacks
, the former Kazekage realises that Karura had been protecting Gaara his whole life.

Remorsefully, the Fourth tells his son the truth of his mother's love for him and apologised that all he had done for Gaara was rob him of happiness, now realising that he had actually been unable to judge the true value of things in the end. Shocked to hear the truth of his mother's love for him and that
Yashamaru
 had been forced to lie to Gaara, the young Kazekage breaks down crying before telling his father that while his mother was truly amazing, it was his father who had finally given him medicine to heal his wounded heart. With Gaara forgiving him for his past mistakes, the Fourth smiles on as he is sealed away by his son, entrusting the village and the future to his son.

Pain

Rinnegan
 eyes were depicted as in the manga, without the darker purple inner circle.
