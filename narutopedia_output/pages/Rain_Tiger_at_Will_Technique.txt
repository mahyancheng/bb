The
Rain Tiger at Will Technique
 is a contact-type
perception ninjutsu
, allowing one to freely manipulate rain infused with the user's own
chakra
.

Overview

The rain falls from rain clouds, formed with Pain's own chakra. During this technique, the falling raindrops are closely linked to Pain's senses. When the rain is obstructed by a chakra belonging to someone not of the village, the existence of the intruder can be detected. The detection of the rain, however, is not specific as Pain can only know if someone has entered the vicinity of the rain but not where specifically they are. Upon knowing an intruder has entered the rain's vicinity, he needs
someone who specialises in covering large areas
 to find the intruder's specific location. The rain will keep on falling until Pain uses the seal to cancel it. When Pain is away from
Amegakure
, he always uses this technique to keep a close eye on the village. He also made it rain every Sunday.

Assuming that no one in the village knows about the sensory nature of this technique apart from Nagato and Konan, outsiders will think the rain is a natural occurrence and will not be aware they will be detected once the raindrops fall upon them.

Trivia

The
tiger
 is well-known for its ferocity and watchfulness. It keeps a very close guard on its cubs, watches vigilantly for an opportunity to catch its prey, and walks great distances to patrol its territory; all a reference to how Pain uses this technique to vigilantly watch over the village.
