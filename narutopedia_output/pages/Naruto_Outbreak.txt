"
Naruto: Outbreak
" (
ナルト・アウトブレイク
,
Naruto Autobureiku
) is episode 183 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Sakura
,
Shizune
, and
Tonton
 are all sitting in a tent camped by
Tsunade
, who has remained in a comatose state since
Pain's assault
 on Konoha.
Chōji
 and
Naruto
 arrive with lunch for them. As Naruto leaves to aid in the rebuilding of
Ramen Ichiraku
, Chōji and Shizune comment on his energetic personality and Chōji's quote leads Sakura to a flashback. She recalls the day when Naruto returned from a mission in an unknown village and appeared to be sick. Naruto sneezed on Sakura, who was about to depart on a mission. Later, after overeating at Ramen Ichiraku, Naruto was resting in his apartment when a group of
Konoha

medical-nin
 attempted to capture him. Throughout the episode Naruto eluded the medical team and other characters who had been ordered by Tsunade to capture him.

After interrogating a medical-nin, Naruto learns that his capture was under Tsunade's orders as she believes that he is the carrier of a rare and dangerous
chakra virus
 that affects a person's ability to mould
chakra
. Since the village was still recovering from the
Konoha Crush
, Tsunade did not want anything to cripple the village. After Naruto was eventually captured and sent to
Konoha Hospital
 it was discovered that he was never infected. Naruto, infuriated at Tsunade's actions, demanded an apology. Tsunade merely said that it was an emergency drill and thanked Naruto for co-operating. Naruto remained angry at her and exploded in a fury of rage as Sakura ends the flashback. She then notes that Chōji's quote, "Fools never catch a cold", may be true in Naruto's case, but that he certainly knows how to stir things up.

Trivia

The crowd of villagers evacuated within the Hokage monument includes several non-Konoha characters, including
Team Oboro
, as well as deceased characters, such as
Hayate Gekkō
,
Zabuza Momochi
,
Haku
,
Shigure
 and
Baiu
.

Due to the fact that
Sasuke
 is hospitalised in this episode but has not yet fought
Naruto
, the events of this episode take place between episodes
106
 and
107
 of the original
Naruto
 anime.
