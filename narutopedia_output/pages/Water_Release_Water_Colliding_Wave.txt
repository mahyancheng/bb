The user creates a massive vortex of water that protects the user from attacks. It explodes from the top of it in the form of a wave that travels at high velocity, covering the entire battlefield. The impact of the technique is similar to a huge tsunami.
 By using hand gestures, the user can manipulate the water to move in any direction. Having changed the battlefield in this way enables the user to follow up with additional Water Release techniques. The user can also evaporate the water at will.
