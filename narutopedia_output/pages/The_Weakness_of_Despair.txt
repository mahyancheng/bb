Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Having arrived at
Kabuto
's hideout,
Sasuke
 identifies Kabuto. Kabuto attempts to manipulate him into attacking
Itachi
, but Sasuke explains his goal was to talk with his brother and that Kabuto, who has now taken
Orochimaru
's mantle, is his enemy. Meanwhile
Tsunade
 reveals her new technique's power, which allows instant regeneration without the usage of hand seals, and throws the sword that impales her back at
Madara
. While he absorbs it into his
Susanoo
,
Ōnoki
 tries to blast Madara with
Dust Release
 from behind, but Madara simply absorbs it, claiming he could have done it earlier but instead took it as a chance to demoralise them with
Hashirama
's visage. Tsunade questions his confidence, stating the
Kage
 forced him into using a
wood clone
. Instead of rebuffing her, Madara admits five versus one is a good match-up number and creates
twenty-five wood clones
, five for each Kage. Sasuke attempts to kill Kabuto, but Itachi stops him, explaining the need to discover the counter to the
Impure World Reincarnation
 beforehand. Sasuke agrees to cooperate on the terms that Itachi will answer his questions once they're done, and Itachi accepts, as both brothers and Kabuto ready themselves for battle.
