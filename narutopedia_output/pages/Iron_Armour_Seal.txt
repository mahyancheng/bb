Iron Armour Seal
 is the fūinjutsu used by
Kumogakure
 to seal
Gyūki
 into its respective hosts.

Usage

The seal itself takes the form of the kanji for "iron" (
鉄
,
tetsu
) and is usually printed somewhere on the jinchūriki's body:
Killer B
's right shoulder, and
Blue B
's chest.
 Not much else is known about the seal, besides the fact that it was stated by B to be of lower quality and weaker than the
Four Symbols Seal
, which was used to seal
Kurama
 inside of
Naruto Uzumaki
.

Trivia

In the manga, the seal is depicted as being black. In the anime however, the seal is blue.

In the anime, the
Five Elements Unseal
 appears to be strong enough to break the Iron Armour Seal.
