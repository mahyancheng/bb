A variety of cards.



The
Extreme: Shinobi Picture Scrolls
 (
激・忍絵巻
,
Geki: Shinobi Emaki
) is a collectable card game depicting several historical
shinobi
. They are manufactured by the
Kaminarimon Company
. Each pack contains ten random cards and costs 30
ryō
. Each card has a rarity level, some sort of stats, a picture along with a description and a village affiliation. Sometimes, the shinobi also has a special title, such as "Seventh Hokage". The cards are very popular amongst civilian and shinobi children alike, so much that some stores limit each customer to three purchases.

During his trip to
Konohagakure
,
Tentō Madoka
 insisted on purchasing an entire store when told that he was limited to only three purchases.
Boruto Uzumaki
 is shown to collect and add them to an album for safe keeping. Tentō also keeps his cards in an album and has bought so many that he has duplicates.

Trivia

In
Boruto

chapter 12
, there are two blurred cards that resemble
Kurenai Yūhi
 and
Neji Hyūga
.

In
Naruto Shinden: Parent and Child Day
,
Hiashi Hyūga
 disapproves of his card's low rarity, believing it inaccurately reflects his long and accomplished ninja career.
Hinata
 tries to reassure him that rarity is determined by the cards' manufacturer and is not truly representative of anything.
Hanabi
 suggests that, if Hiashi performed a mission of Hokage or Sannin-calibre, that would raise the rarity of his card.

Shojoji
 believes it was insulting that a card of him was not made, as he believes himself to be in the same calibre as Orochimaru, who had a card of SSR rarity made.

The cards look extremely similar to the ones from the old
Naruto Collectible Card Game
, especially those from the Japanese release.
