This article is about the toad Gama. For Naruto's wallet Gama-chan, see
Gama-chan
.

Gama
 (
蝦蟇
) is the first
toad
 named in the series, debuting alongside
Jiraiya
. This toad seems to be the keeper of the Toad
Summoning contract
 scroll.

Personality

Gama has not yet been seen talking, only croaking once or twice and mainly in the anime, so his personality is mostly unknown. However, he seems to be deeply loyal to Jiraiya, following him around and immediately obeying his orders; he was also the only summon shown to strike the same pose as Jiraiya.

Appearance






Gama clad in armour.



Gama is a very large toad, enough for Jiraiya to ride on his back. His orange skin is covered in blue markings, he has bandages wrapped around his body and left foreleg, and wears a necklace with seven large beads on it, with the kanji for "loyalty" (
忠
,
chū
) on the central, largest one. It is also shown that he has three swirl-like marking in the middle of his left palm which are similar to the one's sometimes portrayed in Jiraiya's. In battle, he is almost always seen wearing samurai armour, composed of a plate cuirass and arm-guards paired with traditional samurai pauldrons.

Abilities






Gama using the Whip of Love to easily defeat Ebisu.



Gama seems to be skilled in
taijutsu
, which benefits from his large size and toad traits, as seen when
smashing around
 a skilled ninja such as
Ebisu
 with his long, extendable tongue. He also appears to possess considerable strength, being capable of blocking an attack from
Kisame Hoshigaki
, known for having immense strength, with his armour, which prevented him from
having his chakra absorbed
 by Kisame's
Samehada
.
