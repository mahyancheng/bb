"
The Day Naruto Was Born
" (
ナルトが生まれた日
,
Naruto ga Umareta Hi
) is episode 380 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Yin-Kurama asks
Minato
 whether he intends to let
Naruto
 clean up after him, noting that him becoming a
jinchūriki
 wasn't so bad.
Tobirama
 thinks Naruto resembles
Hashirama
 in his ability to work with the
Flying Thunder God Technique
 and use of
Senjutsu
.
Obito
 makes notice of his new vulnerability and creates a giant flowering tree. Each of the four flowers begins charging a
Tailed Beast Ball
. The Allied
Shinobi
 wonder how they can escape those, and Minato and Tobirama are each able to teleport only one of them away. Hashirama wants to help them, but is impeded by
Madara
, who reminds him that their reincarnated bodies will regenerate.
 Obito sends out
chakra
 receivers and erects a barrier trapping the Alliance with the tree. Naruto fist-bumps with Minato for a new strategy, connecting both halves of
Kurama
. Obito wraps himself in a protective cloak, still berating Minato, reminding him that it's his and
Kushina
's death anniversary the next day. Naruto instead remembers it's his birthday. Minato marvels at his grown-up son. Minato and Naruto meld their halves of Kurama's chakra, and the cloak on the Alliance shinobi reappears. Jūgo arrives at their location and tells
Sasuke
 they need to escape via reverse summon. Naruto shares his chakra with them as well. Obito fires the Tailed Beast Balls. The Alliance appears unharmed, having been teleported out of the barrier by Minato, by proxy of Naruto's chakra. Tobirama notes the similarity with the
Shadow Clone Technique
 regarding to chakra distribution, impressing Naruto with the knowledge of the technique, revealing himself as its creator. Minato wishes to talk to Naruto, but Naruto says it's not necessary, having already met his mother's chakra.

Trivia

There is an animation error in which Sasuke's
Mangekyō Sharingan
 displays Madara's pattern instead of his own.
