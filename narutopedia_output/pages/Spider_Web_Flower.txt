Kidōmaru
 spits several small nets from his mouth at a target or targets; the nets' small size means they can be produced rapidly, increasing his chances of striking his target. The nets are made sticky with
chakra
, causing them to cling to targets on contact and adhere them to whatever other object or surface the nets touch. The more nets a target is struck with, the stronger the binding.
 As with all of Kidōmaru's webbing, targets can free themselves by injecting their own chakra into the nets, such as with the
Gentle Fist
.
