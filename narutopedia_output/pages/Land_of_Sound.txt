The Land of Sound.



The
Land of Sound
 (
音の国
,
Oto no Kuni
) is a neighbouring country of the
Land of Fire
. It is a relatively new country in the political scene, though it has existed for some time under the name of the
Land of Rice Fields
 (
田の国
,
Ta no Kuni
,
English TV:
 Land of Rice Paddies). According to the anime,
Orochimaru
 conquered the country and convinced
its daimyō
 to let him establish his own ninja village.

In the anime, this country was said to be home to many shinobi
clans
, who had been used in a hopeless war, with the clans suffering heavily. Many of the survivors joined Orochimaru, lured by his power and promise to help them revive their clans.

Otogakure
 (
音隠れの里
,
Otogakure no Sato
,
English TV:
 Village Hidden in the Sound,
literally meaning:
 Village Hidden by Sound) is the personal hidden village of
Orochimaru
, which was founded after he left the
Akatsuki
 for the express purpose of collecting ninja for his experiments and his quest to learn all techniques. In later years, following Orochimaru's new appreciation for natural development of people and making a truce with
Konohagakure
, Otogakure was reestablished as a legitimate shinobi village.
