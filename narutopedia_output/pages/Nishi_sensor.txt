Nishi
 (
ニシ
,
Nishi
) is a shinobi of
Konohagakure
.

Personality

Nishi is a committed shinobi who highly respects the Hokage, and will carry out missions without complaint. While deeply committed, his focus on the task at hand makes him susceptible to simple, but unorthodox deception. He is confident in his sensing abilities.

Appearance

Nishi is a man of average height with a round face in the manga, but chiselled cheekbones in the anime. He has grey eyes, a small beard with a moustache on his face, and combed ashy hair. Nishi dresses in the standard Konohagakure shinobi outfit - blue pants and a turtleneck, a green vest and a pair of sandals.

Abilities

Nishi is a capable
sensor
 who has been entrusted with the mission of guarding and monitoring Boruto and Kawaki. He is able, if necessary, to expand the target search field.

Kawaki Arc

Kawaki Arc

After the
Seventh

Hokage
 mysteriously disappeared when an
unfamiliar chakra
 had been detected,
Shikamaru Nara
 deployed Nishi and a team to
contain
 and investigate the Hokage's home when
Kawaki
 was the only one that was closest to him at the time. While looking around, Nishi found a vase, which Kawaki had pieced back together after an earlier altercation.
Boruto Uzumaki
 took the vase from him, trying to disapprove Shikamaru's suspicions of Kawaki.

Later, after
Team 7
 and Kawaki had escaped through a
rift
, Shikamaru asked Nishi if
Sasuke Uchiha
 had any contact with the village.

After Isshiki's defeat, Nishi was assigned to keep watch over Kawaki's movements within the village. During the evening, unbeknownst to Nishi, he got his attention on a
shadow clone
 while the real Kawaki
suppressed
 his chakra signature and escaped from the village. Boruto's insistence on the issue exposed Kawaki's ruse, and Naruto ordered Nishi to widen his sensing radius and notify Shikamaru of the development. As the search for Kawaki proved fruitless, Naruto asked Nishi to locate Boruto, realising he went after Kawaki.

Boruto's Return Arc

Main article:
Boruto's Return Arc

Three years later, Nishi was part of a three-man squad led by
Konohamaru Sarutobi
 to locate
two

tresspassers
 who entered the village. Jura gave chase to his target
Himawari Uzumaki
, while Hidari blocked their path. Hidari turned his attention to Nishi after he fended off his team, before turning his attention back to Sarada, who arrived to the team's aid earlier. Nishi continued to watch their fight as Boruto
teleported
 to their location to save her.

After saving Sarada from Hidari, Boruto asked Nishi for help to focus on the Claw Marks, but Nishi refused to help a "traitor". When Boruto discussed Hidari's connection to
Sasuke Uchiha
 with the other Konoha-nin, Nishi then sensed chakra moving within the Claw Marks and quickly warned them. Boruto asked Nishi its wherabouts, but he could not tell stating that the chakra was moving everywhere. A group of Claw Grimes emerged from the Claw Marks and surrounded them. Nishi and
Sumire
 looked after Himawari as Konohamaru helped Boruto and Sarada fight Hidari.

As Hidari was defeated, Boruto was shot down by Jura, using the opportunity to retrieve Hidari's Thorn Soul Bulb. After Jura retreated, Nishi was relieved to see Himawari okay when she came to. The Konoha-nin then proceeded to detain Boruto for questioning.

Trivia

In the manga, Nishi was only named after his character debuted in the anime, where he was given a different name in episode credits.
