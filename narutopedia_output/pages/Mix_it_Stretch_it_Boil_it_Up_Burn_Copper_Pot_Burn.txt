Synopsis

Eager to have some
Ichiraku Ramen
,
Naruto
 and
Chōji
 quickly go to the bar only to discover that it is closed early. They find out that
Teuchi
 is trying to prepare a new kind of ramen because his daughter
Ayame
 was taken hostage by the rarely heard of
cooking-nin
, who are led by
Hakkaku
. Naruto, Chōji, and
Sakura
 offer to help. Teuchi tries to teach them how to cook, and the three take advantage of
their

ninja

techniques
 to make the perfect bowl of ramen. When they rescue Ayame, they are shocked to notice she has grown fat due to being unable to resist the cooking-nin's food. To bring her back to her regular self, she eats her father's diet ramen that appears to be designed to make the customers lose weight from eating it. However, Teuchi also had eaten the diet ramen and ended up losing too much weight.
