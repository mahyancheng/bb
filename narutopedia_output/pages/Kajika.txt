 and
Otogakure
.

Personality

Kajika demonstrated unwavering loyalty to "Lord" Orochimaru, expressing a desire to be of service to someone he deeply respected. He affectionately referred to Orochimaru as "the Wonderful One". Additionally, Kajika exhibited a cruel disposition, seemingly deriving pleasure from combat, as evidenced by his actions, such as licking his lips during the fight with
Sasuke

Kajika proved to be a formidable opponent, showcasing not only physical strength but also keen deductive skills. He quickly discerned
Naruto
 and Sasuke's deception when they attempted to pose as his comrades.

Physical Prowess

Kajika possessed exceptional strength and speed, surpassing even the capabilities of Sasuke's Sharingan. His strikes were powerful enough to create large craters in the earth, and a single blow could propel opponents great distances through rock. Remarkably, Kajika demonstrated remarkable swimming ability, adeptly evading incoming attacks. Even when his vision was obscured by smoke bombs, he relied on instinct to skilfully dodge sneak attacks and kunai aimed at him.

Nature Transformation

Kajika demonstrated exceptional proficiency in

 techniques allowed him to easily fend off Sasuke while engaging Naruto in combat. Kajika showcased the ability to dissolve one of his clones, utilising the remaining water to transform into numerous large ice darts or water tendrils.
