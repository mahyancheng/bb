Kakashi
 submerges into the earth or water, comes up and punches the jaw of his opponent, jumps back away from the opponent to form a
Lightning Cutter
 in-between his two hands. He splits it in two and charges his opponent, leaving two streams of light, and then strikes them with one Lightning Cutter, sending them into the air. He then repeatedly hits them with that one Lightning Cutter in a zig-zag formation into the air, back and forth, before coming above his opponent and finally slamming his second Lightning Cutter into his opponent, driving them into the ground.
