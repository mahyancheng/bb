The
Janin
 (
邪忍
,
literally meaning:
 Evil Ninja) were a trio of brothers with special
ninjutsu
.

History

The Janin took over the
Land of Vegetables
 with the aid of disloyal and greedy courtiers. After their rise to power, they betrayed their allies and mercilessly killed them all. The three brothers were distrusting of each other. Renga states that he would have killed Jiga and Ruiga if the shinobi from
Konohagakure
 hadn't already done so. Ruiga was killed by Jiga, who in turn died due to his weakness being exploited by
Hinata Hyūga
. Renga was left at the mercy of his enemies, but
Haruna
 seemed to be unable to go through with killing him in revenge, leaving the latter's fate unknown.
