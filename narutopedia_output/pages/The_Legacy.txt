"
The Legacy!
" (
継がれゆくもの
,
Tsugareyukumono
) is episode 31 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Chiyo
 begins using her
reincarnation ninjutsu
 on
Gaara
, to make amends for her past.
Naruto
 attempts to interfere, but is stopped by
Sakura
, who tells him that she is bringing him back from the dead.
Neji
 believes that such a convenient jutsu must come at a personal cost, a thought shared by
Kakashi
. Chiyo is unable to successfully resurrect Gaara, due to her low chakra levels. Naruto, however, offers his own chakra. Chiyo recalls Kakashi's remarks on Naruto; a
jinchūriki
 like Gaara, he is the only one who understands Gaara's pain and suffering, hence his intense desire to save Gaara. Using Naruto's chakra to supplement her technique, she tells him that his power to make friends with anyone will result in him being a
Hokage
 the world has yet to see the likes of; she also tells Sakura that one day she will surpass
Tsunade
. Chiyo hopes for a brighter future for both
Sunagakure
 and
Konohagakure
, a future where both Naruto and Gaara will make sure that the world is not like how it was in Chiyo's time. She remarks that everything she has done for Suna her whole life has been wrong, and that resurrecting Gaara is the only thing she has done right.

Gaara's spirit returns to his body, as he sees himself as a younger child crying all alone. However, he is surprised when he sees and feels a young Naruto holding his shoulder and smiling at him. As he opens his eyes, he is shocked to find himself in the real world with Naruto holding his shoulder and smiling at him, the latter glad to see Gaara once more. Gaara notices that nearly every member of Suna's military are also there, all of them cheering and crying out of happiness.
Kankurō
 thanks Naruto for saving Gaara, but Naruto tells him to thank Chiyo, who he believes simply passed out from resurrecting Gaara. Kankurō, however, explains to him and everyone else that Chiyo is dead, having given up her life in exchange for Gaara's.
Temari
 tells Naruto that he really does have the power to change people, adding that Chiyo would have never given up her life to revive a
Kazekage
 or a jinchūriki until she met Naruto; Kakashi adds that she died passing on the future to Naruto and Gaara. Sakura cries, and Chiyo's brother
Ebizō
 notes how peaceful she looks and how he half-expects her to start laughing (as a callback to when she used to fake her death near him as a joke). Naruto remarks that she died in a selfless matter similar to the
Third Hokage
, and Gaara, managing to stand up on his feet, calls for a prayer to commemorate Chiyo's actions and bid her farewell.
