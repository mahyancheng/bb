This article is about the movie character Setsuna. For Setsuna from the Uchiha clan, see
Setsuna Uchiha
.

Setsuna
 (
セツナ
) was a
shinobi
 who hailed from the
Land of Demons
 and appeared in
Naruto Shippūden the Movie
. He led the
Gang of Four
 under
Yomi
.

Personality

Setsuna apparently held the same goals as Yomi
 and was noted to be a clever man.
As with his teammates, Setsuna had a tendency of using overly powerful techniques for even the moderate situations, due to the thrill of receiving
extra chakra
, showing off whenever possible.

Appearance

Setsuna had fair skin, long blue hair and light-coloured eyes. He wore a white attire with a hexagram symbol similar to the rest of the Gang of Four, a belt with pouch, black gloves, and martial artist shoes. When transformed his hair poofed up into three triangular shaped puffs of hair. He also gained two red square-shaped markings coming from the top of his forehead and one of them going over his eyes.

Abilities






Setsuna's partial transformation



Setsuna specialised in mid-to-long-range combat. He would regularly rely on techniques or projectile weapons to keep his opponents a fair distance away. He also demonstrated impressive aim even when targeting a moving opponent. He showed some efficient skill in puppetry, controlling one in the likeness of
Kusuna
 in order to deceive his opponents while fighting Neji at the same time. He was also seen wielding a pair of double bladed
sickles
 while battling, easily slaughtering many of
Shion
's guards.

Nature Transformation

While under the influence of Yomi's
dark chakra
, he used powerful wind-type techniques, usually consisting of strong gusts and tornadoes, sometimes combined with his comrades' fire-based techniques to create massive firestorms. The pinnacle of his wind-type prowess was to combine with
Shizuku
's water techniques to turn into a
thunderstorm
 that could disperse bolts of lightning in order to demolish areas. Unfortunately, doing so quickly drained both his dark chakra and regular chakra reserves.

Plot Overview

Setsuna was a member of Yomi's team, who were on a quest to release the demon Mōryō. During the beginning of the movie, he played a big part in killing the guards of Mōryō's prison. Later, he, along with the rest of his team, were sent to kill Shion, a priestess who was the only person alive who could stop
Mōryō
. However, the attempt on Shion's life failed thanks to interference from
Naruto
. He joined his team in a group combo attack that nearly killed Naruto. Upon fighting Naruto and the rest of his team, he ended up using all of his extra chakra given to him by Yomi, forcing him to retreat with the rest of his team. Later, during the second battle, Setsuna went up against Neji, holding his opponent at bay with his
Wind Release: Rotating Shuriken
. Eventually,
Neji
 realised that this was a diversion to keep him away from
Shion
.

Later, during another attempt to kill Shion, Setsuna and Shizuku began to demolish the entire forest by turning into a thunderstorm and dispersing lightning. Unfortunately, this reckless manoeuvre used up all of his extra chakra. Then, almost immediately after
Kusuna
 was killed and Shizuku was spotted by
Sakura
,
Rock Lee
 took advantage of this opportunity thanks to Neji's plan, and finished him off with a powerful
taijutsu
 attack. Setsuna was then killed by a falling tree.

Trivia
