Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 5
 (
ナルト- 疾風伝 ナルティメットアクセル2
,
Naruto Shippūden: Narutimetto Akuseru 2
) is the fifth instalment in the
Ultimate Ninja
 series.

Gameplay

One of the new gameplay additions is the introduction of assist characters. Assist characters are chosen during character selection, and can be called in during a match to deal extra damage. Certain combinations of characters create unique jutsu in a match; these combinations reflect the associations of those characters in the anime and manga. Many of the characters' techniques from the previous game were updated. There are many updated ultimate techniques, including the aforementioned assist-specific ones. Summons have been removed from the game. The assist characters cannot be turned off. The game also includes an RPG mode where players can roam sections of the village and interact with the surroundings of the story and villagers.

Plot Overview

The plot is separated into eight acts. There is also an extra act. They are directly related to
Kazekage Rescue Mission
 and the
Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission
.

Trivia

In the Master Mode, in one of the playable missions, if in a certain conversation with
Jiraiya
 and
Tsunade
 the player answers yes to Jiraiya's question, it will be meet
Kasumi
 again from
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 2: Phantom Fortress
.

If the player has a saved file of
Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja 4
, he will receive letters from
Aoi
 instead of an orphaned girl from a previous mission.

Due to time constraints, dubbing issues, and declining support of the PS2, the game never released in the US, and the EU version is subtitled, lacking any dubbed tracks.

This game is the only one in the
Ultimate Ninja
 series to not have any removed material from the Japanese version:
Ultimate Ninja
 had Naruto's transformation and Sasuke's transformation removed, and re-added as different characters;
Ultimate Ninja 2
 had
Dotō Kazahana
 removed from the character list, since
Ninja Clash In The Land of Snow
 was not released in the US yet;
Ultimate Ninja 3'
s character's picture were more well-drawn, and the game also came with an
OVA
 giving hints of the Ultimate Contest's crystals locations; and
Ultimate Ninja 4
 had a separate Plus version with remastered soundtrack.
