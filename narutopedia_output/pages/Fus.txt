Fusō
 (
扶桑
) was a nurse and a citizen of
Amegakure
, where she lived in a small village with her
son
 and
husband
.

Background






Fusō being slain during the Second Shinobi World War.



During the
Second Shinobi World War
, Fusō and her husband
Ise
 were providing humanitarian aid. One night during the war, Fusō and her family were hiding in their battle-damaged house when
Konoha
 ninja broke in looking for food. Fusō and her family tried to sneak away but when they were detected she and Ise brought the attention to themselves to give Nagato a chance to escape. The Konoha ninja, assuming the couple were enemy ninja, attacked and quickly killed both of them.

Witnessing this, Nagato unknowingly awakened his
Rinnegan
, and he subsequently killed the two Konoha-nin. Nagato buried his parents before leaving to search for food. The death of his parents is the first great tragedy of his life, and in his eyes evidence that the peace Konoha preaches comes at the cost of others' lives.

Personality

As a nurse, working alongside her husband to give aid to others in times of war, Fusō was a very compassionate woman. She loved her son very much, willing to sacrifice her own life to allow Nagato to escape.

Appearance

Fusō had long smooth red hair, a trait from the Uzumaki clan, and dark-coloured eyes. She wore simple light-brown robes tied with a dark sash and brown sandals.

Trivia

"Fusō" is an
old Chinese term to describe Japan
 as the land east of China where a "holy tree" supposedly grows and where the sun rises. Like Ise, Fusō also shares her name with a
Japanese battleship
.

Based on
Obito
's words, at least one of Nagato's parents is descended from the
Uzumaki clan
.
 A common trait of the clan is red hair. While it is unknown if either of Nagato's parents has red hair in the manga, in the anime, Fusō's hair was red.
