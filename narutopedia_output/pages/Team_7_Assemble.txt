" (
第七班、集結!!
,
Dainanahan, Shūketsu!!
) is episode 373 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

As the newly reformed
Team 7
 mobilises to battle,
Hashirama
 warns the Alliance due to another round of
Tailed Beast Ball
 attacks from the
Ten-Tails
. The ball launches to the barrier but is unsuccessful. Hashirama creates five clones of himself. Four of them will open the barrier to create access and allow the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 to make attacks on the Ten-Tails. The other wood clone confronts Madara, but he demands the real Hashirama, because using a clone is not "fun".
 As the Alliance goes inside the barrier, the Ten-Tails creates an
army of monsters
 to defend itself from attack.
Sakura
 recalls her previous missions, remembering being left out due to the immense competition of
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 and pursues them to become capable like they are. Her training with
Tsunade
 made her stronger and she learned one of Tsunade's techniques,
Strength of a Hundred Seal
. Back at the battle with the Ten-Tails' monster guards,  other shinobi of the
Konoha 11
 resolve themselves to become stronger as well but Ten-Tails constantly creates bigger and more powerful monsters as noted by Hashirama.
Sai
, who is also determined to become capable and stronger, decides to attack Ten-Tails' head but is unsuccessful and is saved by Naruto. Sai discloses his worries and Team 7 summons
their

corresponding

beasts
 to accompany them on the battlefield.
