Summary

The
Doki
 produce spiritual effigies that can pursue
Shikamaru
 beyond their physical range and through physical matter, all in accordance with the music played by
Tayuya
. Shikamaru falls back and formulates a plan. He starts focusing his attacks on Tayuya, the Doki's controller. Tayuya surrounds herself with the Doki to act as shields against the attacks and retaliate towards the attacks' source. Shikamaru then reveals himself, so Tayuya groups the Doki together and has them attack. Having figured out what every finger arrangement on Tayuya's
Demonic Flute
 causes the Doki to do, Shikamaru knows what to expect, allowing him to capture the Doki with his shadow.
