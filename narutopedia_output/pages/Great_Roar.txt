A
tailed beast
 uses its massive chakra reserve to turn a roar into a powerful force of pressure and destruction. When Naruto was in
control
 of Kurama's power, he too could produce these shockwaves by roaring.

Initially
, these shockwaves could deflect projectiles, fracture infrastructure and destroy some ninjutsu,
 but their raw force in Version 2 is such that they can rebound even
Pain
's
Shinra Tensei
 back upon himself.

When used by Kurama itself, it's powerful enough to completely disperse powerful attacks like the
Sage Art: Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan
, and even knock back fully transformed tailed beasts.

When used by the
Ten-Tails
 with a single shockwave, it can destroy mountains while tearing up the landscape for miles in its initial form,
 as well as use it to initiate its
Tenpenchii
 in its mature form after it recovers from its emaciated state.

Trivia

While it was unnamed in the manga and anime, it was named in
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
.

There have been times while using Kurama's chakra where Naruto has produced shockwaves or even explosions through punches or waves of his arms.
 However, since these instances have never been indicated to involve firing chakra, it's unclear if they were produced with this technique or through sheer speed.
