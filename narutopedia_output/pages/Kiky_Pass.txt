The Battle of Kikyō Pass with its supposedly only survivor: Kabuto Yakushi.



Kikyō Pass
 (
桔梗峠
,
Kikyō Tōge
,
literally meaning:
 Chinese Bellflower Mountain Pass) is a pass located near the border of
Konohagakure
 where
a battle
 between Konohagakure and unknown forces at the end of the
Third Shinobi World War
 was held.

Orochimaru
 later fabricated a background story for
Kabuto
 stating that as an infant, he was found by one of the
captains
 of the
Medic Corps
.
