The user expels
fire
 from their mouths while simultaneously creating a whirlwind using
Kamui
. The swirling winds give momentum to the flames and cause them to spiral outward as they move towards the target. The vortex of fire and heat engulfs its victims, leaving them unable to breathe while their bodies burn.
 The spinning flames can alternatively be kept relatively compact - without any obvious influence of Kamui - making it a more conventional attack similar to other fire-based techniques of the
Uchiha clan
.

Trivia
