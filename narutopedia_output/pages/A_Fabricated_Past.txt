"
A Fabricated Past
" (
造られた過去
,
Tsukurareta Kako
) is episode 462 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Hagoromo
 finishes his training at
Mount Myōboku
. A messenger toad arrives and informs
Gamamaru
 that
Kaguya
 has returned, and that they've been unable to contact
Hamura
. Hagoromo evacuates the village. Before departing, Gamamaru gifts Hagoromo a tag that can be used to replenish his sage power. Hagoromo confronts Kaguya about her actions. Hamura appears and attacks Hagoromo, under Kaguya's control.
 Hagoromo fatally injures Hamura, changing his
Sharingan
 into
Rinnegan
. He then heals Hamura with the
sage tag
 Gamamaru gave him. The
God Tree
 turns into the
Ten-Tails
 to fight for Kaguya. The fight goes on for months, until Kaguya was finally sealed, but not before spawning
Black Zetsu
. The people bound by the God Tree are freed. Hagoromo splits the Ten-Tails into nine
tailed beasts
. Having been controlled by Kaguya, Hamura understands her fears, and decides to depart to the Moon to watch over her. Black Zetsu carries on explaining his role in shaping
shinobi
 history to enable Kaguya's return.

Trivia

Urashiki Ōtsutsuki
 is foreshadowed in this episode, appearing as a silhouette alongside
Momoshiki
 and
Kinshiki
. Previously cut in
Boruto: Naruto the Movie
 due to time constraints, he would later appear in the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 adaptation of the film's events.

There are multiple errors in this episode:

The Ten-Tails'
Rinne Sharingan
 is depicted with six instead of nine
tomoe
.

The Rinnegan marking with nine magatama underneath on Hagoromo and Hamura's backs is absent.

Kinshiki's horn is depicted stubbed, despite being cut only after his battle with
Sasuke Uchiha
.

During Kaguya's sealing scene, the ring on Hagoromo's shakujō briefly disappears.

During Kaguya's sealing scene, the Six Paths Yin and Yang seals don't appear on Kaguya's Rinne Sharingan.

Hagoromo and Hamura are depicted sealing Kaguya instead of the Ten-Tails.
