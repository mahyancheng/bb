This article is about a shinobi. For the first fanbook with the same name, see
Hyō no Sho
.

Hyō
 (
ヒョウ
) is a former member of
Konohagakure
's
Anbu
 faction
Root
.

Personality

Like most Root members, he was still loyal to Root's founder
Danzō Shimura
 and is apparently trustworthy enough to be given the task of delivering top-secret information for him.

Appearance

Hyō wears a white Anbu mask with a red marking near each eye hole. He has dark-coloured hair that he keeps held in a ponytail. He carries a
tantō
 and wears a beige cloak that keeps his body hidden.

Abilities

Although Hyō hasn't displayed any techniques, he is able to sneak up on Sai without being noticed until he strikes, implying that his stealth is on a high level. Like all members of Root, Hyō carries a tipless tantō, which he seems to be skilled with. He is very aware of his surroundings and knows when someone is spying on him.

Part II

Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission






Hyō surprises Sai in his home.



Hyō infiltrated
Sai
's home and pulls his tantō on him. He handed Sai a letter containing info on his real mission, reminding Sai about the will and purpose of Root. While they were talking, Hyō felt a presence hiding outside and threw a kunai only to find that it was the cat who scrambled off scared.

Trivia






Hyō during the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack.



In
episode 358
 of
Naruto: Shippūden
, Hyō replaces the Anbu who notified the
Third Hokage
 of the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
 in
episode 248
. This change contradicts his age given in the Third Databook.
