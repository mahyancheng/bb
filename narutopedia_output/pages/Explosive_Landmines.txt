After creating the
C2 Dragon
, Deidara has the clay dragon spawn numerous clay mines and has his partner bury them underground, thus allowing unsuspecting victims to walk on the mines which then explode. These landmines explode automatically when they're stepped on. As such, they're not under Deidara's control.

Trivia

The name of this technique comes from the video game
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3
.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Heroes 3
, Obito just buries them in front or around the opponent.

When Deidara and Obito used this technique, the latter used the
Earth Release: Hiding Like a Mole Technique
 to bury them,
 while a
White Zetsu Army
 clone used his
Mayfly
 technique to bury the mines.
