Zeroth Training Ground.



The
Zeroth Training Ground
 (
第零演習場
,
Daizero Enshūjō
,
English TV:
 Training Ground Zero), also known as the
No-Hunting District
 (
禁猟区
,
Kinryōku
), is a wildlife preserve for rare and unusual animals. A team led by
Kotetsu Hagane
 consisting of
Naruto Uzumaki
,
Shino Aburame
, and
Rock Lee
 were sent into this field to recapture
Condor
.

Appearance

Much like the
Forest of Death
 and other training fields, this one is surrounded by large wire mesh fences, bearing many signs forbidding entry. The interior of the training field consists of a forest containing many insectivorous plants, wide-open plains with few trees and a cliff that was used for dramatic effect.

Background

According to
Tsunade
, the Zeroth Training Ground was originally used for the
Chūnin Exams
 just like the Forty-Fourth Training Ground, but this was discontinued because when she was a child, the field was turned into a nature preserve. This made its modern ecology impossible to predict.
