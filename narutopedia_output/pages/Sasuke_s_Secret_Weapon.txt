 anime.

Synopsis

Boruto
 wakes up in the hospital. Seeing
Sarada
, he asks about his father. He hears
Himawari
 calling for
Hinata
 as
Sakura
 tends to her. Sakura explains Hinata was injured trying to keep
Momoshiki
 and
Kinshiki
 from taking
Naruto
. Sarada informs him
Mitsuki
 is in critical condition after having his chakra stolen. Boruto sees how many others got injured despite Naruto's efforts, and runs out of the hospital. Boruto notices he's still wearing his
Shinobi Gauntlet
 after tripping on a medical kit, and angrily throws it away. Upon waking up, Hinata asks about Naruto, and
Sasuke
 assures her he's fine, and to leave the rest to him.
 Boruto goes to Naruto's office, thinking about all the times he complained about Naruto. He finds and wears Naruto's old clothes. Sasuke tells Boruto he's in a similar situation Naruto used to be, scorned by others. He reveals he can still sense Naruto's chakra, and that he intends to rescue him with Boruto's help. The other
Kage
 arrive, saying they'll help, so everyone pools all of their knowledge of each of the Ōtsutsuki's abilities. The Kage question Sasuke's decision to bring Boruto along, but he assures them he has a reason. Sasuke hands Boruto his own forehead protector with Naruto's scratch on it and explains
the history behind it
. As Sasuke, Boruto, and the Kage prepare to leave, Sarada asks Sasuke to go with them. He instructs her to help
Kakashi
 and
Shikamaru
 protect the village, as she's the only other person with the
Sharingan
. Boruto tries apologising to
Shikadai
, but he says they have more pressing matters, and that he'll listen to what he has to say later. Sasuke opens a
portal
 with his
Rinnegan
. Hinata arrives, and is shocked to see Boruto in Naruto's old clothes. The sight reminds her of her husband when he was younger, and that moves Hinata to entrust Naruto's safety to her son. They then leave to rescue Naruto.
