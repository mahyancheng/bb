This is a ninjutsu from among the Nara clan's secret techniques that uses materialised shadows to attack and bind, instead of merely immobilising and controlling like the Shadow Imitation Technique. The user changes the shape of their shadow into several sharp tendril-like needles and controls each separately. They can then attack the same or several targets simultaneously and at the same time snatch away their ability to move by sewing them stuck with the shadow threads. Because it is a physical attack, it is impossible to capture someone without harming them, but on the other hand, since the speed of invocation and the time of duration are excellent, it can be used when urgent restraint is required.

This technique is usually used to go through the target and capture them, but depending on the opponent, it can also be used as an attack to bring them down. This special characteristic finds its greatest effect when used as logistical support. After this technique hits someone, it can then be directly transformed back into the Shadow Imitation Technique; conversely, after immobilising the target(s) with the latter technique, a proficient user can then also transition so into the Shadow Sewing Technique to thereby subsequently inflict harm to the captured party.

Trivia

This ninjutsu takes its name from the "
Kagenui
", a technique from ninja legends that immobilises a target by pinning their shadow with a kunai.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja 5
, Shikamaru throws several explosive tags up in the air and uses this technique to pin them on his opponent.

In
Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Will of Fire
, Shikamaru uses the special seal used in the
Multi-Size Technique
 instead of the Bird seal, as the ring and little fingers were raised in the manga,
 but the index finger is raised instead of the ring finger in the movie. The folded fingers are also interlocked in the manga, but not in the movie.
