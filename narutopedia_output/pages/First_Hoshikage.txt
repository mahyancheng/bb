He was the
First Hoshikage
 (
初代星影
,
Shodai Hoshikage
,
literally meaning:
 First or Founding Star Shadow), and founder of
Hoshigakure
.

Background

About two hundred years before the start of the series, he discovered a
"fallen star"
 (a meteor) with mystical powers. He founded a village in the
Land of Bears
, in hopes to make well-renowned
shinobi
 and gain the title of a great hidden village. He didn't know of the side effects of the star training, and people started to die from overpowering
chakra
 that imploded in their bodies.

Appearance

The First wore the traditional attire of the
Hoshikage
 that consisted of the customary hat and haori along with a purple, full-length kimono that was tied using a white sash. Though his face was initially unseen, the First seemed to be a middle-aged man and also had a grey moustache.

Abilities

Due to his high rank, the First Hoshikage was presumably a very powerful shinobi. He discovered the usage of the star that Hoshigakure became famous for it and how to harness the unique benefits of its chakra. However, it is unknown if he was one of the extremely rare cares of people who did not suffer any negative side-effects from the star training, or if he actually even learned to use the
Mysterious Peacock Method
.
