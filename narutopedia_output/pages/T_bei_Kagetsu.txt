Personality

Tōbei is a very happy man who would always joke around with his children because he wanted them to be happy too.

When the family members themselves didn't laugh like he had planned, he chose to reveal himself. He spoke of how they all disappointed him, since they all became obsessed with money. He then sang a silly song, reminding them all of the fun the once had, making them all want to regain that part of their life.
