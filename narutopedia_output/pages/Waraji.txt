Waraji
 (
ワラジ
) is a
samurai
 from the
Land of Waves
. He and his partner
Zōri
 were mercenaries hired by
Gatō
 to be his personal bodyguards.

Personality

Waraji is an individual that seemingly lives for the rush of killing others or simply fighting and has been stated to desire to fight anyone that gets his blood rushing. He seems like a belligerent and cruel person who kills out of sheer boredom.
 On his way to Tazuna's house, he cut several trees and animals, and expressed wishing to skin Tsunami.

Appearance

Waraji is of tall stature, wears an eye-patch over his right eye and has brown hair which he parts in three, finishing in an elaborate topknot. He has an intricate tattoo that seemingly stretches across his entire left side and left right, inner thigh, as well as a stitched scar on the left side of his forehead, and the left side of his mouth. He wears what seems to be a loose-fitting kimono, albeit not in the traditional manner as the top half of the outfit falls around his waist leaving his upper body exposed. He also wears bandages wrapped around his waist, simple sandals and carries a fairly long sword.

Abilities

Waraji is skilled at
kenjutsu
 and uses
Iaijutsu
 which is practised by samurai and was able to cut through a wall in one swift, fluid motion;
 allegedly, he has enough skill in the discipline to perform this feat while seated in seiza,
iai-nuki
.
 He is also fairly strong, and was able to slice, and kill a giant boar while on his way to Inari's house.
 In the anime, his swordsmanship was good enough to defeat several of Naruto's
shadow clones
.

Prologue — Land of Waves






Haku attacks Zōri and Waraji before they can react.



Waraji was first introduced, alogside his partner
Zōri
, as
Gatō
 came to lecture
Zabuza
 about his failed mission to kill
Tazuna
. As they where about to attack Zabuza, Gatō stoped them since he wanted to keep question him. When
Haku
 almost crushed Gatō's arm and warnend him not to touch Zabuza, Waraji and Zōri were going to attack him, but instantly found themselves almost killed by their own swords held by Haku. Haku then warned them that he was angry.

Gatō ordered them to kidnap
Tsunami
 to force Tazuna, Tsunami's father and the bridge builder, to stop building his bridge. When Waraji threatened to kill Tsunami's son
Inari
, Tsunami also threatened to kill herself unless they let him go. Since Zōri was told by Gatō that they only needed one hostage, they leave Inari alone and proceed to take Tsunami to the bridge. However, Inari (remembering what
Kaiza
 told him) ran to save his mother. Ultimately,
Naruto
 came and got Tsunami away from Gatō's men. Both Zōri and Waraji were then defeated by Naruto's
shadow clones
 and were tied up and left there.

In the anime, it is revealed in a flashback that after Team Kakashi had left the Land of Waves, Waraji and Zōri did not leave the Land of Waves, but instead bided their time in an attempt to get revenge. They kidnap Inari,
Akane
 and some of the other children but once again their efforts are foiled by Team Kakashi and the villagers who rise up against them.
