Kara Actuation Arc

In the
hospital
 for incoming surgery, Nattō spent his time pulling pranks on the staff. While visiting
Boruto Uzumaki
,
Team 5
, specifically
Iwabee Yuino
, was pranked by Nattō. Nattō was caught by the genin and returned to his room. He claimed his pranks were preparation for his goal of becoming a shinobi. Having doubt in their skills as genin, Nattō thought the team weren't capable of handling their fears. Iwabee denied his claim and Nattō requested they get the autograph of his rarest
Extreme: Shinobi Picture Scrolls
 card,
Orochimaru
. Initially making excuses to accept the task, Team 5 decided to fulfil it when the nurse informed them of his reluctance to undergo surgery. Later, the genin successfully acquired Orochimaru's autograph, impressing Nattō.
