With help from
Kurama
, Naruto converts his
Truth-Seeking Ball
 into a
Tailed Beast Ball
, and adds
wind
-natured
chakra
 to create the
shuriken
-like blades around it before hurling it at the target. The resulting explosion dwarfs that of a regular Tailed Beast Ball and can destroy multiple
planetoid-like
 objects in one blast.

Trivia

In the anime, Naruto was erroneously shown creating seven Tailed Beast Ball Rasenshuriken.
 In the manga, he only had six Truth-Seeking Balls with which to create them.
