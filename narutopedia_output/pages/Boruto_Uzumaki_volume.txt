A battered
Mitsuki
 wakes up in one of
Orochimaru
's hideouts. He's weak, and has several tubes attached to him. Orochimaru gives him medicine to drink, which he does, but as he's weak, he drops the cup. Orochimaru instructs
Suigetsu Hōzuki
 to escort Mitsuki to him when he's fully awake. Orochimaru leaves, and Mitsuki asks who he is, having no memory of himself. Orochimaru talks with a hooded, smoking individual, commenting it's the sixth time, hoping things go better next time. Suigetsu escorts Mitsuki, who asks why he was in bed. Suigetsu explains he was injured in a two-man mission with Orochimaru, asking Mitsuki if he remembers. Suigetsu suddenly attacks Mitsuki, who avoids being stabbed, and
extends
 his arm to lock Suigetsu in place, and take his
kunai
. Suigetsu commends him as he's about to be stabbed, and Mitsuki blocks the kunai with his other arm. Mitsuki apologises, and Suigetsu frees himself by partially
liquifying himself
, noting Mitsuki's body still remembers how to be a
shinobi
, and explaining he had his memories erased. Orochimaru introduces himself as Mitsuki's parent, considering him to be very special, and intent on recovering his memories. He explains the man who took his memories keeps stocks of them, and by implanting false memories into his victims, he's able to control them. Orochimaru says the only way to recover Mitsuki's memories is to have this man, who they call
Log
, to return Mitsuki's memories. Mitsuki asks why they went after Log in the first place. Orochimaru wants to steal the information Log has acquired, and that means taking him alive. Mitsuki presses on, wondering if Orochimaru had his memories altered as well, and which of his parents he is. Orochimaru dismisses Mitsuki's concerns, and when Mitsuki asks why he was part of the mission, Orochimaru once again says as his child, Mitsuki is special. Mitsuki just wants to remember who he is.

On the mission, Orochimaru has Mitsuki break through a barrier, much like the previous mission. Log detects the disruption of the barrier. Log says there was no need for them to come, as he was planning on going after them, to acquire a certain key. Log employs the
Temporary Paralysis Technique
, which is no longer effective on Orochimaru. Orochimaru and Log clash swords, and Orochimaru attempts to use his snakes to poison him, which he is able to block thanks to his armour. Log uses a jutsu that makes his armour cover and paralyse Orochimaru, who informs Mitsuki he's capable of using
senjutsu
. Mitsuki is still paralysed from Log's jutsu. Log attacks, but becomes paralysed at the last moment. As the jutsu binding Orochimaru is undone, he points out Log was too concerned about the big snake he failed to notice the smaller snake that slid between the openings of his armour, managing to poison him in the process. Orochimaru instructs Mitsuki to watch him while he searches for something inside. Log manages to speak, and asks Mitsuki to remove his mask so he can breathe better. Mitsuki thinks he's trying to deceive him, but Log says that removing his mask will show him Orochimaru is the one who is deceiving him. Log claims he removed memories of Orochimaru's manipulation, but instead, Orochimaru used Mitsuki's lack of memories to do it, and that he is the same as Mitsuki. Mitsuki extends his arm, and removes his mask, revealing Log to actually be an older Mitsuki. He explains they are both synthetic humans created by Orochimaru. He goes on to say what Orochimaru came to search is the embryo from which they were both originated, and that he wants to steal the key Orochimaru possesses to open the case with the embryo and destroy it, as it's inhuman. The older Mitsuki tells the younger one he was created because he managed to escape Orochimaru, and vows to kill Orochimaru. Orochimaru returns, saying the circumstances of their birth changes nothing, assuring him as his children, he loves them, adding that Mitsuki's power exceeds his own, and that acting out of love should be something forgivable. The two continue to argue, and the older Mitsuki asks the younger one to take action against Orochimaru. Orochimaru dismisses the accusations, and promises to create siblings to play with Mitsuki. Mitsuki awakens his power, entering
Sage Transformation
, and affirming neither of them can tell him what to do, and he will make decisions for himself, taking the embryo case and key and leaving before either can do anything to stop him. The older Mitsuki asks what is inside the scroll this time, and Orochimaru says it's a "photo of the sun". The two discuss how things finally went their way, with Mitsuki deciding to take a third option rather than choosing between the two he was presented with. Orochimaru wonders if things will work out, not wanting to erase Mitsuki's memories with drugs again. The older Mitsuki, now smoking, thinks the younger one can be a light in the darkness, as that was the true purpose behind this plot of Orochimaru's. Mitsuki finds a photo of
Boruto Uzumaki
 inside the case, and Orochimaru is certain that if Mitsuki can find a sun who will illuminate his path, Mitsuki himself can become a moon and illuminate the darkness.

Chapter 1

"
Boruto Uzumaki!!
" (
うずまきボルト!!
,
Uzumaki Boruto!!
)

On
Naruto
's destroyed face in the
Hokage Rock
,
Boruto
 faces off against
Kawaki
. Overlooking a destroyed
Konohagakure
, Kawaki declares the age of shinobi over. Donning his damaged
forehead protector
 and activating his
dōjutsu
, Boruto points out he is still a shinobi, and charges towards Kawaki. Boruto thinks back on his history, from a time he himself resented shinobi, more specifically his father, who he believed did not pay enough attention to his family on account of being
Hokage
. Boruto recalls a mission his team was assigned, subduing a bear.
 Upon reporting to Naruto,
Katasuke
 interrupts them, asking Naruto's permission to allow the use of the
Kote
 in the upcoming
Chūnin Exams
, which Naruto denies. Later, Katasuke provides Boruto with cheat codes for his video-game, and suggests the Chūnin Exams would be a way to show Naruto how strong he is. Elsewhere,
Moegi
 hands her team admission papers to the exam.
Shikadai
 and
Inojin
 are not very excited about the idea, prompting her to deliver them letters from their mothers, which promptly changes their minds. Shikadai and Inojin meet with Boruto to play video-games.
Sarada
 and
Mitsuki
 join them, asking Boruto to participate in the Chūnin Exams, as it requires three-man teams. Shikadai notices Boruto's game has cheat codes, and leaves, believing the fun of the game being grinding for experience. Sarada and Mitsuki believe they convince Boruto to take the exams, when in reality, he wants to prove himself to his father. They are interrupted by
Hinata
 and
Himawari
, who have groceries for Himawari's birthday party. Naruto joins them for the party, but at the last moment, Naruto drops the cake on the floor when the
shadow clone
 is dispersed, angering Boruto. Hinata tries to defend Naruto's situation. Later, when the door bell rings, Boruto believes it to be Naruto, but actually it is
Sasuke
, looking for Naruto. Hinata informs him Naruto is still at the office. Sasuke hands Naruto a scroll from
Kaguya
's castle, and the two discuss Boruto. Later, Boruto tries attacking Sasuke, who effortlessly avoids it. Impressed with Sasuke, Boruto asks to be his disciple.

Chapter 2

"
The Training Begins!!
" (
修業開始!!
,
Shugyō Kaishi!!
)

Sasuke
 considers taking
Boruto
 as a disciple if he can perform the
Rasengan
. Boruto leaves, sure he'll master it in no time. Sasuke recalls reporting to Naruto about
two

people
 he found when looking for
Kaguya
's scroll, presuming they're also
Ōtsutsuki clan
 members. The next morning, Boruto wakes up
Konohamaru
 and asks him to teach him the Rasengan, which he proudly accepts to do.
 As Boruto finds the training to be bothersome,
Sarada
 watches him. Soon enough Boruto manages to create a Rasengan, albeit a very small scale, but proudly shows this off to Sasuke. However, Sasuke points out that it's hardly a Rasengan due to its size. This frustrates Boruto, causing him to
throw his Rasengan
 and storm off. Sarada arrives and tells Sasuke he's being too strict, and that Boruto's commitment to learning the Rasengan is unusual. Sasuke reveals he does intend to take Boruto on as his disciple, noticing the Rasengan's damage on a tree. Boruto runs into
Katasuke
, and tells him about his situation. To help solve his problem, Katasuke provides Boruto with a
Kote
. Boruto decides to use his new tool to help him impress Sasuke. With the help of the Kote hidden under his jacket, Boruto shows Sasuke a regular sized Rasengan. Although Sasuke sees through the deception, he doesn't comment, and finally agrees to take Boruto on as his disciple. Boruto and Sasuke talk by a bonfire, and Boruto asks Sasuke about Naruto's weaknesses, though Sasuke gives Boruto deeper look on Naruto. Later, Boruto, Sarada and
Mitsuki
 meet up, intending to take the
Chūnin Exams
. Elsewhere, Momoshiki and Kinshiki defeat
Killer B
, even turning his
Tailed Beast Ball
 against him, and taking
Gyūki
's
chakra
. The two detect a more powerful chakra not far away, and turn their attention to the next target,
Kurama
.

Chapter 3

"
The Chūnin Exams Begin!!
" (
中忍試験開始!!
,
Chūnin Shiken Kaishi!!
)

Gaara
,
Kankurō
, and
Team Shinki
 are on their way to
Konoha
 by train for the
Chūnin Exams
.
Shinki
 is fully committed that all three will be victorious, and confident their adversaries will be no match for them. Gaara tells them to be well-rested. In his room,
Metal Lee
 trains.
Sasuke
 teaches
Boruto

shurikenjutsu
, and how deflecting his own shuriken can be used to hit targets. At home, Boruto recalls
Katasuke
's words about the
Kote
.
Shikamaru
 and
Sai
 administer the first exam, a true or false question about a book series. When both answers are shown to be incorrect, all teams fall into an ink pit. The teams who manage to keep themselves from falling into the ink pass.
 Shikamaru informs
Naruto
 that Boruto and his team passed, and advises him to congratulate Boruto. Naruto sends him an email, and Boruto scoffs at it. When Boruto is dissatisfied with Sasuke's assessment of his shurikenjutsu, he complains, saying that this is
Sarada
's specialty as an Uchiha. To counter it, Sasuke creates numerous shadow clones, Naruto's specialty. Boruto manages to create only four clones. In the second exam, teams have to protect their own flags while capturing the opposing team's. Teams Moegi, Yurui, and Shinki pass. Boruto stays back to protect their flag while Sarada and
Mitsuki
 go on. Boruto and his clones take on a triplet team from
Kiri
, but the triplets can also use shadow clones, out-numbering him. Mitsuki turns back to help Boruto. When the triplets are on the verge of getting their flag, Boruto recalls Naruto's congratulatory email, and resorts to using the Kote, using
Water Release
 and
Lightning Release
 to defeat the triplets. Sarada uses her
Sharingan
 to spot the real flag among
genjutsu
 ones, securing victory for their team.
Kōsuke
, one of Katasuke's subordinates, informs him Boruto used the Kote, and that it was video recorded.

Author's Note

“

"I'm short on time and this part's a pain to draw. Could you take it on, Mikio?" That's what Kishimoto-san used to say to me a lot when drawing
Naruto
. In the beginning, it would be a background character, people sitting in spectator seats, the bad guy's gaggle of minions and so on. At times, he would say, "You're the only one I can trust with this," and I would also get to draw Naruto's shadow clones, or even a large-sized main character that wasn't a clone. And then, one day, circumstances led to me being entrusted with an entire manga. An honour that is more than I deserve!

I've loved ninja since I was a kid, and I had been creating lots of tabletop RPGs (RPGs that don't involve computers) with ninja characters when I was tapped to help with the
Boruto
 film and the
Naruto
 novel series world building, which then led to getting entrusted with the script for the main story.

I am very happy to be able to deliver to all of you readers the many ideas that Kishimoto Sensei has bequeathed to me. Thank you in advance!

, Boruto has a chakra cloak similar to the
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 and seemingly the
Byakugan
 in both eyes, and Sarada's
dōjutsu
 does not resemble the
standard
