Summary

Issue # 1

Team 7
 is assigned on a
B-rank
 mission to protect a reporter named
April O'Neil
. April reveals to Team 7 about a
scientist's
 research and experiments on humans and animals to fuse them into mutant shinobi. They are soon after confronted by a group of shinobi from the
Foot clan
 led by an anthropomorphic arctic fox
Alopex
, who are targeting April for her vital information. Just when Team 7 is about to fight the Foot ninja, a group of masked shinobi, consisting of
four

mutant

ninja

turtles
 and a
mutant rat
, intervened which caused the enemy group to retreat. Noticing a group of strange yet suspicious shinobi are here for April, Team 7 fought them while April filmed the entire battle. The masked rat figure called off the battle, commenting Team 7's abilities that rivaled his
four sons
.
Kakashi
, using his
Sharingan
, removed the mutant group's masks and casually greeted the rat mutant by the name
Hamato Yoshi
.

Issue #2

Kakashi explained about Yoshi, a shinobi from the Hamato clan who was killed by a
missing-nin
, though he did not recall Yoshi having a rat tail. Splinter revealed that he was Yoshi's pet rat. Team 7 put together to realise their fight really was a misunderstanding. After the introductions, the ninja turtle group guided Team 7 to their secret hideout. Once they arrived, Team 7 and the mutant ninja turtles got to know each other. Sasuke, who ignored Kaskashi's warning, questioned Splinter what is really keeping them underground. Splinter told him it's not a "what" but a "who". He began to tell Team 7 about
Oroku Saki
. After Hamato was killed by Oroku Saki, Splinter managed to escape and took refuge in the sewers where he found four baby turtles covered in a strange ooze and adopted them. When the ooze transformed them into mutants, Splinter and his sons sought answers in the world above. At every turn, they ran afoul of the Foot clan led by Oroku Saki. April also revealed about how she met the ninja turtles. After the turtles saved April, she left for
Konoha
 to learn more about the ooze from a
medical-nin
 expert. Her story was ended by a sudden growling. Though Sakura blamed Naruto, April admitted that it was her stomach growling.

After Team 7 and the ninja turtles left, April and Splinter stayed at the hideout. However, they were confronted by Oroku Saki and the Foot ninja.

Issue #3

After Team 7 and the ninja turtles returned from the Big Apple Village, they found the hideout ransacked and Splinter and April were gone. Meanwhile, Splinter and April were kidnapped by the Foot Clan as Saki plans to use them as bait to lure the ninja turtles out from hiding. He obtained the mutagenic ooze that was hidden in the scroll and uses it to transform the Foot Enforcers into mutants. He ordered them to cleanse Foot Clan Castle of its vermin, including Alopex in this directive. Before the Foot Enforcers could attack, the Turtles and Team 7 crash into the building, arriving sooner than Shredder had anticipated. After defeating the Foot Enforcers, Team 7 and the Turtles face the now mutated Saki.

Issue #4

Team 7 and the ninja turtles fought the mutated Shredder while Alopex took April and Splinter to safety. Kurama suggested Naruto to release him, but Naruto rejected as he'd rather use his own strength to protect his friends. Saki belittled Naruto as he revealed his birth of how he was abandoned as an infant and planned to use the mutated ooze to raze Big Apple Village and become the true power. Naruto commented that as a dumbest bunch of excuses he heard while explaining that people were born alone that no one survives without help. He then accusing Saki for his selfishness and betraying Hamata who treated Saki like family. Naruto declared that if he can't help his friends to protect Big Apple Village, he will never become
Hokage
 before putting his life on the line for his dream. The ninja turtles agreed with Naruto, commenting that's his
nindō
.

Leonardo said that they are too exposed. To stand a fighting chance, they need to get in close. Sakura noted that the floor is in platform-sized pieces. She told the others to hop on a big enough one, so she could launch everybody within striking distance. Don analyzed the fight so far, and that Saki's body is like bio-metal, so, hypothetically, he was vulnerable to electricity. As Kakashi and Sasuke can use their
Lightning Release
 jutsu, Kakashi told the others to leave the stunning to them.

Sakura lifted a huge slab of concrete overhead and the others climb on. She threw the slab of concrete directly at Shredder. As soon as they are close, Kakashi and Sasuke hit Shredder with their Lightning Release jutsu, causing him to shout in pain and surprise. Then the Turtles attack, their weapons now doing damage to Shredder’s body. Naruto’s clones rush in as well, striking Shredder all over his body. Now on the ground, Shredder is nonetheless still standing, which surprises Raphael. Shredder growls that they will pay for this with their lives. Leo says that Raph is right, they have to wrap this up because they are fighting on fumes. He says that they’ve got just enough left in the tank for a finishing move. Raph adds that there has to be a way for them to hit him all at once. Naruto recalled how they showed him how to surf the sewers on a skateboard. If they are ready to ride some wind, he thought they can grind this fight to a halt.

The two teams combined behind Naruto, who performed a Half-Shell Rasengan Spiral Sphere. Their blows, enhanced by the power of the chakra, rained destruction down on Shredder, defeating Shredder. A stunned Alopex asked if they won and Splinter suggested they join the others. Only Shredder’s helmet remained, covered in green mutagen remnants. While the others were relieved that Shredder was gone for good, Kakashi however informed that Shredder was still alive after sensing his chakra. The ninja turtles declared that they'll be prepared if Shredder shows up again. Splinter addressed Alopex, saying that he believed she will be needing a place to stay and that she's welcome in their lair.

Team 7 needed to head back to Konoha to report their mission to the
Fifth Hokage
. Before that, they joined in a celebration with pizza.
