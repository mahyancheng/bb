Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Boruto
 eats with
Shikadai
, and sketches what the possessing
spectre
 looked like to him. The two speculate why it's possessing people, its purpose, and why only Boruto can see it.
Sarada
 complains about the boys to
Chōchō
 and
Sumire
, but the conversation is cut short when Sumire gets a feeling that someone is spying on them. The three share their concerns with the other girls. The boys overhear them, but don't think it's related to the shadow spectre. The girls take an alley after Chōchō buys chips, and manage to capture their stalker. The boys hear screaming and rush there. Chōchō recognises their stalker as
Magire Kakuremino
, from another class.
 Shikadai checks with Boruto if he's possessed, and Boruto confirms he's not. They question why he's following Chōchō, but he reveals it's Sumire he's following, having a crush on her. Chōchō encourages Magire to confess his feelings to Sumire. He does, but Sumire rejects him, and he leaves hurt. During class, someone leaves a message to Sumire in the blackboard. Mitsuki asks around, and finds out Magire didn't go to class that day. Several notes for Sumire fall over the group, prompting them to watch over her. The boys and girls are separated by a metal wall in the Academy. The girls hide in a storage room, but someone knocks over
smoke bombs
. Sumire opens the door to clear the smoke, and gets separated from Chōchō and Sarada.
Denki
 arrives, asking if she's ok, and gets knocked out by Magire. The boys reach them, and all of them get to Sumire and Magire on the roof. Boruto notices the shadow possessing Magire. Magire
disguises
 himself and starts attacking. Chōchō admonishes his way of getting attention from Sumire, and tells him to better himself. She offers him chips. As he accepts them, the shadow leaves Magire, who breaks down crying. Magire gets gaunt and faints. The boys talk over food, speculating Magire got weaker due to chakra exhaustion.
Shikamaru
 delivers
Naruto
 a report suggesting the same. At night,
Mitsuki
 communicates with someone about Boruto's findings.
