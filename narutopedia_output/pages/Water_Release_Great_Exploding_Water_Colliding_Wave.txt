This technique is a larger version of the
Water Release: Exploding Water Colliding Wave
. With it, the user spews out a massive amount of water, covering an entire area with a ferocious tsunami. The produced ocean of water can be used for further techniques, and even gathered into a gigantic
water prison
, allowing Kisame to use his
Water Prison Shark Dance Technique
.

Trivia

In the anime TV broadcast, when Kisame used this technique against
Killer B
, only the subsequent sphere of water is seen. In the DVD release, the crushing waves produced by this technique are shown.
