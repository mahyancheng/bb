The user places a
sealing tag
 on the designated area. If anyone crosses it, whether it be an ally or an enemy,
toads
 are
summoned
 to stop them. This technique is useful to protect an object from falling into enemy hands, and it is said that only
Jiraiya
 and
Minato
 were able to remove it. Those wishing to release the seal must perform the required
hand seals
 and then point at it, which will cause any summoned toad to depart.

Trivia

The
Genjutsu World
 version of
Jiraiya
 is able to use this technique.
