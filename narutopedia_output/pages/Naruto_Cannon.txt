Naruto
 creates a
shadow clone
 that grabs and flings him to a distant point of the player's choosing. This technique is not meant for combat purposes, being only a method used in
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm
 to get around the
Konoha
 hub faster. As players progress in the game, Naruto's
chakra
 reserves become larger and he can be thrown further.
