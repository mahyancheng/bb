Jigumo can summon his wind spiders, enabling him to spin trails, which can be used to shoot his opponent with webs at high speeds (as shown in
Casualty Puppet
), trap opponents inside a room crawling with spiders and webs, or to make a windmill of webs. This technique was used to track down team
Jiraiya
 by spinning a silver trail. This can be useful with a
ventriloquism
 technique.
