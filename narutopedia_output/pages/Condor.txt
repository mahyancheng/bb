Condor
 (
コンドル
,
Kondoru
), known as
Lord Ostrich
 (
ダチョウ様
,
Dachō-sama
,
English TV:
 Mr. Ostrich), was a runaway pet that was hunted down by
Team 7
 who was tasked with retrieving it. However, he managed to escape and became the leader of the
Four Ninja Animal Warriors
.

Background

Some time after he returned home, he escaped again and trained himself in becoming a ninja ostrich and learning to speak. Since then, he considered
Naruto Uzumaki
 his rival who prevented his freedom. Some time after Sasuke's defection, Condor had escaped once again and had trained himself to learn techniques and to speak.
Kotetsu Hagane
, Naruto,
Shino Aburame
, and
Rock Lee
 were assigned to capture him. Condor, along with a few other animals, were trying to keep themselves free of domestication. He was defeated with the teamwork of Kotetsu and
Izumo Kamizuki
.

Personality

He appears to be knowledgeable as he knows of Sasuke's defection from
Konoha
, Naruto's two year training, and knowing who
Tsunade
 and
Jiraiya
 are. He has a habit of pecking people on their heads (mostly Naruto and
Sasuke Uchiha
) constantly.

Appearance

He is an average sized black and white ostrich who wears three red bow ties on his neck.

Abilities






Condor using Shining Ostrich Kick.



When first introduced Condor's fighting ability was limited to simply pecking opponents which he used effectively against the
Kanabun Gang
. Some time after this, he developed several powerful taijutsu moves taking advantage of his naturally strong leg muscles. For example, he can do a powerful
aerial kick
 that has the potential to
slam
 the opponent to the ground or a powerful kick to the stomach in either in the
air
 or on the
ground
 similar to
Rock Lee
's
taijutsu
. While up in the air he can also create a shock wave by
slamming
 his feet into the ground. His taijutsu skills make him capable of fighting
chūnin
-level
shinobi
. Naturally, as an ostrich, Condor has immense speed which he used in tandem with his taijutsu. He has also demonstrated great
chakra
 control, demonstrating the ability to
walk on water
 as well being able to use
Shadow Clone Technique
.

Part II

Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha

Two years later, he was seen telling some baby ostriches tales of his and Naruto's rivalry until Naruto came to catch him again after
Pain's assault
 on Konoha.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown






Condor watches on as the animals fight for Armadiko's affections.



It was revealed that Condor had actually stowed away on the ship heading towards the
Land of Lightning
. He, however, was found by Naruto when the latter was having difficulties communicating with
King
 and the other animals. Naruto asked if he escaped again and Condor stated he stowed himself away on the ship towards the
island
. Naruto told him that the animals on the island, including Condor, must be part of an animal unit to assist in the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 (a lie made up by the Konoha-nin to keep Naruto distracted). Naruto promised him he'll be free if he serves as an animal translator which Condor accepted. While King,
Don
,
Chūji
 and
Hippo Boss
 chased Naruto over
Armadiko
, who liked the latter, Condor took that opportunity to escape the island.

In Other Media

Video Games

In
Naruto Mobile
, Condor controls the amount of stones needed to increase the strength and skill of the player. He sells additional abilities for these very stones, which gives the player the opportunity to defeat stronger opponents in the tournament.

He also appears in the updated version as a tame beast assisting the owner in battle.

Trivia

Condor's favourite word seems to be "freedom!" (
フリーダム！
,
furīdamu!
).

Despite having a name, Condor is referred to as "Ostrich" in the credits.
