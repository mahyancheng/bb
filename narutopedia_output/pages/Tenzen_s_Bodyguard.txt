He was the bodyguard of
Tenzen Daikoku
 and he wielded
Zabuza Momochi
's
Kubikiribōchō
.

Appearance

He has spiky grey-coloured hair and small black eyes. He wears white bandages around his forehead.

Personality

He appeared to be very overconfident in his abilities thinking that he could defeat
someone
 who just took out a small army of armed men.

Abilities

He was skilled in
kenjutsu
 and strong enough to handle the Kubikiribōchō with ease, cutting Suigetsu down with one slash. He could also break through a wall with sheer power. Suigetsu noted his envy about that the bodyguard could use the  Kubikiribōchō without special training and with brute strength alone.

Part II

Itachi Pursuit Mission

Sasuke Uchiha
 and Suigetsu Hōzuki confronted Tenzen at his castle to obtain the Kubikiribōchō which he claimed at Zabuza's grave when he was originally after Zabuza. Tenzen gave the sword to his strongest henchmen and made him his bodyguard. Tenzen's bodyguard crashed through the wall and slashes Suigetsu with Zabuza's sword but is shocked to see that Suigetsu had survived the slashes due to his
unique body
. Suigetsu
increases the size of his arm
 and grabs the sword, tossing Tenzen's bodyguard out of the hole in the wall.
