The user
summons
 several
snakes
 from under their sleeve, deploying them against a target as a surprise. The snakes do as their summoner commands, attacking or capturing targets by biting or constricting them.
 The snakes can also help the user latch to the surroundings, pulling the summoner towards a destination to help them get around faster. Because of the snakes' length, they can be used from a fair distance away.

Trivia

In the anime,
Orochimaru
 can use this technique via his mouth, in which his tongue transforms into a snake.

Sasuke Uchiha
 is shown performing this technique without sleeves, the snakes being summoned from his bare shoulders.
