The pinnacle of
Uchiha
 Fire Release techniques,

chakra
 kneaded inside the body is converted into fire, and then expelled from the mouth and
shaped
 into a literal sea of flames,
 which covers a wide range as well. This makes the technique extremely difficult to either avoid or contain, with it requiring the combined efforts of several
Water Release
 users in order to extinguish the flames.

Trivia

In the Weekly Shōnen Jump publication of chapter 560, the first kanji in the word 'annihilation' (
滅却
,
mekkyaku
) had been replaced with the visually similar 威 (
authority, majesty
), which is normally pronounced as 'i' and is also found in the name of
Kamui
.

In
Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker
, this technique appears as a set of six enormous fireballs.
