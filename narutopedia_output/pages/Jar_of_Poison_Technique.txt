Using his
rinkaichū
, Torune gathers multiple infected corpses and contains them within a barrier where the decaying flesh will release a gas that in time will ignite an explosion and release the venomous insects in a huge swarm that could cover the surrounding landscape. According to
Shino
, the barrier accelerates the insect's multiplication.

Trivia

When written as 蠱毒, "kodoku" means "to poison someone". When written as 孤独, it means "isolation", "loneliness", or "solitude".

This technique is likely based on
Kodoku
, a Japanese folk curse created by having various insects kill each other in a jar until the last survivor becomes a creature of supernatural influence.

As stated by Torune, the Jar of Poison Technique was labelled a kinjutsu due to the sheer volume of corpses required to execute it and the indiscriminate effects of the
poisonous cloud
.

The appearance of the barrier closely resembles that of the
Four-Corner Sealing Barrier
.
