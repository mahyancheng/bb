The Valley of Clouds and Lightning.



The
Valley of Clouds and Lightning
 (
雲雷峡
,
Unraikyō
).
 is a valley located somewhere within the
Land of Lightning
's many mountain ranges. It's a water-filled valley covered in clouds or fog. Within this valley is a dark cavern where
Killer B
, the
jinchūriki
 of the
Eight-Tails
, trains.

After swearing loyalty to the
First Raikage
, the
Yotsuki clan
 were given land in this valley.
 The valley has been greatly devastated due to Killer B launching a
Tailed Beast Ball
 within the area during his fight against
Taka
.
