With his
Shikotsumyaku
,
Kimimaro
 pulls from his body a bone, such as an
upper arm bone
, that he's modified to use as a sword. With it he repeatedly stabs at his target, doing so rapidly enough to create the appearance of afterimages. Each stab is directed at a slightly different part of the target, from a slightly different angle, and with slightly different regularity, making it difficult to predict each strike. Although targets may be able to dodge Kimimaro's attacks for a time, they will eventually be unable to keep up with the constant and "chaotic" strikes, giving Kimimaro the opening he needs to finally stab and kill them.

Trivia

Camellias
 are tall evergreen trees that grow in warm regions. A camellia's leaves are shiny and rigid and its flowers are red and white.
