Synopsis

Sasuke
 sends
Konoha
 a message about his own encounter with the exploding humans. At the village, Sasuke participates in the service of those who died in the attack.
Chino
 and
Nowaki
 confirm Sasuke's identity, and want to join the investigation. Chino continues to pester Sasuke with questions, but Nowaki tells her to stop. Sasuke confirms he's looking for Fūshin, and is certain the exploding humans were created through a
kekkei genkai
. Sasuke leads them to a cave entrance, where they meet
Yamato
, who is keeping an eye on
Orochimaru
. Sasuke wants to speak with Orochimaru, believing him to have information about the exploding humans.
 Yamato allows them passage into the cave. Sasuke asks Orochimaru for information, who reveals Fūshin does possess a kekkei genkai, and was a member of
En Oyashiro
's guard, an arm dealer. Orochimaru tells him his hideout is even more concealed than his own, but he knows how to draw him out. The rest of
Taka
 arrives,
Karin
 immediately picking a fight with Chino over Sasuke. Orochimaru returns, and says he'll join Sasuke on a journey to an island for the wealthy, where En Oyashiro should go if he takes Orochimaru's bait. They take a boat. Taka discusses Sasuke's situation. Orochimaru is followed by Yamato. Orochimaru and Sasuke discuss how neither of them should be able to move so freely, and the only reason they were free was because they might be useful in the future, should another evil come along though he reiterates that his friend Naruto wouldn't think in this manner.  The group arrives at the island, where the Coliseum is. Orochimaru explains it's a fighting club for the rich, where they have the shinobi under their employ fight. Sasuke say he's not interested, and Orochimaru explains En will appear if there are shinobi he's interested in. Chino asks Sasuke why he doesn't help, explaining that to the victim, their assailant and third parties who do nothing are equally guilty. The announcer introduces
Futsu
, a shinobi employed by En, and to Sasuke's surprise, announces him as the opponent, employed by Orochimaru. Orochimaru explains En collects kekkei genkai, and is always in disguise, so by having the chance to collect Sasuke, he should come forward. Sasuke goes in to fight, Futsu being a Boil Release user. Just as the fight begins, one of the patrons falls by the stage, Sasuke recognising the signs of him being an exploding human.
