Contact! Naruto vs. Itachi
" (
ついに接触!! ナルトVSイタチ
,
Tsuini Sesshoku!! Naruto tai Itachi
) is episode 298 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

As they travel slowly towards an unknown destination,
Nagato
 and
Itachi
 wonder who they are going to be forced to fight.
Sensing
 a nostalgic presence, they are greeted by
Naruto
 and
Killer B
. Their reunion conversation is cut short when
Kabuto Yakushi
 — thrilled by the prospect of capturing the
Eight
 and
Nine-Tails
 — commands Itachi to attack. After slicing through Itachi's
enormous
 fireball using
Samehada
, B apologises to the sentient blade, who did not appreciate being used to absorb hot flames.
Moving-in
, Itachi clashes with Naruto while they converse about
Sasuke
, and Naruto reveals to Itachi that he knows the truth behind the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
. A shocked Itachi questions how far this news has spread, and upon hearing that only a few people know, requests that nobody else finds out.

Though puzzled by the conversation, Nagato is forced to attack before he can ask for more details, and the battle between the four shinobi ensues. Retreating atop Nagato's
Giant Drill-Beaked Bird
, Itachi activates his
Mangekyō Sharingan
, which causes one of his
crows
 to emerge from a shocked Naruto's mouth. Itachi casts
Amaterasu
 in order to incinerate Nagato's summons as well as Nagato himself, telling the
Rinnegan
-wielder that his plan had worked. It is revealed that the crow has
Shisui Uchiha
's Mangekyō Sharingan implanted in its eye socket, and the eye is rigged to cast
Kotoamatsukami
 (with the order "protect Konoha") when it sees Itachi's Mangekyō Sharingan. Now freed from Kabuto's control, Itachi explains that this was the power he had given to Naruto, and that he had intended for it to be used on his brother. During this explanation, however, Nagato's corpse is able to regenerate and Kabuto, excited by the prospect of acquiring Shisui's DNA, has Nagato attack once again. Hidden in his
Giant Snake-Tailed Chameleon
, Nagato surprises the group by launching a large-scaled
Shinra Tensei
 before targeting B. B
throttles
 him in his
Version 2 form
, but Nagato
absorbs
 B's chakra and is restored to his youthful-looking self. With this, Nagato captures Naruto and prepares to
remove
 his soul.

Trivia

In this episode, Kabuto's glasses are briefly shown without their temple arms.
