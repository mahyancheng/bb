Madara Uchiha
 (
うちはマダラ
,
Uchiha Madara
) was the legendary leader of the
Uchiha Clan
 and a
reincarnation
 of
Indra Ōtsutsuki
. He founded
Konohagakure
 alongside his childhood friend and rival,
Hashirama Senju
, with the intention of bringing about an era of peace. When the two couldn't agree on how to achieve that peace, they fought for control of the village, a conflict which ended in Madara's death. Madara, however,
rewrote
 his death and went into hiding to work on his own
plans
. Unable to complete it in his natural life, he entrusted his knowledge and plans to
Obito Uchiha
 shortly before his actual death. Years later, Madara would be
revived
 during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 with his goal involving the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 having reached fruition, only to be upended by
Black Zetsu
 and its own ancient machinations. Finally, realising the error of his ways, he made amends with Hashirama before his final death.

Background






Madara as a child.



Madara was born during the
Warring States Period
, and was the eldest of
Tajima Uchiha
's five children.
 Madara and his siblings grew up on the battlefield waging constant war with the Uchiha's rivals: the
Senju
. Three of his siblings died young, leaving Madara with only his younger brother,
Izuna
. Madara and Izuna became very close through their shared loss and constantly competed with each other to get stronger.
 This, combined with his naturally strong chakra, enabled the young Madara to defeat adult Senju in battle and develop a reputation as a genius.

During his infrequent downtime, Madara met a boy his own age named Hashirama. The two quickly developed a friendly rivalry, be it skipping stones or urinating in rivers. Like Madara, Hashirama was also a shinobi who had lost his brothers on the battlefield. Together they imagined a world where children like themselves wouldn't need to fight.
 As a precaution, Madara and Hashirama did not share their family names, but nevertheless discovered each other's identities: Madara was an Uchiha, Hashirama was a Senju; it was their duty to kill each other, even if they were friends. Needing to choose between his family and his dreams of peace, Madara chose to end his friendship with Hashirama so he would have no reservations over killing him in the future, a resolve strong enough to awaken his
Sharingan
.






Madara and Hashirama clash on the battlefield.



Over the following years Madara and Hashirama continued to meet in combat. Madara could never defeat Hashirama — even after acquiring a
Mangekyō Sharingan
 — and Hashirama could never bring himself to kill someone he still considered a friend, resulting in a constant stalemate between the two that lasted decades. In time, both Madara and Hashirama became leaders of their respective clans, a position Hashirama tried to use to broker peace between them.
 Although some Uchiha found the offer increasingly tempting, Madara refused due to Izuna's death at the hands of Hashirama's own brother,
Tobirama Senju
. Despite this, some Uchiha defected over to the Senju clan out of self-preservation. Madara then used Izuna's eyes in order to gain "eternal" Mangekyō Sharingan and restore his deteriorating vision. With this new power he waged one final assault against the Senju and was summarily defeated. Rather than kill Madara to bring the era of war to an end, Hashirama offered to kill himself if it would stop the fighting. Madara was moved by Hashirama's gesture and finally assented to peace.






Konohagakure is formed.



The Senju, the Uchiha, and all their affiliated clans came together to found a village of peace, where children would never need to die in battle. Madara and Hashirama rekindled their childhood friendship, and Madara named that village
Konohagakure
, seeing it through leaves.
 But Madara's idea of peace differed from Hashirama's: where Hashirama envisioned cooperation with the other newly-formed villages, Madara desired control so the peace could never be lost, evidenced by his attacking
Iwagakure
's
Mū
 and
Ōnoki
 so that they would submit to Konoha's authority.
 When Hashirama was elected as
Hokage
, Konoha's leader, Madara also became concerned for the Uchiha's future, believing this to be but the first step in the Senju's dominance.

The
Stone Tablet

Zetsu
 altered
 had been in the Uchiha's possession for generations and was brought with them when they settled in Konoha. Through careful study, Madara was able to decipher enough of it to learn of the history of shinobi: of the endless cycle of failed peace and the destiny of battle between Uchiha and Senju, but also a means of unity for the world.
 With this knowledge, Madara decided Konoha was a failed experiment. He tried to convince his own clan and even Hashirama of the same conclusion, but none would hear him.
 Madara chose to abandon the village, attacking Konoha on multiple occasions,
 later returning with the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 under his control to challenge Hashirama.
 They fought to exhaustion, and from the carnage of their battle the
Valley of the End
 was formed.
 In the end, Madara was killed by Hashirama.






An elderly Madara awakens the Rinnegan.



News of Madara's death spread fast and his corpse was secretly hidden to keep anyone from finding it and profiting from it. But Madara had planned ahead: he had scheduled an
Izanagi
 to activate sometime after his death, changing reality to bring him back to life in exchange for his right eye's vision. Meanwhile, Black Zetsu had spent an unspecific length of time hiding itself inside of Madara's body, allowing it to later deceive Madara into thinking he created it. After being revived, he left a
copy
 in place of his real body and went into hiding with a special trophy from his fight with Hashirama: a mouthful of Hashirama's flesh that he transplanted into his wounds. It was not until decades later, towards the end of Madara's natural life, that the cells had any effect, awakening the
Rinnegan
 (in the process restoring his right eye). With the Rinnegan, he was able to summon the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, which he used to cultivate a
mindless living clone of Hashirama
 from which he believed he had produced a
White Zetsu Army
.

Over the years, Madara had perfected his plans for peace in what he called the Eye of the Moon Plan. But as his years waned, Madara knew he couldn't complete his plans in the time he had left. So he transplanted his Rinnegan into a young
Nagato
 without the boy's knowing,
 intending Nagato to someday use the eyes to
restore
 Madara to life. If Nagato was to do this, however, Madara would need an agent to act on his behalf and guide Nagato towards this ultimate goal. Madara waited, connecting himself to Demonic Statue to keep him alive until someone could be found.
 Madara spent this time keeping a close eye on Konoha to find a suitable pawn to take his place.






Madara meeting Obito Uchiha.



During the
Third Shinobi World War
, Madara found a badly injured
Obito
. Madara used Hashirama's cells to replace Obito's damaged extremities and placed a
Forbidden Individual Curse Tag
 in Obito's heart as a fail-safe in case Obito ever turned against him.
 Until then, Madara began working towards corrupting Obito. He had
Kirigakure
 kidnap the girl Obito loved,
Rin Nohara
, and seal the
Three-Tails
 into her. He then manipulated events so that Rin would die at the hand of Obito's friend,
Kakashi Hatake
, while Obito watched.
 Driven to despair, Obito offered his services to Madara. Madara divulged to Obito the history of the
Sage of the Six Paths
 and the
Ten-Tails
, the details of his Eye of the Moon Plan, and various techniques that Obito would need moving forward. As a final act, he left behind
Black Zetsu
 — what he believed to be
a manifestation of his will
 — to provide additional guidance to Obito in pursuit of this goal. With that, Madara disconnected from the Demonic Statue and, with his dying breath, entrusted Obito with his name: Madara Uchiha.

Personality






The childhood dynamics between Madara and Hashirama.



Madara's childhood was a product of the times he lived in: the constant fighting made him a perfectionist that would keep at something until he mastered it, and his triumphs on the battlefield made him very confident in his abilities and talent.
 Whenever one of these personality traits was challenged, as they tended to be by Hashirama, Madara's competitive streak would emerge. Madara did not mind Hashirama's influence in this regard; he believed that the only way to survive in the shinobi world was to make allies with one's enemies.
 His exposure to Hashirama is credited for Madara not experiencing the Uchiha's "
Curse of Hatred
" or at the very least, not being victimised by it as much as Izuna was and even though he claimed to have abandoned his friendship with Hashirama, Madara still held onto their friendship subconsciously.
 Madara's actions and beliefs were singularly focused on protecting Izuna, his only surviving brother.
 So long as he had Izuna, Madara was reasonable and kind, willing to make concessions for a perceived greater good.






Madara's descent into darkness.



Madara changed after Izuna's death, becoming bitter towards the Senju, particularly Hashirama since he still had a brother. Embracing his clan's Curse of Hatred, he opted to die for revenge rather than compromise or forgive.
 Although he was briefly convinced to set aside his grief and try to replace Izuna with the collective family of Konoha, he could never shake the feeling that he was betraying Izuna's memory. The increasing isolation of himself and other Uchiha from village politics ultimately convinced him of this, causing him to fully break with any other attachments.

During his time as a Konoha shinobi, Madara did what he thought was in the village's best interests. Unlike Hashirama's compassionate methods, Madara took a merciless approach: the shinobi of Iwagakure only had purpose so long as they swore unwavering allegiance to Konoha.
 Since their methods were so different, Madara hated to hear Hashirama's name during diplomatic discussions.
 After his defection from Konoha, Madara's priorities became centred around the Eye of the Moon Plan, manipulating countless others in order to satisfy his own goals and putting in place multiple layers of contingencies so that nobody could ever diverge from his own intentions. Despite this, Madara genuinely believed this plan would in fact, benefit the world and simply followed an "
ends justifies the means
" principle.

As he valued only power and possessed so much of it, Madara therefore disliked to waste it on unworthy causes or unchallenging opponents, claiming disgust when he was forced to.

Madara loved fighting above all else: the sights, the sounds, even the taste of his own blood, occasionally describing his battles as "dances";
 he felt being
reincarnated
 deprived him of the full experience. Yet he was very disciplined in a fight, never allowing his failed plans or attacks to upset him, never letting superior numbers or power intimidate him, and always willing to do whatever must be done to gain victory. Although he sometimes imposed limitations on himself, such as not using certain techniques more than once, he was willing to "lower" himself with unbecoming tactics or excessive displays in order to change tactics and exploit advantages. He was perfectly aware of his talents and did not feign modesty, bluntly stating when he was stronger than his opponents and belittling them when they continued to defy him. Conversely, if he was proven wrong or somebody posed a legitimate challenge to him, he would admit it, and apologise for previous remarks if necessary. In addition, if such an opponent is about to die, he would show them the ultimate respect by taking the time and effort to finish them off himself, even if said person is going to die on their own.
 Stemming from this, he feels insulted if he knows an opponent isn't using their full power against him, even if he knows it will result in their death.
 He also held the Senju to a higher standard in terms of power due to his encounters with Hashirama, stating a weak Senju disgusts him more than a weak shinobi of any kind.






Madara's reaction after sensing Hashirama's chakra.



One of the exceptions Madara makes was Hashirama. Their years of rivalry left Madara with competing feelings of respect and resentment for Hashirama. Madara considered Hashirama the only opponent worthy of his time and would postpone his own plans if it meant prolonging his time to fight with Hashirama without issue.
 Despite this, Madara is quite open-minded about recognising other strong individuals besides Hashirama, as when he declares
Might Guy
 as the strongest taijutsu user he's ever faced.

Despite his prowess and intellect, Madara is not without moments of recklessness. When he was brought back to life, he showed no hesitation in absorbing Hashirama's senjutsu chakra while admitting he expected to have some difficulty controlling it due to having no prior training.






In his final moments, Madara was finally able to break free from the Curse of Hatred.



In the later years of his developing the
Eye of the Moon Plan
, Madara became pessimistic about human nature, believing the cycle of battle to be inescapable.
 He also came to believe that humanity and the world are incapable of changing from what they were in the past.
 He believed the current, "worthless" reality was built too much on the idea of winning and losing. For this reason he was deeply committed to his plan, so much that he would prematurely end a fight he was enjoying or kill any threat, even his
own

clansmen
, for the sake of its success. Despite this, Madara was simply acting on what he believed would benefit humanity as a whole, showing his time in Konoha did indeed influence his actions and he wasn't acting simply out of bloodlust after Izuna's death. His plan's ultimate failure made him see its errors: breaking free of his Curse of Hatred, and admitted the superiority of Hashirama's methods for peace. He and Hashirama were thus able to reconcile their friendship in the moments just before his death.

Appearance

1/3

Madara was a fair-skinned man with spiky, black hair that had a slight blue tint to it. In his childhood, his hair was chin-length that parted to frame the sides of his face. His casual attire consisted of a blue long sleeve shirt and white pants. While on the battlefield he wore the standard Uchiha outfit: a black shirt with a high-collar left slightly open and the clan's crest on its back, with blue pants and bandages around his shins. Around his waist he had a white sash that held a sack, presumably containing his ninja tools.
 Later, his sash was replaced by a belt, adorned with pouches and various weapons. He also wore another sash strapped across his shoulders which he used to hold his swords.

As an adult, Madara is fairly tall while his hair grew to waist-length with shoulder-length bangs framing the sides of his face, covering most of his right eye. He has several scars throughout his body.
 Although still relatively young, more prominent creases had developed under each of his eyes. At times, he wore crimson armour with numerous metal plates, forming protective guards along his chest, waist, shoulders and thighs. Most of the time, however, he continued wearing the same basic Uchiha outfit: a blue high-collared, long sleeve mantle that splits down the lower half and a simple, light-brown obi and a belt.
 During battle, he often carried an orange-brown
gunbai
 which had a long black chain running up it. At one point, he wore a Konohagakure
forehead protector
.
 The anime also shows him wearing a metal belt, as well as a brown leather sash to hold some of his other weapons, and a pair of belt sashes to hold two of his swords.






Madara in his old age.



In his old age, Madara became extremely worn and emaciated, with his hair turned thin and white, and lost all his teeth. He wore a simple black outfit and used his
kama
 as a makeshift cane.
 When Madara was
reincarnated
 his body's youth was restored, albeit with the generic effect of gaining grey sclerae and minor cracks all over his body. These disappear once he is properly
revived
.

After becoming the
Ten-Tails
'
jinchūriki
, Madara gains the appearance of an
Ōtsutsuki
; having taupe hair (white in the anime), pale grey skin (pale mint in the anime), and he became enveloped by a cloak of chakra that manifests into physical clothing: a full-bodied black garment with black pants, gloves, and boots, over which he wore a flowing white robe with six black magatama markings across his chest and the familiar pattern of a black
Rinnegan
 and nine black magatama markings in rows of three on his back. A pale grey horn-like protrusions grew out of his left temple and overlapped his forehead akin to a
protector
 with an upward-curve on the right temple, giving him an overall appearance very similar to that of the
Sage of the Six Paths
. After absorbing the recreated Ten-Tails produced by Obito, Madara obtained additional black magatama markings around his sleeve cuffs and the rim of his robe. He reverts to his former appearance after the Ten-Tails is removed from his body.

Abilities






Madara's power being compared to that of a god.



Madara was one of the most powerful shinobi in history, recognised as the strongest
Uchiha
 ever produced even decades after his death.
 A child prodigy, he killed several adult
Senju
 before he had awakened his
Sharingan
.
 He was the only one able to push
Hashirama Senju
, a "
God of Shinobi
", to his absolute limits.
 When
Obito
 operated under Madara's name, fear of Madara's power forced the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
, and the neutral
Land of Iron
, to band together, as it was noted Madara's name itself was power.
 Madara was able to, respectively, singlehandedly defeat the Five
Kage
 and the nine
tailed beasts
.
 He was also confident he could overpower Obito - then the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki - something it took the combined
Allied Shinobi Forces
 to accomplish.

Chakra and Physical Prowess

Even by Uchiha standards, Madara was born with very powerful chakra,
 described as very foul and evil.
  His large chakra reserves allowed him to fight nonstop for 24 hours before collapsing,
 and in his old age, summon the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 from its
cage
 in the
moon
.
 His chakra control could perform complicated techniques with a single
hand seal
. He could also quickly
absorb
 and synchronise
senjutsu

chakra
 with his own and enter Sage Mode, despite having no prior training in senjutsu.
 Even when distributing his chakra among 25 wood clones, each still had enough power to threaten the Five Kage.

Madara was incredibly skilled in
taijutsu
. Against the
Fourth Division
, he calmly defeated thousands of opponents with physical combat, showing exceptional agility, reflexes, and coordination to disarm, dodge, and counter attacks from many directions at once. He could strike with precision before his opponent could react, and he could overpower individuals twice his size.
 Madara demonstrated exceptional reactions, strength, and durability during the Fourth Great Ninja War. While still an Edo Tensei, he reacted to and withstood a kick from Tsunade, who was
teleported at lightspeed to the battlefield
, landing on his feet unharmed.
 He also blocked an attack from the Fourth Raikage, displaying both reaction speed and durability against one of the fastest shinobi alive.

Madara withstood a massive Rasenshuriken from Sage Mode Naruto, confirming his ability to endure high-level chakra-based attacks.
 After being fully revived and regaining his past lifetime’s strength and physicality, as noted by Hashirama, He obliterated the legendary Hashirama's technique,
Sage Art: Gate of the Great God
, and destroyed
Sai’s sealing jutsu
.
 Madara forced Sage Mode Naruto to block his attack, overpowering him and sending him flying several meters.

Body Modifications






A replica of Hashirama's face on Madara's chest.



When Madara was
reincarnated
,
Kabuto Yakushi
 modified him to be "even greater than when he was alive". He was restored to his physical prime while also retaining the abilities he only had in his old age.
 In addition, a pale replica of Hashirama's face existed on Madara's left pectoral region,
 which acted as a medium to channel senjutsu chakra into Sage Mode. It also let him
heal
 most of his injuries in seconds,
 and allows him the usage of Wood Release. For severe injuries he could not heal, like amputation, Madara could replace his limb with material from a
White Zetsu's
 body.
 Stemming from having Hashirama's cells in his body, Madara's life-force became powerful enough to not immediately die from having all the tailed beasts extracted from his body.

Ninjutsu






Madara fighting while blind.



Madara was well-versed in a variety of
ninjutsu
 styles: he could use
juinjutsu
 powerful enough to
restrict
 the target's actions,

hide within surfaces
 to avoid damage and traverse the battlefield unnoticed,
 and through an unorthodox use of the
Shadow Clone Technique
, fake his death by having a clone act as his corpse.
 In the anime, Madara showed the ability to levitate.

Madara was an adept
sensor
, being able to
detect
 others' chakra signature countries away,
 determine a person's
clan
 and the nature of their
kekkei genkai
,
 and even differentiate species.
 When amplified by Sage Mode, he could even fight whilst blind by locating targets and dodging attacks through his sensory perception,
 even avoiding a
Flying Thunder God Slash
.
 Also with Sage Mode, Madara's pain tolerance was high, as he neither flinched from
Sasuke
 stabbing his right arm, the tailed beasts' assault, nor from the loss of his arm.

Bukijutsu






Madara wielding his gunbai.



Madara could use many weapons, such as
giant shuriken
, a
kama
,
chains with weights
, a
kusarigama
, and hand-held
shuriken
.
 He also demonstrated proficiency with
swords
 while fighting the Fourth Division.
 His trademark weapon was his
gunbai
, with which he could shield himself
 and
redirect attacks
,
 or wield it like a mace or flail.
 He could slice through the giant roots of the Ten-Tails' tree form with it.

Nature Transformation






Madara using Fire Release: Great Fire Annihilation.



Madara was able to utilise all five basic
nature transformations
, as well as
Yin–Yang Release
.
 An Uchiha, he had a natural affinity for
Fire Release
, being able to
produce a massive flames
 that required several
Water Release
 users together to repel,
 launch a volley of
dragon-shaped fireballs
,
 or
cover an area with ash
 as a smokescreen.
 In the anime, Madara could create
powerful gusts
 with his gunbai to repel an entire platoon.
 Later in his life, he used Yin–Yang Release to amplify
White Zetsu
, and
pour his will
 into
black receivers
 which could restrict and control targets.






Madara using Wood Release.



After transplanting Hashirama's DNA, which was later augmented further by Kabuto, Madara could use
Wood Release
, a mixture of water and
earth
-natured chakra, with his skill and power comparable to Hashirama himself.
 He could create
gigantic flowering trees
 to render foes unconscious,

wood clone
,
 and
wood dragons
 which could bind targets and drain their chakra.
 With Hashirama's cells, Madara could also produce roots to connect to and gain
limited control
 of the Ten-Tails.
 After becoming the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, he could use
Yin Release
 to create
lightning bolts
, and
Storm Release
 – a mixture of water and
lightning
-natured chakra – to create
energy beams
 that could cut through the Six Paths Rods.

Dōjutsu

Sharingan






Madara's Sharingan.



Madara awakened his Sharingan as a child, with one
tomoe
 in each of his eyes.
 By adulthood, his Sharingan was fully developed and active near-constantly. Madara's mastery over the Sharingan surpassed every other member of the Uchiha clan in his natural lifetime. Only he could tell the difference between a shadow or wood clone, and the original.
 With brief eye contact, Madara could place targets under
genjutsu
 and paralyse them or relay information.
 He could even trap the Nine-Tails, and
summon
 it as a powerful tool in battle. By
programming
 one of his eyes to activate
Izanagi
 after his death, he was able to alter reality and resurrect himself.

Mangekyō Sharingan






Madara's Mangekyō Sharingan.



Madara was the first Uchiha known to have awakened the
Mangekyō Sharingan
. Madara knew about other users' Mangekyō techniques, and was also capable of discerning the mechanics of these techniques with brief observation.
 The "straight tomoe" (
直巴
,
Choku Tomoe
) of his Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan granted him fluidity in his movements when fighting.






Madara's Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan.



Having awakened both his Mangekyō, Madara could use
Susanoo
, which he could use even without his eyes in their sockets.
 The ribcage could withstand an
Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan
 and
A
's strength.
 He could produce a legged humanoid Susanoo. His Susanoo wielded up to four
undulating blades
 that could be thrown and controlled remotely.
 He could also fire
Yasaka Magatama
 of varying sizes.
 When fully produced, Madara would hover inside Susanoo to grant him a greater range of movement.






Madara's Complete Body — Susanoo.



With his eyesight deteriorating from overuse, he replaced his original eyes with Izuna's, restoring his vision and gaining the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan.
 With it, he could "stabilise" Susanoo into its Complete Body form, causing it to resemble a
tengu
 with outer armour that was nearly impenetrable.
 A secondary pair of arms wielded sheathed katana which could be used to bisect mountains with their mere shockwaves.
 According to himself, its power was comparable to that of the tailed beasts, and no one was said to have lived to see it a second time.
 Madara's Complete Body Susanoo uses its secondary set of arms for attack and defence rather than flight. He was also able to
shape
 his Susanoo into an
armour
 for
Kurama
, which
synergised their abilities
.

After absorbing the God Tree into himself and stealing
Kakashi Hatake
's Mangekyō Sharingan, he was able to use
Kamui
 on himself immediately
 to
reach
 Obito and retrieve his Rinnegan still with him. Though brief, Madara's use of the eye was notable on account of being able to use Kamui while the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, something Obito himself couldn't do.

Rinnegan






Madara's Rinnegan.



Years after infusing himself with Hashirama's DNA and unknowingly mixing Indra's and Asura's chakra, Madara's Sharingan evolved into the
Rinnegan
.
 As the eyes' original owner, only he could use them to their maximum power.
 He was able to switch between both dōjutsu. With the Rinnegan, Madara could use all of the abilities of the
Six Paths Technique
,
 such as the
Preta Path
 to
absorb
 chakra
 and the
Deva Path
 to perform
Chibaku Tensei
.
 He could also use the
Outer Path
 to create
chakra chains
 that could restrain all nine
tailed beasts
 and
black receivers
 for various melee and supplementary purposes. Through the usage of his Rinnegan with that of his
Sharingan
, Madara could summon
meteorites
 to cause widespread destruction.

While under the
Impure World Reincarnation
, Madara was unable to use the full extent of his Rinnegan's abilities. After being revived and obtaining one of his actual eyes, he could
summon and control
 the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
,

seal
 the
Ten-Tails
 inside himself,
 and generate a
corporeal invisible shadow
 to aid him in battle. While Madara was in Sage Mode and further boosted by Kurama's chakra, this shadow was powerful enough to knock down the
tailed beasts
.
 With access to both of his Rinnegan, Madara could produce at least four shadows to aid him.

Rinne Sharingan






Madara's Rinne Sharingan.



As the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki and with both of his Rinnegan, Madara approached the
moon
 and awakened a
Rinne Sharingan
 on his forehead, which he could use to reflect the eye onto the moon, allowing him to cast the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 and trap everyone, aside from himself, in an infinite
genjutsu
.

Jinchūriki Transformations

Main article:
Jinchūriki Forms






Madara's final jinchūriki transformation.



After
sealing
 the Ten-Tails into his body, Madara had immediately gained complete control over the beast, which was stronger than when it was first revived due to having all of the Eight-Tails and half of the Nine-Tails' chakra sealed in it, leading to his power being noted to feel stronger than Obito's, which only had a portion of the Eight and Nine-Tails' chakra.
 As such, only shinobi using
all
 of the
Eight Gates
 or the
Six Paths Chakra
 are able to compete with him.
 In
this form
, Madara could fly and his physical abilities were enhanced, being fast enough to react to the
Flying Thunder God Technique
 and
Kamui
,
 and durable enough to survive the
Night Guy
. After absorbing the tree form of the Ten-Tails, his regenerative powers could circumvent bisection and restore his body, causing him to declare himself immortal.
 He could also harness
natural energy
 to enhance his
various

techniques
, as well as cast the Infinite Tsukuyomi and
God: Nativity of a World of Trees
 after he awakened the Rinne Sharingan.






Madara shaping the Truth-Seeking Ball as a defensive barrier.



With his transformation, Madara obtained
Truth-Seeking Balls
 that floated behind him in a circular formation, which were comprised of the five basic nature transformations and Yin–Yang Release.
 Their chakra is highly malleable and versatile, such that he could use them as high speed projectiles,
 protective barriers,
 and various weapons, such as a
shakujō
.
 With Yin–Yang Release, the balls could nullify all ninjutsu they came into contact with.

Intelligence






Madara rescinds the Impure World Reincarnation contract.



Madara's years of experience on the battlefield honed his strategic ingenuity. He could quickly devise a number of approaches and could switch approaches immediately. The longer he spent against a particular opponent, the less he needed backup tactics, as he could eventually predict what they would do and identify literal or psychological weaknesses to exploit. He could form and verify any theories he comes up with using small details.
 In addition to his sheer adaptability, Madara was knowledgeable on a large variety of individuals and abilities, and thus could identify techniques when used and react with the most appropriate counter to them. Likewise, Madara was an excellent teacher, having single-handedly trained the young Obito into a powerful shinobi comparable to himself.

A researcher, he experimented on and cultivated a
clone flower
 through the Demonic Statue of Outer Path, and from it, he created a life-support system for himself.
 He had enough medical knowledge to transplant eyes, treat severe injuries, and could replace destroyed body parts with White Zetsu matter.

 approaches Tobi to try and form an alliance. When Tobi asks what will happen if he refuses, Kabuto
resurrects
 Madara to show he knows that Tobi is not the true Madara and forces him to accept.
 Tobi reluctantly agrees and Kabuto de-summons Madara.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax






Madara arrives on the battlefield with Mū.



During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kabuto decides to use Madara against the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 and uses
Mū
 as a medium to summon him to the battlefield. When he first becomes aware of his surroundings, Madara believes he has been brought back by
Nagato
's
Outer Path — Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
 but soon realises that he instead has been brought back with the Impure World Reincarnation. Kabuto speaks through Mū, introduces himself, and explains recent developments in the world and Tobi's current actions. After Kabuto points out that he has restored Madara to a state beyond his prime, Madara tests his body by tearing through the
Fourth Division
, thinning its numbers. The Fourth Division's initial attempts to stop Madara fail as he protects himself with
Susanoo
. When the
Fifth Kazekage
,
Third Tsuchikage
, and one of
Naruto Uzumaki
's
shadow clones
 combine efforts, Madara is forced to activate his
Rinnegan
 and
absorb
 the attack.






Madara battles the Fourth Division.



Realising his enemies were too dangerous for him to hold back to basic ninjutsu and taijutsu, Madara pulls down a
meteorite
 from the atmosphere. When the Kazekage and Tsuchikage successfully
stop it
, Madara adds a second meteorite to his attack, both of which fall upon and devastate the Fourth Division. With most of the Fourth Division dead, Madara questions Kabuto about just how far off-plan Tobi has gone. Because Kabuto doesn't actually know much about the plan, Madara is left to check things for himself and tries to summon the
Nine-Tails
, only to discover it's sealed in a
jinchūriki
, specifically Naruto. Despite knowing the current Naruto was a clone, he decided to delay his plans to test out his new powers, namely, the
Wood Release: Nativity of Trees
 which Naruto's clone barely countered. He then moves in to finish off the remainder of the Fourth Division but is repelled by the arrival of the
Fifth Hokage
, the
Fifth Mizukage
, and the
Fourth Raikage
. The five
Kage
 combine forces against Madara and propel him from the immediate area.






Madara overwhelms the Kage.



By the time he returns, Naruto's shadow clone is gone and the five Kage remain his only opponents. They battle for some time, with Madara equaling and besting the Kage's efforts. When he is hit with the Tsuchikage's
Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique
, Madara's armour is torn away, revealing the implant of
Hashirama
's face on his chest. Madara laments Hashirama's legacy that these Kage have inherited, having been completely unimpressed by their attacks, particularly those of the Hokage, Hashirama's granddaughter. Madara then
creates twenty-five copies of himself
 and has them each activate their Susanoo.






Madara's soul remains intact.



By nightfall, the Kage are still alive and are able to pool their efforts so successfully that he is nearly sealed. Finally impressed by their display, Madara responds by summoning his perfected Susanoo. Before he can use it to kill the Kage, his Susanoo starts to fade and Madara is engulfed in light. Madara realises that Kabuto has elsewhere released him from the Impure World Reincarnation and his soul is returning to the afterlife. Madara responds by performing the hand seals to rescind the Impure World Reincarnation contract that Kabuto has over him, enabling him to return to his immortal body without further interference from a summoner. Now able to do whatever he likes and bored with the Kage, Madara decides to go find Naruto and reclaim the Nine-Tails. The Kage try to block his escape.






Madara reunites with Obito.



After defeating the five Kage, Madara finds and reunites with Obito while he's engaged in combat with Naruto,
Killer B
,
Kakashi Hatake
, and
Might Guy
. Madara notices the
Demonic Statue
 undergoing a premature transformation into the
Ten-Tails
 and scolds Obito for being too hasty. After Obito returns Madara's
gunbai
, Madara creates a
wood dragon
 in an attempt to capture Naruto and Killer B and complete the Ten-Tails. He at one point manages to restrain and drain B of his energy but is overwhelmed by Guy's
Daytime Tiger
. The Ten-Tails is revived before he can recover, forcing Madara to make do. He and Obito leap onto the Ten-Tails' head and connect themselves to it, granting them control of its actions. Their four opponents put up a resistance but are no match for the Ten-Tails' power. Before the Ten-Tails can finish them off, however, the combined Allied Shinobi Forces arrive to join the fight, with Ino managing to control Obito into redirecting the Ten-Tails' attack.






Madara and Obito link with the Ten-Tails using Hashirama's DNA.



The Allies are able to immobilise the Ten-Tails, making it an easy target. The Ten-Tails undergoes a new transformation before their attacks can connect, freeing it and letting it block the incoming attacks. Though the immediate problem is solved, Madara realises there's another issue: the Allies are being coordinated too effectively. He and Obito direct the Ten-Tails to attack the distant Allied HQ, something that takes several
Tailed Beast Balls
 due to their lack of control, which Madara attributes to Obito's failure to revive him correctly. Although the Allies' "
brain
" is killed, the Allies are given one final battle plan in the time it takes the Ten-Tails to hit its target. Obito and Madara try to thin the Allies' numbers before they can get into position and, when that fails, block against the oncoming attack, but the combined forces manage to break through and separate Obito and Madara from the Ten-Tails. With the Ten-Tails now out of their control they must fight the Alliance directly. Obito eventually disappears to the
other dimension
, forcing Madara to fend for himself.






Madara refuses to fight Hashirama's wood clone.



During Obito's absence, Madara senses that Hashirama has elsewhere been brought back to life. Excited at the prospect of fighting his rival again, Madara eagerly awaits his arrival. When he arrives, Hashirama sends only a wood clone to face him, being too busy restraining the Ten-Tails. Madara decides to sit out the fight until the real Hashirama is ready. When the wood clone persists, Madara easily defeats it. Madara later senses Obito's return to the battlefield and decides to make use of one of his fail-safes, activating
black receivers
 planted in Obito to force him to finally revive Madara. Obito resists and instead seals the Ten-Tails into himself.

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki






Madara fighting Hashirama.



Though he's frustrated by this setback, Hashirama is no longer preoccupied, so Madara forces him into a fight for two reasons: his simple desire to fight his rival once again and he also plans to oppose Obito and take his place as the caster of the Infinite Tsukuyomi. To accomplish the latter however, Madara needs senjutsu chakra, which Hashirama has. As their battle rages, Hashirama tries to convince Madara to postpone, but Madara repeatedly refuses. Nevertheless, he keeps track of Obito's progress and growing control of the Ten-Tails' power. After Obito's defeat, Madara is restrained by Hashirama's wood dragons and the Alliance moves in to seal him.






Madara is properly revived.



With Obito no longer the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, Madara puts another fail-safe into effect:
Black Zetsu
. Having been in contact with it since his initial reincarnation, Madara orders Black Zetsu to take control of Obito's body and use the
Outer Path — Samsara of Heavenly Life Technique
. Restored to life, Madara is able to regain his past strength, to which he breaks free of his restraints. Having died with his real eyes intact and removed from his body, Madara's reincarnated eyes crumble to nothing. Sasuke attempts to burn Madara with Amaterasu while Naruto reminds Sasuke that Madara can absorb ninjutsu. Madara however, had to discard his armour that was burnt by the flames. To compensate for his blindness, he immobilises Hashirama with black receivers and absorbs his
senjutsu
 chakra, enhancing his
sensory skills
 enough to perceive his enemies and their attacks without the need of sight. He is once again attacked by Sasuke, but instructs Sasuke to stay out of his way since he does not want to kill his own clansman.






Madara impales Sasuke.



Madara goes after the freed tailed beasts so that he can revive the Ten-Tails once more. He attempts to take on all nine at once, failing and losing his right arm in the process. While he regroups, a
White Zetsu clone
 brings him one of his Rinnegan that Obito kept in storage. Madara takes this and one of the Zetsu's arms, allowing him start round two. He summons the Demonic Statue from Obito's body and uses
Limbo: Border Jail
 to repel the nine beasts. Before they can recover, he seals all of them into the Demonic Statue, including those sealed in Naruto and B. While the Statue undergoes its transformation into the Ten-Tails again, Madara asks the Zetsu clone how Black Zetsu is faring with taking his remaining Rinnegan back from Obito.
Tobirama Senju
, having been reincarnated alongside Hashirama, attacks Madara immediately afterwards, but is restrained after failing to deal any damage. Sasuke also attacks Madara but is immobilised in midair. Having already warned Sasuke once, Madara turns Sasuke's own sword against him and stabs him in the chest.






A reformed Obito steals a portion of Madara's tailed beast chakra.



With nobody left to oppose him, Madara seals the Ten-Tails into himself once its resurrection is complete. Pleased with himself, Madara sets off to regain his other Rinnegan. Along the way he spits out the
Benihisago
 and
Kohaku no Jōhei
, Obito having used both as part of his premature revival method. When he arrives at Black Zetsu's location, he discovers that Obito has regained control of his body. Madara tries to reason with Obito, reminding him of all they planned and insisting on the impending effectiveness of the Eye of the Moon Plan. Rather than be convinced, Obito stabs Madara and manages to steal fragments of the One-Tail's and Eight-Tails' chakra from him before using
Kamui
 to escape with Naruto.






Madara battling Guy.



While Madara contemplates his next move, he is confronted by Might Guy, a master of
taijutsu
, which is one of the only effective attacks against Madara in his new form. Guy opens
all

Eight Gates
 and hits Madara with the
Evening Elephant
. Madara is taken by surprise and tries to defend himself, but other Allied Shinobi are able to reduce him to a single
Truth-Seeking Ball
, leaving him wide open. Madara is thrilled at the prospect of such a challenging fight, and visibly battered but not beaten, forcing Guy to use
Night Guy
. Madara is nearly killed by the attack, which obliterates the entire left side of his body. Thanking Guy for giving him such an entertaining battle, and acknowledging him as a worthy opponent, Madara decides to show him the ultimate respect by killing him instead of letting him succumb to his injuries. However, the Truth-Seeking Ball that Madara launches at Guy is kicked back at him by a revived Naruto, whom Madara notes has somehow gained power similar to his own.






Madara battling Naruto and Sasuke.



Naruto sends Madara crashing through the recreation of the Ten-Tails in its giant tree form, a remnant of Obito's earlier battle. A voice speaks to Madara, telling him to absorb it. Madara does so and becomes stronger, but is met with a new problem: Sasuke, also healed from his injuries, has joined forces with Naruto and is also in possession of new abilities. Despite Madara's efforts, he can do nothing against them. Knowing he needs his other Rinnegan if he's to end the fight, Madara steals Kakashi Hatake's
Mangekyō Sharingan
 and uses it to go after Obito. He stops
Sakura Haruno
 from destroying the Rinnegan, to which Obito responds by sending her back to the real world before Madara can kill her. However, Obito himself is too weak to fight back.






Madara activates the Infinite Tsukuyomi.



To give Obito some final words, Madara first congratulates him for removing the
Forbidden Individual Curse Tag
 he had placed on him. He also reveals his role in the death of
Rin Nohara
, in doing so admitting that he's been manipulating Obito from the start. With that, Madara takes back his Rinnegan, returning to Obito his left Mangekyō Sharingan. Black Zetsu uses Obito's body to perform Kamui and return them to the real world. Naruto and Sasuke move to attack him as soon as Madara appears, so Madara delays them with multiple
Chibaku Tensei
. Madara gains proximity to the moon, awakening the
Rinne Sharingan
 in the process, and succeeds in casting the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
.

Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes

Main article:
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki Strikes






Madara begins to inflate with chakra.



The entire world is trapped in a dream and then wrapped into Madara's
God: Nativity of a World of Trees
. Sasuke is able to save Naruto, Kakashi, and Sakura from the Infinite Tsukuyomi. Seeing them, Madara announces himself the world's saviour, one who has saved the world from itself by replacing the hells of reality with the heavens of dreams. While he is proclaiming his victory, Black Zetsu stabs him in the back. Black Zetsu reveals that it is not Madara's will, but
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
's, and that he has taken advantage of him in order to bring about her revival. Black Zetsu transfers from Obito's body to Madara's, completely covering him and forcing him to start absorbing the chakra of those trapped in the Infinite Tsukuyomi. After dramatically increasing in size, Madara shrinks down until a revived Kaguya is revealed in his stead.






Madara speaks to Hashirama for the last time.



Naruto and Sasuke eventually
seal
 Kaguya in her
own dimension
, along with Black Zetsu, at which point she reverts into the Ten-Tails and spits out Madara. The
Sage of the Six Paths
 summons Madara and everyone else back to the real world, but he can do nothing to save Madara from his approaching death as a result of having both the tailed beasts and Demonic Statue removed from his body. Madara uses his remaining time speaking to Hashirama, noting that his own dream for peace has died while Hashirama's lives on, and therefore was apparently the better of the two. Hashirama replies that they are still friends despite everything, to which Madara agrees as he dies.

Legacy

After his second death, Madara's greatest lasting influence was in Obito's actions, who used Madara's knowledge to create
Akatsuki
. Several years later, when Obito began operating under Madara's name, the mere possibility that he was truly Madara was enough to unify the ninja of the
Five Great Shinobi Countries
 and trigger the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

Madara's actions during life, and even those subsequent actions of Obito, would end up having disastrous effects for the Uchiha clan. Following Madara's betrayal of Konoha, the Uchiha were entirely isolated from any form of control over Konoha's future, chiefly because of the actions of
Tobirama Senju
. His actions also played a role in Tobirama's growth, who believed that to be Hokage, one must balance between Hashirama's compassion and Madara's ruthlessness. At the time, some Uchiha members saw this as proof of what Madara always feared, but the fears subsided with time. Years later, when Obito causes the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
, Konoha once again becomes suspicious of the Uchiha and the Uchiha once again feel wronged. This time, however, their discontent does not subside. When the Uchiha began planning to overthrow Konoha, the upper echelons of Konoha's government ordered the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
.

One silver lining of Madara's legacy is the name of Konohagakure, which he himself came up with.

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Madara Uchiha

Madarao is the name of one of the
Five Mountains
 of Northern Shinshu, the other's being mount Iizuna, mount Kurohime, mount Togakushi, and mount Myoko.

Madara's name, written in katakana, means "pacific cod".

Even though not used for his name, "Madara" (
斑
) can be translated as "spots" or "speckles" if written in kanji.

Studio Pierrot's Settei sheets of Madara show that he was 143.5cm when he met Hashirama.

According to the databook(s):

Madara's hobby was
falconry
.

Madara's favourite food was
inarizushi
, while his least favourite food was
roe
, as well as
shirako
 (milt) specifically derived from
cod
 fish.

Madara wished to fight the upper class Konoha ninja.

Madara's favourite phrase was "Armour-sleeved single hit" (
鎧袖一触
,
Gaishū Isshoku
), which refers to defeating someone with a single blow.

Despite Madara being a user of the Six Paths Senjutsu and using
various
 senjutsu
techniques
, he is not listed as a user of senjutsu in the fourth databook.

Despite Hashirama's blood type being type B, and Madara's blood type being type O, Madara was able to transplant Hashirama's DNA onto himself despite type B not being able to give blood to type O due to incompatibility. This is the same case with Obito, whose blood type is also type O.

Quotes

(To
Ōnoki
 and
Mū
) "
There is no alliance. From here on, you will obey Konoha! And never, ever say
that shinobi
's name around me!
"

(To
Tsunade
) "
You are just a weak woman... Weak people are ugly, and weak
Senju
 are even more ugly.
"

(To
Hashirama
) "
While I walk towards my real dream, I'll enjoy fighting you.
"

(To
Kurama
) "
Nine-Tails, you are merely a momentary life, a temporary existence of coalesced energy… energy that once was a single, ultimate form! An unstable force, lacking in intelligence or sapience, you require a guide to show you purpose. That guide is the Uchiha! The tailed beasts are but slaves to those with blessed eyes. Obey!
"

(To
Obito
) "
This world is full of things that don't go as you wish. The longer you live the more you realise reality is just made of pain, suffering, and emptiness… Listen… In this world, whenever there is light, there are also shadows. As long as the concept of winners exist, there must also be losers. The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars and hatred is born to protect love.
"

(To Obito before dying for the second time) "
Go… until the time… I revive… you are Madara Uchiha.
"

(To
Tobirama
) "
Hashirama's country was a shameful contradiction… Man seeks peace, yet at the same time yearning for war… Those are the two realms belonging solely to man. Thinking of peace whilst spilling blood is something only humans can do. They're two sides of the same coin. To protect something… another must be sacrificed. That is, other than that of, say a dream world.
"

(To Obito) "
I taught you that in order to control people, you need to use the darkness in their hearts. And if there's no darkness, then you just create it… […] From the bottom of your heart, you felt kindness and sympathy for others. […] Your deep feelings… …for Rin… …your comrades… …the Hokage and the shinobi… All you needed to do was to fall once, and all that would turn around into deep hatred for the world.
"

(To
Naruto
) "
I just stopped the fate of this world. I freed people from pain, suffering, emptiness. […] Naruto… You're getting in the way of everyone's happiness. Our game ends here. I turned hell into heaven. You should understand… It's already over.
"

(Last words to Hashirama) "
As comrades, huh… Well… if that's how… we… will…
"
