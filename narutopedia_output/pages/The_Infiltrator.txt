"
The Infiltrator
" (
潜入者
,
Sennyūsha
) is episode 217 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

After
Sakura
 administers the antidote to
Naruto
, the team returns to the
Land of Iron
 to retrieve
Lee
,
Kiba
, and
Sai
. The latter reveals that he's awake unlike the others and feels unease; sticking out his tongue, he and Sakura realise that his
Cursed Tongue Eradication Seal
 is gone. Sai wonders whether it means that
Danzō
 is dead, and
Karin
 notifies them that
Sasuke
 killed him. As they begin their walk back home, Naruto argues with Kiba, Sai, and Lee, and Karin perceives Naruto as the complete opposite of Sasuke, noting that his
chakra
 makes her feel warm and comfortable. However, she senses the presence of
another chakra
, a more ominous one, that lies deep within him, terrifying her.

Back in
Konoha
,
Homura
 and
Koharu
 receive word from
Shikaku
 that the
Root
 members are agitated. Three of them decide to seek out Sai, running into him as the others make their way back from the Land of Iron. Sai confirms that Danzō has been killed, and asks to discuss the future of Root with the new
Hokage
 —
Kakashi Hatake
, much to the surprise of Lee, Sakura, and Kiba.

The
Fourth Raikage
,
Killer B
,
C
, and
Darui
 return to
Kumogakure
.
Karui
 and
Omoi
 shed tears of joy to see their master Killer B alive and notice the blade he is carrying. Killer B tells them that the
Samehada
 is a trophy of war he claimed from a battle, unaware that
Kisame
 is stored within the blade. It is revealed that after Kisame had knocked B out,
White Zetsu
 used a
parasite clone
 to swap places with Kisame; while the real Kisame hid inside the Samehada blade, the clone was the one
decapitated
 by A and B. The entire plan was conceived by
Tobi
 in order to have Kisame infiltrate Kumo and gain intelligence on their responsive actions to the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

The
Raikage
 holds an audience with the
Lightning Daimyō
, gaining the approval for Kumo to officially join and lead the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. As he leaves the meeting, he notices Killer B holding a concert on a rooftop, and
drop kicks
 him to the ground as a result.

Trivia
