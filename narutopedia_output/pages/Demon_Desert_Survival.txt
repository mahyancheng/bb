"
Demon Desert Survival
" (
魔の砂漠のサバイバル
,
Ma no Sabaku no Sabaibaru
) is episode 399 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Ahead of entering the
Demon Desert
,
Shira
 vows to repay
Gaara
 and live up to his expectations by making sure all of the
Suna
 teams pass, while
Team Guy
 comes up with a strategy to counter their opponents. As the
genin
 deploy into the Demon Desert upon the signal,
Asuma
 and
Kurenai
 question Sunagakure's approach of forbidding them to enter the desert.
Guy
 receives a message from
Tsunade
 to protect the
Kazekage
 upon receiving intelligence that his assassins are on the move.
 Within the desert,
Neji
 is puzzled upon failing to detect the other teams before realising that they have been caught under a
genjutsu
. After breaking free from the genjutsu, Neji
detects
 a Suna team up ahead, and engages in battle with them. However,
Team Shira
 arrives to buy enough time for
Team Goji
 to escape. Giving their opponents no time to relent,
Sen
 entraps Team Guy in a genjutsu once again, as Neji's plans backfire. Meanwhile, Team Shira rendezvous with two of the Suna teams and instructs them to retrieve a
scroll
 from the other teams. Ultimately, Shira and his team-mates are betrayed, and find themselves cornered, but Team Guy arrives to their rescue. Questioning Team Shira's motives, Sen reveals to Team Guy that Shira had only recently become a shinobi. Seemingly confused as to why someone of his calibre had only become a shinobi,
Lee
 comes to the conclusion that he and Shira are in many ways alike — due to the fact that both the two men have no talent in
ninjutsu
 and genjutsu.
