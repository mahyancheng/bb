Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Although
Sakura
 has said she will help him find
Sasuke
,
Naruto
 is unwilling to wait for her and wants to try again as soon as he is better.
Jiraiya
 visits him and offers to train him since
Akatsuki
 won't be coming after him for another three years. Naruto declines, saying he needs to take Sasuke back from
Orochimaru
. Jiraiya tells him that Orochimaru won't be able to take Sasuke's body for another three years. He also suggests giving up on Sasuke, having previous experience with his own futile attempts to persuade Orochimaru to change his ways. Only a fool, he claims, would pass up years of training to save someone who doesn't want saving. Naruto says he would rather be a fool. Happy with this answer, Jiraiya leaves, telling Naruto that they will leave for his training as soon as he gets out of the hospital.
