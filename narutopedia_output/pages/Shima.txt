Shima
 (
シマ
), admired as the
Mother of the Toad Way
 (
蝦蟇道の母
,
Gamadō no Haha
), is an elder toad from
Mount Myōboku
. As the heirs of the
Great Toad Sage
, she and her husband
Fukasaku
 are known collectively as the "
Two Great Sage Toads
" (
二大仙蝦蟇
,
Nidaisengama
).

Background

Shima was present when the
Great Toad Sage
 called for
Jiraiya
 to tell him about his prophecy.

Personality

Shima is considered open-hearted and her personality allows her to see everything with great clarity. Because of this, she is adored by all toads as the "Mother of the Toad Way".
 She is greatly respected because of her old age and wisdom, but she still manages to bicker with her husband over small things like missing dinner.
 Despite this constant bickering, she loves Fukasaku very much, calling him "Dad" (
父ちゃん
,
Tō-chan
) as is common among Japanese wives. She was devastated when she saw Fukasaku get killed by
Pain
. Like her husband she also tends to call the Great Toad Sage "senile" due to his forgetfulness.

Shima seemed to have been fond of Jiraiya and similarly was very welcoming to his pupil, Naruto, when he first went to Mount Myōboku to train, 'pulling out all the stops' at her and Fukasaku's home. During the Battle of Konoha, after Pain had stabbed Fukasaku and pinned Naruto to the ground through his hands, Shima called to Naruto not to give up since both Jiraiya and Fukasaku had given their lives because they believed in Naruto, and, if he gave up then, she'd never forgive him.

Appearance

Shima has a green underside with purple marking around her mouth and the back of her body. The top of her head looks as though she is wearing a hair net with hair-rollers underneath, giving her an 'old woman' look. She has been seen wearing two types of capes: a high-collared one and a simpler one.

Abilities






Shima using the Fighting Tongue Bind.



Shima is known for her keen analysis of the situations and circumstances of the battles she participates in. She can quickly figure out the best plan and will turn into the control centre that will make sure that plan is executed. She also has excellent sensing skill,
 apparently because of her tongue, which allow her to
detect and apprehend
 her enemy with ease. The warts on her tongue can release a highly corrosive mucus.

She has been shown to possess a very large amount of chakra, evidenced by her ability to enter
Sage Mode
. She was even able to bring forth
Gamabunta
,
Gamahiro
,
Gamaken
,
Fukasaku
,
Gamakichi
 and
Naruto Uzumaki
 with a single
summoning technique
.

Ninjutsu

Nature Transformation

Shima can utilise
Fire
 and
Wind Release
. Her most prominent role with her Fire Release was joining Fukasaku and Jiraiya in a strong collaboration assault.
 Her abilities of ninjutsu is so great that she even combines her wind-based chakra with senjutsu chakra for a more lethal attack.

Genjutsu

Of special note are her
genjutsu
 skills. Together with her husband she can perform the
Demonic Illusion: Toad Confrontation Chant
, a feat only possible because of the harmony the husband and wife developed after centuries of marriage.

Senjutsu

Her greatest weapon is her mastery of
senjutsu
. She uses this to increase the power and range of her attacks and to push her body to the limits, for instance extending her tongue until it's more than ten metres long.

Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant






Jiraiya summons Shima and Fukasaku to the battlefield.



Jiraiya summoned Shima and Fukasaku during his fight with Pain to help him enter
Sage Mode
. In addition to sitting on his shoulders to provide him with natural energy, they gave him advice, and attacked Pain when necessary. Their combined efforts were enough to combat three of Pain's bodies on equal terms. Shima and Fukasaku then created a
genjutsu
 that allowed them to kill the three bodies, but they were soon overwhelmed by the appearance of three more.

Knowing the battle was lost, Jiraiya had Shima take the
Animal Path
 he had captured back to
Konoha
 while he and Fukasaku made one final investigation.

Pain's Assault

Main article:
Pain's Assault






Shima and Fukasaku attack Pain's summons.



While Naruto learns senjutsu from Fukasaku, Shima happily provides him with meals (unaware that her choice of food makes him sick). While restocking her supplies near Konoha, Shima noticed that something was wrong in the village. She summoned Naruto, Fukasaku,
Gamaken
,
Gamabunta
,
Gamakichi
, and
Gamahiro
 to Konoha's centre moments after Pain destroyed the village. As Naruto engaged Pain, Shima and Fukasaku provided assistance, dealing with the
Animal Path
's summons. They were amazed by his perfected
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
, something he had not shown them during his training, but were again forced to deal with the Animal Path.






Shima creates a cloud of dust.



Knowing that the Animal Path must be got rid of, Shima coated the area in a dust cloud while Fukasaku threw Gamabunta at the path, giving Naruto an opportunity to finish it off. Pain was soon left with only one body, and Shima and Fukasaku tried once again to use a genjutsu to defeat it. Pain killed Fukasaku and knocked Shima away before they had a chance. Their bodies were later found and Shima, once healed, wept for Fukasaku. When Pain was defeated, and subsequently chose to revive everyone he had killed, Fukasaku was brought back to life, much to Shima's shock and surprise. Later, Shima and Fukasaku were both seen together, standing atop
Gamakichi
's head and watching from a distance as the population of Konoha welcomed Naruto back.

Trivia






An early design of Jiraiya, with toads riding on his shoulders.



Shima's name might come from the Japanese actress
Shima Iwashita
.
 Additionally, the city of
Hiroshima
, which is where the
Battles Without Honour and Humanity
 (
仁義なき戦い
,
Jingi Naki Tatakai
) series of films play and where
Gamabunta
's dialect comes from. Hiroshima is strongly connected to the Yakuza, if only through films.

Masashi Kishimoto
 had several different designs for the Jiraiya character. In one such design, Jiraiya would change into an ugly but powerful form during moments of passion, such as anger or when seeing a beautiful woman. This version of Jiraiya had a married toad couple riding on his shoulders, who would periodically tell jokes. Kishimoto abandoned the idea because it was too complicated.

Naruto addresses her as "Granny Sage" (
仙人ばあちゃん
,
Sennin Bāchan
).
