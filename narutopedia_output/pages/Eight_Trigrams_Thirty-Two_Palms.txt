The
Eight Trigrams Thirty-Two Palms
 is a manoeuvre of the
Gentle Fist
 fighting style. It is essentially a halved version of the
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
, but seems to be no less effective. This technique is used to close off the flow of chakra through thirty-two
chakra points
 of an opponent's
chakra pathway system
. This eliminates their ability to use
chakra
 for quite some time and makes it difficult for them to move.

Once someone is within range of her field of divination, Hinata assumes her Gentle Fist stance and begins to deliver her attack:

First, two consecutive strikes to make two.

Second, another two consecutive strikes to make four.

Third, four consecutive strikes to make eight.

Fourth, eight consecutive strikes to make sixteen.

Fifth, another sixteen consecutive strikes in succession to make a total of thirty-two.
