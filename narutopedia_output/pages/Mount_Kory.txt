A far glimpse of Mount Koryū.



Mount Koryū
 (
古流山
,
Koryūzan
,
literally meaning:
 Ancient Flow Mountain) is the main location appearing in the
Naruto Shippūden: Dragon Blade Chronicles
. It's formed into four elemental areas. There is a ritual temple in the middle of the mountain. The area in and around Mount Koryū interferes with normal
chakra
 usage. Because of this, outfits were specifically made to counter this effect.
