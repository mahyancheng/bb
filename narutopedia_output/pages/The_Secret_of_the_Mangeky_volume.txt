 attacks, not giving him the chance to figure out who is who. Meanwhile,

Chapter 381

"
The True Identity…!!
" (
その正体…!!
,
Sono Shōtai…!!
)

Jiraiya
, despite having suffered many severe injuries, managed to capture
one
 of the
Six Paths of Pain
. He tried to figure out why none of the six resembled
Nagato
, but reaffirmed that
one
 resembled
Yahiko
 and all had the
Rinnegan
. He considered if Yahiko had taken Nagato's Rinnegan but put this theory to side as all six Pains had the Rinnegan. In addition, Jiraiya remembered a conversation he once had with Nagato. As the Pain in front of him's forehead protector slipped off, Jiraiya saw the scar on his forehead and recognised him as a ninja he had faced in the past. Knowing for a fact that this wasn't Nagato, Jiraiya decided to test a hunch rather than return to
Konoha
. He asked the
Two Great Sage Toads
 to go home, but they refused at first however, he managed to convince
Shima
 to take the Pain he captured to Konoha for study. Jiraiya and
Fukasaku
 left the
barrier
 and went up to face the remaining Pains. Jiraiya upon observing them all closely confirmed that he had met all of them before. He had managed to figure out the secret of Pain however, he was soon surrounded and his throat was crushed.

Chapter 382

The Real Choice!!
" (
本当の選択!!

Hontō no Sentaku!!

Although he figures out who
Pain
 is,
Jiraiya
 can neither speak nor move. His life begins to fade and he reflects on the many failures of his life; his inability to protect the
Third Hokage
 or
Fourth Hokage
; his inability to save
Orochimaru
; his inability to win the heart of
Tsunade
; and, most sadly for him, his inability to die with honour. He then remembers how
Naruto
 was named after the protagonist of his
first book
, making him Naruto's godfather. Since Naruto's
nindō
 is to never give up, Jiraiya, as Naruto's teacher, decides that that should be his nindō too. He finds the energy to relay a message to
Fukasaku
, confident that Naruto will save the world.

Chapter 385

"
The Secret of the Mangekyō…!!
" (
万華鏡の秘密…!!
,
Mangekyō no Himitsu…!!
)

Knowing that not even
Itachi
 could kill the entire
Uchiha clan
 by himself,
Sasuke
 asks who helped him kill their family, planning to kill them too after he is done with Itachi. Itachi doubts that he could do this, but he gives Sasuke the name of
Madara Uchiha
. A founder of
Konoha
, Sasuke asks how Madara could still be alive after so many decades. Itachi reminds him not to be deceived by such facts, having once believed Itachi to be a loving older brother. Angered that he is being patronised with
genjutsu
, Sasuke demands that the real Itachi face him. Itachi responds that, since Sasuke doesn't have a
Mangekyō Sharingan
, there is no reason why he should do so, but agrees to tell him about Madara anyway.

Chapter 386

"
New Light…!!
" (
新たな光…!!
,
Aratana Hikari…!!
)

In the time before
Konoha
's founding,
Madara
 was a promising member of the
Uchiha clan
. Through constant competition with his
younger brother
 Madara gained the
Mangekyō Sharingan
 and was able to take control of the Uchiha, leading them into countless victories. However, excessive use of the Mangekyō Sharingan left Madara blind, and it was only by taking his brother's eyes that he regained his sight. Madara went on to assist in the creation of Konoha, but later suffered a defeat by the
First Hokage
. He created
Akatsuki
 to hide in its shadow and later tried and failed to destroy Konoha with the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox
 sixteen years ago, which
Itachi
 uses as proof that Madara has grown weak. Intending to surpass Madara, Itachi will take Sasuke's eyes to escape blindness of the Mangekyō. Having heard all he needed, Sasuke prepares for battle.

 insists that
Sasuke
, with a normal
Sharingan
, cannot defeat his

Zetsu
 remarks at how amazing it is for Sasuke to overcome Itachi's
Tsukuyomi
. Having lost a battle of
genjutsu
, Itachi prepares to use a

:
