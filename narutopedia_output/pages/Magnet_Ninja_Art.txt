This technique enables Jiga to magnetise anything he touches, thus fully manipulating objects at his discretion and allowing him a variety of attacks against his enemies, in areas with large quantities of iron ore, Jiga was even able to change direction in mid-air aswell as float momentarily. Jiga claims to be able to do this because of the great amount of iron he ingests. He can activate or deactivate his own body's magnetism, ensuring that he is not affected by his technique. The potential risk of his technique is exploited when
Hinata Hyūga
 introduces an interfering electric current into his
chakra
, causing he himself to become a powerful magnet. In this state, he attracts a large quantity of iron sand to himself, and is forced into a vortex of sand and killed.

Trivia

Though similar to
Magnet Release
, Jiga actually gained this ability through ingesting iron when he was younger and as such is not a
kekkei genkai
 but an unorthodox bodily adaptation.
