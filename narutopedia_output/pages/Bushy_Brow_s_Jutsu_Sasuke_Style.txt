"
Bushy Brow's Jutsu: Sasuke Style!
" (
嵐を呼ぶ男!!サスケのゲジマユ流体術!
,
Arashi o Yobu Otoko!! Sasuke no Gejimayu-ryū Taijutsu!
) is episode 66 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

As the fight between
Sasuke
 and
Gaara
 commences,
Kakashi
 apologises to
Sakura
 for worrying her by being late. He then remarks to
Guy
 about the
Anbu
 presence in the stadium,
Konoha
 not knowing when they will be attacked.
Naruto
 realises how dangerous Gaara is and the only person who can currently satisfy his blood-lust is Sasuke. At the same moment, Sasuke begins attacking Gaara fast enough to bypass his
Shield of Sand
, oddly reminiscent of
Lee
's fighting style.

Kakashi explains that, having seen Lee’s taijutsu before with his
Sharingan
, they had been training this last month to produce the same speed. Lee knows from prior experience that speed is not enough to defeat Gaara, but Guy recognises it must serve some other purpose. After continuously being pummelled by Sasuke, Gaara retreats into a
Shield of Sand
 shaped into a sphere to give himself time to transform. Sasuke is unable to break through this defence with speed alone, and Naruto and Shikamaru both reflect on how Gaara thinks his point is to kill others. They decide that if the match continues, Sasuke will die, and rush upstairs to tell Kakashi. He tells them not to worry, promising there was a good reason for why they were late.
