Confession
" (
告白
,
Kokuhaku
) is episode 166 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Team Guy
, who were out on a mission, make their way back to
Konoha
 when
Neji
 spots the wounded
Gamabunta
, recognising the toad as
Jiraiya
's personal
summon
. In the village,
Hinata
 is able to spot the pinned
Naruto
 with her
Byakugan
 and recalls memories of first encountering Naruto when she was younger. Her guardian,
Kō
, had told her to stay away from him as she heard the villagers gossip about the
Nine-Tails
. However, after a group of thugs pushed her around, Naruto came to her defence. Remembering how Naruto had protected her, Hinata leaps into the battlefield in order to protect Naruto for once.

Naruto asks why she would enter the fray and attempts to convince her to leave, telling her that this is his battle. Hinata then proceeds to confess her love for Naruto and pulls out one of the
black receivers
 that
Pain
 has embedded inside Naruto. Using his
Shinra Tensei
, Pain's
Deva Path
 pushes Hinata away. Hinata manages to stands up and activates her
Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists
, and proceeds to run towards and engage in combat with Pain, who tracks the movement with his
Rinnegan
 and is able to evade being struck. However, when Nagato begins to cough blood, he loses his concentration for a brief second, allowing Hinata to land a blow. Seeing the dazed Pain, Hinata pulls out another receiver, and is pushed even further away, this time through the air.

As Hinata lands across the crater, she begins to bleed from her head. Naruto cries out for her safety, as Hinata crawls her way back towards Naruto, remembering how Naruto
cheered
 for her during her
battle with Neji
, and how he had
told her
 that he liked people like her. As she makes her way to Naruto, Pain asks her why she would attempt to fight him or try to save Naruto if she knew she would die as a result, and Hinata claims that she would never give up, as it is her
nindo
, stunning Naruto. Pain then uses his Shinra Tensei to send Hinata upwards through the air and
pulls
 her back down. As her falling impact cracks the ground, he proceeds to take his blade and stabs her, seemingly killing Hinata. As Naruto sees the blood seeping out of her, Pain merely remarks that this is the same way his parents died, being murdered by
shinobi
 from Konoha. Enraged at Pain's callous murder of Hinata, Naruto unleashes the power of the Nine-Tailed Fox and enters into his
Version 2
 form.

Trivia

This episode heavily expands the scene from the manga. In the manga, Hinata only initiated the Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists technique, but Pain stopped her from using her technique while she was running towards him. In the anime, she battles him for quite some time: as a result, the extended battle demonstrates that the Six Paths of Pain are effectively dolls who become completely vulnerable if the caster is distracted for any reason. She also made no attempt to remove the black receivers in the manga unlike in the anime, instead choosing a more direct approach in opting to try and force Pain away from the pinned Naruto and buy him some time.

Hinata's memories in this episode bear a strong resemblance to the first scene in
The Last: Naruto the Movie
, similarly featuring bullies picking on her in the middle of the woods, near Naruto's swing, who attempts to defend her only to get beat up in response. Similarly, while The Last is meant to follow the timeline of the manga rather than the anime, Hinata's confession as recounted in the movie is presented the same way as in the anime, rather than the way it was presented in the manga.
