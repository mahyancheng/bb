Homura Mitokado
 (
水戸門ホムラ
,
Mitokado Homura
) is a former member of the dissolved
Team Tobirama
. He and his team-mate
Koharu Utatane
 now serve as members of the
Konoha Council
.

Background

In the anime, shortly after the foundation of the village, he was shown to be part of a class alongside Koharu Utatane and Torifu Akimichi.






Tobirama and his team during the First Shinobi World War.



Ever since childhood, Homura and
Hiruzen Sarutobi
 have been close friends. Under the guidance of the Second Hokage,
Tobirama Senju
, they and their third team-mate, Koharu, have completed numerous missions together. On one mission during the
First Shinobi World War
 as Tobirama's
Escort Unit
, the team had been surrounded by the brutal
Kinkaku Force
. Homura voiced that with their inferior numbers there was no way they could win. He later watched on in shock as Hiruzen, Danzō and ultimately the Second offered himself up as a decoy to allow them to escape.

When Hiruzen became the Third
Hokage
, Homura and Koharu became his councillors. With their years of experience and knowledge and their unending effort to make
Konohagakure
 a better place, they eventually gained similar respect and social status as the Hokage himself. Thanks to his prudence and efficiency, Homura especially has gained the absolute faith of the Konoha shinobi.






Homura and his team-mates during the Nine-Tails' attack on the village.



Many years later, during the
Nine-Tailed Demon Fox's Attack
, Homura was seen fighting alongside his team-mates and many other shinobi, attempting to restrain the beast and drive it out of the village before it could cause any more mayhem and destruction.

Personality

Like Koharu, Homura actions always have the village's best interests at heart. He is more militant than the Hokage he has served under, and as such leans more toward
Danzō
's war hawk ideology sometimes. This became most apparent when he and Koharu supported the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
 and later, when they wanted to restrict
Naruto Uzumaki
's movements. He has a differing opinion on how the village should be run, thus constantly meddles in the decisions of the Fifth Hokage,
Tsunade
, who in turn has grown to dislike him, along with Koharu, for it. He and Koharu seem to believe Tsunade was partly responsible for the damage done to Konoha during
Pain's assault
, despite her desperate attempt to save the village that placed her in a coma.

He is also a very composed individual, even in dire or shocking situations, such as when Tsunade accosts him, never shouting or reacting violently. He also tends to speak in an authoritative manner, offering Tsunade suggestions that come across as decisions to be carried out. Also, because of his great prudence and efficiency while working with the Hokage, the
jōnin
 have absolute faith in him as well.
 Homura also believes that Konoha's funding should be spent on military strength, such as the Anbu, and despite being aware of many children's fragile and damaged mental health caused by the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Hamura sided with
Kido Tsumiki
 about redirecting the funds away from
Sakura Haruno
's clinic.

Appearance






Homura in his youth.



In his old age, Homura is depicted with grey hair, a beard, glasses as well as a constant frown that he's always worn, even in his youth. He also has a strong jaw-line a facial structure he has retained even in his old age. As a member of the
Konoha Council
, he wears similar garbs to those that Hiruzen would when acting in his capacity as Hokage.

As an active shinobi in his youth, he was seen in two different outfits: the first is a simple black outfit with a grey armour protecting the chest, shoulders and outer thighs, arm guards, a dull green scarf, a pouch strapped to his waist with bandages, a kunai holster on his upper right leg, and shinobi sandals during the lifetime of the Second Hokage and a simple black jumpsuit outfit with mesh armour underneath and a gauntlet on his right arm, exactly like the one Hiruzen wears during the Nine-Tails' attack on Konoha. He has at least three giant scrolls (two on his back, and one in front). One common aspect of his costume that hasn't changed (except for during the Nine-Tails' attack on the village), is a poncho like top that he wears over his outfits. They have seemingly got longer over the years.

Years later, during the reign of the Seventh Hokage, Homura aged considerably. He gained deep wrinkles and the top of his head was balding. His beard reached down to his waist and now requires a cane to move about.

Abilities

In
Book of Bright Light
,
Danzō Shimura
 alleges that Homura and Koharu are neither especially skilled nor have they ever done anything noteworthy on the battlefield. He claims they've only lived for so long through a combination of luck and by knowing when to align themselves to more talented allies.

During the Nine-Tails' attack, Homura was seen carrying two giant scrolls on his back and one in front of him. The purpose of these scrolls is unknown.

Search for Tsunade

After the death of the Third, Homura and Koharu finds Jiraiya spying on women bathing, an action which Homura reprimanded him for. They then discussed the situation between Konoha and
Suna
 which
Jiraiya
 said he was fully aware of. Homura then tells Jiraiya the gravity of the situation that Konoha was in with their depleted forces and that under such situations all they could do was prepare for the worst. As Koharu tells Jiraiya that they selected him to become the next Hokage and he declines the post, Homura tells him that it had already been decided as he was the most eligible person for the post. Jiraiya however makes mention of
another candidate
 that was possibly even more qualified than he was. When Jiraiya states that he will go and look for Tsunade, Homura insists that three
Anbu
 accompany him, Jiraiya declines once again and says he only has one person in mind to bring with him:
Naruto Uzumaki
.

The Council and Tsunade meeting with the Suna delegation.



About two years later, in an effort to restore Konoha's reputation, Tsunade proposed to host an early Chūnin Exams in Konoha, hoping to get Sunagakure's approval and assistance as co-sponsors. When meeting with the
Fifth Kazekage
 and the
Three Sand Siblings
,
Kankurō
 quickly realised that Konoha's reputation was not the only reason for this unorthodox proposal. It was explained that with their intel on the Akatsuki suggested that they would be making a move soon, she hoped this improvised exams would lure the enemy out. Ultimately, it was agreed to host the first exam in Konoha and the second exam in Suna, conceding that the Sunagakure's location would make for a better survival exam.

Homura and Koharu meet with Tsunade to discuss Naruto.



After Shizune becomes increasingly uneasy about how liberal Tsunade was with Naruto and the missions he went on that constantly put him at risk of encountering Akatsuki, she speaks to Homura and Koharu, who in turn, hold a meeting with Tsunade. Homura tells Tsunade that Naruto was a
jinchūriki
 and as such shouldn't be leaving the village at all and should have been kept under constant supervision. Tsunade rejects this and tells him that Naruto would grow to become a great power for Konoha but Homura tells her that she was being too carefree in her decisions regarding Naruto even though she was the Hokage. After Tsunade dismisses his claims, he resigns to her decision and instead tells her that they would be choosing the fourth member of Team Kakashi. After Shizune states that as Kakashi was still recuperating so a interim leader would have to be selected,
Danzō
 suggest that someone from the Anbu be appointed. Seeing this as a good idea, Homura asks Tsunade if she has any objections to the suggestion.

Tsunade lecturing Homura and Koharu about lacking faith.



When Tsunade tells
Kōsuke
 to head back to
Mount Myōboku
 and get Naruto after
Pain
 invades Konoha, before he is able to leave, Homura and Koharu interrupt saying that they should leave Naruto where he was safe. Homura then tells Tsunade that according to Danzō, that the leader of
Akatsuki
 was heading the assault and their target was Naruto. As Tsunade physically accosts them, Homura demands that she let them go. Tsunade then tells them both that Naruto was a shinobi of Konoha and not a tool of the village. She also tells them that unlike Jiraiya and Hiruzen, and even
Chiyo
, they lacked faith and trust in the younger generation. After initially reacting with shock, they tell her to do whatever she pleased, giving up on trying to change her mind.

Two years after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, he and the
Fire daimyō
 were ambushed by unknown perpetrators and their attacks separately, yet they were unharmed then after. However, having no proof of both attacks' connection led Kakashi on investigating both said incidents. He later attended a meeting on discussing the budget with
Kido Tsumiki
, Koharu, the daimyō, the Sixth Hokage, and Shizune. Listening to Kido's argument against Kakashi's and Shizune's discussion about securing additional funding for
Sakura
's clinic and about the recent attacks against him and the daimyō, he called for increased funding to Konoha's Anbu. However, the daimyō deferred to Homura, who agreed with Kido.

Mitsuki's Disappearance Arc

Mitsuki's Disappearance Arc

In the anime, when two chūnin gate guards were attacked by unknown assailants, the village was put on lockdown. After one of the guards' condition was stabilised, Homura and Koharu oversaw
Ino Yamanaka
's probing of the guard's mind for answers, learning that
Mitsuki
 had left willingly with the attackers. When it was revealed by Naruto that Mitsuki was in fact Orochimaru's son, the elders were furious at such a secret being kept from them. Naruto rationalised this on the grounds that Orochimaru's conduct has changed from before and that he was aiding in investigating the Ōtsutsuki. Despite this, noting the unpredictable nature of Orochimaru, the elders insisted that they had to treat the Oto-born boy as a threat.

As the council and Hokage continued to talk about how best to deal with this, Kakashi voiced his overall approval of Naruto's actions, noting that Naruto would never do anything he thought would bring danger to the village and that the elders wouldn't even consider letting the boy in the village had they known the full story to begin with.

Boruto's Return Arc

Main article:
Boruto's Return Arc

Following the world's memories of Boruto and
Kawaki
 being
swapped
 and the Seventh Hokage apparently being
killed
 by Boruto, Shikamaru was appointed as Eighth Hokage, something he agreed to on a provisional basis for three years. During a meeting following Boruto's driving Code back during his attack on Konoha, Homura and Koharu pressed Shikamaru to permanently accept the title to solidify his position on the global stage, and stressed that Boruto should be killed to assuage the daimyō responsible for the village's budget. Shikamaru merely agreed to report to them again.

Later, after Boruto was captured during his aid to protect Konoha from the sentient God Trees' assault on the village, the elders listened in on the interrogation. Boruto explained what the man-like God Trees are but refused to reveal his
source
. The Homura demanded more intel, noting that as a Hokage-killer, he is already sentenced to death, but what intel he gives can make his death less painful. Boruto then revealed that the Seventh Hokage and Hinata are both alive, but gave no other information, annoying the elders.

Shikamaru then called in Mitsuki to help with the interrogation through his venom. As Mitsuki suddenly became enraged and tackled Boruto, he used this moment to free Boruto from his cuffs, secretly ordered to do so by Shikamaru. As Boruto teleported away, the elders voiced their displeasure in Shikamaru's failure, noting that there would be consequences.

Post Matsuri and Ryū Arc

Upon the Fire Daimyō questioning the interim Hokage's ability to carry out the responsibilities of being the head of his village, a meeting was held. The elders of Konohagakure and the Fire Daimyō's chief advisor,
Kobu
, summoned the Eighth Hokage. During their meeting, the possibility of a mole being in the inner circle of the village was brought up. As Konohamaru voiced his belief that Boruto was not an enemy after he saved the Jōnin from the Human God Trees, the elders scoffed at the suggestion after what "Boruto" did to the Seventh Hokage. Shikamaru was then questioned in order to identify who helped Boruto escape custody in the village.
