 anime.

Synopsis

Sasuke

trains
 by himself, attacking a huge boulder with his
Chidori
, while remembering his
battle
 with
Gaara
. After he struck Gaara's partially-transformed arm, the latter merely regenerated one with his sand while Sasuke was rendered unable to move due to his reliance on the
Cursed Seal of Heaven
. However, he was spared from death by the timely arrival of
Naruto
, who proceeded to kick Gaara in the face. Gaara
restrained

Sakura
, who attempted to shield Sasuke from any harm. In anger as well an overwhelming desire to protect his comrade, Naruto
faced off
 against Gaara, attacking the
jinchūriki
 with his
All Directions Shuriken
 and his new, extemporaneous technique — the
Naruto Uzumaki Two Thousand Combo
. Pushed to his limit, Gaara
unleashed

Shukaku
, his
tailed beast
, while Naruto
summoned

Gamabunta
 in order to match his foe's strength. His ability to use the Summoning Technique despite using most of his
chakra
 for his
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 stuns both
Pakkun
 and Sasuke, with the latter perplexed at how and when Naruto became strong.

Shortly after finishing his training, he discovers that his older brother
Itachi
 has returned to
Konoha
 in search of Naruto. He
locates
 his brother in an inn, along with his partner
Kisame Hoshigaki
. Sasuke attempts to kill Itachi with Chidori, although Itachi is easily able to stop the attack and proceeds to break Sasuke's arm and kick him aside, declaring that he is not interested in Sasuke and is only here for Naruto. Naruto and Sasuke are saved by
Jiraiya
, who summons
Gama
 to block Kisame's
Samehada
. Sasuke asks Naruto not to interfere, but is easily
subdued
 by Itachi, who punches him and proclaims that Sasuke could never defeat him as his hatred is not strong enough, and subsequently tortures Sasuke with his
Tsukuyomi
, forcing his younger brother to relive the memories of the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
 for the next twenty-four hours. Jiraiya uses his
Summoning: Toad Mouth Bind
 to ensnare the two
Akatsuki
 members, though they are able to escape due to Itachi's
Amaterasu
.

Sasuke is healed from his trauma by
Tsunade
, much to Naruto's happiness. However, Sasuke is infuriated at Naruto's surge in improvement and
challenges
 Naruto to a fight, which the latter accepts. Sasuke and Naruto go at one another with Chidori and
Rasengan
, while
Sakura
 runs in between the attacks to stop them. As the two
genin
 realise that they cannot stop their trajectory, they are
thrown
 out of the way by
Kakashi
, who berates Sasuke for using Chidori against a teammate while also asking Jiraiya why he taught Naruto the Rasengan. Jiraiya retorts that Kakashi is being hypocritical, having passed on the Chidori to someone who wants only revenge. Sasuke notices the damage caused by Naruto's Rasengan and is only further angered by Naruto's improvement. Later that night, as Sasuke considers his future, he is attacked by the
Sound Four
,
Orochimaru
's bodyguards, who taunt him by calling him weak and defeat him without difficulty. They offer him a chance to come with them in order to gain power from Orochimaru and give him time to consider his choice before departing. Sasuke fumes as he realises that he needs that kind of power if he ever wishes to defeat Itachi.
