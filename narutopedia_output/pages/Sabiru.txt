Sabiru
 (
サビル
) was a high-ranking
shinobi
 in
Konohagakure
's tactical division. He was later discovered to be a traitor and a spy.

Background

Sabiru was part of Konohagakure's tactical and defence division during the
Third Hokage
's administration. He had seemingly come up with a plan that would fortify Konohagakure's defences to the point that the Third stated that it would assure the peace in Konohagakure forever. He was, however, discovered to be a traitor of the village by
Kisuke Maboroshi
, an
Anbu
. When Kisuke confronted Sabiru, he
removed
 Kisuke's soul from his body, leaving him in a comatose state.

Personality

Despite appearing as an upcoming shinobi invested in his village's security and welfare, Sabiru was a in fact a cruel man, who had no qualms about killing an
innocent woman
 or a defenceless comatose opponent.

Appearance

Sabiru had spiky light blue hair and blue eyes. He wore the standard outfit of the Konohagakure shinobi complete with a
flak jacket
 and a
forehead protector
 on a long band that tapered off. He also wore his sleeves rolled up.

Abilities






Sabiru using Soul-Body Separation Technique on Kisuke.



Sabiru was hailed as a very intelligent shinobi for his age, capable of planning an efficient security system for Konoha all by himself, earning him praise from the Third Hokage. This, however, was later revealed to be part of his plan as a spy.

Sabiru was also capable of using the
Shadow Clone Technique
, and seemed to be adept at trap-oriented attacks, as seen when he used a shadow clone in conjunction with some
explosive tags
 to throw
Kisuke Maboroshi
 in a river. He could also perform a
particular technique
 which allowed him to extract others' souls from their bodies, sealing them in tags.

Part II

Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha

After murdering Kisuke by deactivating his life support system,
Naruto Uzumaki
 tried to expose him as a spy. Later with Naruto's help from
Kakashi Hatake
, he was found liable, but before they could extract any information from him, he was taken out by a hidden
Kabuto Yakushi
.

Trivia

Written as 錆びる, "Sabiru" means "to rust", "to become rusty".

Sabiru shares an uncanny resemblance to
Inori
's
brother
, a shinobi from
Boruto
