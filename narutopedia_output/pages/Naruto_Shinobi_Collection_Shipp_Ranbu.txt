 is a social run and battle RPG game released by GREE for mobile phones on July 27, 2015. The game's service ended on August 31, 2022.

Gameplay

Naruto: Shinobi Collection Shippū Ranbu
 is a free to play game that only charges money for the purchase of certain items, mainly Shinobi Stones (
忍石
) that have a variety of functions in the game. Players collect Shinobi cards that can be used as playable characters to use in missions that are separated in run and battle parts with varying enemies and difficulty. In the Run part, the ninjas continually run forward while facing enemies and collecting items. The Battle part in the end of the mission is a RPG battle. Some missions may have only one of the two parts, Battle parts being more common.

Besides playable characters, there are Shinobi cards that serve other purposes, such as
chakra
 stones that grant more experience points when given to characters,
toads
 and
snakes
 to awaken the character's power, and
Nekobaa
 coins that grant more
Ryō
 when sold.
