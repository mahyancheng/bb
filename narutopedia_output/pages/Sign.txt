Lyrics

Rōmaji

I realise the screaming pain

Hearing loud in my brain

But I'm going straight ahead with the scar

Can You Hear Me (x2)

Can You Hear Me (So am I)

Wasurete shimaeba ii yo kanji nakunacchaeba ii

Surimuita kokoro ni futa o shitanda

Kizutsuitatte heikidayo mou itami wa nai kara ne

Sono ashi o hikizuri nagara mo

Miushinatta jibun jishin ga

Oto o tatete kuzureteitta

Kizukeba kaze no oto dake ka

Tsutaeni kitayo kizuato tadotte

Sekai ni oshitsubusarete shimau mae ni

Oboeterukana namida no sora o

Ano itami ga kimi no koto o mamottekureta

Sono itami ga itsumo kimi o mamotterunda

Can You Hear Me? So am I

Rōmaji (Full Version)

I realise the screaming pain

Hearing loud in my brain

But I'm going straight ahead, with the scar

Can You Hear Me (x2)

Can You Hear Me (So am I)

Wasurete shimaeba ii yo kanji nakunacchaeba ii

Surimuita kokoro ni futa o shitanda

Kizutsuitatte heikidayo mou itami wa nai kara ne

Kanji

I realise the screaming pain

Hearing loud in my brain

But I'm going straight ahead with the scar

忘れてしまえばいいよ　

感じなくなっちゃえばいい

擦(す)りむいた心に蓋(ふた)をしたんだ

傷ついたって平気だよ　

もう痛みは無いからね

その足を引きずりながらも

見失った自分自身が

音を立てて崩れていった

気付けば風の音だけが…

伝えに来たよ　傷跡を辿って　

世界に押しつぶされてしまう前に

覚えてるかな 涙の空を　

あの痛みが君の事を守ってくれた

その痛みがいつも君を守ってるんだ

Kanji (Full Version)

忘れてしまえばいいよ

擦(す)りむいた心に蓋(ふた)をしたんだ

傷ついたって平気だよ

その足を引きずりながらも

見失った自分自身が

気付けば風の音だけが…

伝えに来たよ　傷跡を辿って　

世界に押しつぶされてしまう前に

覚えてるかな 涙の空を　

あの痛みが君の事を守ってくれた

その痛みがいつも君を守ってるんだ

「傷付かない強さよりも　

傷つけない優しさを」

その声はどこか悲しそうで

掛け違えた　ボタンみたいに

こころ身体　離れていった

もう一度 心を掴んで

伝えに来たよ　傷跡を辿って　

世界に押しつぶされてしまう前に

覚えてるかな 涙の空を　

あの痛みが君の事を守ってくれた

その痛みがいつも君を守ってるんだ

いつか聞いた あの泣き声は

間違いなくそう 自分のだった

全てはこの時のために…

きっと始めから わかってたんだ　

もう二度と自分だけは離さないで

気付いてくれた　君への合図　

あの痛みが君の事を守ってくれた

伝えに来たよ　傷跡を辿って　

それなら もう恐れるものはないんだと

忘れないでね 笑顔の訳を　

あの痛みが君の事を守ってくれた

あの痛みが君の事を守ってくれた

その痛みがいつも君を守ってるんだ

English

I realise the screaming pain

Hearing loud in my brain

But I'm going straight ahead

With this scar

Can you hear me

Can you hear me

Can you hear me, so am I

I don't mind if you don't remember

All the feelings that we used to share

For I've sealed away my heart into the darkness

It's just fine if you end up hurting me

'cause I don't feel pain anymore

I just drag my feet behind me

Towards what's held in store

I had been led astray

With no hope to be found

My heart withered away

And I fell to the ground

Then I heard a voice within the blowing of the wind

Please let me show you the pain

My scars have made me obtain

Before the weight of the world

Comes crashing down on my shoulders

Do you remember the time

Our tears fell down from the sky

Someday soon when I'm gone

Never think that I'll neglect you

For the pain that I've

Sealed away in your heart will protect you

Can you hear me, so am I

English (Full Version— literal)

I realize the screaming pain

Hearing loud in my brain

But I'm going straight ahead with the scar

Can you hear me/can you hear me/can you hear me

So am I

It's okay if you've forgotten

It's okay if you don't feel it anymore

I know it's because you've covered up your scraped up heart

It's okay if you hurt me

because there's no pain anymore

Even as you're dragging your feet behind you

The self you lost

Made a sound, then crumbled to nothing

If you realize it, only the sound of the wind...

has come to answer you, so follow the scar

Before you are crushed under the weight of the world

Do you remember? That sky of tears

That pain has protected you for me

That pain is always protecting you

"More than the strength to not hurt anyone,

towards a kindness that doesn't hurt anyone"

In that voice, somewhere, sadly

Like crossed buttons

You've separated your body from your heart

One more time, grab onto your heart...

I've come to answer you, so follow the scar

before you are crushed under the weight of the world

Do you remember it? That sky filled with tears

That pain protected you for me

This pain is always protecting you

That crying voice heard somewhere, sometime

Unmistakably was mine

All of it was for this moment...

I'm sure you knew from the very beginning

Just don't ever let go of yourself again

As a sign to you who has realized that,

That pain has protected you for me

I've come to answer you, so follow the scar

If you do so, there's no longer anything to fear

Don't forget it, okay? It was all for that smiling face

That pain has protected you for me

That pain has protected you for me

This pain will always protect you for me

English (Full Version-- Alternate)

I realise the screaming pain

Hearing loud in my brain

But I'm going straight ahead, with this scar

Can You Hear Me (x2)

Can You Hear Me (So am I)

i don't mind if you don't remember all the feelings that we used to share

cause i sealed my heart into the darkness

it's just fine if you end up hurting me, cause i don't feel pain anymore

I just drag my feet behind me, Towards what's held in store

I had been led astray

With no hope to be found

My heart withered away

And I fell to the ground

Then I heard a voice within the blowing of the wind

Please let me show you the pain

My scars have made me obtain

Before the weight of the world

Comes crashing down on my shoulders

Do you remember the time

Our tears fell down from the sky

Someday soon when I'm gone

Never think that I'll neglect you

For the pain that I've

Sealed away in your heart will protect you

Can you hear me, so am I

Although I've blocked all of my feelings

Even the ones caused by being kind

Every now and then I hear a voice

Inside me seem to cry

Like when you undo

A button from it's hole

My bitter torment drew

My body from my soul

So I'm crying out in hopes to fill my empty heart

Please let me show you the pain

My scars have made me obtain

Before the weight of the world

Comes crashing down on my shoulders

Do you remember the time

Our tears fell down from the sky

Someday soon when I'm gone

Never think that I'll neglect you

For the pain that I've

Sealed away in your heart will protect you

Can you hear it?

Can you feel it?

Can you hear me?

Can you hear me?

Can you hear me?

Can you hear me?

Can you hear me?

So am I

I have finally found

All of the heartbroken moans

That I keep hearing sound

Are from my voice alone

And I've done this all for this one moment here with you

I'm sure that right from the start

You always knew in your heart

That I'd always be the one

That you could count on to care for you

I have been leading you to

The sign that I left for you

Someday soon when I'm gone

Never think that I'll neglect you

If you will follow the pain

That through me you have obtained

There is nothing in this world

That will be able to hurt you

But don't forget all the things

That bring out your smile away

Someday soon when I'm gone

Never think that I'll neglect you

Someday soon when I'm gone

Never think that I'll neglect you

For the pain that I've

Sealed away in your heart will protect you

Can you hear me

Can you hear me

Can you hear me

So am I
