The
Flaming Arrow Warhead
 is a technique used by
Nagato
 through the
Asura Path
.

Overview

Using the body modification ability of the
Asura Path
, the user detaches their hand, revealing a cluster of missiles. The further the hand is removed from the arm, the more missiles can be fired at once. These can fired to create widespread damage, or as homing devices seeking a single target. Even if the Asura Path has sustained significant damage, it can still produce missiles from its body, as it did when Pain attempted to kill Chōji.
