Boruto creates a shadow clone and delivers a few strikes to his opponent, putting some distance between them. The shadow clone creates a Vanishing Rasengan, and Boruto grabs the clone by the hand, spinning it to create momentum. Boruto lets go of the clone, and the clone throws the Rasengan, giving it more speed. When it connects with the target, it pushes them up in the air before expanding.
