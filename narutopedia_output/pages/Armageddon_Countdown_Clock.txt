After performing the hand seal, a special clock appears on the palm of one's choosing. This clock was developed by
Konohagakure
, only to be used by the five
Kage
 and their most trusted assistants. It serves as a countdown to the Earth's destruction, after
Toneri
 dislodged the
Moon
 from its orbit.
