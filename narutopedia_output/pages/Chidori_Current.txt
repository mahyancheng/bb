Chidori Current
 is a
ninjutsu
 that was developed by
Sasuke Uchiha
 while he was training with
Orochimaru
.

Overview

By releasing the
Chidori
 in every direction, an electrical discharge flows from the user's entire body allowing them to affect multiple enemies. When using this attack on a great number of enemies at once, it can effectively double as an instant defence. The body of the person touched by the Chidori will misinterpret the lightning nature as "electrical signals from the nerves", making its muscles contract. This causes the body to involuntarily go stiff, while at the same time receiveing damage. This attack can also be channelled through the ground to increase the range of the attack.
