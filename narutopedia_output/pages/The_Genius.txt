Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Tobi
 watches
Konoha
 and teleports away.
Itachi
 feels an ominous wind as Tobi summons the
Nine-Tails
. Tobi has the Nine-Tails attack the village, and Itachi protects
Sasuke
 during the attack. Itachi comes across
Izumi
 during the attack and helps her get to a shelter. Konoha manages to subdue the Nine-Tails. Itachi attends the funeral of those who died during the attack. Izumi thanks Itachi for helping her.
Danzō
 oversees the rebuilding of the village, and moves clan settlements around, including pushing the
Uchiha
 to the edge of Konoha.
 The Uchiha are displeased with the decision, but can't be the only voice of dissension, as other clans were also relocated. Itachi asks
Fugaku
 to see the new Uchiha training grounds, and asks him to teach him jutsu. Itachi effortlessly learns
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
. Itachi notices Fugaku's discomfort with the neighbouring buildings around the new Uchiha clan settlements. Itachi and Izumi begin at the
Academy
. Itachi excels at it, and asks Fugaku to teach him more jutsu, as he deems the ones taught in the Academy too easy. Itachi's prowess affords him admiration by girls, and jealousy from some boys. Itachi's classmates, among them
Saisu Kamano
, run into an older student named
Dokan
, who takes issue with their attitude. The boys cower behind Itachi, who easily beats Dokan when he attacks. The boys' jealousy turns into admiration, much to Itachi's discomfort. Itachi wonders about what it means to be a shinobi, and about the village. He learns from
Shisui
 during Academy hours, and sends in a
shadow clone
 to attend the Academy. The shadow clone is defeated by Dokan and other older students when they target him and other students from his class out of revenge. Itachi's teachers are impressed by him knowing it, and offer him an early graduation. Itachi graduates, and can begin acting as part of a team and going on missions.

Trivia

At the beginning of the episode when Tobi is looking at the village, the Hokage Rock has Tsunade's face even though the episode is set before she becomes Hokage.
