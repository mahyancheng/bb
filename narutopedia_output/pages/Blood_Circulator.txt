Lyrics

Rōmaji

Aimaina hyōden koshiraete hitatteru no

Seisei saisai nani o mada matteru no

Itsunomanika hitori ni natta

Tameiki hitotsu haite nageite

Jōnetsu moyashita ano koro o

Shinketsu sosoide torimodosunda

En de tsunagareba kono hibi mo

Suteru hodo koware tenaidarou

Ayumi o tomenaide

Kibō o sutenaide

Dōka furimuite

Dō ka kimiyo

Jin Jin kokoro ga itamunara

Kan'nen no ori o uchiyaburu nda

En'en tsukihi wa megurukedo

Suteru ni wa yami ga asaidarou

Jōnetsu moyashita ano koro o

Shinketsu sosoide torimodosu nda

Ai o wakeaeba kono hibi mo

Mōichido kimi o terasudarou

Kanji

曖昧な評伝 拵え て浸ってるの

世世 歳歳 何をまだ持ってるの

いつのまにか独りになった

ため息ひとつ吐いて 嘆いて

情熱 やしたあの頃を

心血注いで取り戻すんだ

縁で繋がれば この日々も

捨てるほど壊れてないだろう

歩みを止めないで

希望を捨てないで

どうか振り向いて

どうか 君よ

ジンジン 心が傷むなら

観念の檻を打ち破るんだ

延々 月日は巡るけど

捨てるには闇が浅いだろう

情熱 燃やしたあの頃を

心血注いで取り戻すんだ

愛を分け合えば この日々も

もう一度 君を照らすだろう

English

You allowed yourself to be consumed

After all these years what have you gained?

Before you knew it you were all alone

You let out a painful sigh

You were once burning with passion

You must pour your heart into your soul

Compared to the challenges of today

It's not worth throwing it all away

Do not stop to walk

Do not give up hope

Please turn back

Please hear me!

If your heart is tingling with pain

Break free your idea from it's cage

The endless waiting is over at last

Only shallow darkness is left behind

You allowed yourself to be consumed

After all these years what have you gained?

The days that you used to love

Will once again shine on you

English (full version)

a vague, unclear critical biography, are you immersed in its creation?

generations, years, annually, what are you still waiting for?

before we knew it, we were alone

spit out a sigh and grieve.

a parasite and a snail swirl together, tumbling down

silent, scattered, resounding, groaning

before we knew it, we were alone

where is this place?

the voice’s hiding place, pursue gently

at least a sigh, gulp down

that time with which passion burned, we'll pour our

heart’s blood into it, take it back

if we’re tied together by fate, these days too

aren’t so broken you have to throw them out, you know

if your trembling heart hurts, it’s the

prison of beliefs you resigned yourself to being

defeated

endless days go around, but

compared to throwing it all away,

their darkness is superficial

the rain has stopped, you know

the roadway blurred in headlights

the rain has stopped, you know

the hand that closed the umbrella, dully grows numb with cold

please, don’t stop walking

please, don’t throw away your hope

please, don’t cry all alone

please, don’t hurt your body

please, don’t starve yourself of love

please, don’t accumulate hatred

please, somehow, turn around

please, somehow, you

before we knew it, we were alone

where is this place?

the voice’s hiding place, gently pursue

at least a sigh, gulp down

that time which with passion burned, our heart’s blood

we're pouring all into it, to take it back

if we’re tied together by fate, these days too

aren’t so broken to throw them out, you know

if your trembling heart hurts, it’s that the

cage of beliefs you resigned yourself to has been defeated

endless days go around, but

compared to throwing it all away,

their darkness is superficial

with passion burned, that time, our heart’s blood

we're pouring into it, to take it back

if we can share love, these days too

love will light you up once more
