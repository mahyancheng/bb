Gamakichi
 (
ガマ吉
) is a
toad
 from
Mount Myōboku
. He is also the eldest son of
Gamabunta
 and the older brother of
Gamatatsu
. He is the personal summon of
Naruto Uzumaki
.

Personality

Gamakichi is rather comedic, and has the mannerisms of a smart aleck. He is also often very condescending as well as light-hearted in most situations, preferring the levity of talk to the seriousness of battle. He has formed a bond with Naruto because he saved him from Gaara in his
miniature Shukaku form
. After he is summoned, he tends to greet people by saying, "
Yo
" (in English dub, "
Hey
").

In Part II, Gamakichi has not just grown in size but in maturity as well. Gamakichi seems to have a considerably large amount of knowledge when it comes to human-toad combination techniques and
natural energy
. Also, he seems to be on better terms with his younger brother,
Gamatatsu
, as shown by him no longer calling him an idiot.

When summoned during the Fourth Shinobi World War, Gamakichi is shown to have started smoking like his father.
 With this, his personality has also become a lot more like his father's as well, as Naruto noted that along with his new size, he also gained an ego to match. At the same time, Gamakichi is shown to be very dutiful. As he realised time was almost up for his summoning, he was determined to give one final assist to Naruto.

Appearance

Gamakichi débuted as a young orange toad with purple markings around his eyes, mouth and stomach. In Part I, he was small enough to fit on top of
Naruto
's head like
Akamaru
 could fit on top of
Kiba
's head and wore a blue jacket. In Part II, during
Pain's assault
 on Konoha, Gamakichi had grown big enough so that Naruto could stand on his head, but was still small enough that he stand on
Gamabunta
. By the time of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
 Gamakichi has matured further, and is now almost as large as his father (only 10 cm shorter) with Naruto riding on top his head. Gamakichi now also smokes a cigarette and wields a giant
tantō
. In addition to this he wears a necklace with a large bead. His colour scheme has also changed during this time.

Abilities

Though much was not seen in terms of Gamakichi's appearance in the series during his childhood and adolescent stages, as an adult toad, Gamakichi has proved a formidable opponent and a reliable partner. Gamakichi can leap across enormous distances in a relatively short period of time. Gamakichi also wields a
tantō
 similar to that of his father's, which he has shown great skill with during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, as he was able to easily deflect projectiles from the
Ten-Tails' minions
.

Ninjutsu

Gamakichi has shown the ability to use the
Reverse Summoning Technique
 and summon Naruto to Mount Myōboku.
 As a toad of
Mount Myōboku
, Gamakichi is also well versed in the art of
senjutsu
 and was earlier on in the series able to see the flow and accumulation of
natural energy
.

Nature Transformation

Gamakichi has shown capable of combining the use of senjutsu with his skills with
Water Release

nature transformation
 in order to use the
Starch Syrup Gun
 technique, which creates a viscous blanket of water to attack his opponents with.
 In the anime, Gamakichi has also shown the ability to use
Fire Release
 techniques, which includes the
Fire Release: Flame Bullet
 and the
cooperation ninjutsu
 with his brother and Naruto called the
Wind Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet
.

Part I

Konoha Crush

Konoha Crush

During the fight with the transformed
Gaara
,
Sakura Haruno
 was slowly being crushed, and Naruto decided it was time to summon
Gamabunta
. However, due to poor
chakra
 control, he could only muster enough chakra to summon Gamakichi. Despite being irritated, Naruto kept Gamakichi safe from Gaara's attacks. When Naruto finally managed to summon Gamabunta, Gamakichi convinced his father to help in the fight, telling his father that Naruto had saved him from Gaara and that he, in turn, needed help saving his "girlfriend".

Search for Tsunade

During the fight against
Orochimaru
, Gamakichi was inadvertently summoned by Jiraiya due to the crippling effects of Tsunade's drug which were still in his system, rendering him unable to properly control his chakra. He would later tell his brother Gamatatsu, who was summoned by Naruto, to run away when their father,
Katsuyu
, and
Manda
 with their respective summoners were about to fight. Gamakichi later watched from the sidelines along with
Tonton
 and his brother as the battle between the three waged on.

In the anime, Jiraiya summoned him to check for traps at the entrance of Orochimaru's hideout.

Cursed Warrior Extermination Mission

In the anime, Gamakichi made a short appearance in the
Land of Birds
 when he and Naruto needed Gamatatsu. Despite Naruto thinking he would be useless, Gamatatsu, using his curiosity, found a kite that was a clue to how the
Cursed Warrior
 flew. Later, he went down a dark tunnel with Naruto and Gamatatsu, and Naruto was caught by
Sagi
 and his guards.

Kaima Capture Mission

Kaima Capture Mission

In the anime, he was summoned again with Gamatatsu by Naruto in the
Land of the Sea
, although it was another attempt by Naruto to summon Gamabunta. Upon learning this he warned Naruto that it would be a big mistake to summon his father to the middle of the ocean, since toads are freshwater creatures.

Part II

Three-Tails' Appearance

Three-Tails' Appearance






Gamakichi and Gamatatsu as seen in Part II.



Although he did not have his Part II début until much later in the manga, Gamakichi appeared sooner in the anime adaptation. Noticeably, Gamakichi was not yet as big as he would be in his manga debut, by which time he would be big enough for Naruto to stand on his head. In his anime debut, Gamakichi was easily big enough for Naruto to stand on his back.

When Naruto proved incapable of synchronising with
Gamariki
 to learn
cooperation ninjutsu
, Naruto decided to summon Gamakichi and
Gamatatsu
, as he had worked well with them before. After successfully synchronising with them, Naruto learned that neither of them had any skill in
Water Release
 technique. With Naruto's help and lessons from their father, Gamakichi teaches the basics of Water Release to Gamatatsu.

Later, when
Team Yamato
 found it impossible to break through
Guren
's crystal barrier via conventional means, Naruto summoned Gamakichi and Gamatatsu to help. Gamakichi kept Gamatatsu focused by warning him that he wouldn't get any snacks if he didn't focus on the task at hand. This enables Gamatatsu to break through the barrier, after which they return to
Mount Myōboku
. To their annoyance, however, Naruto keeps summoning them again, both to combat
Team Guren
 and the
Three-Tails
. While fighting the latter, Gamakichi pointed out that their Water Release technique would be ineffective against its own water-based abilities. Naruto lamented the fact that they had no
Fire Release
 technique at their disposal to evaporate the beast's water, but Gamakichi pointed out that he could use fire release and together with him using the
Fire Release: Flame Bullet
 technique, they were able to perform the
Wind Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet
.

After sending Gamatatsu back briefly to Mount Myōboku to bring back a stomachful of toad oil, Naruto, Gamatatsu, and Gamakichi combined their techniques to create the
Wind Release: Toad Oil Flame Bullet
. The resulting inferno drove through the Three-Tails' water attack and had the turtle demon fleeing under the lake's surface. Once the Three-Tails had been overcome, Gamakichi and Gamatatsu went back home.

Pain's Assault

Pain's Assault






Gamakichi returns to Konoha with Naruto and the others.



Gamakichi made his Part II début in the manga when Naruto was informed of Jiraiya's death. He was later present during Naruto's
senjutsu
 training having
summoned
 Naruto to
Mount Myōboku
 and later watched as he trained under
Fukasaku
. He was summoned again during
Pain
's attack on
Konoha
, where Naruto instructed him to get
Tsunade
 to safety. He stayed with Sakura whom he had brought Tsunade to, laughing when the
Deva Path
 starts running away to use
Chibaku Tensei
, thinking Naruto has scared him off. Sakura reprimanded him however, reminding him of the danger with Naruto and that they needed to use this opportunity to save
Hinata Hyūga
 who had been badly injured. He is later seen with the other villagers congratulating Naruto on defeating
Nagato
.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax






Gamakichi summoned alongside Katsuyu and Aoda.



When Naruto, Sakura, and
Sasuke
 simultaneously used the
Summoning Technique
, Gamakichi appeared alongside
Aoda
 and
Katsuyu
. He showed a big improvement in size, looking a lot like
Gamabunta
, with a cigarette in his mouth. Naruto was surprised that Gamabunta didn't appear. Gamakichi stated that his father was busy, and Naruto praised how Gamakichi got bigger. He then instructed Gamakichi to attack the original
Ten-Tails
. As Gamakichi leaped high into the air, using his tantō to destroy the attacks of the guards, Naruto readied his
Wind Release: Ultra-Big Ball Rasenshuriken
 to attack the Ten-Tails.

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki

Gamakichi later made his way towards the barrier when
Hashirama
 instructed Sasuke and Naruto to stop
Obito
 who had
appeared
 atop the Ten-Tails. Stopping midway when
Minato
 arrived before them and cut Obito down, Gamakichi arrived at the location in time for Naruto to retrieve Sasuke and Minato as Obito
sealed
 the Ten-Tails into himself. When
Tobirama
 and Hashirama launched a counter-attack against Obito after they themselves were attacked, Gamakichi was teleported a safe distance by Minato where they looked on as Obito was bombarded by
explosions
. He was later ambushed by Obito who had attacked them from underground. Recovering from the attack, Gamakichi noted as he watched the events on the battlefield unfold, that they needed to be extra careful as one misstep could spell the end for them. He later looked on in shock as one of Obito's attacks prepared to expand in their vicinity, threatening to eradicate them all.

After Naruto and Sasuke second attack on Obito landed, he wondered aloud whether or not they had finally got him. His question, however, was answered by Obito emerging from the flames unscathed. While the team tried to readjust their strategy, Gamakichi attacked Obito with the
senjutsu
-enhanced
Starch Syrup Gun
 technique. He then explained to Naruto that the
Summoning Technique
 would soon be dispelled and that he wanted to attack Obito one last time before he disappeared. The jutsu was then undone and Gamakichi was returned back home. Gamakichi's final attack, however, led to Naruto and Tobirama discovering that Obito could not nullify senjutsu attacks, which played an ultimate role in his defeat.

Trivia

Gamakichi's name means "Propitious Toad".

In the English version, Gamakichi spoke in a New York accent. This could be a similar allusion to Gamabunta speaking in a Hiroshima dialect in the Japanese version, as both dialects are associated with gangsters.
