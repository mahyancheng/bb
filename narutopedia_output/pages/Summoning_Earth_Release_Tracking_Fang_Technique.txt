When, for whatever reason, the user
cannot find
 a target, they use this technique to
summon
 a pack of
ninken
 underground. The ninken use their superior sense of smell to track the target, converge on their location, and then all together burst from the ground and take hold with their fangs. With the target captured in this way, the summoner can easily locate them and finish them off.

During
Kakashi Hatake
's fight with
Zabuza Momochi
, he allows Zabuza to injure him a few times so that Zabuza's weapons will be coated with his blood. He then smears some of his blood on a scroll, holds the scroll in his hands as he performs the
hand seals
, and presses the scroll to the ground as he summons the ninken. Rather than track down Zabuza's scent, the ninken track the scent of Kakashi's blood to Zabuza.
 When
Haku
 later damages the scroll, the summoning is ended prematurely and the ninken disappear, thus releasing Zabuza.

Trivia

In the English translation of the anime, Kakashi threatens to have the ninken kill Zabuza. Such a threat is not present in the original Japanese.
