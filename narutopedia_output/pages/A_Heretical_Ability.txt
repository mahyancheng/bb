Viz:
 Unholy Gifts!) is chapter 67 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Sasuke
 and
Yoroi
 prepare to fight and the rest of the participants go upstairs to observe.
Kakashi
 takes this opportunity to warn Sasuke not to use his
cursed seal
, stating that if he activates it the match will end and Sasuke will be detained. Since he cannot use his
Sharingan
 without inadvertently activating the cursed seal, Sasuke and the watching
Orochimaru
 wonder how he will handle this handicap. When the match starts Sasuke resorts to
taijutsu
, which gives Yoroi ample opportunity to grab Sasuke and absorb his
chakra
. Knowing that a prolonged battle will leave him exhausted and thus unable to win, Sasuke uses his
Lion Combo
, a technique based off
Rock Lee
's
Front Lotus
, on Yoroi.
