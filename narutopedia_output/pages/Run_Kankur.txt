"
Run, Kankurō
" (
疾走れカンクロウ
,
Hashire Kankurō
) is episode 7 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

In
Konoha
,
Tsunade
 is prepared to give
Team Kakashi
 a B-ranked mission.
Shizune
, however, offers a D-rank mission of walking someone's dog, as she doesn't believe
Naruto
 should go on dangerous missions outside of Konoha as he possesses the
Nine-Tailed Fox
 inside of him. As a compromise, Tsunade decides to give them a C-rank mission of escorting a gold convoy. Naruto returns to his apartment, which is dusty and filled with cobwebs. Glad to be back at home, he dusts off an old picture of
Team 7
 and tells himself that he will bring
Sasuke
 back home.

In
Sunagakure
,
Deidara
 manages to catch an unconscious
Gaara
 with his clay bird and flies outside of the village.
Kankurō
 chases down the
Akatsuki
 member in an effort to rescue his brother, while
Baki
 orders a Suna shinobi to send word to Konoha. The shinobi sends his message via
Takamaru
, a carrier bird for the Sand. Back in Konoha,
Shikamaru
 wakes up early to escort
Temari
 to the village's gate, so she can begin her journey back to Suna. Kakashi, who spent the whole night rereading
Icha Icha
, quickly assembles his team dossier and goes down to meet with Naruto and
Sakura
, who are to be assigned their first mission as Team Kakashi. After encountering the two, Kakashi notices Takamaru flying above the sky.

As Kankurō manages to catch up to the two Akatsuki members,
Sasori
 tells Deidara to go ahead with Gaara while he fights Kankurō. Kankurō attempts to attack a fleeing Deidara using his three
puppets
;
Karasu
,
Kuroari
 and
Sanshōuo
. However, Sasori seems very familiar with Kankurō's techniques, destroying Kuroari and Sanshōuo without breaking a sweat, allowing Deidara to escape.

Trivia

During the scene where
Kakashi
 spends all night reading his
book
, he is missing his
Anbu
 tattoo on his left deltoid.
