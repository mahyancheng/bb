Ebisu
, a tokubetsu jōnin of
Konohagakure
.



Tokubetsu Jōnin
 (
特別上忍
,
English TV:
 Special Jōnin,
literally meaning:
 Special High Ninja, sometimes known as Tokujō for short) are ninja who, rather than having all-around
jōnin
 skills, only excel in a specific area, much like
warrant officers
 in real-world militaries. For example,
Ibiki Morino
 can completely understand the workings of the human mind, making him an expert in interrogation.

They nevertheless possess enough skill overall, as they are known to have been given the same opportunity as jōnin in leading their own
genin
 teams.

Trivia

In
Naruto: Rise of a Ninja
, tokubetsu jōnin are called "elite shinobi."
