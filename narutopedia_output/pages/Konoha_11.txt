The
Konoha 11
 (
木ノ葉の11人
,
Konoha no Jūichinin
,
English TV:
 Hidden Leaf 11,
literally meaning:
 Tree Leaf Eleven People) is a term used to collectively refer to the members of four
Konoha
 teams:
Team 7
,
Team 8
,
Team 10
, and
Team Guy
. Team 7's
Sasuke Uchiha
 is not included in the group as he had defected from the village prior to its formation. Though the members appear in both the manga and anime and often work collectively in both medias, the term "Konoha 11" is only ever used in the anime.

History

The Konoha 11's first official mission is during the original anime's
Konoha Plans Recapture Mission
, where
Shikamaru Nara
, the only member of the group to be a
chūnin
 at the time, leads the others in stopping
Gennō
 from destroying Konoha. Shikamaru leads them once again shortly thereafter during the
Sunagakure Support Mission
, assisting the
Sand Siblings
 with defeating the
Four Celestial Symbols Men
.






The Konoha 11 discuss Sasuke.



A few years later, when news of
Sasuke Uchiha
's criminal activity reaches the village, the members of the Konoha 11, except for
Naruto Uzumaki
, decide that Sasuke must be eliminated in order to prevent him from implicating Konoha in his future crimes. Because they were his friends and classmates and therefore their responsibility, they decided to be the ones to personally kill him. When Naruto learns of their decision, he asks that they leave dealing with Sasuke to him.

During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Naruto is assisted by most of the members of the Konoha 11 in attacking
Obito Uchiha
 with a volley of
Rasengan
.
Neji Hyūga
, who was killed during the war, is replaced by
Sai
.
Sakura Haruno
 does not directly participate in this attack, instead assisting remotely to heal the members' injuries and replenish their
chakra
.

After the Fourth Shinobi World War, the remaining members continued to stay close in following years, to which their respective children also came to know each other well.

Trivia






The Rookie 9.



During the
Chūnin Exams arc
, the members of Teams 7, 8, and 10 are referred to as the
Rookie 9
 (
新人9人
,
Rūkī Nain
), as all had only recently graduated from the
Academy
 yet were already participating in the
Chūnin Exams
. Team Guy's members graduated a year before the others, and thus aren't included. It is not until the Fourth Shinobi World War that the nine are all together again, combining forces to attack the
Ten-Tails
'
clones
.

This generation was noted to be especially gifted as all nine were nominated by their teachers to participate in their first upcoming exams. True to their words, all nine passed the second part of the exam, which eliminated more than half the candidates.
