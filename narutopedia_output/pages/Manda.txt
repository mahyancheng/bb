This article is about the original serpent in Orochimaru's services. For the clone created by Kabuto Yakushi, see
Manda II
.

Manda
 (
マンダ
) was the boss summon of the
snakes
 of the
Ryūchi Cave
.

Background

In the anime, during the
Second Shinobi World War
, Manda was
summoned
 to the battlefield, alongside
Gamabunta
 and
Katsuyu
, by their
respective contractors
.

Personality

Manda was very snobbish and proud, believing himself superior to everyone. He apparently only served
Orochimaru
 because he could not successfully defeat him, as
Kabuto Yakushi
 expressed concern that Manda would turn on them if he knew Orochimaru couldn't perform techniques.
 Even in this instance, he complained about the conditions he was summoned into, and demanded that he be given a hundred human sacrifices as compensation for his help.
 When they lost this battle, Manda threatened Orochimaru to be prepared for a punishment during their next encounter.
 Manda held mutual animosity for Gamabunta.

Appearance






Manda's full appearance.



Manda was the largest snake in the world, being out-sized only by his modified clone,
Manda II
. He easily towered over buildings, trees, and large rock formations. Due to his length, he was even larger than Gamabunta and Katsuyu, and was easily able to coil around Katsuyu, having additional length behind him. Additionally, he could open his jaws wide enough to swallow Gamabunta whole.

He was coloured purple, and had black rings running down intervals on his body. He had massive fangs, though they were arranged in a way similar to that of a constrictor snake instead of a viper or other venomous snake species, presumably carrying venom in them from the way they were designed, and green eyes. He also had four horn-like protrusions on his head.

Abilities






Manda constricting Katsuyu.



Manda was very powerful, feared as the "strongest colossal serpent" (
最強の蟒蛇
,
Saikyō no Uwabami
).
 He was able to stand his own against Gamabunta and Katsuyu, having almost killed them both. It is also obvious that he was well-known, as
Gamakichi
 was afraid of him just because of his gaze. He was extremely fast, as he was quickly able to dodge Katsuyu's
attack
 and restrict it.
 He was also able to shed his skin in a manner similar to
Orochimaru's technique
 when caught
ablaze
 by Gamabunta and Jiraiya's collaboration technique,
 and move
underground
 in quick succession.
 His body was also sturdy enough to withstand
Deidara
's
ultimate attack
, and remain intact, while providing a relatively safe shelter for Sasuke to hide inside his mouth, although this came at the cost of Manda's life.

Manda in his fight against Katsuyu and Gamabunta.



Orochimaru (with Kabuto's assistance) summoned Manda to combat
Tsunade
's Katsuyu and
Jiraiya
's Gamabunta. After relishing in the possibility of getting to eat the other two summons, Manda attacked. He tried to constrict Katsuyu to death, who after
dividing
, was able to escape. Gamabunta and Jiraiya then tried to catch him in a firestorm, but he just shed his skin and burrowed underground to sneak up on them. Before he could land an attack, however, Tsunade drove Gamabunta's sword through the roof of his mouth, pinning him down and leaving him unable to attempt to eat anyone, for about a month. Angered by the humiliation, Manda threatened Orochimaru before leaving.

Manda's final moments.



Losing to
Sasuke Uchiha
 at the end of their battle, Deidara was forced to use his
C0
 as a last resort to take the Uchiha down with him. However, Sasuke summoned Manda and used his
Sharingan
 to cast a
genjutsu
 on the great serpent so he could jump to Ryūchi Cave inside of Manda. Just before they jumped, Manda and Sasuke were hit by the shockwave. Suspecting that Sasuke had committed the act,
Suigetsu Hōzuki
 summoned Manda to his location to bring out Sasuke. Released from his control and on the verge of death, Manda cursed Sasuke with his last breath.

Legacy

Though Manda died, Kabuto obtained some cells from his body and used them to produce a
more enhanced clone of Manda
.
