" (

Gokuhi Ninmu no Yukue
) is episode 499 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Kakashi
 and
Shizune
 review the wedding gifts for
Naruto
 and
Hinata
. Kakashi leans towards having
Lee
,
Guy
, and
Konohamaru
 on duty. Kakashi goes out on a stroll, and meets up with Hinata, who is going to meet the other girls. Konohamaru finds
Iruka
 at
Ramen Ichiraku
, and demands he finally record a message for Naruto and Hinata. Iruka is still unsure what to say, recalling that
Gaara
 decided to celebrate Naruto as his friend instead of Kazekage, and wondering what role he should be, though understanding most would consider him Naruto's teacher.
 While meeting with Hinata,
Sakura
 almost slips about the mission for getting them wedding gifts. Later, with Team 8,
Kiba
 almost slips about the mission.
Tsunade
 comes by the Hokage's office and Shizune tells her about the mission and Kakashi's predicament of judging the gifts, while Konohamaru overhears them, deciding to hand in his video without a message from Iruka. Konohamaru informs the others of the judging of their gifts, which Hinata overhears, distressing her. Hinata goes see Kakashi about the mission. The others go to Kakashi and offer to rotate between missions and the wedding reception, allowing everyone to participate, and Kakashi being Hokage can change the rule. Tsunade points out this situation is different, as the rule was made at a time when there was a boom in shinobi weddings during a war, and that Kakashi should rule as he sees fit. Iruka comes across a distressed Hinata, and wrongly assumes Naruto is to blame, and starts to apologise for him. Hinata finds it hilarious. Iruka talks with Kakashi, and gives him an idea, while also telling Konohamaru that Hinata found out about the mission, so his video is no longer a surprise. Kakashi asks the other Kage if they can spare shinobi for the missions of the day of the wedding, and Konohamaru tries recording a message from them.
