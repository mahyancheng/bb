Yokaze
 (
ヨカゼ
) is a
medical-nin
 from
Konohagakure
.

Personality

Yokaze always wanted to become a member of the
Anbu
 of his village and therefore admires those who hail from the unit. He is very sacrificial, protecting Yūgao from a serious attack under the cost of his own good health.

Appearance

Yokaze has long, wavy brown hair tied in a low ponytail, and black eyes. He wears the
Allied Shinobi Forces
'
forehead protector
, and a medical gown over his
flak jacket
. During the pursuit to retrieve the KIA scroll, he wears a standard
Konoha
 uniform and lets his hair down.

Abilities

As a medical-nin, Yokaze is naturally adept at
chakra control
 which goes into the use of intricate
medical ninjutsu
. In battle, he carried a
sword
, and while he is not shown using it in battle, it can be assumed that he was at least adept in the use of
kenjutsu
. He is able to fight opponents, who wiped out entire platoons of at least
chūnin
-level shinobi single-handedly, on even terms. He seems to be skilled in
taijutsu
 as he was fast enough to jump into
Hayate Gekkō
's slash towards Yūgao and could immediately counter by delivering a kick that sent Hayate flying quite a distance.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Yokaze defends Yugao from Hayate's attack.



During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Yokaze was assigned to the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
. There, with the body count and casualty numbers rising, he marvelled as
Yūgao Uzuki
 completed her duties with great efficiency, wondering why someone from the
Anbu
 had been assigned to their division. Yokaze was later assigned to a team by
Sukui
, alongside
Sakura Haruno
 and
Iō
 to retrieve the KIA
scroll
 that was stolen by Hayate Gekkō, and two other unnamed
reincarnated
 shinobi from
Sunagakure
 and
Kumogakure
. During the battle, Yokaze threw his
sword
 to Yūgao for her to use, but she was still unable to get over the shock of having to fight her former lover and was not able to take up the sword. Yokaze later sustained an injury during the altercation, but was then attended to by Yūgao. He then confronted Yūgao and stated that Hayate wanted her to stop him. He gave his sword to Yūgao and told her that he would be fine and the reinforcements would arrive soon. Ultimately, the mission turned out as a success as they were able to not only retrieve the scroll, but seal away their comrade and the other two reincarnated shinobi.
