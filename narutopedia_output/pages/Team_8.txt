Team Kurenai
, also known as
Team 8
, was a ninja team led by
Kurenai Yūhi
. Its members are
Kiba Inuzuka
, his
ninken

Akamaru
,
Hinata Hyūga
, and
Shino Aburame
. The team specialises in tracking and locating through the use of the
Hyūga clan
's
Byakugan
, the
Aburame clan
's
bugs
, and the
Inuzuka clan
's
dogs
 as well as Kiba's own heightened sense of smell. When Kurenai became pregnant in Part II,
Kakashi Hatake
 took over as the squad leader on some of their missions.

Along with the other members of the
Konoha 11
, Team 8 had regrettably decided to personally kill
Sasuke Uchiha
 in order to stop him from sinking any lower as a
missing-nin
 and risk causing a devastating international war as a result, but were persuaded by
Naruto Uzumaki
 that he alone will take care of it.

Ultimately, however, Naruto was able to defeat Sasuke and turn him back to good. Alongside
Team Kakashi
, Team Kurenai was the only team not to lose any members throughout Part II (
Team Asuma
 losing
Asuma Sarutobi
,
Team Guy
 losing
Neji Hyūga
), though Kurenai herself was put on maternity leave to take care of her daughter
Mirai Sarutobi
. Presumably, she returned to active duty when her daughter was old enough. Hinata eventually married Naruto and later had two children with him,
Boruto Uzumaki
 and
Himawari Uzumaki
, while Kiba started dating
Tamaki
, and Shino became a teacher at the Academy.
