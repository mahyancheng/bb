Tobi

 Naruto away stating that six against two puts the odds in his favour. However, this was thwarted as

Guy

Violent — Leaf Adamantine-Strength Whirlwind
 technique and cause Tobi to go intangible and slip through Naruto letting Kakashi retrieve Naruto. Naruto is happy to see them, while Tobi states that two more shinobi doesn't make a difference against the power of his eyes and tailed beasts. Kakashi then states that they too have a Sharingan followed by Guy who states that to not underestimate him as he was Konoha's Sublime Green Beast of Prey.

Chapter 567

"
The Jinchūriki of the Village of Konoha
" (
木ノ葉の里の人柱力
,
Konoha no Sato no Jinchūriki
)

At the
Mountains' Graveyard
,
Sasuke
 breaks out of the hideout while elsewhere, having escaped the
samurai
,
Jūgo
 and
Suigetsu
 discuss Sasuke and
Karin
, as well as Suigetsu's goal to collect swords as they head to one of Orochimaru's hideouts. On the battlefield,
Naruto
 warns
Guy
 and
Kakashi
 about
Tobi
's abilities. As the
Five-Tails
 attacks, Guy
frees
 Naruto from the coral before seeing the beast turn on Tobi who
chains
 and
suppresses
 the Five-Tails, who is dismayed at being controlled in that manner. The
Eight-Tails
 tries crushing Tobi, but he simply
slips through it
. Tobi returns
Han
 back to his Version 2 form. Guy and Kakashi speculate that Tobi doesn't have full control over the tailed beasts. The Eight and
Nine-Tails
 speak to each other telepathically about the treatment of the tailed beasts and the Nine-Tails says that as the second strongest beast, going by tails, the Eight-Tails should just finish the battle already, and feigns sleep. The Eight-Tails snaps back, saying that this belief about their powers being defined by the number of tails is exactly why
Shukaku
 hated the Nine-Tails so much. Guy and Kakashi charge at the jinchūriki, intending to figure out which of the
Six Paths of Pain
 techniques each one used, only to conclude that Tobi isn't making them use Six Paths techniques because they already have strategies against those. Tobi praises them for figuring that out, and proceeds to make
Rōshi
 and
Utakata
 transform completely into their
respective

beasts
. Naruto falls out of
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
, and considers creating more shadow clones with the Nine-Tails' chakra as diversions.
B
 thinks that creating more clones would surely kill him, but the Eight-Tails points out that Naruto should already be on the brink of death, and thinks that the Nine-Tails has stopped taking Naruto's chakra for a while. The Six-Tails attacks Kakashi and Guy, who dodge. The Four-Tails tosses the Eight-Tails, and Naruto almost falls into its mouth, but resists being eaten by the Four-Tails, now back in Nine-Tails Chakra Mode, as the Nine-Tails opens one eye watching on.

Chapter 568

"
The Four-Tails: King of the Sage Monkeys
" (
四尾・仙猿の王
,
Yonbi: Sen'en no Ō
)

The
Four-Tails
 tosses the
Eight-Tails
 on the ground, and keeps forcing its mouth shut with
Naruto
 in it while the
Nine-Tails
 watches on.
Guy
 wants to save Naruto, but
Kakashi
 points out their own unfortunate situation between two attack fronts: the
Six-Tails
'
Wisdom Wolf Decay
 and the other jinchūriki's
chakra arms
. Kakashi creates a
shadow clone
 and
slices
 through the arms, while Guy
punches and burns
 the gas away. The Eight-Tails wraps its tentacles around the Four-Tails, telling it to let go of Naruto. The Eight-Tails tells the Nine-Tails it heard that it helped Naruto against
Madara
, the Nine-Tails saying it won't wag its tails to help its
jinchūriki
 as easily as the Eight-Tails. The Eight-Tails questions if it doesn't care at all about what happens to Naruto. The Nine-Tails recalls how many shinobi in the past have restrained it and denied it an identity. The Four-Tails closes its mouth. Naruto meets the Four-Tails, bound by
chains
. It asks if Naruto is there to take its power, and demands to be called by its proper name, making a boisterous introduction. Naruto apologises for not listening to Son Gokū, which impresses it. Naruto and Son Gokū discuss issues of recognition, identity, and existence. The Four-Tails laughs when Naruto says he's jealous of how
B
 and the Eight-Tails are with each other, before seeing Naruto is serious about it. Considering Naruto to be a better sight than
Tobi
, Son Gokū offers to help Naruto if he can undo the chains that bind it.

Chapter 569

"
Proof of Intentions!!
" (
意志の証明!!
,
Ishi no Shōmei!!
)

Son Gokū
 tells
Naruto
 that it won't become his ally even if he saves it, unless it can trust Naruto, who is OK with that.
Kurama
 ponders that it knows Naruto, and that nothing he can say will reach a
tailed beast
.
Tobi
 pulls Son towards himself with
chains
 intent on
absorbing
 them both.
B
's still trying to make Son open its mouth and release Naruto. Naruto fails to make Son open its mouth, and decides using the
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 to make Son puke him out, which it does. B celebrates it. Son tells Naruto that the
chakra receiver
 in him slid from its chest to its neck because of the full
tailed beast transformation
. Naruto spots it, enters in his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
, and sets out to remove it, apologising to Son in advance if he needs to get rough. Naruto
pulls
 himself towards the receiver. Tobi tries binding Naruto with the chains. Kurama recalls Naruto's past achievements, and thinks that if Naruto truly wants to help tailed beasts, that he should do like he always has and act. Naruto tries pulling out the chakra receiver, while a clone he left inside Son enters
Sage Mode
 tries
pushing it
 from the inside.

Chapter 570

"
Kurama!!
" (
九喇嘛!!
,
Kurama!!
)

After
Naruto
 successfully removes the
chakra receiver
,
Tobi
 instantly summons the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 and reseals
Son Gokū
, but not before it leaves Naruto with a parting gift. With a declaration that he intends to go all-out from this point on because they had something that belonged to him, Tobi forces the remaining five jinchūriki into their respective full tailed beast forms. As
Kakashi
 and
Guy
 watch on in shock,
Kurama
 tells Naruto that it is willing to lend him more of its power. Somewhat taken back by this, Naruto then proceeds to thank Kurama for helping him during his brief battle with
Madara Uchiha
, to which the fox rebuffs. Naruto then chastises Kurama for the manner in which he took gratitude before the fox — offering him its fist — tells Naruto to meld his chakra with its own. Bumping fists with Kurama, Naruto stands and tells
B
 and the
Eight-Tails
 that he was ready to go again. They however tell him that they would take the front lines while Naruto acts as support since he was unable to attain the Tailed Beast Mode. Naruto however declines this manoeuvre, leading the Eight-Tails to wonder if Kurama had finally come around. As Naruto places his hand on the seal on his stomach and opens the
gates
 that held Kurama back, he acknowledges Kurama that it was no longer the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox, but a comrade from
Konohagakure
.

Chapter 571

"
Tailed Beast Mode!!
" (
尾獣モード!!
,
Bijū Mōdo!!
)

With the gates opened,
Naruto
 assumes a
new form
. With no time to waste as the opposing tailed beasts prepare to attack
Guy
 and
Kakashi
 with their
Tailed Beast Balls
, Naruto intervenes and deflects the attacks with such speed that Kakashi mistakes him for his own former
teacher
. As the beasts rally again and prepare to attack the shinobi, Naruto transforms into Kurama — seemingly "absorbing" Guy and Kakashi into the beast's chakra for safe-keeping. After creating a clone and being told by Kurama that he probably had only five minutes in the form because it was his first transformation into the beast, Naruto tells him that five minutes was plenty of time. With this, he attacks the
Seven-Tails
 mid-air, intending to pile-drive the beast into the
Three-Tails
 but the giant turtle rolls out of the way. Before he can attack once again, the
Six-Tails
 swallows the beast's hand, immobilising him and allowing the Three-Tails to attack. The Three-Tails' attack is stopped by the
Eight-Tails
 however. Wasting no time as the
Two-Tails
 now prepared to attack, Naruto swings the Six-Tails into the Two-Tails as
B
 deals with the
Five-Tails
. The clone — who had entered
Sage Mode
 — reports that he had located all the chakra receivers on the other beasts' bodies. Naruto then watches on as the other tailed beasts prepare a collaborative Tailed Beast Ball, subsequently preparing one of his own along with Kurama, intending to cancel out the force of the attack.

Chapter 572

"
Nine Names
" (
九つの名前
,
Kokonotsu no Namae
)

As
Naruto
 and
Kurama
's
Tailed Beast Ball
 collide with those of the opposing
tailed beasts
, both attacks fly upwards and explode. Using the opportunity to
grab
 the beasts by the throat, Naruto sends clones in the initial
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 to grab hold of the
black receivers
. As they do so, the original enters the consciousness of the tailed beasts who had all been waiting there with their respective
jinchūriki
 and is greeted by
Yugito
 who was pleased he had made it to this level. Welcoming him, Naruto and
Yagura
 — whom the former starts pitying believing the former
Mizukage
 to be a child who looked even weaker than Naruto did — have a brief conversation. After learning of
Son Gokū
 and
Rōshi
's fate from
Fū
, he is summoned before the tailed beast and told to stretch out his hand. After
Utakata
 and
Han
 thank Naruto, one by one, tailed beast and jinchūriki alike introduce themselves to Naruto and then "bump fists" with him. Here, Kurama remembers the parting words of
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
 and then — as the stakes are removed — asks his fellow tailed beast if they too believed as Son did that Naruto was the one that the Sage had spoken of so long ago. They all affirm them as a shocked
Tobi
 reseals them into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
. Though stating that nothing had changed because of his worn out condition after the
Tailed Beast Mode
 had ended, Naruto refutes Tobi's claim, stating that he had just learned a bunch of difficult names all at once.

Chapter 573

"
The Continuing Path towards Radiance
" (
輝きへと続く道
,
Kagayaki e to Tsuzuku Michi
)

Tobi
 is confused by
Naruto
's claim of learning difficult names, which Naruto teases him for.
Guy
 and
Kakashi
 discuss now Naruto's progress is making them feel old, though not that old. Tobi begins to sweat, but believes it to be the rain that's starting to fall. Tobi gets a strange feeling from Naruto, and concludes that the war will make everything irrelevant. At the Allied Shinobi HQ, Naruto's use of
Kurama
's chakra was felt, though they also feel something else.
Ao
 relays to events to
Shikaku
, who wants to use it to raise the army's morale all at once, despite the strain it would cause to communications. Naruto's friends from
Konoha
 all rush towards his direction, intent on supporting him. Elsewhere,
Sasuke
 also walks towards the battlefield as a thunderstorm begins.

Chapter 574

"
Eyes that See the Darkness
" (
闇を見る眼
,
Yami o Miru Me
)

In the
Konohagakure Intelligence Division
,
Karin
 feigns mental instability to lessen the guards attention to her, and begins plotting her escape with a lock-pick set hidden in her glasses and behind a portrait of
Sasuke
 she managed to keep with her.
Jūgo
 and
Suigetsu
 learn about the
war
, near one of
Orochimaru
's hideouts. Jūgo questions Suigetsu's reasons to be part of
Taka
, and while the two argue, Jūgo's killing instinct kicks in, and he attacks Suigetsu. Suigetsu simply
reforms
 and begins
drowning
 Jūgo to subdue him. He notices that the attack revealed a secret room, where Suigetsu discovers important intelligence gathered by Orochimaru. Sasuke runs into a group of
White Zetsu clones
, who question his presence outside, and realise he's killed the original
White Zetsu
 before attacking. Sasuke uses
Susanoo
 and
incinerates
 several of them. He interrogates one of the White Zetsu using genjutsu, and learns about the war and its purpose. Sasuke finishes the White Zetsu and decides to go kill
Naruto
. Sasuke is pleased with
Itachi
's eyes, and reminisces about him. Elsewhere, Itachi is on the move.

Chapter 575

"
Will of Stone
" (
石の意思
,
Ishi no Ishi
)

Ōnoki
 attacks
Madara
 with a giant
rock golem
, which Madara
destroys
, creating several flowers.
Tsunade
 recognises the technique as her grandfather's.
Gaara

suspends
 the Kage above the attack, Ōnoki levitating A. The flowers begin releasing a toxic pollen.
Kabuto
 muses on how people who heard of
Hashirama Senju
's strength consider it a myth, just like the
Sage of the Six Paths
, and that he'll show everyone that this is real.
Dodai
,
Genma
, and
Raidō
 give chase to
Mū
. Having steered the Kage's attention towards the flowers, Madara uses
Susanoo
 to knock them down from behind, throwing them at the flowers, and proceeds to
set the forest ablaze
.
Mei
 tries
putting out the fire
, but collapses due to the pollen, as do the other Kage. Ōnoki thinks back to his youth, talking to the
First Tsuchikage
 about the strong will of Iwa shinobi. Ōnoki musters enough strength to
destroy
 the flowers and injure Madara. The other Kage regain consciousness just in time to see the face formed from the DNA of the
First Hokage
 in Madara's chest. Kabuto gushes on how Orochimaru's experiments are nothing compared to his ultimate trump card. Elsewhere,
Sasuke
 detects someone in the woods nearby. Taking out his sword, he goes to investigate it, only to be shocked at seeing
Itachi
.

Author's Note

“

For quite some time now, there have been occasions when I think of ideas while in the tub. It's because the blood flow to my head improves and makes it easier for ideas to spring forth. However, I cannot take notes in the tub... And after I get out of the tub, before I realise it, I've ended up forgetting what those ideas inside my head were. Both my mind and body has been washed clean.
