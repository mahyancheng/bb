The user creates a gigantic wooden dragon, which they can use for a multitude of purposes including restraining a target, or for offensive purposes. The dragon that the user creates can vary in terms of appearance. While both instances created a serpentine dragon,
Chinese dragon
, though the first had a short trunk-like nose, while the other two later created did not. It also has the ability to
absorb
 chakra from its target, slowly rendering them unable to use techniques by biting into the target and draining them almost in a vampiric fashion.
 In the anime, Hashirama was able to cause the dragon to detonate on his target, resulting in a large explosion.

Countering

Despite being a formidable technique, it was shown that if the wood dragon's head is destroyed, its ability to consume chakra is eliminated. Both
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Kurama
 countered it this way by destroying the head with a
Body Flicker Technique
 and
Tailed Beast Ball
 combination respectively.

Madara Uchiha
 would also counter it with his
Susanoo
, deflecting its attempts to drain his chakra with a sword.

Influence

The dragon created by this technique resembles a creature predominantly seen in Hindu mythology known as the
Makara
. Over time, the myth surrounding this creature has spread throughout most of Asia, and in Chinese renditions of the creature it most resembles this one: a dragon with an elephant's trunk.

Trivia

In the anime, Hashirama's generic dragon is depicted the same as the trunk-like nosed dragon.

Hashirama noted that the chakra absorption feature of this technique negates the
Chakra Absorption Techniques
 of a bound target.

When the
Wood Release: Wood Human Technique
 was used, this dragon encircles the creature's torso.

In certain parts of Japanese mythology, dragons are considered deities with power over wood, forests, and water, likely a reference to Hashirama's Wood Release.
