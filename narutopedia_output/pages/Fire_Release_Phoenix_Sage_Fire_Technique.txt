The user spits a volley of small fireballs into the air; at a glance, it can appear as though there was only one fireball that then burst into many. The many small flames move wildly through the area, potentially mesmerising targets as they're surrounded. The user controls each individual flame with their
chakra
, allowing them to guide each at the target and, consequently, making this technique difficult to evade.
Shuriken
 can be hidden within the flames, not only making them more deadly upon impact but also, by controlling the flames' movements, giving users a means of controlling the shuriken as well.

Trivia

This technique's name is a pun on
balsam
 (
鳳仙花
,
Hōsenka
,
literally meaning:
 phoenix sage flower), a type of flower. In fact, when the technique was first used in chapter 46, it was written as "Fire Release: Phoenix Sage Flower Technique" (
火遁・鳳仙花の術
,
Katon: Hōsenka no Jutsu
).
