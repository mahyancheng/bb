Summary

Sasuke
 and
Naruto
 are becoming exhausted by
Haku
's relentless attacks. However, the attacks are becoming increasingly less successful, with Sasuke slowly being able to not only follow Haku's fast movements but to react and avoid the attacks entirely. Realising that this is because Sasuke has awakened his own
Sharingan
 eyes, Haku moves to kill Naruto so that he will have an easier time fighting Sasuke. Meanwhile,
Kakashi
 has been badly wounded by
Zabuza
. Zabuza points out that he will soon die just like Sasuke and Naruto, but Kakashi has faith in them in their survival. Elsewhere, Naruto finds that Sasuke has used himself as a shield against Haku's attack. Naruto asks why Sasuke would do that, but Sasuke does not know why. He laments that he did not have a chance to kill
his brother
 before seeming to die. Enraged by the loss of Sasuke, Naruto vows to kill Haku.
