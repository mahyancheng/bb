These are the choice weapons of the
Demon Brothers
. They are a pair of large, metal
gauntlets
 — each brother wore one — which also housed a long, retractable
shuriken
 chain running between the two, which is used to bind an enemy and then shred them to pieces. In the event that the shuriken chain is neutralised, the gauntlets also have a release mechanism to free the user for individual attacks with the sharp claws on the fingers,
poisoned
 for further lethality.
