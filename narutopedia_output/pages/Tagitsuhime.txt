Tagitsuhime
 (
タギツヒメ
) is an inhabitant of the
Ryūchi Cave
.

Personality

Tagitsuhime appears to be more ruthless than her cohorts, as she attacks Boruto abruptly and without warning. However, like the other two, she shows respect to those who pass the three trials.

Appearance

Although appearing to be one, Tagitsuhime is not a human. When disguised as one, she has fair skin and dark hair that is tied into a single bun on top of her head, which then transitions into a ponytail reaching her back. She wears a long, loose-fitting white and red robe as well as a longer red dress beneath that. She wears a golden tiara and a necklace with three red tomoe.

Abilities

Upon biting her opponent, Tagitsuhime is capable of casting a
genjutsu
 that causes her victim to see apparitions of their comrades speaking of the doubts and confusion within their heart. The genjutsu can be broken if one has enough conviction in themselves. She is also capable of levitation, eating another's chakra, and achieving a snake-like form.

Mitsuki's Disappearance Arc

As soon as
Boruto
 had passed
Ichikishimahime
's trial, Tagitsuhime flew from behind and bit Boruto's neck, allowing her to cast her genjutsu on him, which caused images of his friends to come before Boruto and speak of all the harm and mistakes he has made recently. However, Boruto was able to overcome them, and after doing so, was greeted by Tagitsuhime, who took him to see his unconscious friends as well as the
White Snake Sage
. Tagitsuhime later watched Boruto and the others leave to find
Garaga
. She asked the Sage for making that promise, but the Sage doubted they would survive facing Garaga at all.

Trivia

Her name is likely derived from Tagitsu-hime-no-kami (湍津姫神), one of three goddesses enshrined at
Munakata Shrine
.
