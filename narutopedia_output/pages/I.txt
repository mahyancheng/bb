Iō
 (
イオウ
) is a ninja weapon inventor from
Konoha
. He and his assistant,
Shōseki
, help make weapons for the village.

Background

Most of his original weapons are shown to either be impossible to carry or serve no purpose at all. It is assumed he was relocated to the outskirts of the village due to the random explosions he creates, which he claims are "challenges" during his inventing.

Personality

Iō has a very eccentric personality and has a great love for creating weapons without thinking of the consequences, even creating weapons that were either impossible to use because they served no purpose or were too "over-the-top". He is also shown to resent not being able to experiment with his creations. Despite being relocated and not allowed to pursue his experiments within Konohagakure, Iō has shown great loyalty to his village, refusing to make or give his weapons to anyone else.

Appearance

Iō is a small, balding man with grey hair, a small moustache and goatee. He wears a pair of gloves with bandages around his arms, a high-collared jacket, black trousers, sandals and a
blacksmith's
 apron with the village symbol on it.

Abilities

He is very knowledgeable in the art of creating ninja tools, able to create unorthodox yet dangerous weapons like
Tsurukame
,
Dakō
 or
Jidanda
, showing a high level of technical knowledge. However, most of these unorthodox inventions are useless for combat. He has also shown rather skilled at laying traps, as well as proficiency with the
Enclosing Technique
, using it to store some of his creations.

Part II

Past Arc: The Locus of Konoha

Neji Hyūga
,
Tenten
, and
Naruto Uzumaki
 go to the
Konoha Tool Research Lab
 to retrieve more tools for the village. When checking up on their progress, they see that Iō and his assistant went down the research lab to work on Iō's newest weapon. Suddenly, two ninja,
Gameru
 and
Kusune
 arrive in the research lab and demand new weapons from Iō. They both possessed two of his prototype weapons that Shōseki sold to them. Iō gave Tenten his newest weapon, Jidanda, which she used to defeat both the ninja. Iō then took Jidanda back from Tenten after the ninja were defeated, saying more work needed to be done on the weapon.

Three years later, Tenten and Neji Hyūga return to the research lab to retrieve more tools for the village after its
destruction
.
