An example of shape manipulation.



Shape Transformation
 (
形態変化
,
Keitai Henka
,
English TV:
 Change in Chakra Form) is an advanced form of
chakra control
 that involves controlling the form, movement, and potency of one's
chakra
, determining the size, range, and purpose of a
technique
.

The ultimate example of shape manipulation is the
Rasengan
, which is described as shape manipulation that has been taken "to the highest possible level".
 The Rasengan relies heavily on chakra control and does not require the use of
hand seals
. By building up on precepts learned from the
Tree Climbing Practice
 and
Water Surface Walking Practice
 chakra control exercises, the Rasengan is chakra that has been rotated and then compressed into the shape of a sphere.

Shape transformation is one of two necessary components for creating or modifying a technique, the second component being
nature transformation
. While shape transformation changes the form and movement of chakra, nature transformation changes the actual attribute of the chakra, altering its properties and characteristics. Because of this, a technique like the Rasengan can be turned into the
Wind Release: Rasengan
 or
Wind Release: Rasenshuriken
. The cutting nature of
Wind Release
, combined with the spiralling movement of chakra, can change the chakra into millions of minuscule blades in a spiralling formation. In the anime, when
ninjutsu
 and elemental ninjutsu was first developed by
Indra Ōtsutsuki
, there was little to no shape transformation used in the primitive techniques he mastered and taught.

Jinchūriki
, when transforming through their progressive
forms
 into their
tailed beast
, have their chakra moulded around them to resemble the shape of their tailed beast.
 Through further transformations, the tailed beast chakra can materialise into the flesh and bone of the tailed beast.
