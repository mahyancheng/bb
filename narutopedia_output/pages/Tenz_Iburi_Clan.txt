This article is about a member of the Iburi clan. For the Konoha-nin, see
Yamato
.

Tenzō
 (
テンゾウ
,
Tenzō
) was a member of the
Iburi clan
 and the younger brother of
Yukimi
.

Background






Tenzō follows Orochimaru.



Tenzō was born into the Iburi clan which was able to
transform into smoke
. However, their own ability was the biggest threat to the clan as they were unable to fully control it. Due to the danger wind posed to them, they were forced to live in caves. Nevertheless, Tenzō and his older sister Yukimi had to witness many clan members disappear in agony right under their eyes while they were unable to help them.

One day a
shinobi
 from
Konohagakure
, the
Sannin

Orochimaru
, visited the cave and promised to save the clan by providing them with his
Cursed Seal
, which helped temporarily. To improve the control of the clan's ability, he said that he needed a young member of the clan to act as a test subject for his research. Tenzō was chosen to go with Orochimaru and eventually met his end in one of the several research tanks in which Orochimaru was testing various experiments.

Appearance

Tenzō was a small boy with short brown hair and dark eyes. He apparently resembles
Kinoe
, as his sister mistook him for Tenzō. He wore a blue tank-top shirt and pants.

Abilities

Like the rest of his clan, Tenzō was able to transform into smoke. When being younger, the ability manifests itself much greater. It was for that circumstance that Tenzō was chosen by Orochimaru to be his test object.

Legacy

When Kinoe left the
Root
 Division of Konohagakure's ANBU, deciding to start fresh at the suggestions of
Kakashi Hatake
, Kinoe decided to take on the name of "Tenzō" as he did not know his true name and grew fond of Yukimi referring to him as such.
