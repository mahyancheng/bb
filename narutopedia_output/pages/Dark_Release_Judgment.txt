Hiruko
 converts the
chakra
 absorbed from the Dark Release: Inhaling Maw technique into light blue flames, turning it back on his enemies with amplified strength to blow them away. The flames are expelled through the lower square of the mark on Hiruko's left hand.

Trivia

The technique's name is a pun, similar to certain techniques of
Kumogakure
 ninja, in which it has an
English name with a given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation
.

The light blue flames seen in this technique are likely a reference to the "Will-o-Wisp," as the "Dark" (
冥
,
kurai
) in "Dark Release" (
冥遁
,
Meiton
) means 'gloomy; ghostly; night; underworld'.
