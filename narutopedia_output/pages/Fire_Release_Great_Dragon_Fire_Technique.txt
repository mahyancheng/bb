The user compresses a large amount of chakra built up inside their body and changes it into a dragon head-shaped fireball. The user then skillfully manipulates that great fire, and attacks their opponent. Even outside of the attack range, its power and reliability are stressed.

The flames have a high temperature, which can create an upward movement of air currents which in turn can give rise to
thunder clouds
. A master of this technique can fire off several flames in succession and anyone caught in the technique could potentially be reduced to ashes.

Trivia

This technique is a part of the setup that Sasuke uses in order to perform his
Kirin
 technique.
