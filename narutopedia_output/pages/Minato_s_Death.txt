"
Minato's Death
" (
ミナトの死
,
Minato no Shi
) is episode 350 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

The
Konoha
-nin posted on the outskirts of the village as guards are attacked by ninja disguised as members of
Iwagakure
. Their assault is quickly ended when an
Anbu
 detail arrives on the scene and chases them away.
Kakashi
 pursues them and kills them all using his
Chidori
. News of his actions reach a perturbed
Minato
 who speaks with Kakashi, informing him that
Kushina
 was pregnant and asking that Kakashi act as her guard due to the complications that arose from her also being a
jinchūriki
.
 Dutifully taking the mission, Kakashi informs
Rin
 of the new developments, unbeknownst to him that the
masked man
 was eavesdropping from a distance. The event that followed culminated in the
Nine-Tails
 wreaking havoc on the village before it was sealed within the newborn
Naruto
. Shortly before dying, Kushina tells
Hiruzen
 the child's name and pleads with him to protect him — an oath which the Third swears to. With the
Hokage
 seat once again vacant, Hiruzen resumes the post until they can groom someone else for the post. Kakashi is inveigled by
Danzō
 to join
Root
, and upon reporting to the war-hawk, he encounters
another Anbu
 with the ability to use
Wood Release
.
