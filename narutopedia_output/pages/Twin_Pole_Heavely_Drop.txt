After separating, Sakon and Ukon place themselves so that their opponent is in between them. They both lunge at the opponent, switching places and knocking them into the air. While the opponent is airborne, they jump into the air, and both grab an opponent's arm. They then both spin rapidly until the opponent's head makes contact with the ground.
