The user creates a number of gigantic wooden hands that erupt upward from beneath the ground, which then encircle and attempt to restrain a chosen enemy. The size of each of these hands is around the size of a
tailed beast
. Hashirama is shown to be able to manifest two hands with sheer will alone, without the use of hand seals.

Influence

This technique seems to be influenced by
Budai

Budai
), also known as
Hotei
 in Japanese. He is almost always shown smiling or laughing, hence his nickname: the Laughing Buddha. In Japan, Hotei persists in folklore as one of the
Seven Lucky Gods
 of Taoism.
