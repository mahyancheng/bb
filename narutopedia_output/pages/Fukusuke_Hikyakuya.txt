Land of Tea Escort Mission

Aoi Rokushō
 and
Team Oboro
 turned out to be the bodyguard for Fukusuke. The leader of
Wagarashi family
,
Kyūroku Wagarashi
, hired them to take care of
Idate Morino
 for him.

When it came to the race, Fukusuke was ahead thanks to Team Oboro. When it came to the next part of the race, Fukusuke tells Aoi that he'd better make sure Idate doesn't catch up. Before sending Fukusuke on his way, Aoi grabs Fukusuke and warns him that if he threatens him again, he will break him in half.

Idate
 managed to catch up and outrun Fukusuke at the last minute. Fukusuke was beaten up by two members of Wagarashi family who state that he has dishonoured the Wagarashi family and had better prepare for what's coming to him. Fukusuke begs for forgiveness. When Kyūroku and the
Tea Daimyō's minister
 try to have Idate disqualified for assistance in getting to the checkpoint and declare Fukusuke the winner, the
daimyō
 intervenes, stating that there is no rule against that. After the Wagarashi family was ordered to be disbanded, Fukusuke's current location and status are unknown.
