Trivia

In the Japanese manga, anime, and in the English manga, Shiore is always referred to as a male. In the English dub and some Japanese subtitled versions, Shiore is referred to as a woman until it's revealed that it was Orochimaru in disguise.

The kanji (written three times) on the talisman hanging on Shiore's conical straw hat reads "Aku", which means "evil".

Shiore's name was revealed only in the
Naruto Anime Profiles
.
