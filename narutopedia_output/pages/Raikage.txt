The Raikage's hat.



The
Raikage
 (
雷影
,
literally meaning:
 Lightning Shadow) is the
Kage
 of
Kumogakure
, a title bestowed on the village's leader. The Raikage is generally regarded as the strongest shinobi in the village. There have been five Raikage in the village's history.

Overview

The Raikage position was created after the formation of Kumo by
A
, the village's founder, that in anime was the second of the five Kage to emerge.
 How the Raikage is selected isn't clear; The
Second
 was appointed for his long service and dedication as the bodyguard of the First Raikage
 and after the
Third
 died, his son automatically became
Fourth Raikage
, a decision made many years earlier.
 Generally, the Raikage is known for its strong desire to protect the village and its inhabitants as well as for its pride. The Raikage works inside a
central blue structure
 inside Kumogakure.

Throughout Kumo's history, the first four Raikage each had the given name
A
 (
