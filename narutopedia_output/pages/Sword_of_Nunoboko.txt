The
Sword of Nunoboko
 is a massive sword shaped like a double helix, formed from
Truth-Seeking Balls
, and was originally wielded by
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
.

Usage

According to
Obito Uchiha
, this sword is a holy relic once used by the Sage of Six Paths to "create the world" and, in Obito's hands, could just as easily destroy it.
 When wielded by Obito, the blade was partially destroyed by
Sasuke Uchiha
's
Susanoo Sword
 while enhanced by
senjutsu
 and
Kurama
's
chakra
.

Trivia

The sword's shape is based on the double-helical form of
DNA
, a molecular structure existing in all known living organisms.

Obito has described the weapon as a "
A sword in which the strength of one's emotions dwells… A Sword of the Heart…
" (
想いの強さが剣に宿る⋯ 心の剣⋯
,
omoi no tsuyosa ga ken ni yadoru… Kokoro no Ken…
).

The sword's name, as well as the legend of it being the tool used by Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki to "create the world", is likely a reference to the
Amenonuhoko
 (
天沼矛
,
literally meaning:
 Heavenly Jewelled Spear). In legend, Amenonuhoko was the spear used to raise the primordial land from the sea. It was later used by
Izanami
 and
Izanagi
 to create the first island, on which they then dwelt.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
,
Obito Uchiha
 and
Kakashi Hatake
 combine this technique with
Lightning Cutter
, to break through
Madara Uchiha
's
shell
.
