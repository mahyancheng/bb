 manga.

Summary

The day of the
Chūnin Exams
 finals has arrived.
Naruto
 is worried about his upcoming match with
Neji
 and takes a detour on his way to the stadium where the finals will be held. He finds
Hinata
 training along the way and speaks with her. Naruto tells her his concerns and how he, a "failure", may not be able to defeat Neji, a "genius". Hinata assures him that it is because he is not perfect, not a "genius", that he will win, as he constantly strives to improve himself, which she finds inspiring. Naruto thanks her and asks her to come watch him defeat Neji. He arrives at the stadium and stands with the other seven finalists before the audience.
