"
Naruto's Favourite Pupil
" (
ナルトの愛弟子
,
Naruto no Manadeshi
) is episode 234 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Konohamaru
,
Udon
 and
Moegi
 are training to prepare for the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, with Konohamaru perfecting his new technique —
Fire Release: Ash Pile Burning
. After asking
Sakura
 how they could aid in the war effort, she makes them carry and stock boxes. Konohamaru, wanting something more important to do, leaves with his team ranting. They approach
Shikamaru
, who asks Konohamaru who the "King" he must protect is and writes the kanji for 'king' on a stone shaped like a
shōgi
 piece and gives it to him. Konohamaru then goes to see
Tsunade
 for permission to join the front lines, who outright refuses and tosses him out.

Team Ebisu
 then spots
Temari
, who has arrived to deliver a message from
Suna
 as well as check on the state of
Konoha
 following
Pain's assault
. Konohamaru decides to engage in combat against Temari, introducing himself and claiming to be
Naruto
's favourite pupil. However, Temari uses her
Sickle Weasel Technique
 to easily dispel Konohamaru's Ash Pile Burning technique as well as his
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
. Temari insults Naruto, and in anger, Konohamaru rushes toward her with his
Rasengan
. Shikamaru, who had been alerted of the battle earlier by Moegi and Udon, uses his
Shadow Sewing Technique
 to save Temari from being struck by the Rasengan. Temari is shocked that Konohamaru mastered such a devastating technique and tells Konohamaru that he would be a fine
shinobi
 someday, and that she would report to
Gaara
 about Konoha's new generation. Meanwhile, Moegi tells Konohamaru that as
genin
, their duty is to protect the children and seniors of the village, and Konohamaru realises that they are the "king" he is to protect, and declares to Shikamaru that he would fight Naruto for the title of
Hokage
 one day.

Shikamaru reports the outcome of the battle to Tsunade, who is reminded of her little brother
Nawaki
, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Konohamaru; in addition, they both proclaimed themselves as future Hokage who would protect Konoha as grandsons of the former Hokage. Nawaki also reminds her of Naruto, and she wonders what Naruto may be up to now.

Trivia

In this episode, Shikamaru uses the
Shadow–Neck Binding Technique
 in a similar manner to the
Shadow Sewing Technique
. This is most likely an animation error.
