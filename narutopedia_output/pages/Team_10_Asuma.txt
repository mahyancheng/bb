This article is about the team led by Asuma Sarutobi.  For other uses, see
Team 10
.

Team Asuma
, also known as
Team 10
, is a generation in the
Ino–Shika–Chō Trio
 (
いの しか ちょうトリオ
,
Ino–Shika–Chō Torio
). As such, the three team members are good friends and
have exceptional team work
, although they tend to bicker from time to time. All three members of Team 10 are skilled at stalling opponents. They were led by Asuma until his death in Part II. Kakashi led them temporarily after that to help them avenge Asuma's death. The team is assumed to still be active, although without a permanent leader.

During the time-skip in the anime, for the second
Chūnin Exams
, Sakura (whose other teammates were not in the village) temporarily joined the formation, as a team of three is required. Asuma placed Shikamaru in charge, having already become a
chūnin
.

Along with the other members of the
Konoha 11
, Team 10 had regrettably decided to kill
Sasuke Uchiha
 after he attacked
Kumogakure
 on behalf of
Akatsuki
 in order to stop him from sinking any lower as a
missing-nin
 and risk causing a devastating international war as a result. However,
Naruto Uzumaki
 persuaded them that he will deal with Sasuke alone.

Shikamaru was eventually promoted to jōnin and became Naruto's advisor and right-hand man when he became Hokage, and married
Temari
 and had a son named
Shikadai
. Ino married
Sai
 after taking her father's duties for the
Shinobi Union
, and had a son named
Inojin
. Chōji married
Karui
 and had a daughter named
Chōchō
.

When
Asuma
 died fighting the
Akatsuki
 member
Hidan
, the three swore revenge and stayed together under the name "Team 10", albeit without a
jōnin
 commander. When they prepared to depart on the day the duo had promised to return, Tsunade, however, objected to them recklessly seeking revenge even with Shikamaru's plan, and forbade them from undertaking the mission, as they do not qualify as the standard four-man cell. However,
Kakashi Hatake
 opted to lead the squad on this mission. The team's revenge was consummated with the defeat of Hidan whom Shikamaru trapped within the
Nara Clan Forest
, and
Kakuzu
's death, with backup from the rest of
Team Kakashi
.

Trivia

Asuma gave all three of his students a pair of silver knob earrings,
 as part of a
tradition
 where a
Sarutobi
 gives the members of the
Yamanaka
,
Nara
 and
Akimichi
 clans earrings when they are promoted to the rank of chūnin.

The name "Ino–Shika–Chō" is a reference to a card combination in the
Hanafuda card game
,
Koi-Koi
; Inoshikachō uses the Boar (
猪
,
Ino
), the Deer (
鹿
,
Shika
), and the Butterfly (
蝶
,
Chō
).

According to
Sakura Haruno
,
Team 7
 has the best teamwork with Team 10.

In the anime, Sakura became a temporary member of the team in order for her, Chōji, and Ino to take part in their second
Chūnin Exams
, Shikamaru having already been promoted, and Sakura's team-mates not being in the village at the time.

When Team 10 was introduced properly during the Chūnin Exams, Naruto commented on them with the less-than-flattering nickname The Idiot (O-baka) trio, referring to each members' most obvious and annoying habit (food for Chōji, complaining for Shikamaru, and obsessing with
Sasuke
 for Ino).
