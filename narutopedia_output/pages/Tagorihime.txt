Mitsuki's Disappearance Arc






Tagorihime welcomes the Konoha genin.



When
Boruto
 and his friends arrived at Ryūchi Cave, Tagorihime and her comrades observed them from among some trees. Later on, she would be the first to put them through a trial, which involved casting a genjutsu over dangerous foods to make them appear as a feast in order to get them to eat it. However, due to slipping up and mentioning
Mitsuki
's name despite none of the Konoha shinobi mentioning his name, Boruto saw through her trick. Although she was angry at being unable to eat their chakra, she still allowed the children to continue onward. Tagorihime later watched Boruto and the others leave to find
Garaga
.

Trivia

Her name is likely derived from Tagori-hime-no-kami (田心姫神), one of three goddesses enshrined at
Munakata Taisha
.
