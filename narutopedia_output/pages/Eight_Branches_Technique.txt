This is Orochimaru's greatest and strongest
snake
-related technique. Using the "power of reincarnation" possessed by the White Snake as an intermediary, he can transform into a giant white serpent with eight heads and eight tails. The serpent boasts a giant body, even larger than that of
Manda
, who was feared as the "strongest colossal serpent". Just by crawling on the scales of its abdomen it was able to trample the
Uchiha hideout
, and could destroy most things without difficulty. This technique transcends the "Snake", and becomes like a "Dragon God".

When using this technique, Orochimaru can emerge from the mouth of one of the heads and use his
Sword of Kusanagi
 to attack.

Trivia

The name of this technique comes from the legendary snake
Yamata no Orochi
, a  monstrous eight-headed and eight-tailed snake that was destroyed by the god
Susanoo-no-Mikoto
. This is referenced when
Itachi
's
Susanoo
 killed the serpents produced by this technique.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2
, the eight snakes' heads can unite to create a devastating energy attack similar to a
Tailed Beast Ball
 from a
tailed beast
 that was powerful enough to overwhelm the defences of Itachi's armoured
Susanoo
, even with it using its
Yata Mirror
 for defence.

Despite the fact that this technique was stated to be the product of Orochimaru's years of human experimentation and the
Living Corpse Reincarnation
 technique in the manga,
 in the anime, it was stated that Orochimaru, upon defecting from
Konohagakure
, stole the
scroll
 from the
Hokage Residence
 with the information on this
kinjutsu
.
