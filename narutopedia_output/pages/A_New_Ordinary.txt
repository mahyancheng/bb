Synopsis

The Konoha
genin
 take the Thunder Train back to
Konohagakure
, while
Naruto
 stays in
Iwagakure
 longer to attend
Ōnoki
's funeral.
Mitsuki
 is confined to a different railcar, under supervision of
Sai
 and
Konohamaru
.
Boruto
 wishes he could have talked to Mitsuki before being separated.
Shikadai
 tries to distract
Inojin
 from
Akkun
's death. Besides the Five
Kage
 and high ranking Iwagakure officials, many villagers come to pay their respects. Boruto and
Sarada
 return home to their worried families. Back at the village, Naruto wants to praise Boruto and Sarada for standing up for Mitsuki, but Sai and
Shikamaru
 point out he can't, so as punishment, he means to remove their genin rank. They ask about Mitsuki, and are told he's still being debriefed, as there's a lot of intel only he knows. Naruto has them leave their forehead protectors. Sai and Konohamaru debrief Mitsuki, and ask him why he chose against informing anyone in the village of his plans. Sarada is concerned Mitsuki will be blamed for the situation in Iwagakure and be forced to leave, or that he might chose to leave on his own. Boruto has faith in Mitsuki. While asleep, he is mentally contacted by
Garaga
, since Mitsuki being back in the village marks the end of their contract.
 They exchange words and bid each other farewell. Sarada wakes him up, and informs him Mitsuki's debriefing is over. The two look for him. Mitsuki makes small memorials for the Fabrications. Boruto finds him, and Mitsuki apologises for the hurt he's caused. Boruto recalls Ōnoki's words, and tells Mitsuki there are many sides to his will, and that his questions are a natural part of it. Sarada arrives and they share a laugh.
Orochimaru
 discusses Mitsuki's development with
Log
, who informs him the body of the scientist responsible for developing the Fabrications has gone missing. They wonder
who
 might be responsible. Boruto, Sarada, and Mitsuki walk through the village, and hear the official account of the situation of Iwagakure in the news. Boruto thinks he spots a Heart Stone in the river, but cries when he remembers Ōnoki's teachings. As their sensei, Konohamaru wants to take responsibility for their actions, but before they can decide anything,
Kurotsuchi
 and
Akatsuchi
 arrive from Iwagakure, and want to personally thank the Konoha genin for their actions, adding they'll always consider them shinobi at Iwagakure. Naruto understands what she means, Team 7 has their genin status reinstated, and they prepare for their next mission.
