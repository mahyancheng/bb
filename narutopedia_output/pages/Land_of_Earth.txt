The Land of Earth.



The
Land of Earth
 (
土の国
,
Tsuchi no Kuni
) has seen little attention in the series thus far. It is located north-west of the
Land of Fire
. Its government leader is the
Earth Daimyō
. The country is mostly comprised of desolate, rocky areas. The border of the Land of Earth runs along a rocky mountain range, blocking communication with other countries. The wind blowing from the north passes over these mountains, carrying small rocks from the Land of Earth to the surrounding countries. This famous natural phenomenon is called "Rock Rain" (
岩雨
,
Gan'u
).

The
"Rock
Rice Cake
"
 (
岩餅
,
Iwa Mochi
,
English TV:
 Rock Mochi) is a regional specialty of the Land of Earth. The crispy texture of the rice cakes is said to be irresistible.
