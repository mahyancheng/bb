.
Shikamaru
, with the help of
Ino
's
technique
, devises a last-minute plan to counter its powerful attack by creating a
barrier
 and at the same time have
B
 shoot Tailed Beast Balls to change its trajectory. However, the ball manages to pierce through barriers created by the Alliance and B quickly blocks the ball on his own. The ball suddenly disappeared as
Minato
 arrives, telling the Alliance that he
teleported
 the ball to the sea.
 The other revived
Hokage

makes
 several

Sakura
 prepare themselves against the Ten-Tails. Meanwhile in the

 is briefly shown with normal sclerae instead of the black one, usual for those brought back with
