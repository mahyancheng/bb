Naruto, while in his
Tailed Beast Mode
, transfers his chakra to Hinata, who launches an Eight Trigrams Vacuum Palm at the opponent to knock them off balance before grabbing Naruto's hand. He transfers his chakra to her again and they take off in the form of a bird, where Hinata creates a Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists and Naruto creates a Rasengan within its jaws before smashing it into the opponent. The opponent then detonates in a giant dome explosion as Naruto
retreats
 away from the blast with Hinata.
