This is a reincarnation technique which uses
Ryūzetsu's kekkei genkai
.  After forming hand seals, the user’s hands begin glowing white.  The user then places their hands over the target, similar to the
Mystical Palm Technique
.  After this, the user forms another hand seal which causes their entire body to start glowing after which the person's life force is transferred to the target, completely restoring them, but at the cost of the user's life.
