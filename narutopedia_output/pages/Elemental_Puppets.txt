The
Elemental Puppets
 have roughly the same appearance, but are either red or blue in colour. They can deploy
water
 or
flames
 in battle, and it appears that each one can only have one of the two abilities. The puppets were used by
Gandō
 to stop
Naruto
 and take the Blue
Spirit Orb
 from him,
Kakashi
 and
Might Guy
.
