 manga.

Summary

The crowd praises
Naruto
's victory, with the veteran ninja impressed that he could learn to control the
Nine-Tails
' power. As Naruto basks in the attention,
Neji
 is taken away to recover.
Hiashi
 comes to visit him to tell him the truth of
Hizashi
, Neji's father's, death. When relations between
Kumo
 and
Konoha
 became strained and Kumo wanted Hiashi's head, Konoha and the
Hyūga clan
 suggested substituting Hiashi with Hizashi. Hiashi was reluctant to offer up his brother, but Hizashi insisted, wishing to choose his fate at last by dying, not for the clan's benefit, but to save his brother. Neji doubts the validity of the story until Hiashi bows his head for forgiveness. Moved, Neji realises that it is true and abandons his concept of destiny, instead expressing a desire to become strong enough to never lose again.
