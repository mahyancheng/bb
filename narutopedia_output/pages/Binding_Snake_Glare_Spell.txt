The user summons one or two large
snakes
 which crawl out from one's sleeves, and coil around the enemy capturing them. This is a great technique for capturing someone alive, or for inflicting damage by constriction, and if the situation calls for it, the snakes can bite the victim with their poison fangs. With the summons specified beforehand, the procedure can be shortened by using blood on a summoning "contract seal" (
結印
,
ketsuin
), making it possible to use the technique immediately. The further addition of the user's
killing intent
 can weaken their target's resolve.

Snakes summoned by this technique are on a whole other level in terms of intelligence and strength, compared to normal summons. It is said that even
shinobi
 with great skill are unable to escape from this restraint.

Trivia

In
Naruto Mobile
, Mitsuki is able to channel lightning through the snakes to paralyse opponents.
