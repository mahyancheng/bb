First Division
 of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. When
Darui
 confronted the
reincarnated

Gold and Silver Brothers
, Atsui and his sister provided assistance. Attacked almost immediately by numerous
White Zetsu Army
 clones, he
incinerated
 them before he moved to confronted towards the opposing
Kinkaku
 and
Ginkaku
 head-on. Both he and Samui are hit by the
Kōkinjō
, resulting in their
"word souls"
 (
言霊
,

) being drawn from their bodies.






Atsui being absorbed by Ginkaku into the gourd.



With their respective word souls subsequently severed by the
Shichiseiken
 and absorbed by the
Benihisago
, the siblings are placed under a combination curse and sealing technique, where if they uttered the word they've used most in their lives, they'll be imprisoned for eternity. Although Samui advised that he not speak, Kinkaku's subsequent
attack
 prompted Atsui to say "
hot
", causing him to be sucked into the gourd. Darui later promised to find a way to release him and Samui who was sucked into the gourd as well. The gourd with Atsui and Samui inside was later taken by
Tobi
 in order to seal the portion of the Nine-Tails' chakra that was within
Ginkaku
 who was also absorbed into the gourd some time later.
