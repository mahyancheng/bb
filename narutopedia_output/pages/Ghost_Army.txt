The
Ghost Army
 (
幽霊軍
,
Yūreigun
) was a brigade of moving stone soldiers that served the demon
Mōryō
. Being made of stone and seemingly to move on a ghostly will, they are invulnerable to conventional weapons and immensely difficult to stop.

Background

In the past, a clan of shinobi made a pact with the demon and tried to use his army to destroy the world and to create a Thousand Year Kingdom (
千年王国
,
Sennen Ōkoku
). However, when the priestess,
Miroku
,
sealed
 Mōryō away, the army was encased in stone within the shrine that their leader's soul was sealed, in the
Land of Demons
.

Abilities

These stone soldiers were very powerful, being able to trample many shinobi, and cause forts to collapse simply by marching through them. They had very high defence being able to take the full force of spears, arrows, and swords. They could take a
Rasengan
 along with various other techniques and only be pushed back. However, they were very slow. They also had some skill in wielding swords along with other weapons, though they were stiff and robotic in attack and not very proficient with them.

Plot Overview

When
Yomi
, a descendant of a shinobi clan, came to
free
 Mōryō, he also released the Ghost Army. Yomi gained command of the army by acting as Mōryō's avatar, and ordered them to advance to the
Land of Swamps
 to retrieve the demon's body. They trampled several villages and strongholds on their way to the Land of Swamps, but were ultimately defeated by
Naruto Uzumaki
,
Kakashi Hatake
,
Shikamaru Nara
,
Might Guy
, and
Temari
.

Influences

The Ghost Army is seemingly based on the
Terracotta Army
, stone soldiers, numbering over 8000, buried with the tyrannical Chinese Emperor
Qin Shi Huang
 who desired an army to guard him, as well as having servants to rule over, in the afterlife. The fact that Mōryō is a demon sealed away with his "Ghost" army in the cavern that Yomi claimed to be of the other world further makes this connection.
