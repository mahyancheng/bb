Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Kabuto
 is flung back by the perfected
Rasengan
. Kabuto is able to stand up after the attack while
Naruto
 collapses, Kabuto having damaged his heart at the last second. Though initially confident his medical expertise has saved him from the worst of the damage, Kabuto finds that his injuries are too great and collapses.
Tsunade
 rushes to Naruto's side and tries to heal him, vowing to not let him die in his pursuit of the title of
Hokage
 like
Dan
 and
Nawaki
 did. Kabuto insists he is doomed but Naruto, healed, grasps the
First Hokage's Necklace
 he has now won before losing consciousness. Putting faith in another's dreams once more, Tsunade puts the necklace around him.
Orochimaru
, seeing Naruto's success against Kabuto as a potential concern for the future, tries to kill him, but Tsunade blocks the attack with her own body.
