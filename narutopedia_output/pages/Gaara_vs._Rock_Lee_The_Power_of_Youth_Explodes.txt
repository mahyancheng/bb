 anime.

Synopsis

After a long wait,
Rock Lee
 is set to fight against
Gaara
. At first it seems as though Lee's
Strong Fist
 taijutsu is ineffective because of Gaara's
Shield of Sand
, a wall of sand that automatically rises to protect Gaara regardless of his will. Lee soon reveals that he has been wearing heavy leg weights and removes them, allowing him to move faster than before and to ultimately bypass Gaara's sand. Lee is able to punch Gaara using his speed before Gaara's shield of sand can defend him. Seemingly injured, Gaara sends the sand towards Lee, who manages to use his speed once more to get behind Gaara and kick him in the face. However, it turns out Gaara has coated his body with a suit of armor made of sand. As his usual attacks and speed cannot hit Gaara, Lee performs his
Front Lotus
; the initial kick does not cause Gaara to soar into the air, causing Lee to kick him multiple times to get him airborne. Despite the strain caused by the kicks, Lee is successfully able to perform the Front Lotus. Just as it seems that Lee has clenched victory, it turns out that the Gaara he performed the Front Lotus on was nothing but a shell made of sand.
