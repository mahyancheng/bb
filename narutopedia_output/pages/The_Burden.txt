"
The Burden
" (
背負うべき重荷
,
Seōbeki Omoni
) is episode 214 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Kakashi
 finds the unconscious
Kiba
,
Akamaru
,
Lee
, and
Sai
 in a wooded path and manages to briefly render Kiba conscious long enough to find out where
Sakura
 had gone. At the
Samurai Bridge
, Sakura tells
Sasuke
 that she has defected from
Konoha
 and wishes to join him. Sasuke alerts her that his goal is to
destroy
 Konoha and that if she still wishes to join him, she must kill
Karin
, claiming she'd be a perfect replacement as she is a
medic-nin
 as well. Sakura pulls out a
kunai
 and walks up to Karin but hesitates to kill her. Sasuke, in turn, forms a
Chidori
 in his left hand and prepares to kill Sakura from behind, only for the attack to be blocked by Kakashi, who realises in shock that Sasuke had intended to murder her and exclaims how far Sasuke had fallen.

Kakashi tells Sakura to take Karin elsewhere and to
heal
 her since she possesses a lot of information on their enemies while, as their teacher and the one responsible for letting the situation come to a head the way it had, he deals with Sasuke. Kakashi recalls when he used to wonder how the
Third Hokage
 still had a soft spot for
Orochimaru
 despite everything Orochimaru had done and how the
Hokage
 had no choice but to
fight
 his former student to the
death
, and finally comes to understand himself how the Third felt. Sasuke
summons

shuriken
 from his bracelets and throws them towards Kakashi, who blocks it with his
Earth Release: Earth-Style Wall
. Sasuke leaps over the wall and prepares to finish off Kakashi with his
Chidori Sharp Spear
, but Kakashi jumps off the bridge to evade the attack.

Sasuke praises Kakashi's usage of his
Sharingan
, albeit insulted that a non-Uchiha is using it. He notifies Kakashi that only a true member of the
Uchiha clan
 can use it effectively, and forms his
Susanoo
. Sasuke has the Susanoo fire an arrow at Kakashi, who uses
Kamui
 to warp the arrow away. Sasuke is impressed that Kakashi was able to awaken the
Mangekyō Sharingan
 and attempts to use the Susanoo once more, only for his vision to become blurred; as a result, his Susanoo and his Sharingan deactivate. Kakashi attempts to convince Sasuke to change his ways, repeating what he
once told
 Sasuke about how revenge does not get anyone anywhere; Sasuke retorts that Kakashi should stop talking as if he was his sensei and exclaims that he would only stop his tirade if Kakashi could bring his
father
,
mother
, and
brother
 back to him. Sakura, who has finished healing Karin, sneaks up behind Sasuke, recalling her memories of Sasuke, back when they had
passed
 the
bell test
 as well as her conversation with Sasuke before he
defected
 from Konoha. She holds a kunai to his back, finding herself unable to kill him. Sasuke turns around and grabs her throat with one hand while prying the kunai out with the other. Kakashi, weakened by the Mangekyō, is unable to stop him as Sasuke attempts to kill Sakura, only for
Naruto
 to arrive in the nick of time and whisk Sakura out of harm's way.

Trivia

This episode has a few animation errors:

Kakashi's
Mangekyō Sharingan
 is inaccurately depicted as having a red design on a black background, though this error was fixed in episode 215.

Sasuke's
Susanoo
 is incorrectly depicted with five fingers instead of six, holding a gourd in the secondary right hand instead of an
Amaterasu
 orb in the primary right hand and the bow in the left hand instead of nothing. Its teeth are also depicted incorrectly.
