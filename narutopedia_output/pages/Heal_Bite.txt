Through biting and consuming the user's
chakra
, they can heal the injuries of others, as well as themselves.

Overview

This ability has been shown to heal even life-threatening injuries, and is also capable of quickly restoring the stamina of those healed. This technique, however, rapidly depletes the user's own chakra reserves, leaving them with a presumably permanent bite mark after each use. Due to the technique's accelerated depletion of chakra, it is dangerous for one to use this ability too regularly as Karin normally refrains from doing so more than once a day.

Trivia

Due to inconsistencies within the anime and manga, it's unknown if Karin's bite marks are always present.

This ability is uniquely tied to the user’s chakra’s specific characteristics, not to a jutsu that can be willingly used.
