Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Jiraiya
, despite having suffered many severe injuries, managed to capture
one
 of the
Six Paths of Pain
. He tried to figure out why none of the six resembled
Nagato
, but reaffirmed that
one
 resembled
Yahiko
 and all had the
Rinnegan
. He considered if Yahiko had taken Nagato's Rinnegan but put this theory to side as all six Pains had the Rinnegan. In addition, Jiraiya remembered a conversation he once had with Nagato. As the Pain in front of him's forehead protector slipped off, Jiraiya saw the scar on his forehead and recognised him as a ninja he had faced in the past. Knowing for a fact that this wasn't Nagato, Jiraiya decided to test a hunch rather than return to
Konoha
. He asked the
Two Great Sage Toads
 to go home, but they refused at first however, he managed to convince
Shima
 to take the Pain he captured to Konoha for study. Jiraiya and
Fukasaku
 left the
barrier
 and went up to face the remaining Pains. Jiraiya upon observing them all closely confirmed that he had met all of them before. He had managed to figure out the secret of Pain however, he was soon surrounded and his throat was crushed.
