Prior to being struck by an attack, Urashiki activates his
tomoe
-less Rinnegan and causes it to glow blue. His body then disappears without warning, leaving behind ten glowing red
orizuru
, which slowly float to the ground before fading away. Afterwards, Urashiki's
chakra
 signature is completely untraceable, allowing him to escape elsewhere unnoticed. The exact nature of this technique is unclear, but upon observing it,
Sasuke Uchiha
 believed that it does not involve slipping into
another dimension
.
