Nagato

Tobi
's strategy while waiting near a shrine, and the real
Neji
 is seen still in the battlefield, complaining to
Kiba
 that he doesn't want to go to the medical compound. Kiba tells Neji that getting himself killed from overexertion won't impress anyone, and chides Neji when he can't even tell Kiba and

" asks Sakura where
Shizune
 is, and she tells him she's tending to
Tonton
's leg. "
Neji
", assuming Tonton is a human, says that at least a leg injury is better than a hand injury, which would prevent Tonton from forming seals, arousing Sakura's suspicion that something with Neji is amiss. He asks her to take a look at his arm, which he claims is still causing him pain, simultaneously reaching for a kunai with his free hand, when Sakura
slams
 him into the ground before he can stab her. The "
