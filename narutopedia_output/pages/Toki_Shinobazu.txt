Personality

Toki happened to be rather arrogant and is prone to making jokes while in combat.
 He, however, was very strategic, managing to lure his bait into a large crater. It was presumed that he had some knowledge in geography, considering he created a man-made canal with his drilling device that caused a current.

Appearance

Toki had a short crop of brown spiky hair and small black eyes, and wears a white-clothed headband. The drilling device he used to perform his Crimson Earth technique is located on his right arm. Aside from this, he wears a green, arm less robe with a yellow line coming down from the black collar.

Part I

Gantetsu Escort Mission

Toki was first shown creating a man-made canal in order to form a current. This action was in conjunction with
Monju
's
Murderous Grasp
 technique, where as
Gantetsu
's captivity was split in two, and later separated. The act separated
Naruto Uzumaki
, Gantetsu, and
Todoroki
 from
Sakura Haruno
,
Rock Lee
, and the other guards that were saved from the shipwreck.
 A day after the failed attempt in capturing Gantetsu, Toki personally went in for the kill; luring the three into a trap, only to crush them with his drilling device. Unfortunately for him, Toki had destroyed
shadow clones
 under the
Transformation Technique
. Toki and Naruto begin to battle, however, the results ended up against Toki's favour, resulting in his death to a rock slide created by a
Rasengan
.
