This technique will summon a large amount of water that will then be used to strike at the opponent in several versatile ways.
Shizuku
 has been known to transform it into a dragon with a gaping mouth to attack. The water used will be stationary till it is sent offensively toward the opponent.

Trivia

The Japanese romanisation of this technique has a pun: the "Gorugon" part is also the
Japanese way to pronounce the English word
 "Gorgon". A
gorgon
 is a woman with snakes in place of her hair, and this technique is a reference to the gorgon, as Shizuku summons a sphere of water around her and shoots many serpentine streams of water in multiple directions from the sphere.
