Anko Mitarashi
 (
みたらしアンコ
,
Mitarashi Anko
) is a
tokubetsu jōnin
 who teaches at
Konohagakure
's
Academy
.

Background






Anko with Orochimaru.



When she was a
genin
, Anko was on a
team
 led by
Orochimaru
.
 Their team took part in the
Chūnin Exams
; during the second round, they confronted a team consisting of
Hayate Gekkō
,
Ibiki Morino
, and
Tokara
.
 Orochimaru took a strong interest in Anko, teaching her several of his signature
jutsu
 and, in the anime, what he'd learned about immortality.
 Orochimaru eventually used Anko as a test subject for his
Cursed Seal of Heaven
. Of the ten subjects, Anko was the only survivor.






Anko is found by Konoha's Anbu.



In the anime, Anko refused to continue following Orochimaru after she received her Cursed Seal of Heaven. Unwilling to kill her because she was so valuable as a research subject, Orochimaru erased Anko's memory, making her wonder if she'd been abandoned for lacking the ideal drive to fuel the cursed seal, rather than her choosing to reject him in the face of his evil experiments.
 An amnesiac Anko was found in the
Land of the Sea
 by
Konoha
's
Anbu
 and brought back in hopes of giving the village information regarding Orochimaru, but because of her tampered memory, nothing could be recovered. Distraught at being abandoned and having no memory, Anko was comforted by the
Third Hokage
. Ever since then, Anko held a grudge against Orochimaru for what he did and believed it was her responsibility, as his former student, to stop his criminal actions.

Personality






Anko making a dramatic entrance.



Anko is laid-back, tomboyish, playful, stubborn, brave, rough, feisty, and sometimes hyperactive, to the point that
Sakura Haruno
 described her as being much like
Naruto Uzumaki
 in many ways.
 Despite portraying several childish and somewhat juvenile behavior, Anko has nonetheless been shown to be very well-prepared and studious. However, she is also shown to have a bloodthirsty side of herself, as seen when she slashed Naruto's face with a
kunai
 and licked his blood (in the anime, she merely used her finger to wipe it off).
 Anko has also shown a somewhat sadistic side and is apparently not the most sympathetic of people, which is no surprise being a former student of Orochimaru. However, she is not above caring for her comrades or people in pain, as shown by her encouraging words to
Isaribi
. Anko is also a very strict and impatient person, wasting no time in announcing bad news and dislikes sugarcoating situations when there is no need for it. She regularly makes sure she has at least a basic understanding of the landscape so her next mission can be accomplished. Anko is also highly confident in her own abilities, often choosing to face a powerful opponent alone or continue a dangerous mission alone.






Anko's scary demeanor.



Anko's personality quirks are often commented by others, who consider her being crazy and somewhat deranged, such as Naruto and
Ino Yamanaka
. While completely aware of this, Anko doesn't when enjoy when others point it out, scaring Naruto and leaving him creeped out when she overheard his negative comments about her, threatning him with a kunai, all the while licking her lips.
 Anko once held an extremely powerful admiration towards her teacher
Orochimaru
, viewing him as a role model and striving to become just like him. However, after Orochimaru
branded
 her with a
Cursed Seal of Heaven
, Anko's admiration for her former teacher transformed into a deep-seated hatred.
 Her experience with Orochimaru, and the betrayal she suffered by his hand, left Anko with post-traumatic stress disorder, having nightmares about the effects of the Cursed Seal of Heaven, which often left her waking up drenched in sweat. As a result, Anko became determined to be the one to put an end to Orochimaru's evil ways, being even willing to
sacrifice herself
 in order to accomplish it.






Anko's sweet tooth.



One of Anko's defining characteristics is her strong and unyielding sweet tooth, spending almost all of her free time eating food, particularly
dango
, which is her favorite meal. Accordingly, she becomes extremely angry and hostile towards anyone who either threatens to interrupt her snack time, or dares to steal her food, seen when she almost killed Naruto by throwing several
skewers
 at him after he ate her dango right under her nose.
 Her unrelenting love for sweets and unwillingness to moderate her eating habits eventually caused Anko to gain a significant amount of weight, and around fifteen years after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, her previously slender frame had since become an overweight one, although she shows zero concern about it and takes no offense when others comment on her newfound weight.

Appearance

Anko as a genin.
Anko's appearance in Parts I and II.
1/2

Anko is an average-sized, young woman who was of slender frame. She has light brown, pupil-less eyes. Her hair - black with a blue tint in the manga
 and violet in the anime - is styled in a short, spiky, fanned-out ponytail. She usually wears a custom-made outfit that is crafted of thin metal mesh to fit the lines of her body,
 that covers her from neck to thigh. Over this, she typically wears a tan overcoat with a purple in-seam and a pocket on each side, a dark orange mini-skirt, a dark blue belt, and pale grey shin guards. In addition to the typical
forehead protector
, she also wears a small pendant that looks like a snake fang.

As a child, Anko wore a sleeveless chainmail mesh shirt, chainmail armbands that reached to her elbows, dark shorts, and knee-length boots.
 Though during her time as a preteen when following Orochimaru in the anime, she instead wears a brown-red t-shirt with bracelets, white shorts and chainmail leggings. Years after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, she puts on weight and starts wearing red lipstick. Her chainmail bodysuit is replaced with an orange blouse with a white coat cape over it.

Abilities

Being a
tokubetsu jōnin
, Anko is indeed a highly skilled
kunoichi
. Even as a child, her talent gained the attention of Orochimaru who would take her up as his disciple. Her prowess ultimately earned her recognition as a legendary kunoichi a decade after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

Ninjutsu






Anko utilising snakes.



While under Orochimaru's wing, she was taught many of his techniques, such as the
Hidden Shadow Snake Hands
 and its
stronger variant
. Her skill with these techniques, in particular, allowed her to easily outmaneuver the collaborative efforts of the
Ino
-
Shika
-
Chō
 trio during their
Genin Exams
.
 She could also perform Orochimaru's
murder-suicide technique
 as well.
 She was also the first surviving recipient of his
Cursed Seal of Heaven
, which appears as three
tomoe
 at the back of her neck. Though it flares up from time to time in its attempt to encourage her to use it, she refrains from doing so. It is eventually
removed
 from her body following the Fourth Shinobi World War.
 Anko has incredible aim, able to make a perfect
Konoha
 symbol out of dango sticks without even looking.
 She has excellent tracking skills, evidenced by her being placed in charge of
a team
 tasked with finding
Kabuto Yakushi
. In the anime, she has been stated to have built up an immunity to
poisons
 with Orochimaru's help.
 She also has proficiency
Fire
 and
Yin Release
, able to unleash
power flame streams
 and
confuse her targets
 with the respective elements.

Chūnin Exams






Anko meets "Shiore".



Anko proctors the second stage of the
Chūnin Exams
 held in
Konoha
. She breaks into the room where the first stage was held and showily introduces herself to the assembled
genin
. When she realises that she entered too soon, she tries deflecting blame by instead reprimanding the first stage's proctor,
Ibiki Morino
, for how many genin were allowed to pass to the second stage. She leads the genin to the
Forest of Death
 where she explains the rules for the second stage and the dangers they'll face in the forest. She attacks
Naruto Uzumaki
 with a kunai when he suggests she's exaggerating, only for the kunai to be returned to her by
Shiore
, a
Kusa
-nin.






Anko finds Orochimaru.



Shortly after the second stage gets underway, Anko is alerted to the discovery of three dead Kusa-nin, among them Shiore. From examining the bodies it becomes clear to her that they've been dead for some time and, because they're all
missing their faces
, she concludes that Orochimaru has infiltrated the Chūnin Exams. She orders that the
Third Hokage
 be informed of what's happened, that two teams of
Anbu
 be deployed, and then goes into the forest to find Orochimaru on her own. She locates him shortly after nightfall and tries to use the
Twin Snakes Mutual Death Technique
 on him, only to discover at the last moment that she's been attacking a
shadow clone
. He reactivates her dormant
Cursed Seal of Heaven
, immobilising her with the pain, and warns her not to cancel the Chūnin Exams before departing.

Despite the pain, Anko is eventually able to reach the centre of the Forest of Death. The Third Hokage treats her cursed seal and, after hearing what's happened, speculates that Orochimaru is after
Sasuke Uchiha
, who Orochimaru has branded with another Cursed Seal of Heaven.
 Anko tries to argue that Sasuke be removed from the exams and placed under guard, but the Third insists the exams continue per Orochimaru's instructions. During the preliminary matches, Anko stays by the Third's side, informing him of the participants' particulars; she is amazed by Sasuke's control of his cursed seal during his match.

A month after the preliminaries, as the final round matches near and it becomes increasingly clear that Orochimaru means ill to Konoha, Anko tries to apologise to the Third for her failure to kill him. She also rues over the death of the
Fourth Hokage
, believing he could have stopped Orochimaru, but the Third tells her to neither blame herself nor to dwell on the dead..
 In the anime, around the same time, Naruto approaches her while she's at her favourite
Dango Shop
 to ask her about the "Fourth Hokage's legacy". When he eats one of her dango without permission, she attacks him and chases him away.

During the practical and final test of the graduation exam, the class was brought to the training field. There, the entire class was set up to face Anko, Shino, and Konohamaru for 24 hours. While the teachers would still evaluate the students' respective improvements, the students' true test was against Kakashi Hatake. The Sixth Hokage quickly explained that he would only pass the first student who is able to take the single bell attached to his hip. As the test began, Anko quickly caught many students in a genjutsu. She was then attacked by the
Ino–Shika–Chō
 trio. While questioning their willingness to work together as there could only be one winner in the test, they insisted that it was more practical to work team up for now. Anko smirked at their choice. As she began overwhelming the trio with her
snake techniques
, they were soon aided by more of their friends to face Anko. Ultimately, Anko defeated and subdued the group of students.

Later that night, following a plan from Boruto, the remaining students able to split up the proctors. Anko was then attacked by Lee and
Wasabi Izuno

sonic blast
 that incapacitated Anko. By the end of the test, despite no one getting the bell from Kakashi, the Sixth Hokage chose to pass everyone as they succeeded in the true goal of the test; team-work and loyalty.

When she felt dejected over the enthusiasm her students showed when Team 7 taught a class, Anko was confident about Hana's qualifications. After she successfully mended a rift between her students, Anko was happy for her. She asked Team 7 if they wanted to teach another class, but Boruto declined the offer.

When the Academy held a festival, they an explosion went off and they received a terrorist threat of more. The Academy staff discussed how to deal with the situation, and they accepted the help of former students in attendance to help deal with the situation, as no one could leave or contact the outside.

Following the attack, Hana was injured and hospitalised. As Shino took over Hana's class as she recuperated, Anko suggested to Shino they not tell Hana about Kae having been the target of the attack, not wanting to put any grief on the new teacher. After the threat on Kae was seemingly thwarted, Anko and Shino decided to tell Hana about it upon her return.

Anko later listened to Hana in the hospital as she explained how her other personality had been the assassin after Kae, and her decision to live with the other personality, teach her, and befriend her. Anko attended the class' Sannin play as a send off for Kae, who had to return to her country.
