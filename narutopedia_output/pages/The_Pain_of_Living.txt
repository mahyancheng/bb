Summary

Itachi
 plays with

, and thinks back to one of his missions. Itachi sees his father after returning from a mission. The
Konoha Council
 discusses with the
clan

heads

of

the

village
 about relocating in the aftermath of the
Nine-Tails
' attack, resulting in the
Aburame
 and
Uchiha Clan
 relocating. Itachi points out
Fugaku
 is still the face of the Uchiha, many of whom greet them as they walk, and that he is proud to walk with him. Itachi and Fugaku go get dumplings, but the store is sold out. They run into
Izumi
. She and Itachi go to a lake, where Izumi apologises for not giving him anything for his promotion.
 Itachi tells her not to worry, but she insists on sharing her dumplings with him.
Tenma Izumo
 arrives and informs Itachi they have a mission.
Team 2
 visits
Nekobaa
, who has tasked them with finding a ninja cat. The team splits up to look for the cat. Tenma is personally invested in completing the mission, as the cat's whiskers are an ingredient for a medicine for his sick father.
Yūki
 approaches the cat, but he scratches him. Itachi's team-mates are also incapacitated. Itachi manages to catch the cat, and save Tenma when he tries to acquire the cat's whiskers. On their way back to
Konoha
,
Shinko
 scolds Tenma for not thanking Itachi, and Itachi for just acting as if they were only on a mission, as they are friends. Itachi, thinking back to this moment, recalls when a
masked man
 killed Tenma in one of their missions. The pain of those memories awaken Itachi's
Sharingan
, which Sasuke notices. Itachi wonders if one day Sasuke will also awaken the Sharingan.
