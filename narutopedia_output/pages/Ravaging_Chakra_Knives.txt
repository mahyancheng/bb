Kagura will sink several knives attached to
strings of chakra
 underground and shoot up from the ground under the opponent, launching them into the air. While the enemy is in the air, Kagura will release chakra strings and restrict the opponent, pulling them to her, while throwing several chakra strings with knives directly at them. She finishes the opponent off by slamming them into the ground.
