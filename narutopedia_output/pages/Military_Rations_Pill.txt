. It is made up of powerful stimulants and nutrients that are near-instantly absorbed into the in-taker's body, and said to allow the user to keep fighting for three days and three nights without rest.

Trivia

These pills are based on the actual world military rations pills used in Japan, mainly during the
Sengoku period
 (mid-15th – early 17th century). They were made from rice, various flours, dried vegetables and fruits, seeds, and various other ingredients.

In the anime,
Sakura Haruno
 created her own version of the Military Rations Pills. They are supposedly weaker than regular ones, as Sakura would deliver dozens of them to
Naruto Uzumaki
 on a daily basis while he was training. They are also intended to have more medicinal purposes and be easier to consume, despite neglecting to favour the general flavour. As a consequence, they taste awful, with
Sai
 calling them "mud balls".
