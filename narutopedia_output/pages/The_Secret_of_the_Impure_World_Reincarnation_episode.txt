Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 continued his
tailed beast
 training with
B
. As he attempted to transform into the
Nine-Tails
, he failed, assuming a chibi-version of the beast. With this, the
Eight-Tails
 explained the mechanism behind transforming into a tailed beast and the cooperation required from both parties to do so. B told Naruto that this might pose a problem as he wouldn't be able to use the
Tailed Beast Ball
. Moving on with the training nonetheless, B decided to build on the techniques Naruto could perform. Showing them his
Rasengan
 in his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
, B was shocked to see that Naruto's technique was an application of the Tailed Beast Ball. Telling Naruto this, B enquired who taught him that technique and upon hearing that it was created by the Fourth
Hokage
,
Minato Namikaze
, B wondered whether this was fate.

At
Mountains' Graveyard
, Tobi demanded that
Kabuto
 kill
Anko Mitarashi
. However, Kabuto refused, explaining that he needed to drain
Orochimaru
's chakra that resided within her so he can increase the binding power on the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
. Wary of Kabuto's loyalties, Tobi ordered him to demonstrate that technique and all of its secrets, including on how to stop it. Tobi then killed
Torune
 and told Kabuto to use
Fū Yamanaka
 to reincarnate and control Torune. Kabuto complied and elaborated on the technique before taking off to an isolated area.
Black Zetsu
 appears before Tobi and confirms that he planted the White Zetsu's spores on Kabuto and then sets out to do another task for Tobi.

Meanwhile at the
Allied Shinobi Forces
' Headquarters,
Ao
 noted that the intel sent to them by
Muta
 allowed them to locate the
enemy forces

travelling underground
. After
Inoichi
 has his division
inform

,
Akamaru
,
Hana
 and one of the
