The temple.



The
Tailed Beast Temple
 is a temple located on the back of
Genbu
 behind the
Falls of Truth
 with many structures, headless
Bodhisattva
-like sculptures (which
B
 jokingly states were past jinchūriki that failed to open the door due to impure hearts and had their heads chopped off by the cat, but later revealed that they were simply broken) and murals depicting the
Eight-Tails
 and the
Two-Tails
 on a giant wall. Inside the temple there are two chambers where the
jinchūriki
 attempts to gain control over their tailed beast.





The entrance to a training chamber.



The entrance to the first chamber where a jinchūriki attempts to control one's tailed beast has a sculpture of the Two-Tails' head with a switch inside its mouth, only accessible by entering head first. The chamber is designed to hold a tailed beast, in case the jinchūriki failed to master control and allow the beast to be reborn, and lock it up until a new jinchūriki comes forth.

The second chamber is known as the "Chakra Isolation Chamber", and is located behind the statue of the Eight-Tails' head. Killer B stated that it is impossible to detect chakra beyond the walls of the chamber; however,

Trivia

In the anime, the
Sage of Six Paths
 and his followers built temples in nine different regions of the world where the
Tailed Beasts
 could live and be protected.
 However, it is not clear if this temple was actually built by Hagoromo.
