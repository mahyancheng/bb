Kakashi forms a
Lightning Cutter
 in his hand and launches it at the opponent in the form a hound. The hound is highly fast and its movements are unpredictable, making it is very difficult to avoid. As Kakashi's hand remains connected to the hound by a cord of lightning, adjusting the amount of chakra used for the technique allows him to freely manipulate its speed and range.

Trivia

Raijū
 is a mythological creature in Shintō religion, companion to the Shintō god of lightning, Raijin. Raijū has many common representations, with a white and blue wolf sometimes engulfed in lightning being among them, akin to the form Kakashi's technique takes.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
, Kakashi can only use this technique if
Lightning Cutter
 is selected as his Ninjutsu attack, as this technique serves as the Lightning Cutter's charged Ninjutsu attack in the game.

In multiple Storm titles, this technique is used in conjunction with
Might Guy
's
Daytime Tiger
 as part of their
Combination Ultimate Jutsu
.
