Hanabi
 uses the
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
 technique to hit and shut down sixty-four of the opponent's
tenketsu
, with the final hit making the opponent spin in a vortex-like fashion. Then, Hanabi, after fussing about her hair, launches a
vacuum
 of
chakra
 at the opponent, stopping their spinning and sending them head-in into the ground.
