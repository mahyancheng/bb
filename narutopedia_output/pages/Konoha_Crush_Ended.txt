Summary

Gaara
, defeated, and
Naruto
, exhausted, fall to the ground. The lifeless body of the
Third Hokage
 falls to the ground and
Orochimaru
 curses him for sealing his arms, thereby leaving him unable to perform techniques. Now unable to continue the
Konoha Crush
, Orochimaru flees with the
Sound Four
 in tow. Seeing this,
Baki
 and
Kabuto
 follow suit, knowing they have been defeated.
Temari
 collects
Kankurō
 and
Sasuke
 makes sure
Sakura
 is okay before proceeding to Naruto. Naruto crawls towards Gaara, who, fearing he is going to be finished off, tells him to stay away. Naruto only sympathises with everything Gaara has gone through, telling him that he might have ended up just like him if he hadn't found friends. Accordingly, if Gaara harms those friends, Naruto will have no choice but to kill him. Seeing that Naruto's strength is gained from fighting for others, Gaara questions his practice of thinking only for himself. While Temari and Kankurō carry him home, he apologises to them which shocks Temari and Kankurō. The remaining invaders flee
Konoha
 and the Konoha ninja gather around the Third's body.
