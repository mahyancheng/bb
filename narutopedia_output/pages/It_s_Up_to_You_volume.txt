Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 manga.

Chapter 32

"
A Sense of Duty
" (
義理
,
Giri
)

Naruto
 and
Delta
 trade blows. Delta uses her leg propulsion to gain height and her body modification to attack Naruto with enlarged legs. Naruto destroys her legs with a
Lava Release Rasenshuriken
, but she quickly regenerates them. Naruto notices it, and intends to land a blow on her torso, but is concerned with hitting her close to her face, which would allow her to absorb his jutsu.
Boruto
 wonders if they should try getting her off-guard, but
Kawaki
 points out that Naruto can't go all out if there's a chance they'll get caught in it. Boruto tries to argue, but Kawaki stresses that while in the defensive, Naruto is leading Delta's attacks away from them while trying to get an opening himself. Delta comments on Naruto's abilities and regeneration, but when he suggests her surrender, Delta unleashes powerful eye beams, which Naruto is able to avoid.
 Kawaki explains to Boruto that these beams were designed to be used against opponents with regeneration abilities, so even his highly modified body wouldn't be able to heal the damage. Naruto deduces such an attack is quite taxing on her, but Delta is unconcerned, saying she only has to land one attack. The two continue to trade blows in close quarters. When Naruto is on the ground and Delta prepares to unleash the beams again, Boruto activates his
Kāma
 without Kawaki's assistance, and sends a
Vanishing Rasengan
 at her, figuring she won't be able to absorb it if she can't see it. While Delta can't see it, she is able to detect its presence through her drone, which is still in the air, and absorbs it. She closes the distance between them, punching him aside, and thanking him for giving her an idea. She grabs
Himawari
, throws her up in the air, and sends eye beams at her, so they'll hit Naruto when he goes for her. When the smoke clears, Naruto has caught Himawari, and Kawaki blocked the beams with his transformed arm. Kawaki falls to the ground wounded and unable to heal, Naruto looks after him, and Delta is incredulous that Kawaki do that for them. Boruto blames himself for it, but Kawaki claims that if Naruto had been hit, it would be over for all of that, so it couldn't be helped. He adds that this should make them even about Himawari's broken flower vase. Boruto laughs at how Kawaki is thinking about something like that in their situation, and Delta is livid about how the battle is turning out.

Chapter 33

"
Breaking the Limit…!!
" (
限界突破…!!
,
Genkai Toppa…!!
)

Naruto
 leaves
Kawaki
 and
Himawari
 under
Boruto
's protection.
Delta
 is irate over Kawaki damaging himself, considering his body to be the "Vessel" that belongs to
Kara
 in service of
Jigen
. She believes
Amado
 will be able to heal him once she takes him back. Boruto is incensed by Delta's treatment of Kawaki. Naruto questions her about Jigen, but she says it's none of his business as he'll be dead soon, so Naruto dares her to try killing him. The two exchange various physical blows. Boruto comments on Naruto's anger. Delta notices Naruto's shortness of breath, and intends to finish the fight with her eye beams. Naruto asks her if she forgot he'd make her regret laying a finger on the children. He extends his promise to Jigen, vowing to track him down from behind the shadows and make him pay. Delta is puzzled by his anger over Kawaki as he walks towards her.
 When he gets close enough, she unleashes her eye beams again, but Naruto disperses the beams with a
Big Ball Rasengan
. Delta proceeds to absorb it, as Naruto escalates it with an
Ultra-Big Ball Rasengan
. Boruto is initially unsure of his father's intention, but realises his strategy. Delta berates Naruto for thinking she can't absorb bigger jutsu as she absorbs it as well. Kawaki comments on the futility of increasing jutsu size, but Boruto points out that's not what Naruto is doing. Delta is incredulous at Naruto's chakra output, and finally realises his ploy. Boruto explains to Kawaki how Naruto is trying to overcome the limit of her ability to absorb chakra. Delta's Shinobi-ware overheats, causing her eye functions to cease, as well as her connection to the drone's vision. Naruto points out it was only a matter of time since she first absorbed his Rasengan, having rationalised the absorbed jutsu had to be stored in her body, therefore indicating a limit of how much she can absorb. He boasts about his chakra pool, and Delta yells at him as she attempts a physical attack. Naruto dodges her, and tells her to savour the first direct hit from his jutsu, landing an
even bigger Rasengan
 on her, leaving her body at the bottom of a crater it carved into the ground. With Delta defeated, Naruto deactivates his chakra cloak, and gives the children a thumbs up in celebration.

Chapter 34

"
Training!!
" (
修業!!
,
Shugyō!!
)

Naruto
 slides down the crater, explaining to
Boruto
 he went through the trouble of not killing
Delta
 so he could capture and interrogate her.
Kawaki
 is startled by this, and urges Naruto to kill her while he still can. Delta's body begins to sound off, and Naruto jumps away, taking the children with him as it explodes. Kawaki points out that's the type of people in
Kara
. Delta's drone retreats, which
Koji
 witnesses through his toad's eyes. He considers Naruto to be terrifyingly powerful, but still unable to defeat
Jigen
, and is sure that the key to Jigen's defeat is Boruto's
Kāma
. Naruto believes whoever worked on Kawaki before could restore him completely, but he has
Katasuke
 work on him, limiting the repairs to the installation of a high performance hand, which would take a lot of time to prepare. Naruto asks about fitting Kawaki with one of the many prototypes developed for him, and Katasuke explains his creations only respond to the chakra of the person they're designed for. Naruto considers it for a moment, and has Katasuke fit Kawaki with one his prototypes anyway, and shunts off a bit of his chakra.
 Boruto asks if the continuous drain won't be rough, but Naruto likens it to maintaining an active shadow clone, pointing out it'll be inactive when he's asleep. Kawaki asks if this is really ok, and Naruto points out this is a literal example of chakra being used to connect. Boruto comments on its coolness and jokes he wishes he had one. Kawaki asks if Boruto wants him to blow off his right arm, pointing out he could get rid of his Kāma. Boruto explains he was joking as Naruto and Katasuke laugh.

While going through data,
Amado
 notices the arrival of Delta's drone, which connects to a terminal where two other Delta bodies are stored. He enters a few commands and one of the Delta bodies awakes, kicking open her containment and cursing at Naruto. Amado complains of her always breaking the lid of the containment, but she retorts that smashing things is her job and that if he has time to complain, he should do his job. He comments on her mouth. As she makes her way through the Kara base,
Boro
 teases her over her defeat. Delta attempts to kick him, but her leg just goes through the projection. She assures him she'll be the one to kill the
Hokage
, but
Code
 disagrees, saying he or Boro should do it, considering her to be outmatched. Delta refuses, saying she'll never feel right unless she kills them herself, but Jigen silences the discussion. He asks about Koji, who he put in charge of the mission. She explains he's concealed in
Konohagakure
, watching over Kawaki. Boro questions what Koji is doing, as the mission was to retrieve Kawaki before he even got picked up by the village. Delta agrees this was her original intent, but that Koji stopped her and let things play out to acquire more information. Jigen thinks it over. She also reveals there's another Kāma wielder beyond himself and Kawaki, much to everyone's surprise. Code says they inspected the Hokage after
Momoshiki
's death, and asks if the new wielder is
Sasuke
. She explains it's Boruto, the Hokage's son, adding she saw Boruto's Kāma resonating with Kawaki's, assuring her of its legitimacy. Jigen considers it was Momoshiki's final act, making Boruto a vessel of his own. Amado watches him silently.

At Naruto's home, Kawaki asks why Naruto is doing so much for him. Naruto explains some chakra for his hand is hardly anything considering Kawaki shielded him and
Himawari
, and Kawaki retorts he's the reason they were attacked in the first place. Naruto just says Kawaki reminds him of himself from long ago and he couldn't let it go. Kawaki asks Naruto to teach him
ninjutsu
, who agrees. Boruto tells Kawaki he won't lose to him. Kawaki responds he should be the one telling that to Boruto. At night, Kawaki begins putting Himawari's vase back together. Kawaki gets his first
Extreme: Shinobi Picture Scrolls
 pack with Boruto,
Shikadai
, and
Inojin
, and lucks out with a super rare card of the
Fourth Hokage
.
Sarada
 comments to
Mitsuki
 and
Chōchō
 they got comfortable with each other fast, which Mitsuki attributes to him saving Himawari. Chōchō crushes on Kawaki. Kawaki comments on Minato also being a Hokage, and Inojin and Shikadai explain that Minato is Boruto's grandfather. Boruto complains about getting another duplicate card of his father, and Kawaki offers to trade his Fourth Hokage card, as he knows nothing about him and doesn't mind. Boruto celebrates his first, non-Naruto Hokage card. Kawaki ponders about Naruto. Over the next days, Kawaki begins training ninjutsu, and continues to put Himawari's vase back together. When he finishes it, he pours water to fill it up, but it leaks. He thinks there's a missing piece, but finds none left to add. He moves to go look for it, but
Kurama
 manifests its head from a sleeping Naruto, telling Kawaki not to wander off from Naruto on his own.

Chapter 35

"
It's Up to You
" (
お前次第
,
Omae Shidai
)

Kawaki
 is startled by
Kurama
's appearance. Kurama introduces itself, and explains it's the one responsible for watching over Kawaki while
Naruto
 sleeps, something the other
Kage
 have requested as well, commenting on the how times have changed to the point such a thing is possible. Kawaki is vaguely familiar with the concept of
Tailed Beasts
 from
Kara
's documents, but mistakenly believes that Kurama is affiliated to Naruto because of his strength, and allowing him to lead
Konohagakure
. Kurama corrects Kawaki, explaining Naruto is like Kawaki himself. It explains it used to be feared and took many lives, including Naruto's parents', and that Naruto was made into a vessel to seal it, causing him to be shunned by others. Kawaki thinks back to Naruto's words about using
shadow clones
. Kurama continues, adding that Naruto was very bad at jutsu, but that wasn't what filled his heart. Kawaki thinks back to Naruto saying having friends will change his life.
 Kawaki asks Kurama if he can become someone like Naruto. Kurama is affirmative, but stresses it's up to him, and notices Kawaki's tears. Kurama tells Kawaki it's late and that he can look for the missing vase fragment the next day. Kawaki leaves as the vase continues to leak.

During the day, Kawaki picks up
walking up trees
 easily, and asks to learn the shadow clone already. Naruto recalls having had lots of trouble learning it, but
Boruto
 points he also picked up walking up vertical surfaces easily.
Chōchō
 and
Sarada
 watch from afar, Chōchō still crushing on him, and Sarada, while understanding of Kawaki's situation, is jealous of his special attention from Naruto. Chōchō argues Naruto treats everyone like family.
Sai
 and
Shikamaru
 also watch them, Shikamaru find the children to be too innocent. Sai asks if he still doesn't trust Kawaki, and Shikamaru asks him, as head of
Anbu
, to give him one. He reaches for his cigarettes, but Sai lifted them off, as smoking in public places is forbidden. Sai concedes Naruto is naïve as well, but they don't have enough information to conclude Kawaki intends to betray them. Shikamaru asks about the intel
Konohamaru
 recovered, and Sai reveals them found coordinates to a place that can only be reached with
space–time ninjutsu
. Sai is suspicious of how plain it was, considering it a possible trap, but being unable to ignore it, they passed it on for
Sasuke
 to investigate.

Sasuke arrives at the location with
his space–time ninjutsu
. He examines carvings on the walls, one of which causes a hologram of
Kinshiki
 to appear. An adjacent carving changes it to
Momoshiki
. A third carving changes it to
Kaguya
. Noticing all of them to be
Ōtsutsuki
 who came to their world, and the carvings to be arranged in pairs, some quite significantly damaged, he speculates Kaguya also came with a partner. He observes the hologram activated from the carving paired with Kaguya's. He hears some ruckus coming from under the hologram's platform, and is shocked to find a
Ten-Tails
-like tailed beast.

Naruto asks Boruto about his
Kāma
, but it hasn't hurt again, only throbbed after training. Sarada teases him on becoming more sensitive, and
Mitsuki
 dismisses it, flustering her. Boruto asks Kawaki, who shares similar experiences, adding he hasn't woken up from nightmares anymore either. Sarada wonders if there's any connection to the mark on her
mother's
 head, aware it's some jutsu. Naruto explains a bit on the
Strength of a Hundred Seal
, telling them to look at the
Hokage Rock
, pointing out the
Fifth Hokage
 also had it. Kawaki isn't optimistic, as the shape is very common, but Mitsuki has been told by his
parent
 that there is a lot of poorly understood history about the jutsu. Sarada says she'll ask her mother about it. Boruto asks Kawaki if he's up to go ask the Fifth about it, but he has things to do at home. Before Boruto leaves with Mitsuki, Kawaki warns him that
Jigen
 knows everything and that looking into Kāma will eventually lead them to him. Boruto agrees they'll have to get stronger, and assures Kawaki his issues aren't just his own anymore, calling him brother. He says they'll crush Jigen and Kara together. Kawaki smiles at that and agrees.

Sasuke observes the tailed beast resembles the Ten-Tails, noticing its eye, and its tails pinned down by stakes, unable to tell how many there are. Before he can do anything else, he notices someone arriving through space–time ninjutsu and hides. From the intel he has from Anbu and the Kāma on his chin, Sasuke recognises Jigen. Jigen talks at the beast nonchalantly as he hovers above it, calling it Ten-Tails. It tries to eat him, but he's out of reach. Jigen says it's too soon, and that he has to complete the vessel. He uses his Kāma to absorb more of its chakra, and as the Kāma pattern spreads, which Sasuke likens to Boruto and Kawaki, Jigen's form briefly changes into the
Ōtsutsuki
 supposedly partnered with Kaguya. Sasuke is concerned by all of it, and feels the need to inform Naruto at once. Jigen intends to visit Boruto and Kawaki.

Mitsuki raises the possibility that Boruto will never be rid of his Kāma, regardless of defeating Jigen or not. Boruto wants to deal with the situation as if it was a mission, to change his disposition towards it. If it's a mission, he'll put his best effort on it as Sasuke's disciple, the Hokage's son, and a ninja.

Author's Note

“

There is a work of art in Sumida Ward entitled
The Future Where Everything Is Possible
. It's apparently based on a drawing made by a grade school student, but my heart feels warm and fuzzy when I look at it. It's a spaceship with time machine capability and can travel underwater as well as in the sky. It can race across the ground and tunnel underground as well. If you and your pet put on the some hat, you can communicate with each other. How awesome! Especially the part about the hats. I cant wait for the future where everything is possible!

From this volume on, I'm including some behind-the-scenes columns exhumed from storage. I'd been steadily cranking these out with
Kishimoto
 Sensei from about just before the battle against Kaguya in
Naruto
, and they were created with the launch of the
Boruto
 film and TV anime in mind.

I would be grateful if you'd use them as world guides to enjoy the series. If they could serve as a means to give Boruto and his friends' everyday life more than a passing thought!
