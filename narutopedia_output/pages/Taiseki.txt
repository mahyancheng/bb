Taiseki
 (
タイセキ
) was a
jōnin
 from
Iwagakure
.

Background

During the
Third Shinobi World War
, he led a team with
Kakkō
 and
Mahiru
, using their superb diversionary tactics to attack the enemy. With his
Hiding with Camouflage Technique
 he was able to approach his enemies from their blind spot, easily killing them with a single strike. They confronted
Team Minato
, led by
Kakashi Hatake
, during the Third Shinobi World War, managing to take
Rin Nohara
 hostage.

Using his Hiding With Camouflage Technique, he was able to sneak up on Kakashi, blinding his left eye. Immediately following this,
Obito Uchiha
 awakened his
Sharingan
 and used it to find and kill Taiseki.

Personality

He was quiet, unlike his partner Kakkō. He was also very cautious,
 as he took his battle with Kakashi and Obito "nice and slow", even if they were kids. Even during their battle, he was careful to immediately discard the kunai with Kakashi's blood on it so that he couldn't be tracked.

Appearance

He has a wide frame, with neck-length black hair, and a bandanna with his village's
forehead protector
. He wore the standard Iwagakure shinobi uniform, complete with a
flak jacket
 and a shirt having no right sleeve along with a dark indument hanging from his waist onto his right leg, reaching to his knees.
