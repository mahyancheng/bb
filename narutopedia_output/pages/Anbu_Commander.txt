This
shinobi
 is seemingly the commander of
Konohagakure
's
Anbu
.

Background






Hiruzen and the Anbu confronting Orochimaru.



He and
another Anbu
 accompanied the
Third Hokage
 in infiltrating a secret bunker with the intention to find out who was behind the disappearances of shinobi from their village. After they disarmed the traps, they confronted the person behind the acts and discovered it was
Orochimaru
. Having been caught, the Sannin
attacked
 the Anbu and Hiruzen, giving him an opportunity to escape and flee the
Land of Fire
.

Appearance

He is dressed in a white cloak and black trousers with bandages tied around his right leg, arm-guards, gloves and black sandals. He also has brown, spiky, hair and wears a mask with a monkey motif inclusive of pointed ears, detailed eyebrows and three, thick stripes with two along either sides of his cheek and one on his forehead. He has also been depicted at times with a line running across the right side of his mask to its eye hole.

Abilities

The fact that he is the commander of the Anbu, which consists of some of Konohagakure's most skilled shinobi implies that he is a very powerful ninja. He is very observant, seen when he recognises that
Pain
's
chakra
-levels must be immense and that he is controlling the
bodies
 used to destroy Konoha by chakra alone.
 The fact that he carries a
sword
 hints that he is skilled in
kenjutsu
.

Part II

Pain's Assault

During
Pain's assault
 on Konoha, he reported to
Tsunade
 that the enemy's strength was estimated at three battalions in total by the analysis team. On Tsunade's orders, he assigns squads to protect
Shizune
 while she researched and the
interrogators
 while they tried to acquire more information. He later accompanies Shizune,
Inoichi
 and
Ino
 who had broken off from the main group in order to uncover the mystery of Pain together. However, the
Human Path
 was able to slip into his guard and
interrogate
 Shizune after taking her captive, killing her in the process. Later he, along with Inoichi and Ino joined
Shikaku
,
Shikamaru
 and
Shiho
, carrying Shizune's corpse.

After the battle between
Naruto
 and
Pain
, he informs Shikaku of the emergency meeting which he attends along with
Danzō Shimura
, and the
Konoha Council
.

Five Kage Summit






The Fire Daimyō and delegation meet with the governing body of Konoha.



After the invasion, the Anbu commander is one of five Konoha villagers to be summoned before the
Fire Daimyō
 to discuss the village's response and reconstruction. With Tsunade in a coma, Danzō suggests selecting a new
Hokage
. Though silent in the meeting, he is shocked when the Fire Daimyō announces that Danzō was to become the next Hokage.
