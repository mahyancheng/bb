Team Ganryū
 was a team led by
Ganryū
 ten years prior to the formation of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. With the assistance of
Iwagakure
, they were sent on a mission to retrieve a document taken by
Kumogakure
 from
Kirigakure
. However, when the document was retrieved, the Iwagakure
shinobi
 betrayed the Kiri team and killed
Junsai
 and
Suiren
, where the latter sacrificed herself to save Ganryū. This incident would become known as the
Tragedy of Yosuga Pass
 which began the hostilities between the two nations.

Trivia

A defining trait of this team was their uniform, which consisted of a customised
flak jacket
 (which were similar to those worn by Iwagakure in design, but were coloured slate grey) and a jade-green bangle worn on the right forearm.

Ganryū would in later years amass a small group of Kirigakure shinobi whom also felt the same hatred towards Iwagakure-nin and attack the shinobi from Iwagakure where they could.
