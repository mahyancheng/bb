Tonton
 (
トントン
) is
Tsunade
's ninja pig (
忍豚
,
Ninton
), often kept in the care of
Shizune
.

Personality

Above all else, Tonton is a highly devoted, and dutiful pet pig.
 Her devotion to Tsunade was noted during her master's battle with the other
Sannin
, which she watched in earnest as
Gamakichi
 and
Gamatatsu
 bickered. This even surfaced during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, where, in her earnest to aid the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
, Tonton carried around several large sized crates around the camp ground, eventually spraining her foot.

Tonton does not speak in any human language, but still manages to get her point across by whining in her own unique tone (a "buhi" or "oink" depending on the language). It seems that Tsunade and Shizune are able to understand what Tonton is trying to say. Tonton's nose also seems adept at tracking things, so much so that
Pakkun
 has some familiarity with her.

Appearance

Tonton is of a light pinkish colour, much like any other ordinary pig. Her cheeks blush in a darker shade of the same tint as her skin. She is always seen wearing a pearl collar and a dark red jacket.

Abilities

Tonton's sense of smell is noted to be even finer than that of a
ninken
. She has reportedly smelled debt collectors coming and saved Tsunade from them countless times while they were not in Konoha.
 She was also able to direct Shizune,
Jiraiya
, and
Naruto
 to Tsunade's location after she was locked in battle. Also, despite her small size, she is strong enough to carry several crates at least as large as her.

In the anime, Tonton once performed a
Transformation Technique
 to appear as Tsunade. However, while doing so, she was still unable to speak.

Part I

Search for Tsunade

While travelling with Shizune and Tsunade, Tonton encountered
Orochimaru
 and
Kabuto
, who were hoping for Tsunade to cure Orochimaru's arms. She is later seen on the battlefield watching the battle along with
Gamakichi
 and
Gamatatsu
.

Mizuki Tracking Mission

In the anime, Tonton was seen during the escape of the criminals from the
Konoha Strict Correctional Facility
. She used her keen sense of smell to find the escapees until she was relieved of these duties by
Pakkun
.

Part II

Pain's Assault

Tonton was present when Naruto was informed of his master's death, with Shizune holding her in her arms.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown

When Tsunade awakes from her coma, Tonton looks pleased to see her up until Shizune mistakenly believes that Tsunade wanted to eat Tonton to regain her stamina, much to their panic.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Tonton remained by Shizune's side in the
Logistical Support and Medical Division
. When Shizune introduced her to the division members, she expressly told them that Tonton was not food. During the night when the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 had retreated for protection and treatment at the division barracks, Tonton busily carried crates around the compound despite Shizune's behest to not overdo it.
 Tonton had to later be tended to by Shizune when she had sprained her right front leg after carrying too many heavy crates.
