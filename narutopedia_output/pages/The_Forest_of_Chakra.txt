"
The Forest of Chakra
" (
チャクラの森
,
Chakura no Mori
) is episode 10 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Kakashi
 is brought to
Tazuna
's house to recover from overuse of his
Sharingan
. When he wakes up, Kakashi realises that Zabuza's death had been odd, and concludes that it had probably been an act. Elsewhere, the hunter-nin, named
Haku
, revives
Zabuza
, revealing that he is in league with the
missing-nin
. Zabuza promises to crush Kakashi when they meet again. In the meantime, both Kakashi and Zabuza need to rest for at least a week to recover from their battle. To prepare for Zabuza's likely return, Kakashi takes
Team 7
 to the nearby woods for training, where they learn to walk up vertical surfaces using only their
chakra
.
Sakura
 performs perfectly the first time, but
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 require extra training. Kakashi notices that Naruto is finally getting a good grasp on teamwork, and recognises that Naruto's chakra is the highest of all those present.
