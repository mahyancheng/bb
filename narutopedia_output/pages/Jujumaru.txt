Chūnin Re-Examination Arc

As the Land of Calm Seas was ravaged by an epidemic, a medical-nin found cheap and quick-acting treatment to help the population. The greedy daimyō sent out Jujumaru and his brother to destroy the treatment so he could continue using his slower method of treating people to make more money. One after another, the brothers were able to track down the medical-nin's students, securing their medical samples and killing them. The final target was
Mozuku
, who hired
Konoha-nin
 as bodyguards. Jujumaru was able to trap them while Kurobane secured the medical samples and left to deliver them. Jujumaru boasted about his technique, but the Konoha-nin were able to break apart his webs. Despite
Chōchō Akimichi
 falling victim to Jujumaru's technique,
Shikadai Nara
 was able to counter it with his
Shadow Imitation Technique
. Switching tactics, Jujumaru tried attacking, managing to injure Chōchō, but was soon defeated by the others and tied up.
