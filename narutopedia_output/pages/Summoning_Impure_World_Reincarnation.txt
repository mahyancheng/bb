The
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 is a jutsu that binds the
soul
 of a deceased person to a living vessel, restoring them as they were in the last moments of their lives in order to do their summoner's bidding. It was originally created by
Tobirama Senju
, some time after which he declared it a
kinjutsu
.
Orochimaru
 would discover the technique decades later and improve on its use, while his subordinate
Kabuto Yakushi
 nearly perfected it.

Usage





The seal for the ritual.



Before this technique can be performed, the user must first acquire some of the
DNA
 of the person they intend to reincarnate. Kabuto remarks that this essentially results in grave-robbing, although blood stains or organs salvaged after the target's death can also be used.
 The soul of the intended reincarnated must also reside in the
Pure Land
; souls trapped in the stomach of the
Shinigami
, for example, cannot be reincarnated so long as they reside there.
 A living sacrifice is also required for the reincarnated soul to use as a vessel.
 If the souls are readily available in the Impure World, such as was the case with the first four Hokage who were freshly freed from the Shinigami's stomach, they can be reincarnated through this technique.






Torune being reincarnated with Fū as the sacrifice.



To actually perform the Impure World Reincarnation, the DNA of the person to be reincarnated is smeared on a special scroll. Once the scroll is activated, the remains spread out in the form of a special seal with the living sacrifice in the centre. Then dust and ash encase the sacrifice's body, giving them the same appearance that the reincarnated had at the time of their death; the process is apparently painful for the sacrifice.
 The sacrifice's chakra signature is completely overridden with the chakra of the one being reincarnated. Although the sacrifice is still technically alive so long as the technique is active, their body will never again be theirs and they will die when the reincarnated soul is released.

Although Tobirama was the technique's creator, his usage had two flaws: the reincarnated souls were greatly diminished in power compared to when they were alive and he could only control a small number at a time.
 Orochimaru was able to somewhat improve on the power restriction, although the power of the shinobi he reincarnated was still not anywhere close to when they were alive. Ultimately, it was Kabuto who almost completely eliminated all flaws, bettering the Impure World Reincarnation to such a degree that the reincarnations' power levels were nearly identical to how they were during life, as well as allowing the caster to control as many reincarnations at a time as they wished, resources permitting.
 His improvements, combined with the fact that performing the Impure World Reincarnation requires no chakra from the user, causes Kabuto to declare it the most powerful jutsu in history. Following his revival, Orochimaru used Kabuto's refinements and was therefore able to reincarnate beings who nearly had their original levels of power.

Reincarnations can be mobilised like standard infantry, where they must travel to their destination. Alternatively, coffins that contain them can be summoned to a location, assuming someone is there to perform the summoning; the anime does not consistently require this.
 Reincarnations can be recalled in a similar way, with a coffin emerging around them to take them back.

Control






The talisman used to control the reincarnated.



The only discretion a user needs to exercise for the Impure World Reincarnation is how much control to exert over the reincarnated soul. After first performing it the user is only able to restrict their movements. In general, this limited control is not an issue for the summoner, and they will typically "deactivate" the reincarnation, placing them in a coffin for storage and transportation until they're needed. However, when the perfected Impure World Reincarnation is used to revive somebody, there comes a possibility that they will be strong enough to resist this control; Tobirama was able to resist this control prior to Orochimaru using Hashirama's cells to strengthen the binding and Orochimaru notes
Hashirama Senju
 could break free if he chose to, even with the enhanced binding from Hashirama's cells.

In order to actually be able to control their actions, the user must implant a special talisman - generally attached to the end of a kunai - within the reincarnation's brain. The talisman's design determines how strong the control is:

At its most basic, the reincarnated souls retain their personality, giving them the freedom to approach a given task however they like so long as it broadly carries out the summoner's bidding. On the one hand, this makes them more useful in combat because they know how best to use their own abilities
 and, if deployed against somebody they knew when they were alive, there is a possibility for psychological warfare.
 On the other hand, although they are compelled to do as their summoner wishes and act without reluctance,
 they can undermine their summoner to a degree, either by making poor decisions that opponents can take advantage of or by giving opponents advice about how to defeat them.
 Despite its risks, Kabuto prefers this level of control.

At its strongest level, the reincarnated soul's personality is entirely eliminated. The summoner instead controls all of their actions, even permitting them to speak through the reincarnation
 or summon other reincarnated souls to their location. Although this guarantees the reincarnated soul will only ever act as desired, they are less resourceful and it requires the summoner's attention for every action that must be taken, making it difficult for them to multi-task depending on the circumstances. Orochimaru prefers this level of control. Kabuto has at times rewritten talismans remotely in order switch to this level of control when the situation calls for it.

Kabuto and Orochimaru are able to strengthen the bindings they use through external means: Kabuto siphons chakra from the
cursed seal

Anko Mitarashi
 is branded with;
 Orochimaru uses
Senju

cells
.
 On a related note, any level of control creates a traceable chakra signature between the reincarnated soul and their summoner, allowing reincarnated
sensors
 to trace the summoner's location.

Attributes






Deidara being rejuvenated.



When first summoned, the body will appear grey and in a state of minor decay: marred by cracks and other imperfections. If the summoner chooses to, they can rejuvenate the reincarnation while planting their control talisman, restoring their complexion and reducing some of the imperfections; this is merely aesthetic and the signs of decay do not inhibit their abilities. An unavoidable characteristic of a reincarnated body is the darkened sclerae, with a soul that retains its personality having grey sclerae and a soul with a suppressed personality having black sclerae.

A reincarnated individual will have all the abilities they had during their life, including
kekkei genkai
 and
kekkei tōta
, along with all of the memories they had when they were alive, although their memories of the
Pure Land
 are not accessible. They are also physically restored as they were at the time of their death, including certain physical handicaps they may have possessed, such as
Nagato
's damaged legs, although
Itachi Uchiha
 was restored with perfect vision rather than the deteriorating vision he had during the final stages of his life. Other exceptions also exist: illnesses they had will not be retained, nor will any physical damage that contributed to their death. There is some inconsistency of whether or not foreign body matter will be restored as well:
Hanzō
 retains the poison gland of the
black salamander
, but
Madara Uchiha
 did not have access to Hashirama Senju's genetic material when he was reanimated and thus Kabuto grafted artificially recreated Hashirama cells onto Madara's reincarnated body to restore those abilities.

Clothing is reproduced according to what they wore when they died, although it is merely a superficial aspect of their reincarnated body; armour offers no actual protection, being of the same ashen material as the rest of their body. Reincarnated members of
Akatsuki
 are, however, outfitted with different cloaks than they used to wear. Weaponry is usually not retained and must instead be gathered by the summoner; the reincarnated
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
 only have access to those swords Kabuto is able to acquire.
 One exception seems to be the
Gold and Silver Brothers
'
Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths
, which are still seemingly stored within the brothers' bodies.

The vast majority of the reincarnated were able to achieve the same power they had at life, such as
Mū
. But a few of the reincarnated, such as Madara Uchiha's full abilities were limited by the technique. For example, even with the perfected Impure World Reincarnation; Madara's reincarnated body is successfully bound by the
Sage Art: Gate of the Great God
, which he easily breaks free of as soon as he is
restored to life
.
 Likewise, there are some things a reincarnated body simply cannot do, such as access all the abilities of the
Rinnegan
 or become the
jinchūriki
 of the
Ten-Tails
.

Enhancements






Tobirama using the Mutually Multiplying Explosive Tags.



One of the major benefits of the Impure World Reincarnation is that it grants immortal bodies to those who are reincarnated. Any damage they receive will regenerate in time and, assuming the damage is not too debilitating, they can continue attacking even before their body recovers. This was one of the main purposes Tobirama created the technique for, as he would use one or more reincarnated souls to perform a series of
Kamikaze
-like attacks until the opposition was wiped out;
 he created the
Mutually Multiplying Explosive Tags
 specifically for this purpose. Reincarnated bodies do not bleed, except in those cases where blood is needed to perform the
Summoning Technique
.

A second benefit is the limitless refilling of their diminished chakra reserves that the reincarnated individuals have access to; they can fight eternally and perform ordinarily physically demanding or chakra-intensive jutsu without issue, knowing their current reserves will infinitely refill.
 They are still subject to certain inherent demands of the jutsu itself, such as the
Second Tsuchikage
's chakra supply being cut in half after using the
Fission Technique
 or only being able to create a certain number of
clones
.
 Other side-effects may still manifest, such as when Itachi's eyes bleed from using his
Mangekyō Sharingan
, although he does not suffer vision loss and is also otherwise not inhabited by the bleeding.

The reincarnated body can be further enhanced to "beyond their prime". When Madara Uchiha was brought back, Kabuto put his body through a selective evolution, combing the best attributes from different points of his life. In addition to his body being restored to its physical prime rather than the withered state it had when he died, he also retained the various abilities he gained only during the last years of his natural life; he retained the graft of Hashirama Senju's DNA so he could still access the First Hokage's abilities, and he has access to
dōjutsu
 he gave up during his life.
 The reincarnated jinchūriki similarly have their respective
tailed beasts
 sealed back into them.

Reincarnated individuals are immune to the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
.

Countering






Itachi Uchiha's soul ascending.



Killing the summoner does not release the Impure World Reincarnation, and in fact that can be considered inadvisable.
 There are only three guaranteed ways to end the technique:

Remove the soul from the reincarnated body, such as with the
Dead Demon Consuming Seal
.

Have the summoner end the technique. As they are unlikely to do this voluntarily, using a
genjutsu
 to trick them into cancelling the technique is ideal. The sequence of
hand seals
 for cancelling the technique is
Rat → Ox → Monkey → Tiger → Dragon → Boar
 and saying "release" (
解
,
kai
).
 (When demonstrating the technique to
Tobi
, Kabuto lied that the seals to release it are
Dog → Horse → Tiger
.)
 The
Sage of the Six Paths
 has demonstrated the ability to release the Impure World Reincarnation despite not being the summoner.

A less reliable, though equally effective method is to have the reincarnated soul be affected in some emotional way that gives them closure, allowing their soul to break free of the Impure World Reincarnation's influence.

When a soul is released from the Impure World Reincarnation, their body disintegrates back into dust and the sacrifice's corpse will be left lying in the debris. The soul may linger briefly - with their personality restored if it was being suppressed - to leave parting words or take final actions. Souls released by their summoner will be enveloped in light throughout the process.

Even if the Impure World Reincarnation cannot be broken conventionally, reincarnated bodies can still be neutralised. During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 develop the method of binding the reincarnations' bodies so that they can't move and then placing a
seal
 on the bindings so that they no longer pose a threat. The Benihisago and Kohaku no Jōhei are able to seal the reincarnated bodies to such a degree that even the release of the jutsu won't affect the seal.
Yin–Yang Release
, as manifested in
Truth-Seeking Balls
, can negate the regenerative properties of reincarnated bodies, reducing their effectiveness and, if used to strike a vital spot, kill them for all intents and purposes.
 The spirits of those reincarnated by the technique will remain damaged even if the jutsu is released, as shown with
Minato Namikaze
. Itachi also used his
Sword of Totsuka
 to seal Nagato, his ultimate fate unclear after Itachi had Kabuto released the technique.

There are also other instances of a reincarnated body escaping their summoner's influence.
Itachi Uchiha
 was targeted with
Kotoamatsukami
 by
Shisui
's eye transplanted into a
crow
 which was stored in Naruto, displacing Kabuto's commands with different orders.
 Kabuto can regain control of Itachi by gaining access to the control talisman,
 and in fact is still able to release him from the Impure World Reincarnation. Conversely, if the reincarnated soul knows the hand seals, they can sever the summoner's contract with them; in the anime, the seals are
Snake → Ram → Boar → Dog → Tiger
.
 This grants them full control of their own actions, all the benefits of an immortal body, and prevents the summoner from releasing them from the Impure World Reincarnation.
Madara Uchiha
 describes this as "the one risk of the technique".
 Another way to take over the control of reincarnated bodies is through the usage of the
Six Paths Technique
, as in the case of Obito's Six Paths jinchūriki. Because of Obito's
Black Receivers
 being embedded into the left side of each jinchūriki's chests, he was able to wrest Kabuto's control over the revived jinchūriki, and thus control the revived jinchūriki's near-perfectly. However, it should be noted that Kabuto is still able to release them from the Impure World Reincarnation.

During the

, Orochimaru attempted to reincarnate Minato Namikaze, unaware that his soul did not reside in the
Pure Land
. For that reason the summon failed.
 The failed coffin is not seen in the manga, but in the anime it briefly appears with "four" (

Notes

Kabuto mentions his desire to reincarnate certain shinobi:

Jiraiya
, though his body lies at the bottom of the ocean where the water pressure is too great to reach. However, he claimed that the bloodstains on the
Six Paths of Pain
's weapons may provide enough DNA.
Tobi
 denies him this request on the basis that doing so would be "pushing [his] luck".

Shisui Uchiha
, but Kabuto could not find his body. He suggested that one of Shisui's eyes that was crushed by
Danzō Shimura
, whose corpse was in Tobi's possession, would be sufficient. As with Jiraiya's case, Tobi threatened him not to push his luck.

In the anime, Kabuto planned to reincarnate
Baki
, if he died during his fight with Hayate Gekkō.

In the anime, Kabuto's reincarnation of Chūkaku and Heiji are accidents, as he intended to reincarnate
Chiriku
 and Hanzō, respectively.

Kabuto deploys these and other mistaken reincarnations to try and release more important reincarnations from their bindings. As most are no stronger than
genin
, they all fail.

Trivia






The pebbles and grid Kabuto uses.



Kabuto is seen using a grid to keep track of all the reincarnated individuals he controls, with a pebble representing each shinobi.
 It is not clear if there is some actual connection between the grid and those he reincarnates or if it's a mere convenience for him. In the anime, the pebbles crumble when the reincarnation is sealed. All of the pebbles are light-coloured except for
Madara Uchiha
's, whose is black.
 In the anime, the failed reincarnations are represented by piles of sand.

"Edo" (
穢土
,
literally meaning:
 Dirty Soil) is what Japanese Buddhists call the normal world, where unenlightened people live. The current, living world. The world of the people who have not yet have escaped the polluting thoughts (greed, hatred, delusion, etc.) that result in suffering.

A possible translation of
Tensei
 is "Resurrection". In terms of this technique, both "Reincarnation" and "Resurrection" can be found; the sacrificed body is
reincarnated
 into the body of the summoned shinobi, while the reincarnated shinobi is
resurrected
 from the dead.

Due to the mechanics of this technique, Orochimaru's attempt to summon the Fourth should not have been feasible, as the limitations of the ritual would have been apparent during the initial summoning process, making such an action fundamentally impossible within the framework of the technique.

In
Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 2
, Orochimaru reincarnates the
Third Hokage
 despite his soul not being in the
Pure Land
.

Orochimaru also reincarnates
Zabuza
 and
Haku
 to aid him in a second
Konoha Crush
.

During the original
Naruto
 anime, a reincarnated target's eyes appear normal, albeit glazed over.
 In
Naruto: Shippūden
, the eyes are corrected to match the manga.

Starting in
Ultimate Ninja Storm Generations
, Kabuto Yakushi (Snake Cloak Form) uses the Impure World Reincarnation as his ultimate technique. He summons Kakuzu, Itachi, and Deidara, who attack the opponent using the
Lightning Release: False Darkness
,
Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique
, and
C1
, respectively.

In the anime, when eradicating the personality of Hanzō, Kabuto used several hand seals instead of just one.

In
Konoha Shinden: Steam Ninja Scrolls
,
Ryūki
 claimed to have redesigned this technique as a means to communicate with the dead without actually sacrificing anyone. This was ultimately a lie to gather sacrifices for his goal in gaining immortality from
Jashin
.

In the
anime
 within Tsunade's
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 dream, Sasori used this technique to revive an army of shinobi puppeteers, which could all use
Red Secret Technique: Performance of a Hundred Puppets
.

In
Sasuke Retsuden: The Uchiha Descendants and the Heavenly Stardust
, Zansūru claimed that the Impure World Reincarnation is merely a regional variant of
Redaku Reincarnation Ninjutsu
. Decades prior to Sasuke's time in the
Astronomy Research Institute
, Orochimaru visited the Institute to research this technique, ultimately stealing a few of the more valuable documents for his own purposes and using what he learned to improve upon Tobirama's Impure World Reincarnation.
