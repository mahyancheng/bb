The
Lizard Puppet
 is an S-rank
puppet
 used by
Ibushi
. It is similar to
Sanshōuo
 as it is based on a lizard and breathes fire. Its use was supposedly exclusive only for the top-ranking members of the
Shirogane clan
. The puppet was eventually destroyed by
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Kakashi Hatake
.

Appearance

The puppet looks very similar to
Kankurō
's
Sanshōuo
 except having a medium-sized lizard head, a light bluish colour on the top of its lower back, four segmented lizard legs, a long segmented lizard tail, and three curved horns at the side of its head and one at the bottom. It also has a bulls-eye target symbol in the centre of its head, three yellow-golden, mechanical, porcelain-like eye irides with thin, light black lines that connect near to its nose and porcelain teeth.

Abilities and Weapons

The lizard puppet did not possess much in the way of weaponry, but did display several abilities that no other puppet has shown. Fighting within a barrier, it displayed the ability to adhere to the vertical surfaces of this arena, and while doing so it can violently shake itself in order to cause objects to fall down on the enemy. Whether it can do so on normal walls is unknown. It has shown to be amphibious, swimming up to the boat in Rakan Lake, and like all Shirogane puppets, can seemingly fade into thin air and possesses a mechanism to project its user's voice. In terms of combat, its only weapon is a flamethrower installed in the mouth, but it also attacks by spinning around to create a gust and spinning itself rapidly in midair for a strong rolling tackle.
