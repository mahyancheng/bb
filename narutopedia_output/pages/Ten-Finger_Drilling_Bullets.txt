Kimimaro
 parts his fingertips, creating holes that expose hardened finger bones. In volleys (five per hand), he shoots these bone bullets at a target by swinging his hand,
 causing a loud sound as they're fired. The bullets travel incredibly quickly through the air and take a spinning motion. Upon impact, the bullets tear through skin, flesh, and bone.
 The bullets aren't able to penetrate the
Shield of Sand
,
 but in the anime, they can pierce
samurai
 armour.
 Kimimaro relies on this technique for his long-range attacks.

Trivia

The first two kanji (十指) would normally be pronounced as
jisshi
 (
じっし
) or
jusshi
 (
じゅっし
), rather than the
teshi
 (
てし
) given by the furigana.
Teshi
 probably comes from
shushi
 (
手指
,
finger
), the first kanji of which can also be pronounced as "
te
".

This is Kimimaro's only Shikotsumyaku technique that is not referred to as a dance.

In video games, such as
Ultimate Ninja Storm
, Kimimaro uses these bullets as his main projectile instead of the
shuriken
 used by most characters.
