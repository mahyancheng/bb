"
Following the Master's Shadow
" (
師の影を追って
,
Shi no Kage o Otte
) is episode 153 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Naruto
 leaves
Tsunade
's office as the Great Sage Toad
Fukasaku
 muses how he hopes Naruto is the
Child of the Prophecy
. He reveals that before
Jiraiya
 died, he managed to capture
one
 of the
Ame
-nin, and that Jiraiya also managed to kill one of
Pain
's six bodies, which Fukasaku has in his possession. After giving the corpse to Tsunade, the
Hokage
 orders Shizune to prep an autopsy unit. Fukasaku also has a picture of his back taken, asking the Hokage to decipher the clue and notify him, as well as to notify Naruto that he can always be reached at
Mount Myōboku
.

On his walk home, Naruto smiles as he sees an
Icha Icha
 poster and remembers how Jiraiya would always peek at nude women, citing it as research for his books, and remembers his
his first journey
 with Jiraiya. He encounters
Iruka
, who claims that the village is talking about him and offers to catch up over at
Ramen Ichiraku
, willing to treat him; however, Naruto refuses, wishing to be alone.

In her office, Tsunade tasks
Shikamaru
 with deciphering the code as she leaves, crying as she remembers her
last words
 with Jiraiya. At home, Naruto begins to cry and decides to take a walk late at night. After buying a popsicle, he sits down on a bench and allows the tears to stream from his face. Iruka walks up to him and consoles him as Naruto expresses how one of his wishes was to have Jiraiya witness his ascension to Hokage and how Jiraiya only knew the clueless Naruto during his time alive. Iruka reminds Naruto that he is a disciple of the
Sannin
 and that Jiraiya always spoke highly of him, having considered him as a grandson, and that Naruto should continue to be the
shinobi
 that he was so proud of. Iruka breaks the popsicle in two, taking one, akin to what Jiraiya used to do.

After
Mitoku
 and
Shiho
 of the
Konoha Cryptanalysis Team
 notify Shikamaru that Jiraiya's code could only be broken by those closest to him, Shikamaru asks Tsunade and Kakashi, who cannot decipher it. Shikamaru then heads to Naruto's house, only to find the
genin
 depressed. In order to snap him out of his funk, Shikamaru brings Naruto to the hospital to meet a pregnant
Kurenai
, and reveals that
Asuma
 had entrusted him to be their child's teacher. He reminds Naruto that he knows what it feels like to have a teacher killed but that instead of crying about it, they should move on, and evolve from students to teachers, honouring the teachers they had themselves. Recalling a happy image of Jiraiya, Naruto smiles, and Shikamaru gives him Jiraiya's code to decipher.

Trivia

In Kakashi's flashback with Jiraiya, there were three minor mistakes:

Jiraiya was seen wearing a Konoha
forehead protector
 instead of wearing his usual
Mount Myōboku
 one.

Kakashi was seen without wearing his gloves.

Tsunade was seen wearing her
grandfather
's necklace when she clearly gave it to Naruto
before returning
 to her
village
.
