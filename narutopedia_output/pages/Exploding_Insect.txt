The insect removed from its host before exploding.



The user blinds the enemy with a smokescreen to scatter larvae that if inhaled, will grow inside their bodies into a spider-like parasite that explodes, killing the host. The insect's growth depends on how much
chakra
 the host is using and a massive amount of chakra can speed up the growth process. The insect can however be removed by the means of surgery, though it is difficult, as one mistake could cause the insect to explode.

The
Nokizaru Group
, notable users of this technique, regularly taunts their victims into attacking after being exposed, thereby accelerating the process.
