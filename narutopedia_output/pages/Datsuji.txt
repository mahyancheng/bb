Datsuji fighting
Yome
.



Datsuji, alongside his team, participated in the joint
Chūnin Exams
. He and his team were one of the few who managed to qualify for the second round. The next day, the second exam proctor —
Temari
, announced the start of the second round taken place within
Demon Desert
.
 Following a plan set by
Shira
, Datsuji's team evaded
Team Guy
 while Shira's team set a trap for the Konoha-nin. After seemingly removing the Konoha-nin from the exam, Shira's team regrouped with the other Suna-nin with plans to make sure all the Suna-nin teams advanced to the next round. However, Datsuji and his team refused to work alongside Shira anymore. He and the other Suna-nin then attacked Shira's team to take his scroll. As Shira's team was pinned down, Team Guy appeared and drove Datsuji and the other Suna attackers away.






Datsuji and the other Suna genin team up against Lee.



Despite setting a large trap to keep enemies from following them, Datsuji and the others were soon pursued by
Rock Lee
. As the team quickly recognised him as a taijutsu specialist like Shira, they kept him at bay with genjutsu before attacking him from afar. Soon afterwards, Lee's teammates and Shira's team arrived to save him. After Datsuji and the other Suna-nin were defeated, Shira surprisingly asked Lee's team to spare them. The Suna-nin were all shocked at how quick to forgive Shira was. As Shira explained that he admires Gaara so much for changing his life through perseverance and intends to do the same, Shira offered his exam scroll on the grounds that he was defeated before. Datsuji and the other Suna-nin however declined, instead giving Shira and Team Guy their respective scrolls as they lost this fight. Noting their own pride, they were still determined to pass the exam by getting a new heaven and earth scroll from other teams before leaving.
