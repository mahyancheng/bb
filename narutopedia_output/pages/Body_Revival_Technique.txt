The
Body Revival Technique
 is a high-level medical ninjutsu, and
Shinnō
's signature technique.

Usage

The principle of this technique is to take advantage of the muscles' ability to grow stronger after repairing itself from damage. Understanding this theory, the Body Revival Technique can repair the user's body and increase its strength by manipulating the "Destruction and Rebirth" cycle of the muscles.

This technique allows the user to survive any otherwise normally fatal damage and instantly heal from the damage. A unique trait of this technique is that it can momentarily give the user the appearance of death, fooling even the most talented
medical-nins
.

When combined with
Dark Chakra
, this technique can also be used to physically enhance the person's speed, strength and healing capabilities to superhuman levels. It also alters the person's physical appearance drastically, making them younger and more fit in looks, greatly bulking their muscular physique. By Shinnō's claim, this form allows him to perform techniques that are normally taxing for the body, including open all
Eight Gates
, without any drawbacks. However, if the user loses proper control over the dark chakra while performing this technique, it can cause severe backlash that can destroy the body.

Trivia

This technique's principles is fundamentally similar to
biofeedback
