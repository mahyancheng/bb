 anime.

Synopsis

Shino
 recruits the help of
Konohamaru
 to teach his
Academy
 class about the
Summoning Technique
. Konohamaru summons
Gamagorō
 much to the amazement of most of the students except
Boruto
. When accused of jealousy by
Chōchō
, Boruto tries and fail to summon a creature since, as Shino explains to him and the class, he has signed no contract with a summoned creature.
 While they practise summoning
sealed weapons
 instead, the class soon becomes divided as the girls argue with the boys over maturity. While Konohamaru and Shino ponder what to do about the constant outbreaks of infighting, the class almost breaks out into another boys vs. girls battle at lunch. Shino intervenes just in time and instead gives the two sides the task of playing capture the flag within the Academy while he assesses each ones strengths and weaknesses. Things come to a head as both teams make their way to the rooftop: Boruto, who has stolen a scroll from the Academy once again attempts the Summoning Technique intending to summon a small toad to scare the girls. Instead, an unknown creature appears and strikes at Chōchō throwing her off the building. Boruto,
Inojin
, and
Shikadai
 are able to catch her, but the beast sets its sights on them while they helplessly dangle from the roof. Konohamaru arrives in time to defeat the beast with his
Rasengan
 and
Sumire
 silently steals the flag winning the match for the girls. Later, Boruto apologises for putting Chōchō's life in danger, prompting the girls to put a rain check on collecting their favour. While they prepare to head home, Shino advises them that they first needed to clean up the now crumbling Academy building, while Konohamaru wonders how Boruto was able to pull off summon such a large creature in the first place. While all this in taking place, a
mysterious newcomer
 looms over them all.
