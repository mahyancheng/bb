The user creates a swamp by changing the ground beneath a target into mud, which the target sinks into. The mud is infused with
chakra
 to make it sticky, ensnaring the target and preventing escape. The size and depth of the swamp are determined by the user's skill and the amount of chakra used; ideally it will be made large enough for targets to become completely submerged. It is most effective when used against multiple and/or particularly large targets.

This technique is not restricted to usage on the ground, as it can also be used to capture enemies clinging to ceilings, who will sink into it regardless.
