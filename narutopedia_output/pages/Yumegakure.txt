Yumegakure
 (
夢隠れの里
,
Yumegakure no Sato
,
literally meaning:
 Village Hidden Among Dreams) is a small village located in a deep forest of a tiny country, near the border of the
Land of Fire
. It is led by
Enzo Tenrō
.
 Ninja of this village seem to specialise in more powerful combat-oriented versions of the
Transformation Technique
. The village's forehead protector bears three "Z" symbols.

Before its destruction by the Fake
Nine-Tails
, the village was positioned in a flat valley surrounded by forests and mountains, with a bridged river running through it. The buildings were similar in architectural style to those of
Japan's Edo period
.

Background

According to
Gensui Amagiri
, the village was founded by the
Amagiri clan
 and was led by them in the past. However, the
Tenrō clan
 were the ones who sealed the
Three-Heads
 and as a result, gained control of the village and the Amagiri were exiled. The village then became known for its control of the massive guardian beast, and because of that
Konohagakure
 formed a pact of peace with Yumegakure, so that they could keep it in check.

At some point in the past, the village engaged in wars and was in a state of poverty until recently.

Locations

Forest of Mythic Beasts

The Forest of Mythic Beasts is a large forest filled with heavy mist outside the village. The forest seems to be a moist area where several large insects live. It is also home to the exiled Amagiri clan and some members guard it with a great zeal.

Hill of Illusions

The hill serves as a vantage point close to the Forests of Mythic Beasts, offering a clear view of the surrounding area.

Three-Heads Prison

The Prison of the Three-Heads lies hidden within a large cave situated inside a volcano, not far from Yumegakure. The cave's layout primarily consists of a number of lava pools, with dark stalactites and stalagmites. The prison itself is a small blue orb situated at the back of the cave.
