Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

As
Kazami
 and his
teammates
 silently wait for their opponents, they encounter
Team Kurenai
 who by chance possess the
scroll
 they seek. The two teams confront one another, and engage in battle. However, it is all part of Team Kazami's plot to find out which member has the scroll. With
Kiba
 exposed as the holder of the scroll, Team Kazami lead a joint effort to successfully obtain the Earth Scroll.

Burami
 then unleashes his unique
Smell Sphere
 technique, causing his opponents to go numb. In spite of that, Team Kurenai fight on with sheer willpower alone, much to Burami's dismay.
Muyami
 summons a
giant mole
, and, atop the creature, he and his team-mates make their escape. Luckily,
Shino
 managed to place one of his
kikaichū
 on Moguranmaru, and Team Kurenai make their pursuit. Once again, Team Kurenai fall to their opponents' prey, and end up inside a
quicksand
. Though they seemingly fall to their deaths, a
last-ditch effort
 by
Akamaru
 rescues Team Kurenai. With Team Kazami out of
Hinata
's range of
vision
, Kiba puts his nose to use once more in pursuit of Team Kazami.
