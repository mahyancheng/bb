 anime.

Synopsis

Konohamaru
 delivers a mission report to
Shikamaru
, who is dealing with
Naruto
's paperwork while Naruto is away meeting with the daimyō. Konohamaru notices papers regarding the upcoming Chūnin Exams, and Shikamaru tells him to think about his genin. Konohamaru discusses the subject with
Moegi
,
Udon
, and
Shino
, pointing out Shino's students, who have caused their share of trouble, will be participating. They go over all the incidents caused by that class and analyse their students' growth. They go out for drinks, and Konohamaru is unsure if he'll recommend Boruto to take the exam, worried that Boruto has relied too much on luck so far, and that failure in the exam will crush him.
 The others disagree.
Hanabi
 joins them, and gets drunk with Konohamaru. Hanabi accidentally gets Shino drunk, causing him to lose control over his insects. Naruto is called to resolve the situation.
