Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
 is a game developed by CyberConnect2 and published by Namco-Bandai games for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC. The North American
 and Japanese releases were scheduled for September 2014. The demo was presented on July 2, 2014 in Japanese and English for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

Gameplay






Naruto performs an aerial attack during the Ninja World Tournament.



Summing up playable and support, there are 118 characters in the game,
 including a new addition to the roster drawn by
Masashi Kishimoto
. The new character designed by Kishimoto is a mecha version of Naruto, which has a two-stage awakening: a three-tails transformation and a Mecha-Kurama transformation. Other characters may also have two-stage awakenings.

The game features separate original stories involving Mecha-Naruto,
Shisui Uchiha, Team Minato and Kushina, and the creation of the Akatsuki
. Additionally, the game features a revamped support system. There is also a "Ninja World Tournament" (
忍界武闘祭
,
Ninkai Butōsai
,
literally meaning:
 Ninja World Fighting Festival) mode, that places the player in a battle against three CPUs, in an all-out battle royale; the goal is to collect as many orbs battle during combat, as well as new environment interactions. Another new feature, is a brand new storyline which encompasses the past of the
Akatsuki
 and will allow the player to recruit (and even fight) the known members into the Akatsuki, with several new designs exclusively created for the game by Masashi Kishimoto, as well as 46
 minutes of newly animated footage to go along with the storyline.

Another novelty is that there is an anime cutscene entitled The Far Reaches of Hope, which shows Kushina Uzumaki interacting with
Team Minato
.
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
 has a new battle system where players can select different types — Ultimate Jutsu, Awakening and Drive. Each character has the option for all three types. The Storm Gauge also makes a return, and now recovers upon executing any action in the fight. Some actions will increase it more than others. Once it is at 100%, all of the player's chakra is recovered.

The three battle-types are:

The Ultimate Type:

Allows you to perform a standard Ultimate Jutsu/U2 when the user has enough chakra.

Allows you to perform a U3/Team Attack or Team Ultimate Jutsu (depending on who is in the team) when the Storm Gauge is maxed, and successfully performing one will reduce it to 0.

Awakening Type:

Allows the user to perform an Instant Awakening with the right thumbstick.

Allows you to perform a "True Awakening" (hold down Chakra Load button to awaken) when the Storm Gauge is maxed, where the Storm Gauge for that duration becomes the timer for the mode.

Drive Type (which has the most complex amount of options):

Allows you to have support drive actions, via the right thumbstick as with Instant Awakening.

When in "Attack" mode, your supports will do the equivalent to the "Attack" support types from previous
Storm
 games, with the addition of the Balance Type's "Cover Fire" action (supports perform a joint air chakra tool throw).

When in "Defense" mode, your assists will do the equivalent to the "Guard" support types from previous
Storm
 games, with the addition of Balance Type's "Ultimate Jutsu Substitution" action (chosen support sacrifices themselves to take on an Ultimate Jutsu/U2 in the user's place).

Performing a U2/Ultimate Jutsu input (Chakra Load x2>Close-Range Attack) will activate "Auto Mode", which will allow supports to be of both types above at the same time for a limited time. It also grants access to a Team Seal Barrier Technique through performing a U3/Team Attack input (Chakra Load x3>Close-Range Attack) when the Storm Gauge is full, inflicting a launch that works as a viable combo starter, while also having various debuffing effects on the victim depending on their type:

If the victim is Ultimate Type, they are sealed from using their U2/U3/Team Ultimate Jutsu.

If the victim is Awakening Type, they cannot use either version of their Awakening.

If the victim is Drive Type, they cannot use Support Drives, nor can they use their own Team Seal Barrier Technique.

Awakenings have been modified from previous
Storm
 games in the fact that all characters now have an Instant Awakening in addition to an even more powerful True Awakening, activated when the Storm Gauge is full. Another new feature is called "Shinobi Customise" which allows players to customise their fighters with accessories that can change the player's appearance. The feature is available only to those who have saved data from
Storm 3
 on in their console.

However, several mechanics have been removed and/or tweaked:

A double/extra midair jump is now added for all characters.

Ninja moves can no longer be cancelled into tilts/mid-ranged attacks, as well as no longer being cancel-able into grabs.

Ninja moves however can now also be done by holding the block/guard button and pressing a direction while doing so, but block/guard-based ninja moves are slower than the original versions.

It is now possible to Spark Cancel specific U1s/Jutsu with the block/guard button at the cost of extra chakra.

Close-range/basic attack inputs can now be cancelled into a U2/Ultimate Jutsu, at the cost of halving its damage output.

All D-Pad ninja items in the up slot are now replaced with a Guard Break, which makes the user perform a faster version of the Relay dashing animation introduced in
Storm 3
, only it inflicts a guard break state on either hit or block once it connects.

However, the original Relay mechanic itself has been removed.

Air chakra dashes are now faster versions of the original Ninja Dash animation (double tap jump quickly in midair), overall making it slower than the prior air chakra dash animations.

A new mechanic known as a Counterattack is added when both the guard and ninja tool throw buttons are combined. At the cost of reducing your max chakra threshold around 1/5th or 1/4th of the original amount (disregarding the current blue chakra gauge amount), can counter these attacks while flashing white as the user performs their chakra charging animation (and forces a guard break state on the attacker who triggered it):

Close-Range/Basic Attacks

Non-Projectile Mid-Range/Tilt Attacks

All Chakra Dashes

Guard Break attack

However, these attacks can break through the counter as normal:

Grab.

Support/U1/U2/U3.

Any projectile move.

Any puppet-based close-range/basic attack input when the puppet master is at long-range distances.

Even then, the max chakra threshold will gradually restore back to its original length if the Counterattack is not performed for a while. If another counter is performed however, the regeneration rate will reset. Even then, the max amount will be restored up to full upon the Storm Gauge being maxed out.

The U3/Team Attack introduced in
Storm 2
 is notably nerfed, making it so that instead all team members rush at the foe to circle around them somewhat, only one member on the team rushes towards the opponent first to attempt to trigger the first portion.

Likewise, "Combination Ultimate Techniques" (
合体奥義
,
Gattai Ōgi
) between two or three characters is available; also dubbed as a Team Ultimate Jutsu (abbreviated as a TUJ to differ from a U3/Team Attack) is added where it is a unique cinematic Jutsu between various specific team members, replacing the base U2/U3 input of the user.

The Body Replacement metre now recharges slightly faster than in
3
.

Glitches

When Obito (Unmasked) summons the Ten-Tails during his Awakening sequence while battling against Rock Lee (Part II) in his Eight Gates state, the latter's head momentarily disappears.

When Rōshi uses his neutral combo and delivers the last punch, he opens his mouth which shows his teeth. However, if he uses it while wearing his DLC costume, his teeth are not there. The same disappearing teeth glitch can happen to the Susanoo Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan Version of Sasuke if he uses his grab while wearing his Warrior DLC costume.

When Naruto (Part I) in his DLC Pyjama costume uses his grab, right before the opponent lands on the ground, it can be seen when the tip of the clone's sleep cap sticking out of the ground before disappearing.

This glitch doesn't happen too often. When you are playing a Challenge in the Ninja World Tournament, sometimes when it loads the contestants icons disappear then the screen goes completely white.

There is a rare glitch that happens when one team attempts to use a Team Ultimate Jutsu. If the second support member is damaged during the beginning animation (for example, is hit by a support attack or paper bomb), there is a chance the first support will continue to try and hit the opponent multiple times, even if the defending player guards multiple times. The way to break this glitch is to jump over the first support and let him/her run, then the second support will get up and will finish the Team Ultimate Jutsu attempt with the opposing player.

This rare glitch can only happen if one of the players has the Drive System. Depending on what kind of attack the opponent is using at the time and how close they are, even if the player successfully hits the Seal Barrier, the opponent will not enter the animation and thus the seal will not work, wasting the drive bar completely.

Trivia

Team Ultimate Jutsus for Naruto and Konohamaru, Neji and Hinata, as well as Guy and Lee (Part I) were found in the coding of the demo. They were, however, ultimately cut from the full release.

Some of the Ultimate Jutsu Finish's subtitles have improper grammar or misspell some of the character's names. An example is one of Fū's (No. 379) where it says, "There's no word for defeat in
Foo's
 dictionary."

A poster that depicts Mecha-Naruto and its other two forms alongside a Mecha-Naruto trading card were given to buyers of the game.

If the player uses Sasuke in his kimono outfit and does his combination ultimate jutsu with Naruto, just as they are about to strike the opponent, you can see Sasuke's cursed seal on his body, even though the version of Sasuke that the costume is for had his cursed seal removed long ago by Itachi.

When Rock Lee (Part I) finishes a Team Ultimate Jutsu and thanks his team members, he only shouts "Tenten!", even if neither versions of Tenten are on his team. The same is true with Shikamaru (Part I) as he yells "Choji!".

In one of the trailers, it showed combat between Mecha-Naruto and Shisui on the Uchiha Hideout (Destroyed) stage, yet that stage is not available to play on in the game.

When fighting against an opponent that starts in True Awakening, with a Titan Awakening Character (Madara Reanimation Resolved, Obito Uchiha, and Hashirama Sage Mode) if you perform True Awakening, the field won't change to the True Awakening field and the Titan awakening will just move through the stage background.
