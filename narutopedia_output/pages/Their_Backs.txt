"
Their Backs
" (
二人の背中
,
Futari no Senaka
) is episode 409 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

As
Chōji
, while under the control of
Saya
's
Puppet Imitation Technique
, charges at
Sakura
,
Ino
 takes over her foe's control over her team-mate and charges at
Team Saya
 instead.
Mamushi
 and
Sana
 manage to avoid the attack, but Saya takes the full blow, what was later revealed to be a
Body Replacement Technique
.
Taking the look of her puppet
, Saya manages to
regroup with her allies
, claiming that she doesn't care about the
Chūnin Exams
 anymore and that she wants revenge. As
Team Asuma
 head toward the main tower, Sakura begins thinking about how weak she was before and that she always needed
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 to protect her.
 At the same time,
Jiraiya
 is seen training Naruto, asking
Gerotora
 to weaken the
seal
 on Naruto's belly. As the seal weakens, the boy falls under the control of the
Nine-Tails
, manifesting four tails and attacking his master. After the fight, the two are seen laying in hospital beds, with Naruto apologising about what he had done to Jiraiya, only for him to say that it wasn't his fault. As Jiraiya asks whether the boy will give up, Naruto tells him that he won't, even if it'll seem impossible. Meanwhile, Sana uses her
Sandstorm Technique
 to stop Team Asuma in their tracks. As the team realises that the sandstorm is unnatural and that someone is after them, Saya uses her
Cursed Sand Puppet Technique
 to create sand dolls in order to attack and confuse her foes, with Sana using her
Sand Cloak Technique
 to disguise Mamushi as one of the creations. As Chōji fends off the dolls, one of them turns out to be Mamushi, who
uses his

snake
 to
poison
 both him and Ino. Sakura, recalling her
surgery
 and the request to
Tsunade
 for an acceptance in the Chūnin Exams, manages to replenish her
chakra
 and finish off her foes in
one blow
. She then removes the poison from her allies and thanks them for letting her join their team.
