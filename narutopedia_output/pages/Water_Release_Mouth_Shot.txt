A technique where the user spits out a single
senbon
-shaped droplet of
water
 with high velocity which is hard to avoid. Once the droplet hits anything, it forcefully bursts and injures the target. While the technique lacks the force to seriously endanger somebody, it can be used to weaken enemies while they are distracted.
