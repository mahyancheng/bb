"
Ultimate Defence: Zero Blind Spot!
" (
死角ゼロ!もうひとつの絶対防御
,
Shikaku Zero! Mō Hitotsu no Zettai Bōgyo
) is episode 61 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Iruka
 worries about Naruto since he is fighting
Neji Hyūga
. Outside of the battle arena,
Kabuto
 kills an
Anbu
 in order to impersonate him as a disguise. Naruto's
clones
 fail to hit Neji, who aims for what he believes is the real thing, but is unsuccessful. Naruto explains how he held one of his clones back from attacking, in order to draw Neji’s attention to that one.

He tackles Neji again, only to fail when he utilises the
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
.
Hiashi
 and
Hinata
 are shocked to see it, since it is a move taught only to the main branch of the Hyūga clan.
Tenten
 explains that Neji can see almost 360 degrees with his Byakugan, and emits chakra from any point in his body, rotating to repel his opponent. He then takes the
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
 stance, surprising Hiashi since this is an elite move exclusive only to the strongest of the Hyūga main branch, and proceeds to strike all of Naruto's sixty-four chakra points.
Genma
 then walks up to the two to determine whether the match is over or not.
Kiba
 asks Hinata if she ‘s okay, observing her coughing up blood. Neji is surprised that Naruto is still conscious following the attack.

Naruto feels dizzy but remembers when
Lee
 and Hinata had critical injuries due to their matches, and still managed to continue giving it their all. He manages to get back on his feet, shocking Neji. He then asks about the
Hyūga clan
 and Neji's hatred for it. Neji takes off his
forehead protector
 and reveals the
Hyūga Main Family's Juinjutsu
. He explains the circumstances surrounding
his father
's death, and the Hyūga clan's branch family. He proclaims that Naruto's fate in their match was already decided when chosen as his opponent.
