These are pills in a capsulated form created by
Magire
 and
Kido Tsumiki
. After the consumption of this drug, the user gains a heightened
transformation
. Kido's ultimate goal was to open his own military company to market these drugs, not only as weapons, but also initiators of war, thus leading to an endless cycle of revenue for him.

Overview

By collecting DNA samples left by
Naruto Uzumaki
 after his battle with
Sasuke Uchiha
 in the
Valley of the End
, along with the body of a descendant of
Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
, Kido and Magire were successfully able to create this drug. When activated, the user gains a
chakra
 cloak with tails that can range from one to nine tails  — though the precise amount of tails generated by the user depends on the amount of chakra they have. The tails are capable of being used as a shield deflecting
kunai
,
taijutsu
 or
ninjutsu
. These tails are also able to manifest into
Tailed Beast Chakra Arms
. Depending on the skills of a user, they may also be able to create Black and White chakra to use the
Tailed Beast Ball
, Kido being the only one capable of such a feat.

Drawback

Though the tails can be used defensively, the cloak that embeds the body leaves the user just as vulnerable with it as without. If the user is rendered unconscious, the cloak will disappear. The drug is also limited in duration — during combat, several users of the Tailed Beast Drug lost their cloaks, though the time seems to vary from user to user. Also, while Kido's usage of the Tailed Beast Ball was powerful, it was nowhere near as strong as ones coming from a true
Jinchūriki
 or Tailed Beast.

Trivia

Ino Yamanaka
 criticises the power gained from this drug to be unearned, and reasons it will never have a marketability despite Kido's belief it would bring him endless fortune.
