Synopsis

Sai
 administers the written portion of the
Chūnin Exam
.
Naruto
 gives an interview, explaining that recent incidents have highlighted their need for qualified shinobi, other villages also holding new exams. The
genin
 teams use their skills to share answers. Sai disqualifies a genin he catches cheating with a puppet.
Denki
 thinks all of
Team 7
 will perform well, owing to their many missions.
Boruto
 tries building Denki's confidence when he thinks he'll hold back his
team-mates
 during the practical portion of the exam. The written exam results are published, and the advancing teams celebrate.
Kaito Kawanami
, a senior of Boruto's in the
Academy
, acts haughty towards him. Boruto doesn't recall who he is, and Denki explains that
his team
 mostly take on overseas missions. Naruto, Sai, and
Shikamaru
 congratulate them, and explain they want to promote shinobi with varied skills. The exam is also a way to reassure the village following
Isshiki
's attack. Feeling good about his progress, Boruto buys taiyaki for
Kawaki
.
 Naruto checks on Boruto, who has trouble sleeping, thinking back to how he embarrassed himself during the last exam. Naruto reassures him he knows his strengths, telling him to do what he would normally do, and Boruto vows to do his best. The next day, the genin gather for the next exam.
Shikadai
 drops by to motivate his
team-mates
, reminding them that as
chūnin
, their earnings from missions will also increase. The second exam is to be held in the
Forest of Death
, where battle conditions will be simulated. Individually, the genin must rescue injured subordinates. Upon learning there are only 10 subordinates for 26 genin, one team rushes in before all instructions are given, and are disqualified upon being captured by forest wildlife. There will also be chūnin in the forest acting as enemy shinobi.
Sarada
 asks about returning with the subordinate within the time limit to advance to the third round, but the genin are surprised to be told there won't be a third round. Kaito acts chummy with Boruto. The exam begins. Naruto, Sai, and Shikamaru observe their performance through cameras.
Tsubaki
 rescues a subordinate.
Namida
 finds
Mirai
 by a campfire, thinking her to be a subordinate, but she's actually in the role of an enemy shinobi, and knocks Namida unconscious.
Team 40
 gets trapped in a sand pit.
Iwabee
 and
Wasabi
 argue over who found a subordinate.
Mitsuki
 fends off a chūnin while carrying his hostage.
Team 25
 collaborate. Boruto escapes from
insects
. Denki finds a subordinate, someone much bigger than himself, but remains committed to carrying him off the forest. The proctors praise Denki's knowledge and strategies, thinking he has high potential to become a chūnin. Boruto finds a subordinate with the help of a snake. Denki makes it off the forest. Sarada sees through Mirai's Mitsuki
disguise
 and engages in combat. Wasabi and Iwabee succeed in taking their subordinates out of the forest. Kaito lays a trap for Boruto, having placed a transmitter on him before the exam began, and takes his subordinate. However, he gets scared by a bear, and falls off to the side. Boruto's subordinate frees herself and Boruto from Kaito's web, which she assures him is an understandable special circumstance. She warns him he still has time, but Boruto chooses to check on Kaito and bandages his injury. He carries Kaito with a
shadow clone
, and almost makes it out of the forest with his subordinate before the time limit expires. Tsubaki,
Hōki
,
Inojin
,
Chōchō
, Denki, Wasabi, Iwabee, Sarada, and Mitsuki pass. Boruto also passes, and the proctors explain they were judged on overall performance, so his commitment to not abandoning an injured team-mate counted for his result, as it's not always possible to complete a mission. They're all surprised by the announcement of the final exam, consisting on one-on-one fight, so only half of them will become chūnin.
