Synopsis

Jigen
 considers it unfortunate for
Naruto
 and
Sasuke
 to have met him together, making a battle necessary. Naruto and Sasuke consider it fortunate, if they defeat him early, and their location makes it possible for them to go all out.
Koji

observes
 them, having snuck a
toad
 through the
portal
.
Boruto
's
Kāma
 recedes.
Sarada
 arrives at the Uzumaki house, and finds the remnants of Jigen's attacks. She checks in on
Konohamaru
, and
Kawaki
 tells her that Naruto was taken away.
Ino
 confers with the
Konoha Barrier Team
, confirming that Naruto and Jigen's chakra have disappeared, and orders them to continue monitoring the situation. She updates
Shikamaru
, who issues orders. Jigen fights Naruto and Sasuke,
manifesting
 rods to both attack and defend. Sasuke asks Naruto to buy him time, which Naruto does with
shadow clones
. Sasuke observes Jigen and his jutsu, as he disappears and reappears between attacks.
 He determines that Jigen is shrinking and restoring to normal size both himself and his rods. Jigen compliments Sasuke's abilities, and decides he should kill him first. Sasuke warns there's another secret to him, but Jigen attacks. Naruto blocks his rods with a
Big Ball Rasengan
. Jigen shrinks himself, but Sasuke warns Naruto where he is. Naruto attacks with a Big Ball Rasengan, which Jigen can still absorb while shrunken down. Naruto counted on it, so Sasuke can attack him while absorbing an attack. Jigen portals out of the way. He thanks them for exposing a weakness of his ability and manifests a horn, which Sasuke recognises. The
Medic Corps
 take the injured shinobi from the Uzumaki house as Boruto and
Mitsuki
 arrive. Kawaki tells them and Sarada it was Jigen, who also took Naruto away. Kawaki wants to go look for Naruto. Mitsuki points out Naruto should be ok, as Kawaki's prosthetic, which relies on his chakra, is still working. Sasuke updates Naruto on the
Ōtsutsuki‎
 and
Ten-Tails
 intel he discovered, determining his goal is to drain the
planet's
 chakra. He manifests his Complete Body
Susanoo
, and Naruto manifests
Kurama
. Jigen blocks and avoids their attacks, and kicks Sasuke out of Susanoo. Jigen pins him with rods, but Sasuke
switches places
 with him. Naruto attacks with Kurama's tails, but Jigen avoids and pins them as well. He punches Naruto out of Kurama. He baits Jigen with a
Rasengan
, but Sasuke switches places, intending to behead Jigen, who protects himself by manifesting rods from his neck. Sasuke attempts to burn Jigen with
Amaterasu
, who merely absorbs them with Kāma. Sasuke is concerned he won't have enough chakra to leave the
dimension
 with
his space-time ninjutsu
. Jigen notices a crack on his body, noting it's too much power for this body to contain, stressing his need for Kawaki. He decides to wrap things up, and stabs them from below, and begins to drop a lip on the battlefield. As it would take too much time and effort to kill Naruto with Kurama, Jigen opts to seal him. Naruto taunts him about the crack on his body, but Kurama tells him not to give Jigen a reason to change his mind. Jigen asks about Boruto and how his Kāma is maturing. He moves in to kill Sasuke, but Naruto creates shadow clones to give Sasuke time to escape. He convinces Sasuke to escape, who portals back home, to be found by
Sakura
. Jigen finishes dropping the lid and shrinks the seal. His body cracks further and he cries.
Isshiki Ōtsutsuki‎
 dismisses his pain and worth as a vessel, and portals away. Watching through his toad, Koji deems the entire affair quite informative. Kawaki's prosthetic hand stops working, causing him to drop a photo of Naruto, to his shock.
