Denka
 (
デンカ
) is a
ninneko
 that lives with
Nekobaa
 at an
Uchiha

supply base
.

Personality

While having a calm and almost pleasant disposition most times, Denka and his partner
Hina
 do not like to be treated like common pets as
Suigetsu Hōzuki
 would come to learn.

Appearance

Denka is predominantly a light-coloured brown with darker markings along his ears, on his cheeks, paws, and tail. Suigetsu when he first met them mistook the two for talking
tanuki
.
 He wears a simple blue kimono with mesh armour underneath, held closed by a simple white sash. On his forehead, is the kanji for "shinobi" (
忍
).

Abilities

While nothing has been seen of their abilities,
Sasuke Uchiha
 did note that Suigetsu would end up a scratching post if he messed with him and Hina.

Part II

Itachi Pursuit Mission

When Sasuke and
Hebi
 made their way to the old Uchiha supply base, Denka and Hina greeted them at the entrance and were glad to see Sasuke. However, when Suigetsu began treating them like common cats, Denka, who was seemingly outraged at this, hissed at him. When Sasuke later warned Suigetsu about the two and then made the reason for his visit clear, he and Hina carried them to where Nekobaa and
Tamaki
 were so they could get supplies.
