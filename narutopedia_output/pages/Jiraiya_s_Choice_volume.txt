Viz:
 Jiraiya's Decision) is volume 41 of the
Naruto
 manga.

Chapter 370

"
Unease
" (
胸騒ぎ
,
Munasawagi
)

The
Amegakure
 ninja refuses to tell
Jiraiya
 anything about
Pain
's current activities. Jiraiya leaves him, admiring his loyalty. He removes
Gerotora
 from his body, explaining that he is worried about confronting Pain. He tells Gerotora to store himself within
Naruto
 if he doesn't return. Gerotora, containing the key to the seal that keeps the
Nine-Tails
 within Naruto, advises against it. Jiraiya insists, believing
Minato
 would want Naruto to master the Nine-Tails for some unknown purpose, perhaps to combat
Tobi
.

Chapter 371

"
Old Friends…!!
" (
旧知…!!
,
Kyūchi…!!
)

As
Hebi
 heads to the rendezvous point with
Itachi
, they come across one of
Naruto
's
shadow clones
.
Sasuke
 destroys the clone, but Naruto and the
other

Konoha
 ninja pick up on his trail. In
Amegakure
,
Jiraiya
 sends one of his prisoners to Konoha while he takes control of the other to explore the village.
Konan
 sees him and tells
Pain
 about Jiraiya's presence. Pain tells her to kill him if she can before he gets there. Konan confronts Jiraiya and releases the Amegakure ninja under his control. Jiraiya, surprised to see her, remarks that she has grown.

Chapter 372

"
The Crying Country!!
" (
泣いている国!!
,
Naite Iru Kuni!!
)

Jiraiya
 asks
Konan
, a former student, who
Pain
 is. She attacks him instead of answering, having orders from Pain to kill him. He quickly neutralises and captures her. Jiraiya remarks that, having thought Konan and her peers were dead, he had never imagined they would be members of
Akatsuki
. She asks if he regrets sparing their lives, causing him to think back to when he met Konan and her friends. After the
Second Shinobi World War
, Jiraiya found three war orphans that he decided to teach how to look after themselves. Soon after meeting them, Jiraiya discovered that the boy
Nagato
 possessed the
Rinnegan
.

Chapter 373

"
The Era of Teacher and Students…!!
" (
師弟時代…!!
,
Shitei Jidai…!!
)

When
Jiraiya
 saw the young
Nagato
's
Rinnegan
, Jiraiya decided to train him,
Konan
, and
Yahiko
 so they could protect themselves and others. Having heard rumours that the Rinnegan originally belonged to the founder of the ninja world, Jiraiya also wished to teach Nagato to control his power for the world's benefit. Once he had taught them all they needed he left them on their own, later hearing they had died. Although he is glad this is not the case, Jiraiya tells Konan that what
Akatsuki
 is doing is wrong.
Pain
 appears and refutes the claim. Seeing Pain's Rinnegan, Jiraiya assumes that, although he looks very different, he is Nagato.

Chapter 374

"
Growth into Godhood!!
" (
神への成長!!
,
Kami e no Seichō!!
)

Pain

summons
 a giant crustacean to free
Konan
 from
Jiraiya
's technique. He instructs Konan to leave them. Jiraiya destroys the crab and asks what
Nagato
 has done to himself and what happened to
Yahiko
. Pain responds that Yahiko is dead and that he has moved on from his childish beliefs after experiencing so much pain, having how attained godhood. In his role as
Akatsuki
's leader, Pain intends to capture the nine
tailed beasts
 to create a weapon that can destroy entire countries. In the face of such power, the world will give up on war and achieve peace. Jiraiya insists that that would never work. Pain summons a chameleon to prove his point, and Jiraiya summons
Gamaken
.

Chapter 375

"
The Two Great Sages…!!
" (
二大仙人…!!
,
Nidai Sennin…!!
)

Jiraiya
 tells
Gamaken
 to buy him time while he prepares for
Sage Mode
.
Pain
 hides within his chameleon and
summons
 other animals to fight Gamaken. While Gameken defends against them, Jiraiya points out that Pain, having the
Rinnegan
, can use almost any technique, yet he has so far used only animal summons. Jiraiya sends Gamaken away once he is ready, blocking a summon by himself and re-entering the battle with two new
toads
.

Chapter 376

"
The Child of the Prophecy!!
" (
予言の子!!
,
Yogen no Ko!!
)

Having entered
Sage Mode
,
Jiraiya
 faces
Pain
 in battle with the help of
Two Great Sage Toads
. They ask why he would need their help, to which he responds he must kill a former pupil. Finding this significant, Two Great Sage Toads locate the chameleon Pain is hiding in and force him to show himself. Seeing his
Rinnegan
, they reflect on a prophecy that was made about Jiraiya. Jiraiya would have a student with the power to save or destroy the world. Seeing that Pain has taken the path to the world's destruction, they prepare for battle. Pain also prepares by
summoning
 two bodies.

Chapter 377

"
Sage Mode!!
" (
仙人モード!!
,
Sennin Mōdo!!
)

The two bodies that
Pain
 summons turned out to also possess the
Rinnegan
. Although confused that there are three people with the Rinnegan,
Jiraiya
 attacks, blinding one of the Rinnegan wielders. He then joins
Two Great Sage Toads
 in a joint elemental attack, but the second body absorbs it and all of their subsequent attacks. Jiraiya tries to attack the blinded body, but it has no difficulty blocking attacks that one of the other bodies can see. Noticing this,
Fukasaku
 hypothesises that they are somehow able to share vision.

Chapter 378

"
One-on-One…!!
" (
一対一…!!
,
Ittaiichi…!!
)

Knowing that, even in
Sage Mode
, he cannot defeat three
Rinnegan
 users that are able to share sight,
Jiraiya
 retreats. In addition to being able to react to any physical attack,
Pain
, a former student, knows all of Jiraiya's abilities. To get around this particular fact,
Ma and Pa
 propose a sound-based
genjutsu
, an area that Jiraiya himself has little skill with. While they prepare the attack Pain is drawn to their location. To buy time, Jiraiya cuts off the three Rinnegan from each other, allowing him to finally fight one-on-one.

Chapter 379

"
Jiraiya's Choice!!
" (
自来也の選択!!
,
Jiraiya no Sentaku!!
)

Jiraiya
 is able to hold his own in a fight with
Pain
 long enough for
Ma and Pa
 to use their
genjutsu
. The
three Pains
 are caught in an illusion and immobilised, allowing
Jiraiya
 to easily kill all three. Confident he has won, Jiraiya thanks
Shima
 and
Fukasaku
 for their help with eliminating
Pain
. Another person with a Rinnegan appears and corrects him. He attacks Jiraiya and severs his left arm. The
Six Paths of Pain
 confront Jiraiya, amongst them the three bodies he just killed, and all possessing Rinnegan.

Author's Note

“

Thanks to everyone's support,
Naruto
 has now received its first award in the U.S. I was very honoured that a Japanese manga was able to win from among so many American comics. I swear to keep working hard on this manga.
