"
Jūgo of the Northern Hideout
" (
北アジトの重吾
,
Kita Ajito no Jūgo
) is episode 117 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Synopsis

Sasuke
,
Karin
 and
Suigetsu
 head to the Northern Hideout, where they plan to recruit
Jūgo
. Karin warns them that Jūgo is an individual with repressed maniacal urges who becomes homicidal when he snaps, and that
Orochimaru
 extracted fluids secreted from his enzymes in order to create his
cursed seals
. At the hideout, they discover that the guard is missing and are subsequently attacked by a
prisoner
, who is in the second stage of his cursed seal. Having killed all the guards, the prisoner decides to attack Sasuke, only for Sasuke to
cut
 him down with his
sword
. As they enter the hideout, they are faced with various other prisoners also in the second stage of their cursed seals, and Sasuke asks Suigetsu to deal with them without killing them.

As Jūgo sits in his cell, he recalls on how he was once cooled off during a murderous rampage by
Kimimaro
, who had promised him that he would be there for him. Musing that Kimimaro is no longer with him, Jūgo constantly states that if a man were to walk through the door, he would kill him, only to continuously state that he would do the same if it were a woman. As
Sasuke's team
 make their way through the hideout, Karin sends Suigetsu down the wrong hallway in order to be alone with Sasuke, and leads him to Jūgo's cell. As Karin unlocks the door, Jūgo states that if it is a woman, he would kill her; however, just as she is about to open the door, Jūgo claims that he would kill whomever if it is a man, and is greeted by Sasuke, who opens the door. Jūgo enters into a
partial transformation
 and attacks Sasuke, who also undergoes a partial transformation into the second stage of his cursed seal. Repelling Jūgo's attack, Sasuke tells Jūgo that he is not here to fight but to merely talk to him.

In
Konoha
,
Naruto
 and
Sakura
 are summoned to
Tsunade
's office, where both she and
Jiraiya
 tell the duo that Orochimaru has been killed by Sasuke. As Sakura wells up in tears, Naruto cheerfully exclaims that he knew Sasuke would not lose to Orochimaru and proudly asks whether this means Sasuke would be returning to the village, only for Jiraiya to tell him that returning to Konoha isn't part of Sasuke's plan.
