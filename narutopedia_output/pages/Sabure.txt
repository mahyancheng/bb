Sabure
 (
サブレ
) is a pastry chef in
Konohagakure
.

Background

A citizen of the new city in Konohagakure, Sabure fell in love with
Yubeshi
, the granddaughter of his grandfather's friend
Ohagi
 from the old town. However, a rift began growing between their grandfathers and the residents of the new city and old town over a festival's firework display, to the point Sabure and Yubeshi felt they couldn't tell their grandfathers about their relationship, despite already having picked a wedding date.

New Era

When
Taruto
 and new city residents were arguing with Ohagi and old town residents, Sabure and Yubeshi tried breaking them up. After Yubeshi convinced Kakashi to solve the dispute by promising him a rare first edition of an
Icha Icha
 volume, he and Boruto visited Taruto's pastry shop, where Kakashi deduced he and Ohagi previously had a good relationship. After Taruto asked them to leave, Sabure explained the origin of the firework rivalry. Kakashi left during the explanation, as he still had more shopping to do. Boruto later asked him and Yubeshi to make their grandfathers' dango shortcake recipe in an attempt to reconcile them, but it didn't work. Kakashi suggested they could elope, but the couple wanted their grandfathers to celebrate their union. Sabure was unsure when Kakashi turned the dispute into a competition, but his interference took everyone's heart out of the rivalry. Sabure urged Taruto to reconcile with Ohagi so he and Yubeshi could get married, surprising both of the grandfathers. They made up, and attended their grandchildren's wedding.
