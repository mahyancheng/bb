Viz:
 The Great Gokage Debate…!!) is chapter 458 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

The
Kage Summit
 begins. They first discuss previous attempts to collaborate against
Akatsuki
, an idea that most of the
Kage
 rejected since each village still had a
jinchūriki
. The
Fourth Raikage
 becomes angry about the casual nature of the meeting and smashes the table in front him, prompting the Kage's bodyguards to come to their defence. Once things have settled the Raikage accuses the other villages of supporting Akatsuki in the past. The Kage start to debate the merits of using Akatsuki, so
Danzō
 gets things back on track by relaying
Sai
's report that Akatsuki is led by "
Madara Uchiha
". In
Konoha
, Sai speaks with
Sakura
 about
Naruto
's attempts to ask the Raikage to pardon
Sasuke
. Since Naruto is doing all of this because of the promise he made to Sakura, Sai reasons that he both loves Sakura and is caused constant pain because of her. At the Summit, in light of Danzō's news,
Mifune
, the Summit's mediator, suggests the ninja villages unite against Akatsuki under Danzō's leadership.
