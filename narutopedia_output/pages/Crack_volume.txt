 manga.

Chapter 588

"
The Burden of Being a Kage
" (
影を背負う
,
Kage o Seou
)

As
Kabuto
 remains incapacitated by
Izanami
,
Sasuke
 questions whether undoing the
Impure World Reincarnation
 would not mean
Itachi
 would disappear as well. Declaring that he no longer had any attachment to the world of the living, Itachi notes that he was proud to be able to protect
Konohagakure
 once more. Enraged to hear Itachi's motives, Sasuke states that while he could forgive his brother, he could never forgive the village for what they had done. This leads Itachi to tell his little brother that he won't be the one to change him and that he was doing this to aid
Naruto Uzumaki
 — whom he had entrusted that task to. Itachi then proceeds to raise the
brille
 over Kabuto's eyes and uses
genjutsu
 to order Kabuto to teach him the
hand seals
 needed to stop the Impure World Reincarnation. Meanwhile, the five
Kage
 struggle to hold their own against
Madara
's twenty-five
Susanoo
-clad
wood clones
. Amidst all the struggles, Ōnoki rallies them to fight on having been entrusted with a great task at which they could not fail. Madara notes that he needed to break Ōnoki's will as it was the most troublesome of all. Rallying to each other's side,
Tsunade

transfers

chakra
 to Ōnoki who uses a large-scale
Dust Release: Detachment of the Primitive World Technique
 which succeeds in obliterating the twenty-five clones and part of the real Madara, in one fell swoop. Splitting the cube down the middle,
Mei
 unleashes a
Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet Technique
 which
A
 charges with
lightning
. This makes contact with Madara effectively slowing down his response time. As Madara prepares to counter, it is revealed that
sand
 was also concealed in the dragon which
Gaara
 uses to bind Madara's movements further in order to create an opening for Ōnoki to use another
Dust Release
 thus giving time to seal him during the regeneration process. After they declared that this was the power of the five Kage, Madara compliments them stating that he would respond with his full power as well. He then unleashes the complete version of his
Susanoo
 stating that it would help them realise just how futile their efforts have been, regardless of being Kage.

Chapter 589

"
Impure World Reincarnation Technique: Release
" (
穢土転生の術・解
,
Edo Tensei no Jutsu: Kai
)

The five
Kage
 look on in shock as
Madara
 unleashes his
Susanoo
. After stabilising the construct,
Tsunade
 questions whether her
grandfather
 really fought against someone who was so much stronger than five Kage put together. Madara responds by saying that Hashirama was the only one who could defeat him and then states that it was a good thing that he wasn't here as the extent of damage to the surrounding landscape would be on a much smaller scale as he sends the Kage flying with one swing from his
sword
 — destroying the mountain range behind him in the process. Realising his full power,
Ōnoki
 questions whether or not Madara had gone easy on him and
Mū
 in the past, to which Madara states that why an adult should fight seriously against children. As the Kage stand to face Madara nonetheless, Ōnoki then states that they would not back down now, causing Madara to resolve himself to crushing their beliefs. Elsewhere,
Itachi
 then commands
Kabuto
 to use the
hand seals
 he had just stated to end the
Impure World Reincarnation
.
Sasuke
 uses this time to state his resolve to Itachi and that he will destroy the village because of what it did to him before bidding farewell to Itachi. As the technique is released, the reincarnated shinobi from all-over the battlefield begin to deconstruct. Upon seeing this, a battered
Naruto
 and
B
 thanks Itachi and uses it as motivation to wrap things up with
Tobi
 as well. Before being completely decommissioned, Itachi heads towards his little brother with his hand outstretched, stating that he could still make it.

Chapter 590

"
I Will Love You Forever
" (
お前をずっと愛している
,
Omae o Zutto Aishiteiru
)

With the
Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation
 finally released, all the reincarnated shinobi began to fade into pillars of light. As the battle between
Tobi
 and
Naruto
 ensues, Naruto charges at him, stating that his opponents were in front of him as Tobi contemplates the fact that
Kabuto
 had seemingly been defeated. Meanwhile, the five
Kage
 struggle to combat
Madara
, as he is about to deal another blow with his
sword
, Madara's
Susanoo
 suddenly  dissipates and he is enveloped in a beam of light, causing him to wonder what happened to the summoner. Back at the cave,
Itachi
 uses the last of his consciousness to show
Sasuke
 his memories of the
Uchiha Clan Downfall
, showing him how he came into possession of
Shisui Uchiha
's
Sharingan
,
Konoha
 leadership's decision to move against the Uchiha clan's coup d'etat, his meeting with Tobi and ending with
Fugaku
 and
Mikoto
's last words to Itachi. With the entire truth about the massacre revealed, Itachi told Sasuke that even if he never forgave him, and no matter what he decided to do from that point on, he would love him forever.

Chapter 591

"
Risk
" (
リスク
,
Risuku
)

After imparting his final words to
Sasuke
,
Itachi
's soul is released from the
Impure World Reincarnation
. On different battlefields, all the other reincarnated shinobi's souls are being released, as the five
Kage
 realise what was happening, they wonder who had released the technique with
Ōnoki
 noting that whomever it was, was a hero to the shinobi world. Regaining dominion over his movements,
Dan
 asks
Chōza
 to have them remove the
barrier
 which sealed him. When the barrier is released, Chōza notes the
hand seals
 Dan used, realises his intentions and tells him to hurry and go to
Tsunade
. Using his
Spirit Transformation Technique
 to take control of his then-ascending soul, Dan flies to Tsunade's location in time to take over her body and save her from
Madara
 — who though was being released from the Impure World Reincarnation, was still making a desperate attempt to kill the Kage. Speaking with Tsunade in her subconscious, before disappearing Dan tells Tsunade that he would wait for her in the afterlife but not to follow after him just yet and leaves her with the remainder of his chakra, thus restoring her
Strength of a Hundred Seal
. After returning to the real world, Tsunade and the other Kage watch in some confusion, wondering why Madara hadn't stopped moving as yet. He then explains that if the reincarnated know the seals to end the summoning contract of the Impure World Reincarnation, they could sever ties from the summoner. With this, Madara performs the seals to sever the contract and tells them to tell his
summoner
 that he shouldn't use
kinjutsu
 so arbitrarily.

Chapter 592

"
The Third Power
" (
第三勢力
,
Daisan Seiryoku
)

Reflecting on
Itachi
's last words,
Sasuke
 is tormented with questions about important aspects of a
shinobi
's life; including
his clan
, his friends and about his own existence. While deep in thought, the ceiling of the cave breaks open, but Sasuke manages to dodge the falling debris and
Suigetsu
 appears, along with
Jūgo
, stating that they had finally found Sasuke. Meanwhile on the battlefield, the five
Kage
 are still amazed to find
Madara
 still intact even after the
Impure World Reincarnation
 was released. Madara exclaims that after fighting him, they might have realised he was not the type of shinobi to be under someone else's control. He also states that anyone that had seen his perfect form of his
Susanoo
 had to die but laments that it would be a disgrace and defeatist to manifest it once again. Elsewhere,
Naruto
,
Kakashi
,
Guy
, and
Killer B
 are still fighting
Tobi
 and the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 with Naruto provoking Tobi to take off his mask despite Kakashi's warnings not to irate the enemy. Seemingly resigned to his actions, Tobi summons the
Benihisago
 and the
Kohaku no Jōhei
, and while remembering the fragments of the chakra he had collected from the Eight and
Nine-Tails
 laments that he wanted to revive the
Ten-Tails
 in perfect condition but even at a fragments of its power, it was still the same. Back at
Kabuto
's location, Jūgo realises that
Anko Mitarashi
 is still alive and alerts Sasuke to the fact that Madara was still in the living world, shocking Sasuke. As Sasuke questions them why they were still following him, Suigetsu tells him that they had found something interesting and hands Sasuke the
scroll
 which they found at one of
Orochimaru
's hideouts. Rendered speechless for a moment by the content, Sasuke says that he is willing to meet with Orochimaru which shocked Suigetsu and Jūgo but Sasuke noted that Orochimaru was not one to die so easily even if he was killed. Standing up, Sasuke states that he was going to meet "
the ones who know everything
".

Chapter 593

"
Orochimaru's Revival
" (
復活の大蛇丸
,
Fukkatsu no Orochimaru
)

Despite
Suigetsu
's vehement and somewhat manic opposition to reviving
Orochimaru
 plying
Sasuke
 with several different reasons not to proceed, Sasuke is resigned to his decision. Moving to execute Sasuke's orders,
Jūgo
 retrieves some of
Kabuto
's DNA using his
Sage Transformation
 abilities, much to Suigetsu's disgust. After Jūgo places the DNA on
Anko
's
Cursed Seal of Heaven
, Sasuke uses the
Evil Releasing Method
 to revive Orochimaru using the remnants of his life force left within Anko. Retreating behind Kabuto as Orochimaru emerges, Suigetsu sheepishly greets his former captor, who notes that he was abreast of the situation having been able to observe everything from within Anko, further shocking them when he tells them he has no interest in the war that was currently going on. And instead, still had his sights set on Sasuke's body, but was unable to
steal
 it in his current state. Showing him the
scroll
 he was given, Sasuke tells Orochimaru that he wanted to hear everything from its source, leading Orochimaru to question him about whether or not he had wavered from his path of revenge, to which Sasuke denies. Moving over to the immobile Kabuto — which prompts Suigetsu to run to the other side of the cave — Orochimaru drains Kabuto of his chakra, causing Kabuto to revert to his pre-implantation of Orochimaru's DNA appearance. Noting to himself that Sasuke had changed since he last saw him, Orochimaru beckons him to follow him and tells him that they were going somewhere he himself knew well.

Chapter 594

"
The Progenitor
" (
祖たるもの
,
Sotarumono
)

While analysing the situation before them, the shinobi are told by
Tobi
 to witness as the
Ten-Tails
 was revived and with it, the beginning of the world's demise. Confused that Tobi would be able to do this,
Kakashi
 notes that the war was all for the sake of preventing
Akatsuki
 from attaining
Gyūki
 and
Kurama
 and since his side still had the tailed beasts, wonders whether Tobi was lying. But recalling the fact that they had used a
clone
 made from its
chakra
 during the fight with
Taka
, Gyūki reminds
B
 and the others that Akatsuki may actually have its chakra. Kurama then notes that its chakra was also present in the
Benihisago
 and
Kohaku no Jōhei
 which the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 had consumed and requests
Naruto
 to switch with it so it could explain to the others. As the fox explains the story behind the two
Treasured Tools of the Sage of Six Paths
, the
Gold and Silver Brothers
 and how they had come to attain its chakra, Kakashi corroborates Kurama's story with the intel received from headquarters. With this, Kakashi notes that he would like them to do something before the beast was revived, leading Tobi to retort that because Kakashi had always spoken so easily, it had led him to live a life full of regret.
Guy
 questions Tobi once again on who he was, but Tobi simply responds that it would make no sense to tell him because Guy didn't remember faces. Interjecting, Kurama tells them that as Kakashi said, now was the only time to do something about the situation as the
Sage of Six Paths
 had told them that the revival of the Ten-Tails signalled the end of the world. Answering Naruto's questioning of the Ten-Tails' power, Kurama tells him of the beast's might and the fact that amongst all the names it was known by it was also seen as the progenitor of all that existed in the world. The fox then goes on to state that though even it alone would stand no chance against the Ten-Tails, it may be possible since Tobi did not possess all of Gyūki and its own chakra. Tobi however rebuffs this stating that he only needed the beast to cast the
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 on the world. Switching back with Kurama, Naruto declares his dreams to Tobi, with Guy, Kakashi, and even B — who reveals his fetish for middle-aged women's breasts to those present (much to Gyūki's shock) — rally behind him. As Tobi launches into another speech, Naruto enters his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 and attempts to land a high-speed
Rasengan
 attack on the statue, but Tobi blocks it with his
gunbai
 prompting Naruto to state that it seems as though he really would have to bash Tobi's mask in first. Tobi responds, noting that there was one thing he could not part with, and then declares that he would not let them touch the statue.

Chapter 595

"
Crack
" (
皹
,
Hibi
)

Formulating their strategy as
Naruto
 produces a
shadow clone
, the shinobi agree that the use of feint attacks would be crucial in this battle because of
Tobi
's abilities. Moving directly towards Tobi, Naruto uses the
Super Mini-Tailed Beast Ball
 while
Kakashi
 asks
B
 to hoist him into the air as he activates his
Mangekyō Sharingan
. Deciding that it was best to avoid direct contact,
Guy
 takes out his pair of
Nunchaku
. Tobi, wielding his
gunbai
 is able to stave off Naruto's attacks but ultimately has a harder time at things once Guy joins the fray. Using his nunchaku to counter Tobi's gunbai, Guy is able to send the masked man throttling towards Naruto and his Super Mini-Tailed Beast Ball. Using that opportunity, Kakashi activates
Kamui
 with the intention of ripping the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
's neck off. However, the statue — which by this time was bleeding from the eyes and metamorphosing — is seemingly able to nullify the attack which confused Kakashi greatly, who immediately thinks of a possible reason for this, but it was not revealed what his thoughts were. As Naruto's attack is about to make contact, Tobi teleports, prompting Naruto to
sense his intent
 and evade Tobi emerging from the ground directly below him in a surprise attack. Dodging the initial attack, Naruto, now separated from the others, has a harder time blocking Tobi's gunbai. Kakashi
imbues
 a
kunai
 with the
Lightning Release
 and once again calls out to B. Launching him across the battlefield, Kakashi easily cuts through a rock that separated him from Naruto and then launches the kunai at Tobi. Forced to become intangible, but not one to give up so easily, Tobi changed the trajectory of the kunai and sends it hurtling towards Naruto. Telling him to ignore the kunai, Kakashi uses Kamui once again to warp the kunai away. Regrouping as the last attack seemingly fails to land, the
shinobi
 wonder how they were going to defeat Tobi. Just then, a tiny crack appears on Tobi's mask.

Chapter 596

"
One Technique
" (
一つの術
,
Hitotsu no Jutsu
)

Noticing a slight crack on
Tobi
's mask,
Guy
 and
Naruto
 thought that Naruto's last attack had actually hit the mask; however
Kakashi
 disagrees, noting that the type of crack was not consistent with a punch, but a sharper object. Kakashi then remembers the
lightning
-imbued
kunai
 he had thrown earlier at Tobi and had warped away with Kamui.
B
 takes the opportunity to strike the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 as it continues to transform into the
Ten-Tails
, but the attack is deflected when Tobi erected a
barrier
, rendering the team powerless to strike the statue until they defeated him. After he had finished formulating his strategy, Kakashi then tells the group to aid him in testing his hypothesis. They then leapt unto B's hand, who launched them directly at Tobi, commencing the plan. Guy starts off using his
Sōshūga
 only for Tobi to avoid it using his dematerialisation ability, predicting Guy's moves with his
Sharingan
. Jeering Tobi, Guy gets the masked man to absorb his nunchaku rendering him tangible. This allows Naruto to follow up quickly by launching a
Rasengan
, which Tobi phases through, insisting on the futileness of the strategy. However, the Rasengan seemingly dispersed before passing through Tobi, continued by a sudden explosion that inflicted his right arm and hurled him away, having him to get on his feet again thanks to his weapon. Tobi then realised that the attack was transported to the
other dimension
 using
Kamui
, just as he was about to materialise. Realising Tobi's ability now, Kakashi notes that Tobi was not using two separate techniques to dematerialise and warp things away, but a single technique.

Chapter 597

"
The Secret of the Space–Time Ninjutsu
" (
時空間忍術の秘密
,
Jikūkan Ninjutsu no Himitsu
)

Urging
Kakashi
 to explain it in the simplest way possible so that they could readjust their strategy,
Guy
 and the others listen on as Kakashi explains that
Tobi
's ability to become intangible and absorb things were one and the same. He then explains that when he makes himself intangible, what Tobi actually does is to warp away the part of his body that was being attacked to the
other dimension
; so while it existed there, all attacks would simply phase through his body. However, since
Kamui
 shares the same dimension, the
lightning
-enhanced
kunai
 that Kakashi warped away, passed through the "intangible" part of Tobi's body and ended up in the other dimension and scratched the part of his body that was sent there in order to make him appear intangible. When questioned by
B
 how it was possible that their two techniques were linked to the same dimension, a hesitant Guy began to question Kakashi, but the latter cuts across him to ask Tobi directly where he got the
Sharingan
 from. Responding, he told them that he got it during the
previous war
 at the
Kannabi Bridge
 at a time when Kakashi was being recognised as the "Hero of the Sharingan" (
写輪眼の英雄
,
Sharingan no Eiyū
,
literally meaning:
 Hero of the Copy Wheel Eye). With the Copy Ninja at a loss for words, Tobi takes the opportunity to chastise him and perpetrate his
Eye of the Moon Plan
 as the right move for humanity, but his views are still rejected by Naruto who tells him that he would not give up his dreams. Taking the opportunity to chastise his beliefs as well, Tobi questions Naruto on how he would feel when he failed
Jiraiya
 and
Minato
. Telling its
jinchūriki
 to switch with it, however,
Kurama
 speaks directly to Tobi telling him that it was entrusted to Naruto, who had befriended him, for the exact reason of defeating Tobi. Spurring the young man onwards, Naruto enters his
Tailed Beast Mode
 and charges towards the masked man.

Author's Note

“

Sasuke and Itachi's tale concludes in this volume. I actually wanted to put it all in volume 61 so that you could read it all at once, but it just wasn't possible. (D'oh!) Please read volume 61 before 62! Please!
