Tera
 (
テラ
) is a former member of
Konohagakure
's
Anbu
 faction
Root
.

Background

As a member of Root, Tera was likely trained to lose emotions in order to better accomplish missions. As the Root members each use a codename, it is unknown what Tera's real name is, if he even has one. Even though the organisation has been officially disbanded, Tera remains loyal to its head,
Danzō Shimura
.

Personality

Tera is extremely loyal to Danzō and follows any and all orders given to him. Even if it means he would have to kill other Konohagakure shinobi.

Part II

Five Kage Summit

Tera and
Dajimu
 had both been secretly assigned by Danzō to assassinate
Anko Mitarashi
, but due to the village's situation at that time, their mission was postponed in preference of finding
Kabuto Yakushi
 before she did.
