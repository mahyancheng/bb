Kuroari
 (
黒蟻
,
literally meaning:
 Black Ant) is a
puppet
, originally created by
Sasori
, but passed onto
Kankurō
. It has a much longer head than
Karasu
 with a bucket-shaped face sporting two sharp red horns and six arms; its facial features include three eyes similar to Karasu, with a dark, disheveled hairstyle. Its overall body-frame somewhat resembles a large barrel.

Like Karasu, Kuroari is able to detach any of its body parts for separate attacks. Kuroari's primary function is to capture opponents and thus it does not contain as many hidden weapons as Karasu, as each of its arm segments only contains a saw blade. However, when used in tandem with Karasu, it can have devastating results.

Kuroari's head could also be seen in one of
Chiyo
's flashbacks. It was an unfinished puppet, with the Ant's head, without the three eyes. Kuroari was destroyed by Sasori when Kankurō fought against him after
Gaara
's capture early in Part II, and has since been repaired. During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Kankurō was shown to have gained a second Kuroari puppet, as seen when he trapped both
Sasori
 and
Deidara
.
