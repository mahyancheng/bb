The
Gang of Four
 (
四人衆
,
Yonin-shū
) were a group of four
shinobi
, who served under
Yomi
 and appeared in
Naruto Shippūden the Movie
.
Setsuna
 acted as leader under Yomi.

History

The Gang of Four followed Yomi in attacking the location in which
Mōryō
 was sealed, easily killing the guards with their enhanced technique via Yomi's
Strengthening Prescription: Chakra Injection
.

After taking control of a good portion of the territories they pass by via Mōryō's
Ghost Army
, Yomi assigned the group to assassinate
Shion
, a priestess who has the ability to reseal the demon. Kusuna, the
medical-nin
, was the only one capable of utilising the chakra snakes of Yomi's technique, and was designated as the group leader, responsible for giving the other three their special
chakra
.

Upon attacking Shion's compound in the
Land of Demons
, the three fighters proved themselves to be abusive of the enhanced chakra, using overly powerful techniques to deal with even the most minor matters, and
Gitai
 even drank the chakra directly, which killed him when the unstable power led to a self-detonation. Their tendency to abuse their chakra became their downfall, as it resulting in rapid drainage and requiring replenishment; upon using too much chakra in an attempt to flush out Shion, the opponents took advantage of this moment of weakness and took down the remaining three members of the Gang while refusing to let them restock.

Trivia

Each member of the team had a certain trigram on their uniform;
Setsuna
's meant "lightning" (
雷
,
kaminari
),
Shizuku
's meant "water" (
水
,
mizu
),
Kusuna
's meant "wind" (
風
,
kaze
) and
Gitai
's meant "fire" (
火
,
hi
).

Despite Setsuna being the designated leader of the group, Kusuna appeared to show more authority during the course of the attack on
Shion
, as he ordered the other three to use a combination attack against
Naruto Uzumaki
's
army of Shadow Clones
, while being the one to submit a report of killing
whom
 he thought was Shion.
