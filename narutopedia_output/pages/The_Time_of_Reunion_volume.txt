Yamato
, no longer playing nice, tries to capture Sasuke. Sasuke escapes and prepares to finish them off, but is stopped by
Orochimaru
. Orochimaru says that
Team 7
 should be spared since they might kill another member of

Itachi
. Sasuke agrees, and they leave with
Kabuto
.

Author's Note

“

Recently, the people around me tell me they have been reading books. I rarely read books, so I'm thinking about picking one up for the first time in a while. I'm considering either a mystery or a fantasy work.
