Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

In spite of
Shukaku
 stopping
Madara
's
Susanoo Sword
, the
Uchiha
 sends another one hurtling towards
Gaara
, knocking him down, which leads the One-Tail to tell its former
host
 not to overdo it, but the
Kazekage
 continues to fight unyieldingly, declaring he is now the tanuki's equal. The
tailed beasts
 are then dragged into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, forcing
Naruto
 out of his
Tailed Beast Mode
. Losing his consciousness, Naruto begins to fall to the ground after having
Kurama
 extracted, but Gaara uses his
sand
 to cushion Naruto's fall.
 The tailed beasts are successfully resealed inside the statue as Madara slams his
minion
's talkativeness.
Tobirama
 sneaks up behind Madara, and
engages
 in battle with him, buying Gaara enough time to escape with Naruto. Meanwhile,
Sasuke
 rejoins the battle, but not before
Hashirama

transfers
 to him his own
chakra
, and gives him a "technique" to counter Madara's
senjutsu
. As he arrives to Madara's location, Sasuke finds himself suspended in midair before he could land a blow, and is then stabbed mercilessly by Madara. Elsewhere,
Tobi
, using his
Kanzeon Lotus King
, proceeds to assault the
Shinobi Alliance
, only to be fended off by
Hiruzen
. Meanwhile,
Orochimaru
 and his group take cover to plan a surprise attack while
Karin
 bursts into tears after sensing Sasuke's predicament. As Naruto is escorted safely by Gaara,
Hinata
, learning of Naruto's failing heartbeat through her
Byakugan
, rushes to his location, but stumbles and falls due to her low chakra, while
Sakura
, who remains the only
medical-nin
 with enough chakra, begins to heal him. As grief overtakes both Sakura and Karin, the two kunoichi realise that if things continue like this, both Naruto and Sasuke will die.
