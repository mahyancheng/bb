The
ninja
 from the
Land of the Sky
 use this type of projectile weapon. When using this weapon, a barrage of
kunai
 will be fired at high speeds in a similar fashion to
machine guns
. The launcher can be used in conjunction with their
Winged Mechanical Devices
 to perform aerial raids with devastating effects. This is achieved seemingly without diminishing precision.

The launcher seems to be preferred by the shinobi of the Land of Sky over the more common kunai and
shuriken
 despite their versatility, likely due to the rapidness of the barrages and precision making it easier for them to use during flight.

In the anime, Tenten equipped a multitude of
puppets
 with kunai-launchers.

Trivia

This weapon seemingly follows the regular design for
Naruto
 projectile weapons; though still having heavy similarities with a machine gun, it launches kunai instead of bullets.
