Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

The team realises soon enough that the clones are not physical; they are in fact another
genjutsu
. In order to draw out the assailants,
Naruto
 disguises several of his
shadow clones
 as his teammates and fights the enemy clones all night. When
Team Oboro
 believe that the entire team is exhausted from combat,
Kabuto
,
Sakura
, and
Sasuke
 corner them. Sasuke orders Naruto to take a break, as he had used a lot of
chakra
 and should be unable to move; however, Naruto rushes forward and punches all three of the
Ame

genin
, surprising Sasuke, Kabuto and Sakura, with Kabuto realising that Naruto's chakra levels must be exceedingly high to still be able to fight after pulling off a
Multiple Shadow Clone Technique
 along with a
Transformation Technique
. After a brief struggle, Naruto knocks out the enemies and takes their
scroll
, at which point they head to the tower and meet with Kabuto's
team
. Unknown to Naruto and his friends, Kabuto is revealed to be a spy for
Otogakure
, and submits all of the data he gathered on them to his master,
Orochimaru
.
