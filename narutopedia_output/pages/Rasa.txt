Rasa
 (
羅砂
) was the
Fourth
Kazekage
 (
四代目風影
,
Yondaime Kazekage
,
literally meaning:
 Fourth Wind Shadow) of
Sunagakure
. Renowned for his ability to use
Gold Dust
, Rasa's reign as Kazekage was marked by his frequent quelling of rampages by the
One-Tailed Shukaku
, which he had sealed into his youngest son,
Gaara
.

Background






Rasa overseeing the meeting between Iwagakure and Konohagakure.



In the anime, it was noted that Rasa also sent
Pakura
 to her death as part of an unfair peace treaty between them and
Kirigakure
 where her life was to be forfeited. She was sent to Kirigakure under the pretence of being an envoy, where she was killed. The blame for this was cast on
Iwagakure
 whom his village had a feud with at the time as a means to stir their shinobi to war.
 Also, during the
Third Shinobi World War
, as Konohagakure wished to form a peace treaty with the Iwa, they deliberately had the meeting on the Suna borderline, prompting Rasa and his forces to oversee the events should a battle occur. He stated he would deal with any incidents that were to happen, and with that, the Iwa group retreats.
 Also, in the anime, it was said that Rasa established a rule for the Sunagakure Academy that forbade children who didn't possess skill in ninjutsu or genjutsu to attend.






Rasa during Gaara's birth.



Because the
Land of Wind
's
daimyō
 began to cut down on
Sunagakure
's budget and instead used
Konohagakure
's less expensive services, Rasa therefore saw his own village in danger of extinction. In order to prevent that, he decided to focus on increasing the quality of the ninja in the village. As such, he ordered
Chiyo
 to seal
Shukaku
 within his youngest son, Gaara, so that he could become Suna's ultimate weapon. As a result, his wife,
Karura
 died from childbirth while Gaara was born prematurely, despite Rasa's desperation to save her life. He then taught Gaara
ninjutsu
, but assigned
Yashamaru
 to be Gaara's caretaker, ostracising him from his elder siblings
Temari
 and
Kankurō
.






Rasa witnesses Shukaku going wild.



However, as Gaara grew and his abilities began to manifest, Rasa realised that this had been a poor choice, and started to view Gaara as a failed experiment that threatened the inhabitants of Suna, due to Gaara's unstable nature of attacking citizens unintentionally. Being pressured by the village's dying resources and with the council declaring that Gaara was useless to them, Rasa formulated a plan with Yashamaru to test out Gaara's control over Shukaku. Upon this Yashamaru died and Gaara lost control, allowing Shukaku to go wild. Rasa used his
Gold Dust
 to stop the beast. After this incident Rasa saw Gaara was indeed a failure and began issuing orders for Gaara's assassination, but all six attempts ended unsuccessfully. However, later when Gaara began to have more control over his powers due to his new ideals of being alone, Rasa saw this as an opportunity to give his son one more chance, and to appreciate Gaara's usefulness, therefore stopped issuing attempts on his son's life, in hopes of him becoming a powerful tool.

Rasa once mentored
Shigezane
 in Water Release techniques, in order for him to gather gold dust for the Kazekage.

Personality

Befitting his status and responsibility as leader, Rasa cared deeply about the well-being of his village, so much so that he was thinking about allying with
Orochimaru
 to destroy Konoha to bring Suna's resources back up, despite knowing Orochimaru is a highly dangerous criminal. This turned out to be a fatal mistake on Rasa's behalf, as he and his bodyguards were betrayed and assassinated by Orochimaru. Upon returning from the dead, he hoped that the
Third Raikage
 was right about the next generation being strong enough to stop them from their mindless actions. The anime extends on his ruthless nature as a leader, where he sent Pakura to her death for the betterment of the village.

He loved his wife and children dearly, but he was also torn between his duties as the village leader and those as a father. This conflict was seen when Gaara was deemed a failure by the council, he was visibly disappointed and ultimately decided to give his son one last chance before deciding whether or not to eliminate him. To this end, he was willing to set an elaborate and potentially heartbreaking lie to see his son's determination. Seeing the failure, he chose the village's safety over his son.

Given his eventual willingness to sacrifice and later ally with Orochimaru for the sake of Sunagakure and the greater good are evidence to suggest that Rasa had a strong
utilitarian
 mindset. He also had a habit of putting "value" on things which might be an allusion to the fact that he used gold dust. His view on value is exemplified in a form of bigotry in the anime, as he established a rule that anyone who cannot perform ninjutsu be barred from entering the Academy.

After being reincarnated and seeing his son has become Kazekage and even formed strong bonds with his friends, he comes to regret the horrible life he put Gaara through with the choices and mistakes he made concerning him, solemnly thinking he wasn't worthy to be called his father. Upon being defeated, he acknowledges Gaara had long surpassed him, and tearfully entrusts the safety and future of his village to his son and was happy he was given a chance to apologise to him.

Appearance






Rasa'a full appearance.



Rasa had auburn hair, dark eyes and was usually depicted with a very stern look on his face. He wore a simple black jacket and pants with mesh armour underneath. He carried a small canister strapped to his hip. As he got older, he gained two creases around his mouth. When using his Gold Dust, dark markings appeared around his eyes that bore strong resemblance to Gaara's own dark markings. During his time as the Kazekage, he wore the standard attire of the Kazekage which consisted of a loose fitting green kimono with a white collar and the signature hat with the kanji for
wind
 (
風
) on it.

Abilities






Rasa manipulating Gold Dust.



Rasa was a very powerful shinobi, as evidenced by his title of Kazekage. He could even subdue a fully released
tailed beast
 like Shukaku. The prospect of his retaliation was enough to keep a great group of Iwa-nin from sparking a conflict at the Land of Wind's border.
 He was shown to be quite observant, pinpointing Gaara's
Third Eye
 that was spying on him and the other reincarnated Kage after
Mū
 sensed his chakra. He employed a stationary-type
fighting style
 where he manipulated his Gold Dust to attack his opponents. The fact that Rasa was actively developing new techniques for the benefit of Suna indicates that his intelligence was rather high.

Ninjutsu

Nature Transformation






Rasa summoning Gold Dust.



With profound research and knowledge of ninjutsu, along with exceptional talent, Rasa learned the
Third Kazekage
’s
kekkei genkai

Magnet Release
, a simultaneous usage of
earth
 and
wind
 elements. When in use, it caused dark rings to appear around Rasa's eyes, similar to the permanent ones around those of his youngest son, Gaara. He utilised this ability to manipulate quantities of Gold Dust, being capable of
summoning vast amounts
 of these particles, seemingly from the immediate vicinity around him, over relatively short spans of time.
 When used offensively, Rasa tended to form dense, fast-moving surges that could range in size from narrow streams to colossal waves, intended to injure a target by violently crashing the compacted material into them. However, when used defensively, he created
thick barricades
 of the dust, durable enough to block large
spheres
 of sand.
 Due to the fact that gold is heavier than sand, he was able to use this additional weight to subdue even Shukaku whenever it went on a rampage.

Rasa was able to form an
eye
 out of his Gold Dust, which allowed him to remotely monitor any situation from a safe distance. He was proficient with the
Water Release

nature transformation
, noted to have developed a
high-pressure water blade
 powerful enough to break through an
absolute defence
.
 He was also noted to use
Yin Release
.

Part I

Chūnin Exams

Chūnin Exams






Rasa is killed by Orochimaru.



When
Orochimaru
 approached Sunagakure with the proposition of joining forces in invading
Konohagakure
, Rasa agreed due to the economical decline brought about by the
Land of Wind's daimyō
 using the shinobi of Konoha. Hoping that the success of the invasion would prompt additional funding, Rasa planned to have Gaara unleash Shukaku from the centre of Konoha during the
Chūnin Exams
 to put the Konoha shinobi at a disadvantage from the start. Before the finals for the Chūnin Exam began, Rasa was murdered by Orochimaru by impaling him in the chest with his
sword
. Having also killed his guards, Orochimaru used his
Vanishing Facial Copy Technique
 to pose as the Kazekage, making it easier for him to manipulate Sunagakure.

Only after the failed attack on Konoha did Suna discover Rasa's rotting, faceless corpse on the outskirts of the village, making them realise that they were betrayed by Orochimaru.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Main article:
Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Rasa summoned alongside the other reincarnated Kage.



In preparation for the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Rasa was
reincarnated
 by
Kabuto Yakushi
 alongside other deceased
Kage
, in order to fight against the
Allied Shinobi Forces
. When
Mū
, despite his
camouflage
, is later detected approaching the
Fourth Division
, Kabuto has him summon three other Kage in order to provide support. Amongst this number is Rasa who, during the conversation between the others, discloses that he was only aware of their exploits due to his elders. He then declared that whilst the
Second Hokage
 had died many years before his own lifetime, the wretched ability used to reincarnate them had come into the possession of another, a shinobi named Orochimaru. While the others are preoccupied by their mutual desires to confront each other, only Rasa notices
his son
's Third Eye observing them from afar.






Rasa uses his Gold Dust to suppress Gaara's sand.



Pursuing the retreating division throughout the night, each of the Kage lament the possibility of opposing shinobi from their own respective village, with Rasa remaining sceptical of the
Third Raikage
's belief that the current generation had surpassed their own. Confronted by an
enormous wall of sand
, he integrates his heavier
Gold Dust
 into the approaching wave in order to slow it down, under the presumption that Gaara had already
unleashed
 Shukaku. Divulging that it was this very method which allowed him to stop the beast in the past, just as his son manages to restrain them with arms of sand, he then dwells on their strength having increased. When Gaara finally comes into view, he is shocked to see his son before him rather than Shukaku, causing him to question about the beast's location, receiving in reply that Gaara was no longer the jinchūriki his father had created.






Rasa clashing with Gaara.



Unable to comprehend the circumstances surrounding his son's revival after the extraction of the One-Tail, especially in regards to how he obtained friends, Rasa's surprise only escalates when informed that Gaara does not hate him, due to his role as Kazekage now providing perspective into the motives behind his father's previous actions. Recollecting the past, including both his son's birth and eventual descent into failure as a jinchūriki, Rasa supposes that there is some value in his reincarnation as it allows him to determine the worth of his child. Questioning whether Gaara was truly capable of surpassing him, the battle between father and son recommences with the collision of gold and sand, resulting in a mixture of the two. However, by attempting to protect two of the other Kage from an
aerial barrage
, Gaara's sand is able to restrain all three in an inescapable embrace that adopts the form of his
late wife
.






Rasa restrained by Gaara.



Admitting the growth of his son as his counters continue to fail in the face of Gaara's
Shield of Sand
, Rasa comes to the realisation that all a parent needs do is trust in their children, contradicting his prior concepts of value. Declaring that Gaara's strength comes not from Shukaku but instead from his mother, he tells his son that Karura truly loved him and explains that it was he who had ordered
Yashamaru
 to lie about his mother simply as a test. Apologising to his son for all that he had stolen from him during his childhood, he acknowledges that for all his failures as a parent and having no right to call himself a father, he was still glad that Karura's strength had helped Gaara throughout his life. After hearing Gaara forgive him, before Rasa is sealed, he tearfully recognises that his son had surpassed him and gladly entrusts the village's future to him.

Later, with the release of the Impure World Reincarnation technique, a light of sorts encased Rasa's sealed body as the technique was dispelled and his soul was returned to the afterlife.

Trivia

The name "Rasa" (
羅砂
) literally means either "demon sand" or "silky sand".

His hair colour was a dull purple colour in his first appearance, but it is auburn in other appearances.

According to the databook(s):

His favourite food was any dish with meat.

In the
fourth databook
,
Hiden
 is listed among Rasa's special characteristics, though none of his techniques are known to be classified as such.

While they have no names in the anime and manga, Rasa's Gold Dust techniques share the same name as his son's techniques in the video games.

As revealed in the
Gaara Hiden
, Rasa's direct bloodline is highly valued in Suna. When his daughter married Konoha shinobi
Shikamaru Nara
, the
Suna Council
 demanded his sons take brides and start families as they feared losing Rasa's direct bloodline to Konoha.

Quotes

(To
Gaara
) "
You've truly grown Gaara… The only thing a parent needs to do, is trust in their children. That's all… And that in itself has true value.
"

(To Gaara) "
It appears that I didn't have an eye for value after all. The sand will always protect you… It's not Shukaku's strength that you wield, but your mother Karura's. Your mother truly loved you.
"

(To Gaara about
Karura
) "
Your mother was truly strong… Even in death, she continues to believe in you and protect you… That's what helped you bring you to where you are today.
"

(To Gaara about his shortcomings) "
Now that you've become Kazekage… And you've made real friends… and you have real connections with people. Those are all the things I stole. …But I, your father, never did a thing for you. …No… I couldn't even call myself your father…
"

(To Gaara before he is sealed) "
More than I ever could have hoped. You've surpassed me… I entrust the village to you now… Gaara…
"
