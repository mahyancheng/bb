Yugakure
 (
湯隠れの里
,
Yugakure no Sato
,
literally meaning:
 Village Hidden in Hot Water) is the
hidden village
 of the
Land of Hot Water
. Like the country in which it resides, Yugakure has strong inclinations towards pacifism.
 After years of reluctantly offering combat-related services, Yugakure officially transitioned away from the typical
shinobi

missions
; it prides itself as the "village that has forgotten wars" (
戦を忘れた里
,
Ikusa o Wasureta Sato
). The village's ninja now work almost exclusively within the Land of Hot Water's borders, keeping the roads safe for tourists and performing odd-jobs for the many small settlements around the country.

Yugakure's transformation from a military force was not supported by all,
Hidan
 being a notable objector. A follower of
Jashin
, Hidan believed violence was good, even necessary; when he couldn't convince the village to change its ways, he became a
missing-nin
, slaughtering many of his fellow Yu-nin before he left. In
Konoha Shinden
, critics of Yugakure's pacifism decry it as "Nurumayugakure" (
ぬるま湯隠れ
,
literally meaning:
 Village Hidden in Warm Water). In
Sasuke Shinden
, Yugakure's ninja acknowledge a flaw in its pursuit of peace, as the village has historically tended to ignore difficult subjects in order to avoid getting involved,
Jashinists
 and the
Chinoike clan
 being more glaring examples.

Yugakure is surrounded by several different hotsprings, and so thick steam rises up around the village. Many resort hotels are built throughout the area for the hotsprings' visitors to stay in.

Trivia

In
Naruto
 episode 37
, a masked ninja with a symbol similar to Yugakure's is briefly shown during the

.

Yu-nin are recurring enemies in
Rock Lee's Springtime of Youth Full Power Ninja Chronicles
.
