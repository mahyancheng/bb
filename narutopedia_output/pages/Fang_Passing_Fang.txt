An
Inuzuka
 and their
ninken
 companion both perform the
Passing Fang
, whereby they rotate their bodies and deliver a series of rapid body blows to a target. In order to coordinate their attacks, thus ensuring targets have no opportunity to defend themselves, Inuzuka and their ninken synchronise with each other as much as they can: breathing in unison; using the
Four Legs Technique
; using the
Beast Human Clone
. As the users cross back and forth for this attack, the surrounding area is damaged as well, crushing rocks and shaving sections off the ground.
