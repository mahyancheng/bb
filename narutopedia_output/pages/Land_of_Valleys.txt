The Land of Valleys.



The
Land of Valleys
 (
谷間の国
,
Tanima no Kuni
) is a country that is a considerable distance from the
Land of Fire
. The country is home to a medical care manufacturing company founded by
Victor
 after the
Fourth Shinobi World War
. Its foundation there led to various technicians from other regions to flock in that area in pursuit of better opportunities, leading to the country's progressive infrastructure and emerging development.

Later, it was discovered that the company's philanthropist goals were a façade, as it was actually running unethical and inhumane experiments in an attempt to create an artificial
God Tree
 by using human lives as nourishment. The company also made a hefty investment into
Kara
, something
Deepa
 implied to be a reason for Victor being elevated to the rank of Inner. With Konoha-nin tricking Victor into showing the
Valleys Daimyō
 the truth behind the scenes, and the artificial God Tree failing to produce the Chakra Fruit, the building was destroyed during the efforts to subdue the tree.
Mia
, who lost her husband
Anato
 due to Victor's machinations, testified against the corporation, thus bringing an end to its trust and patronage from the Land of Valleys.
