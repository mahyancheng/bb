Iwakyō
 (
岩狂
) is a
shinobi
 from
Iwagakure
 and the eldest brother of the village's
Three Brothers
 group.

Personality

Iwakyō is seemingly cruel and relentless, like his brothers.

Appearance

He is a large man, with a bald head and dark eyes. He wears the standard Iwa-nin
flak jacket
, with his
forehead protector
 around his neck, and the standard pants with a lapel. Like Iwazo, he wears bandages around his arms and black, spiked wristbands.

Abilities

He seemingly possessed a great deal of brute strength, as he was able to rupture a large portion of ground with a single strike. He also proved to be an observant adversary, being able to spot a
Body Replacement Technique
 in the darkness of night. Iwakyō was also a fast individual, and it often appeared that he was skating on the ground rather than simply running on it.

Part II

Paradise Life on a Boat






Three Brothers defeated by Ino–Shika–Chō.



Iwakyō and his brothers pursued Kosuke through the night in order to retrieve intel that he had stolen from them. The brothers eventually cornered him deciding to interrogate him for information on
Konohagakure
 instead of killing him outright. His plans are however thwarted by the appearance of
Team Asuma
 and their
team-work
. When
Chōji Akimichi
 used the
Human Bullet Tank
 to stop them he was caught by Ino's
Mind Body Switch Technique
 and was forced to fight
Iwaji
 and
Iwazō
. He was then knocked out by Chōji.
