The
Reverse Four Symbols Sealing
 is a powerful fūinjutsu activated upon the user's death. The user must, beforehand, place the seal across their chest. Upon activation, it releases four symbols from the user's own blood that then forms a large, black sphere around them. Anything caught inside the sphere's area is then drawn in and sealed within the user's corpse.
