When they confront Hakkaku and his cooking-nin, the three take advantage of their ninja techniques to make the perfect bowl of ramen. After Hakkaku and the cooking-nin ate the best ramen, Teuchi explains that the recipe was just to remove the bitter taste from the soup. When they rescue Ayame, they became shocked as they noticed she has grown fat due to being unable to resist the cooking-nin's food, much to Teuchi's dismay. After saving his daughter with the help of Naruto, Sakura, and Chōji, he develops a diet for Ayame to bring her to her regular self and the diet ramen appears to be part of the menu for the customers to lose weight from eating it.

Sakura informs Teuchi and Naruto about Tsunade's recovery.



Soon after
Tsunade
 regained consciousness,
Sakura
 burst into Ichiraku to inform Naruto and Teuchi about what happened. Upon hearing the good news, Teuchi offered a bowl of ramen to both Naruto and Sakura, on the house, which Naruto accepted, but Sakura declined. Just as Naruto was about to eat he was
reverse-summoned
 to
Mount Myōboku
, much to Teuchi's confusion. When Naruto reappeared in Ramen Ichiraku, Teuchi asked where his best customer disappeared to. When Naruto was asked by the other ninja customers for his autograph, Teuchi thought proudly at how Naruto was being called the "Miracle boy" and at the irony at how not so long ago he was thought of as the opposite. Teuchi then asked the other customers to allow Naruto to finish his meal before he signed anything.

Konoha Hiden: The Perfect Day for a Wedding

Teuchi reflects on how good business has been at Ichiraku Ramen recently and how the naruto topping has seen a reversal in popularity: it used to be the least popular, easily eclipsed by seaweed; now seaweed, though still popular, is second to naruto. In fact, Teuchi cannot prepare enough naruto to meet the demand. The reason for this is because of Naruto Uzumaki's importance to Konoha, with standard customers craving naruto whenever there is news of Naruto, and with shinobi hoping that eating at Ichiraku Ramen will bring them the same success on their next mission as Naruto has always had on his.






Teuchi and Ayame attending Naruto's wedding.



Teuchi has been serving Naruto ramen since he was a young boy, back when most of the village hated and despised Naruto. Teuchi didn't care what the rest of the village thought of Naruto; Naruto loved ramen and Teuchi loved preparing it for him. Since ramen has been the extent of their relationship all these years, Teuchi was surprised to be invited to Naruto's wedding. He decides that giving Naruto free ramen for a year would be the most appropriate wedding gift. Teuchi then realises how much ramen Naruto can eat, and starts decreasing the duration of the offer, but every span of time he considers leaves him with visions of Ichiraku Ramen going bankrupt and his daughter being put out on the street. He also has visions of Naruto's smiling face whenever he finishes a bowl of his ramen. Teuchi settles on giving Naruto free and unlimited ramen for the rest of his life.

Teuchi is later seen at Naruto and Hinata's wedding, using his daughter to attract business for Ichiraku Ramen.

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Teuchi

Teuchi's name can mean "making noodles by hand" (
手打ち
). However, the same word can also mean "killing someone with one's bare hands".

Teuchi first made his appearance in the official series in a
short omake
, published in the
first databook
. However, he had appeared before in the
pilot
 of Naruto, making him one of the earliest appearing characters from the series, together with Naruto himself and an early version of
Hiruzen Sarutobi
. His first appearance in the actual manga was in chapter 144.

According to the databook(s):

Teuchi's favourite word is "artisan", "craft" (
匠
,
takumi
).

In the
third databook
,
Masashi Kishimoto
 joked that when Teuchi got mad at the two new cooks, it wasn't a
Lightning Release
 technique he used.

The
thirty-fourth ending
 of
Naruto Shippūden
 depicted a young Naruto watching the shop when Teuchi invited him to come in. Naruto ran away at first due to being used to everyone hating him, but warmed up to their hospitality.
