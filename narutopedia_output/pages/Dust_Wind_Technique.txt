Temari uses her
Giant Folding Fan
 to generate a gust of wind that layers the surrounding area in a blast of
sand
. This layer of sand that accumulates on the nearby trees makes it difficult for others to get a good footing. The initial gust can also temporarily blind opponents by lodging sand in their eyes.
