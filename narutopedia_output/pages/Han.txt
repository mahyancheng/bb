Han
 (
ハン
) was a
shinobi
 from
Iwagakure
 and the
jinchūriki
 of the Five-Tails,
Kokuō
.

Background






Han and Rōshi facing Team 6.



During the
Third Shinobi World War
, Han became known worldwide for his prowess with
steam ninjutsu
.
 In the middle of the war on the battlefront, he and the
Four-Tails
's
jinchūriki

Rōshi
 confronted
Team 6
, during which they launched their
Tailed Beast Balls
, but missed when
Minato Namikaze

warped
 the
Konohagakure
 squad to safety.

At some unspecified time in between the war and the capture of
Yugito Nii
, Han died, as by the time the
Two-Tails
 was sealed, according to
Pain
 only
three

tailed

beasts
 remained uncaptured.
 It's unclear if he was captured by the
Akatsuki
 and had the Five-Tails
extracted
 from his body leading to his death, an incident that Iwagakure would have not alerted others of out of embarrassment,
 or similar to
Yagura Karatachi
 died and the group went on to capturing his roaming
Tailed Beast
. Ultimately, sometime after his death,
Kabuto Yakushi
 acquired some of Han's DNA, which he used to
reincarnate
 him.

Personality

His personality was described as lively and direct.
 Han makes a habit of leaving his right hand tucked inside his kimono. He was rather amicable and friendly when he first met
Naruto Uzumaki
 appearing to be a calm and reserved individual, crediting his and fellow jinchūriki getting along due to them witnessing how Naruto had been recently treating
Kurama
 as well as
Son Gokū
.

Appearance






Han in his steam armour.



Han was a very tall man, seen as the physically largest jinchūriki, easily standing a head taller than
Killer B
. He was also heavily armoured, wearing what is called
Steam Armour
 with a furnace on the back that emits steam. He had light brown eyes, was eyebrowless, and his armour extended all the way to the bottom half of his face, covering it up. Underneath the armour covering the bottom half of his face, he wore a white cloth which also covered both sides of his face and the top of his head. Aside from his red armour, he also wore a red kasa (conical straw hat) over the white cloth and it seems to be composed of the same material of his armour and furnace. He wore his Iwagakure forehead protector on a black cloth, and over his armour, Han wore a black gi, with the sleeves seemingly torn off and black gloves. He also wore what seems to be a bronze-coloured ring around his neck which he wore over his red armour. Also, the armour covering his arms, legs and torso was plated.

Abilities






A reanimated Han.



Han was recognised worldwide for his prowess with steam ninjutsu due to his war efforts, and his speed and power in taijutsu during his lifetime was considered amongst the greatest in the world.
 He was also notable enough to be reincarnated by
Kabuto Yakushi
. After his
reincarnation
 and serving as one of Tobi's
Six Paths of Pain
, Han is seen with both the Sharingan and Rinnegan. Combining the perceptual and predictive abilities of the former with the shared field of vision ability of the latter, allowed Han to use his attacks in a more precise and coordinated fashion as well as react to enemy attacks more efficiently, both individually and in conjunction and with the other jinchūriki.

Physical Prowess and Nature Transformation

Han's fighting style seemed to revolve around
taijutsu
. He covered his body in a
special armour
 with a furnace on his back that stores large amounts of steam, borrowed from
Kokuō
's
Boil Release
, the simultaneous mixture
fire
 and
water
-natured chakra, which
boils
 Han's chakra to the highest temperature. By regulating the amount and pressure of the steam, Han can severely magnify his physical strength and the force behind his physical
attacks
. The power behind his steam-enhanced strength was enough to send Naruto in his
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
 flying into
Killer B
 with such force that both were launched across a significant distance in the forest.

Jinchūriki Transformations

Jinchūriki Forms

As
Kokuō
's
jinchūriki
, Han is granted a significant amount of chakra and stamina from the beast. While Han wasn't credited as having full control of his Tailed Beast, he was able to enter
Tailed Beast Mode
 without physically transforming to cast
Tailed Beast Balls
.
 After he was
revived
, when attacked and immobilised by B's
ink clone
, Han transformed into his 'Version 2' form to escape being
sealed
. He was also able to physically fully transform into Kokuō, while in this state Han displayed strong ramming power, using his
horns
 to heavily wound the Eight-Tails and B as well sending them back a considerable distance. He is also able to utilise
chakra arms
 in his Version 2 form like most other jinchūriki.

Han reincarnated, alongside the other jinchūriki.



In preparation for the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, Han was reincarnated by
Kabuto Yakushi
 to fight against the
Allied Shinobi Forces
, before being mobilised alongside the other deceased
jinchūriki
. As dawn broke on the second day of war, it was revealed that
Tobi
 had turned the reincarnated jinchūriki into his own customised
Six Paths of Pain
, with each having a
Rinnegan
 and
Sharingan
 in place of their left and right eyes respectively. Each jinchūriki also had their respective tailed beast resealed within them and a
chakra receiver
 embedded into their body.

Han and Yugito attack Naruto and Killer B.



Han later travelled together with Tobi, in pursuit of
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Killer B
. Encountering their targets, the reincarnated jinchūriki were sent into battle. With the enemy blinded by
Fū
's
technique
, Han attacks them directly alongside
Yugito Nii
, where he clashed with Naruto. When his punch was blocked, he released steam from his
armour
 and overwhelmed Naruto with his strength. However, when this initial assault failed, he, like the others, unleashed the power of their respective
tailed beast
 by materialising the first of its tails.

As Naruto tried to destroy the chakra receiver embedded in
Rōshi
's chest, Han intercepted him with a steam-enhanced kick, sending him hurtling backwards. Incapacitated in the wake of the
Eight-Tails
'
devastating attack
, after B's recent
transformation
, Han was then restrained by the latter's
sealing technique
. However, before the sealing's completion, he managed to escape by adopting his
Version 2
 form. Han then assumed his full Five-Tails form and proceeded to
gore
 the Eight-Tails.






Han alongside the other transformed jinchūriki.



When the Five-Tails temporarily regained control of itself and tries to attack Tobi, after
Kakashi Hatake
 and
Might Guy
's intervention, the beast was
restrained
 and forced to revert to Han's Version 2 form. Regrouping with the other reincarnated jinchūriki, Han then charged towards Naruto but was instead intercepted by Kakashi and Guy. Confronting the Konohagakure
jōnin
, he took advantage of the
Six-Tails
'
Wisdom Wolf Decay
 bearing down upon the pair, creating multiple
chakra arms
 in preparation to attack them. However, when these are quickly
severed
 by Kakashi, the jinchūriki ready themselves for another attack. As
Son Gokū
 was resealed into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, Han was forced to re-enter his full tailed beast form, as Tobi prepared to go all-out.

Unleashing a
Tailed Beast Ball
 along with the others, the jinchūriki instead resorted to a direct assault when these attacks are deflected by Naruto, only to then be repelled as the latter adopted his
Tailed Beast Mode
. In the resulting chaos, Han attempted to gore the Eight-Tails again, but in a complete reversal, finds himself sent reeling. With this, the rival beasts regrouped and prepared a collaborative Tailed Beast Ball, launching it towards their opponents only to have it diverted by an opposing one.






Han, alongside the other jinchūriki and tailed beasts, encounters Naruto.



Attempting to remove the opposition's chakra receivers in the ensuing blast, Naruto enters the joint consciousness of the tailed beasts, where he met Han along with the other jinchūriki and their respective beasts. During this encounter, he told them how they had only happily gathered together after Son and Rōshi's disappearance, thanks to Naruto. With this, Han introduced himself alongside his tailed beast,
Kokuō
. After Kokuō was resealed into the
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
, Han and the other jinchūriki's unconscious bodies were collected by
B
 and held in Gyūki's tentacles. With the release of the Impure World Reincarnation, Han and the others were enveloped in a light of sorts before their bodies started to deconstruct and Han's soul returned to the afterlife.

Trivia

In order to prevent the jinchūriki from turning traitor, it is tradition for the host to be selected from the family of the village's own Kage. Due to this, Han may have been connected to one of the
Tsuchikage
.

In the manga, Han was possibly one of the jinchūriki that were captured by
Akatsuki
 before Part II, who loathed humanity due to being neglected and hated by his village, none of whom came to rescue him when he had been captured.
