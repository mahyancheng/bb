Byakuya Gang Arc

Upon robbing the Fukutoku Store in
Konohagakure
, Oko informed Gekkō that they had help from villagers during their escape. For the Byakuya Gang's final heist, they spread rumors about the Kaminarimon Company being a corrupt organisation that was unfair to its workers. This combined with the growing support of citizens in the village and placing multiple people under genjutsu to further the charade forced all active ninja in the village to work and pacify the protestors from growing violent.

During which, the gang made their move on the
Ninjutsu Research Centre
, where they stole Centre’s entire data on world ninjutsu. As the gang made their way for the country border, they were found by
Team 10
 and
Boruto
, who followed the gang thanks to a locator
Katasuke Tōno
 placed on Gekkō. Ryōgi and Gekkō made their retreat while the rest of the gang held off their pursuers, however, Shikadai and Boruto managed to slip past them. Ultimately, Oko was the only one left, but he proved too strong for Inojin and Chōchō to handle. Instead, however, he was defeated by the timely arrival of
Shikamaru Nara
, who quickly subdued the thief.
