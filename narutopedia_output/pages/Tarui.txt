 yellow eyes and considerably long blonde hair which reaches to her ankles, with two long bangs framing her face. Her attire is typical of a Kumogakure ninja, with white
flak jacket
 and dark-coloured undershirt and pants. Her sleeves are mismatched, with the left sleeve being significantly longer than the right, covering her arm, which prevents her enemies from predicting her movements.
 Additionally she wears a black lapel around her waist, as well as bandages around her right arm and ankles. Her
forehead protector
 is worn like a
knit cap
.
