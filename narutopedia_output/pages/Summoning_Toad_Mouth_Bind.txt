Unlike the usual practice of
summoning
 an entire creature, the user instead summons only the
oesophagus
 of a giant toad from
Mount Myōboku
: Rock Lodging (
妙木山・岩宿
,
Myōbokuzan: Iwayado
). The oesophagus is summoned around a target; if this is done inside a cave or some other structure, it's possible the target will not even notice. The walls of the oesophagus are sticky and pliable, making it difficult for opponents to keep their footing and, therefore, fight as normal. The oesophagus is ordinarily inescapable, and over time it will contract around and digest its victims.

Jiraiya
 can control the oesophagus, causing it to expand, contract, or grow in whatever direction he wishes. When first used, Jiraiya claims that no one has ever escaped from this technique.
Itachi Uchiha
 and
Kisame Hoshigaki
 manage to escape when Itachi burns through the oesophagus using
Amaterasu
. This surprises Jiraiya, as the oesophagus is fire-resistant due to the toad's ability to breathe fire.

In the anime, Jiraiya demonstrates the ability to summon a giant toad's stomach using this technique. This section of the toad contains stomach acid, and the air within is filled with an acidic
poison
 that is colourless and odourless, making it difficult to detect. Though it can be endured in small amounts, this poison begins to paralyse a person's entire body after ten minutes of continuous exposure, indiscriminately affecting anyone contained within the stomach.

Trivia

Gamaguchi
 (
蝦蟇口
,
literally meaning:
 toad mouth) is a Japanese name for a pouch or wallet, especially one closed with a metal clasp and used for small change. Naruto's
own wallet
 is a reference to this word as well.

In various video games, parts of the oesophagus also spew fire.
