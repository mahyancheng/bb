This technique summons a flock of countless
crows
, dazzling the enemy. The user can freely manipulate the crows by emitting
chakra
 from his fingertips and altering it into high frequency waves. Since the crows continuously clone themselves, the target becomes completely surrounded, obscuring their field of vision. When no longer needed, the crows will simply disappear in a puff of smoke.
