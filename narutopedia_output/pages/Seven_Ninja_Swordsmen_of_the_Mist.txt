The
Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist
 (
霧の忍刀七人衆
,
Kiri no Shinobigatana Shichininshū
) was an organisation consisting of only the greatest
blade-wielding

shinobi
 of their generation that
Kirigakure
 can produce. There can only be seven members at a time — hence the name. The swords of the Seven Swordsmen are passed down from generation to generation
 since the
First Mizukage
's era. They're considered mystical blades, and together, the Seven Swordsmen are capable of bringing down an entire nation, regarded as being the strongest shinobi in the village behind the
Mizukage
.

History






A previous generation of the Seven Swordsmen.



Some time after the
Third Shinobi World War
, the Seven Swordsmen of the time (
Fuguki Suikazan
,
Jinin Akebino
,
Kushimaru Kuriarare
,
Raiga Kurosuki
,
Jūzō Biwa
, and two others) cornered a
Konoha team
. The team was rescued by
Might Duy
, who fought all seven using the
Eight Gates Released Formation
.
 In the manga, it is only known that Fuguki survived, while in the anime, Jūzō and Raiga also survived along with him.

The group's make-up changed over the following years:
Mangetsu Hōzuki
 joined and mastered all seven swords,
 and Fuguki was killed and replaced by his subordinate,
Kisame Hoshigaki
.
 The group's remaining members started dying — as in the case of Mangetsu — or becoming
missing-nin
 and taking their swords with them — as in the cases of Kisame and
Zabuza Momochi
, as well as Jūzō and Raiga in the anime. By the time of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, only
Hiramekarei
 wielded by
Chōjūrō
 remained in Kirigakure's possession.






The strongest generation revived.



The "strongest" generation of the Seven Swordsmen was later
reincarnated
 to fight for
Akatsuki
 during the Fourth Shinobi World War.
 Five of the swordsmen were reunited with their former swords, which they used in battle against the
Third Division
 of the
Allied Shinobi Forces
.
 Although the Third Division suffered numerous casualties, they were able to
seal
 all of the Seven Swordsmen by the second day of the war.
 With the release of the Impure World Reincarnation, the sealed swordsmen's
souls
 were ultimately returned to the
Pure Land
.

In the anime, the remaining six swords returned to Kiri's possession, including
Kubikiribōchō
 from
Kakashi Hatake
,
Samehada
 taken by
Killer B
, and
Kiba
 that was in the possession of
Omoi
. As such, the unit had been reinstated, with Chōjūrō personally choosing
Kagura Karatachi
 to replace his position.
Shizuma Hoshigaki
 later forms his own version of the group called the
New Seven Ninja Swordsmen
, comprised of malcontents who wish to return the village to its roots as the "Village of Bloody Mist". Recruiting Kagura to their cause, they take advantage of his access to the armoury where the seven blades are stored and steal them with plans of staging out a coup d'etat.
 However, they failed to start their revolution due to the actions of
Boruto Uzumaki
, his friends, Chōjūrō and eventually Kagura himself, which resulted in them being defeated and taken into custody.
 Despite not being official members of the Seven Swordsmen, when Kiri was in need of manpower to go against the
Funato clan
, three of the arrested members of Shizuma's group who did not participate in their leader's jailbreak were recruited by
Kagura
 and loaned the swords they took during their failed coup.
 Kagura is killed by
Funamushi
, and thus the Hiramekarei would be returned to Chōjūrō's possession.
 In the aftermath,
Buntan Kurosuki
 returns to Kiri, presumably returning Kiba, Nuibari and Kabutowari.

Swords






The seven swords.



Hiramekarei

Other Members

An earlier generation of the organisation consisted of Fuguki, Jinin, Jūzō, Raiga, Kushimaru and two other unidentified shinobi:

Hiramekarei's wielder: A shorter individual with moused-up hair who wore his forehead protector as a choker and a utility belt around his waist along with a flak jacket and a pinstriped shirt and pants. He carried the Twinsword strapped to his back horizontally. Together with his companions he assaulted Konoha shinobi, and died during his battle with Might Duy.

Shibuki's wielder: A slender man bearing a similar appearance to Jinpachi. He who wore a pinstriped shirt and a cloth-mask that only showed his eyes. Together with his companions he assasulted Konoha shinobi, and died during his battle with Might Duy.

Trivia

The Seven Swordsmen seem to be loosely inspired by the
Seven Spears of Shizugatake
, a group of seven samurai during the
Sengoku period
 in 1583 who were led by the daimyō,
Toyotomi Hideyoshi
.

It seems to be a tradition for the members and aspiring members of the Seven Swordsmen to have sharpened teeth, the only exception being Raiga in the anime.

When the group debuted in the anime, at least two of the sword designs differed to later appearances in the anime and in the manga.

All named members of the Seven Swordsmen have surnames, or a given name in the case of Chōjūrō, derived from a type of
produce
. This does not hold true for Raiga.

All of the reincarnated swordsmen have bandages around their necks.

At
least

two
 (
four

in the anime
) of the members became
missing-nin
, while
one
 was discovered to be a traitor, leaking confidential information to other villages.

Although Mangetsu was said to have mastered use of all the swords, other members of his generation wielded six of them, leaving Hiramekarei as the blade he likely primarily used.

At
least

two
 (one in the manga) members of the Seven Swordsmen were former
Anbu
 members.

At
least

two
 (
three
 in the anime) members of the Seven Swordsmen managed to fake their own deaths or regain life later on by means of an accomplice.

In the anime, Kushimaru and Jinpachi were known collectively as the "Heartless Pair" (
非情コンビ
,
Hijō Konbi
) due to their many acts of cruelty in their lifetimes.

Due to the tradition of the group, every single Kiri villager strives to master
kenjutsu
 from their childhood onwards.

This group bears similarities to the
shichinin misaki
, namely there always being seven in number and their association with water.
