Dowsing Rods

Dowsing is a technique using a pair of simple L-shaped rods. One rod is held in each hand, with the short arm of the L held upright, and the long arm pointing forward. The practitioner then concentrates hard on what they're looking for, and the rods react when they're getting close to it. Dowsing is most often used for finding water.
