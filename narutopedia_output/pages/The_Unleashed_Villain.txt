Awaji
.
Chōjūrō
 and other
Kiri
 shinobi
put out
 the fire.
Team 7
 tends to
Katasuke
's injuries. At the prison,
Kagura
 tells
medical-nin
 to go to the crash site. Communications to, from, and inside the prison are interrupted.
Isari
 and
Funato
 clansmen break in and immobilise the guards. Kagura is notified of the intruders, and
Boruto
 offers to help, believing it to be connected to the terrorist attack.
Jibiki

directs water
 through the prison. Inmates become agitated on account of the explosion. Kagura and Boruto find guards in a
Water Prison Technique
. Kagura cuts them free, and they inform him the Funato are responsible. Jibiki reports to Isari he found
Araumi
. Boruto and Kagura analyse the situation. Katasuke asks about Boruto. Chōjūrō receives reports of unidentified bodies in the crashed airship, and orders a lock-down.
Misuno
 asks Chōjūrō to return to his office, where he can ask for reinforcements. Isari arrives at his father Araumi's cell, defeating the guards posted there, and breaks his glass containment.
 Araumi recovers by absorbing moisture from one of the guards, killing him. Boruto and Kagura intercept them, and fight Isari. Boruto attacks Isari's living weapon with a
Rasengan
. Kagura protects them with a
water mirror
. Isari breaks through it with a
water wave
 and leaves. He notices his weapon has taken a liking to Boruto's chakra. The Funato leave with Araumi. Islands throughout the
Land of Water
 begin falling under Funato control. Boruto reunites with Team 7 and informs them the airship crash was a diversion. Chōjūrō receives a report explaining the same. He also learns that a governor's body was found drowned, who had been in contact with the Funato, and speculate that he spread rumours of the terrorist attack. The situation is further destabilised by the destruction of a base in the eastern sea by unidentified weapons. While Misuno and Kagura update each other, Boruto is concerned about
Team 5
, whose mission is one an island of the eastern sea. Chōjūrō can't spare the extra manpower, but allows Kagura to go help Team 7. He explains the situation, and hands him
Hiramekarei
. Team 7 procures a still functioning boat. Kagura arrives, having recruited
Buntan
,
Kyohō
, and
Hebiichigo
 for the mission, who were also allowed to use their swords again, much to Team 7's surprise. They complain to Kagura, but he counters they were allowed to move around under his supervision. They depart to Dotō Island,
Kawaki
 complaining about being on a boat again.
