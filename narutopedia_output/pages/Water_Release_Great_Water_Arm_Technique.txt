By putting the
Hydrification Technique
 into practical use, the muscles of the arm are temporarily enlarged and strengthened. Moisture is gathered from the whole body and compressed into the entire arm, like an instant pump-up. However, because it is essential to properly control the moisture balance inside the body, this technique's degree of difficulty is very high. The technique gives the user superhuman strength, capable of breaking through both rock walls and steel doors with ease.

Trivia

In the anime,
Suigetsu
 can use a similar technique that follows the same mechanics to increases his leg's mass to greatly increase their raw might and natural acceleration.
