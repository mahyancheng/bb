" (

Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

While
Naruto
 is taking him for a walk on the village,
Kawaki
 thinks to himself he's using the
Hokage
 for protection. Back home,
Boruto
 learns that his father took Kawaki out to find a new vase. Kawaki notices the
Hokage Rock
, which Naruto explains to him. They come across
Sarada
 and
Chōchō
 buying snacks. Chōchō is interested in Kawaki, and Sarada tries to be friendly by suggesting which snack Kawaki should have, though he ignores her suggestion. Naruto treats them in addition to buying snacks for himself and Kawaki. Kawaki is taken aback how much he enjoys his snack. Naruto tells Kawaki to let her have a bite of his snack, which she has never had, but he refuses. A boy bumps into Kawaki, who transforms his arm to attack. Naruto stops and prevents him from harming the boy.
 Kawaki advises the boy to be careful, telling him there's danger everywhere. Sarada and Kawaki argue over his outburst. Naruto takes them to
Yamanaka Flowers
, where
Ino
 greets them. Naruto discreetly informs her to keep the Sensing Unit on alert. He tells her they're there for a flower vase. Kawaki picks one at random, causing Sarada to admonish him over his lack of effort and sincerity. Naruto explains the meaning behind making a proper choice. Kawaki picks the same vase, but backs up his choice with motive. Ino offers to add some flowers to the vase, but the stems trigger him, reminding him of the tubes in
Amado
's lab and
Jigen
, and causing him to drop the vase, breaking it. Kawaki's
Kāma
 begins to activate, but Naruto calms him down, causing it to recede. Leaving the shop, Sarada tells Kawaki of her goal of being Hokage, so he can also count on her if he needs anything. Naruto takes Kawaki for lunch and they have ramen. Back home, Boruto acknowledges Kawaki's sincerity when he shows them the new vase, but offers him a glue tube to fix the old vase.
Koji
 and
Delta
 arrive at the outskirts of
Konohagakure
. Koji informs her of the history and capabilities of the
Sensing Unit
, including their ability to detect previously unknown chakra. He crosses into the village without triggering a response, surprising Delta, and angering her when he tells her to stay put. He begins looking for Kawaki.
