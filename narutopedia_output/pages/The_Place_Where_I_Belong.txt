"
The Place Where I Belong
" (
自分の居場所
,
Jibun no Ibasho
) is episode 406 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

In the
Demon Desert
,
Ameno
 is
extracting poison
 out of a wounded man from another
Sunagakure
 team while
Shishio
 is
searching
 for nearby
shinobi
. Meanwhile,
Chōji Akimichi
,
Ino Yamanaka
 and
Sakura Haruno
 are in a need for supplies after a confrontation with another team, leading Sakura and Ino to bicker with each other. On their way, they are suddenly attacked by a giant scorpion, which gets defeated by Chōji and Sakura, to which Ino can't help but to admire their growth. While
healing
 Sakura's injured hand, Ino recalls her past visit to the
Yamanaka, Nara, and Akimichi Clan Memorial
 alongside her father
Inoichi
, who wanted to prepare her for the lengthy training of their
clan
's
hiden
, forcing Ino to wriggle herself out of the situation, unwilling to undergo something that takes several years to accomplish. While celebrating Chōji leaving the hospital after his confrontation with the
Sound Five
, Ino decided to become
Tsunade
's subordinate like Sakura did before.
 Tsunade accepted to test her for three months, time Ino needed to learn how to revive an octopus, which she ultimately accomplished after hard study sessions alongside Sakura. Afterward, Ino finally realised her "own place" and decided to undergo the training in her clan's hiden after all, thanking Sakura for opening her eyes. While Sakura, Ino and Chōji eat the flesh of the recently killed scorpion,
Team Ameno
 detects them and prepares to head towards them.

Trivia

While Ameno was about to perform her medical ninjutsu, one of the Suna-nin was mistakenly depicted with a
Konohagakure

forehead protector
. This was corrected in later sequences.
