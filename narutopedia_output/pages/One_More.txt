Viz:
 The Other…!!) is chapter 101 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Naruto
 manages to punch
Neji
, but Neji deflects the attack with his
Eight Trigrams Palms Revolving Heaven
. Combining his
Byakugan
's 360° vision with his ability to emit chakra from any part of his body, Neji is virtually impervious to attack.
Hiashi Hyūga
, the head of the
Hyūga clan
, is amazed that Neji, a member of the clan's branch house, can perform this technique and at such a young age. He is even more amazed when Neji attacks Naruto with the
Eight Trigrams Sixty-Four Palms
. Naruto's
chakra
 is sealed off but he refuses to give up, unwilling to lose to someone who believes in "failure".
Hinata
's concern for Naruto and the injuries she earlier received from Neji cause her to start coughing up blood. An
Anbu
 offers to help her.
