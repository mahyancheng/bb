This technique makes use of the
Lava Release

kekkei genkai
 where the user expels a large quantity of
quicklime
 from their mouth, capable of inflicting damage to an opponent. This ability can also be manipulated in order to restrict the intended target's movements, as after the initial blast the remnants of the substance can act in a similar manner to quick-drying cement. However, the technique requires the addition of water to set off the necessary reaction to make the substance harden. This can be easily achieved through the use of a
Water Release
 technique, which can also serve to increase the area covered by the substance, thus further increasing the potential range of the technique.

Trivia

The last kanji of this technique's name, the kanji for
congealing
 (
凝
), is also used in the Japanese word for
concrete
 (
混凝土
,
konkurēto
), which also needs to be mixed with water before hardening.
