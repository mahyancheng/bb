Naruto Gaiden
 mini-series.

Summary

As the
mysterious man

guides
 the weapons towards
Sasuke
, the latter easily deflects them with his
sword
 before pointing it against the opponent, who catches it in order to let
his son
 land a successful attack. However, Sasuke's
Rinnegan
 lets him
swap
 places with Shin, shooting a
dense ball of fire
 to complete the counter-attack. The attack is deflected thanks to the enemy using Shin as a shield, though both of them get caught in the explosion.
 Noticing Sasuke's great ocular prowess, the enemy presents himself as Shin Uchiha, to which
Sarada
 comments that he has the same name as his son. After telling
Naruto
 to take care of the children, Sasuke goes on the offensive, but adult-Shin manipulates the opponent's sword into stabbing Naruto, who ends up deactivating his
chakra cloak
 due to the injury. Since the cloak had blocked some weapons beforehand, the sudden lack of protection led Sasuke to shield his daughter with his own body, which ends up being paralysed by said weapons.
Sakura
 arrives in time to stop the two enemies,
punching
 the older Shin into the ground. However, as Sakura apologises to Sarada for the situation, Shin's
creature

teleports
 both Shins – along with Sakura, who got caught up in the technique – to their base, where the father orders her to transplant his injured son's organs into his own body to repair the damage she had caused.
