Seemingly using the manoeuvrability of his
Storm Release: Laser Circus
 technique, but employing the use of
black lightning
 instead of normal lightning, Darui sends out several
panthers
 which are guided towards the opponent, slashing them as they pass. The panthers then merge into a single, giant panther behind the opponent, which bites them and then explodes.

Trivia

As with many of the techniques of
Kumogakure
 ninja, this technique has an English name given kanji that somewhat match the pronunciation. Usually, the kanji would be pronounced as "Shikkoku Hantengū".
