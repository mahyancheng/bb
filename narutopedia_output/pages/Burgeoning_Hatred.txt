Burgeoning Hatred
" (

) is episode 249 of the
Boruto: Naruto Next Generations
 anime.

Synopsis

Two days after
Funamushi
's defeat, the village receives relief supplies from
Kirigakure
. They're concerned about
Iwabee
 and
Denki
, but
Metal
 is still searching for them with
Team 7
's assistance. They find an injured
Funato
 soldier, and take him back to the village, where
Sarada

heals
 him.
Buntan
 disapproves, giving his allegiance to Funamushi, who killed
Kagura
. Other villagers share the sentiment, despite Sarada pointing out he might have information on Denki and Iwabee.
Boruto
 says that Kagura has been avenged, and Buntan questions the cost of that.
Kawaki
 says casualties are part of war, and Buntan counters that
Araumi
 is still alive, so they have to join up with Kirigakure's forces. She's doubtful of what advantage keeping Denki and Iwabee alive would give Funamushi, and if they were, they'd have been used as bargaining chips already. Sarada asks for one more day on the village, which Buntan agrees to. Sarada checks on Boruto at Kagura's grave, where he admits he thought that avenging him would make him feel better, but it didn't. Sarada takes responsibility for
Hebiichigo
's death as captain. They agree that Kagura would be glad they saved the village, and commit themselves to finding Denki and Iwabee, and bringing them home.
 The next day,
Yamame
 and
Iwana
 invite
Kyohō
 to stay on the village, something no one has ever asked him. By their graves, Buntan tells Kagura and Hebiichigo that thanks to his petition, they have been pardoned. Denki and Iwabee show up just as Metal's faith in them being alive begins to waver. Back at the village, they eat, and explain what happened while they were captive. One of Funamushi's subordinates wanted to kill them, but upon learning they were gathering food for children, Funamushi merely had them tied up. When the Funato fled after hearing of Funamushi's defeat, they used the opportunity to escape, Iwabee cutting through their restraints with an
Earth Release
. They share their theories on why Funamushi didn't kill them or used them in negotiations, which Boruto finds hard to believe. Sarada wants them all to sleep early so they can leave early in the morning, but Boruto goes scouting. Kyohō tells Iwana and Yamame he can't stay because he has to help Buntan. While keeping watch at night, Boruto is attacked by
Gokai
, who lures him into a trap where someone else tries hitting him with blow-darts. Boruto defeats Gokai,
sending
 him through an alarm system to alert his friends. He discovers his other assailant is
Kobuna
, who is there to avenge his father, Funamushi. His words remind Boruto of his own, and Buntan's, giving him pause. Sarada arrives in time to
protect
 him, Gokai and Kobuna retreating. He tells Sarada who Kobuna is. Kawaki clashes with Boruto over him understanding Kobuna's feelings.
Mitsuki
 is impressed that Kawaki is always able to convey his feelings and clash with people, admitting his own difficulty in doing so. Kawaki says Mitsuki must also have a way, one that isn't aggressive like Kawaki's, as he has known Boruto for a long while. When they arrive, everyone else is prepared to question the captured Funato soldier. Boruto tells them about Kobuna, and they argue over the cycle of vengeance. If they stop fighting, the situation with the Funato won't be resolved, but if they continue, they'll breed more resentment. The captured Funato soldier laughs at Boruto, saying he's already been an enemy of the Funato since long before Funamushi because he injured
Seiren
, whose younger brother is
Ikada
, to everyone's shock.
