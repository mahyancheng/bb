Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Before the
Demon Brothers
 can kill
Naruto
,
Sasuke
 steps in and stops them. They turn their attention to
Tazuna
, so
Sakura
 comes to his defence. Before the brothers can land an attack,
Kakashi
 appears and neutralises them, having only pretended to be killed so he could see who their target was. As it becomes obvious that protecting Tazuna is going to be more complicated than the
C-rank

mission
 they were assigned, Kakashi considers going
home
. Naruto, angry with himself for freezing up, demands that they complete the mission no matter how complicated it may become, vowing to never step down from a challenge.
