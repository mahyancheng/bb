Mei Terumī
 (
照
美
メイ
,
Terumī Mei
) is the
Fifth
Mizukage
 (
五代目水影
,
Godaime Mizukage
,
literally meaning:
 Fifth Water Shadow) of
Kirigakure
. After the dreadful reign of
Yagura Karatachi
 ended, she became Mizukage and worked tirelessly to reform internal policies and recreate diplomatic relations with other villages.

Background

As a young girl around the age of nine, Mei had to endure Kirigakure's brutal
academy
 graduation ritual.
 Living through the dark days of the Village of the Bloody Mist, she had fought drenched in the blood of others and her own for the sake of the village.

After taking office as Mizukage, Mei came across challenges while struggling to undo the negative inheritance left by the Fourth Mizukage and the village's own history.
 In the anime, during the aftermath of Yagura's passing, Mei received a letter from the
Fifth Kazekage
 and
Hokage
, asking if Kirigakure would participate in the upcoming
Chūnin Exams
 that their villages were hosting. After listening to
her

aides
, Mei informed the Hokage that her village wouldn't be joining.

Personality






Mei dreams of marriage.



Mei is generally a kind and cheerful person, speaking well of others and attempting to avoid conflict. Mei proved to be more open-minded than the other Kage, as she had shown respect and was willing to listen to
Gaara
, at one point even defending him from the
Tsuchikage
's disrespectful behaviour, and later showing admiration for Gaara after seeing how pure-hearted he was. Mei also can be very flirtatious, as she remarked to
Sasuke Uchiha
 that he was good looking, and expressed regret that she must kill someone so handsome, but would give him a kiss before that.
 She is also shown to be quite respectful to others despite her status as a Kage. She often ends her sentences with "kudasai", which translates roughly to "please" and refers to all her fellow Kage with the suffix "-sama", which translates to "Lord" ("Lady" if the person is female). She also stated to
Madara
 that though she liked when men complimented her, she would hold off in his case.

Mei seems to be somewhat sensitive when it comes to her love life, as shown when she misheard
Ao
 say that she was "past marriageable age", and threatened to kill him for such an "insult". This seems to be a running gag, as she has made similar mistakes on multiple occasions. She also has low tolerance towards insults about her age and appearance, as she was instantly angered when
Karin
 called her an "old hag", and beat up Ao while
Fū Yamanaka
 possessed his body and insulted her in the same manner. Despite this, she is also very sharp-witted as she pretended to be able to undo Ao's barrier technique protecting his Byakugan to fool Fū into exposing himself possessing Ao's body.

Befitting her role as the village's leader, Mei cares about the welfare and history of Kirigakure. Under the belief that
Yagura
, her predecessor, had been manipulated by
Tobi
 using
genjutsu
, she was prepared to fight
Danzō Shimura
, who also possessed a Sharingan which could cast a
similar genjutsu
. Though Mei is courageous and calm in battle, she is not above realising her or any one else's limitations as seen from her open acknowledgement that it seems as though Madara could not be stopped.
 Despite usually being quite fearless and determined in battle, she possesses a pessimistic outlook against stronger opponents as witnessed during her battle with Madara; though she felt they were fighting a losing battle and voiced the fact that their efforts seemed futile, this did not ultimately prevent her from fighting alongside her comrades.

Mei does care a lot about her marital status as well as her fellow Kage. In her Infinite Tsukuyomi dream, she dreamt she was married with the other four Kage celebrating it with her. She is also a person of honour as when Sasuke broke a wall and risked leaking her acidic
Boil Release
 to the other Kage, she changed the pH to avoid harming them.

Appearance






Mei in Part II.



Mei is a tall, slender woman with fair skin. She has green eyes, and ankle-length, auburn hair styled into a herringbone pattern at the back, a top-knot tied with a dark blue band, and with four bangs at the front. Two bangs are short, with one covering her right eye, and two are long, crossing each other on her bust, just below her chin.

She wears a long-sleeved, dark blue dress that falls just below the knees. It seems to be closed at the front with a zipper, and is kept open on the front-right side from the waist down. The dress only covers up to the upper part of her arms and the underside of her breasts. Underneath, she wears a mesh armour that covers slightly more of her upper body than her dress. She also wears a skirt in the same colour as her dress and, underneath those, mesh leggings reaching down over her knees. Around her waist, she wears a belt with a pouch attached to the back on the left along with high-heeled sandals, shin-guards reaching up over her knees, dark blue nail polish on her fingers and toes, and is usually shown with purple lipstick (fuchsia in the anime). Years after the Fourth Great Shinobi War, Mei developed minor wrinkles near the corners of her lips. Her hair was also noticeably shorter, only reaching to her lower back.

Abilities






Mei using the Hiding in Mist Technique.



Mei is a powerful kunoichi whose abilities earned her the title of Fifth Mizukage.
 She is calm, observant and perceptive and can pick up on slight discrepancies in another person's personality, as seen when she detected the difference in
Ao
's behaviour when
Fū Yamanaka
 inhabited his body.
 Her power was enough to force
Sasuke Uchiha
 into a corner and injure him despite his usage of
Susanoo
. She has also shown some skill in taijutsu, being able to intercept
Black Zetsu
 from attacking the
daimyō
 with a single kick during the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

Ninjutsu

Nature Transformation






Mei using Lava Release.



Mei is proficient in the
nature transformations
 of
Water
,
Fire
,
Earth
, and
Lightning Release
.
 With Water Release, she can create a
large torrent
 that can extinguish
a powerful Fire Release technique
 used by
Madara Uchiha
, and quickly use the same water to form a
giant dragon
. Mei can also use the
Hiding in Mist Technique
 to obscure the movements of herself and her allies.
 Two years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, her mastery of Water Release enabled her to successfully protect her village from the massive meteorites that had broken off from the falling
Moon
.






Mei using Boil Release.



Mei also possesses two elemental
kekkei genkai
,
 the first of which is
Lava Release
. By combining the earth and fire natures, she can
spit out acidic mud
 that can melt almost anything in its path. The great amount of steam generated after the fluid strikes can serve as an effective smokescreen, allowing for a follow up attack while the enemy is distracted.
 A significant amount of exposure was enough to partially melt Madara's
Susanoo
 ribcage.
 The second kekkei genkai,
Boil Release
, allows her to simultaneously use water and fire natures to
release a corrosive mist
 that can melt almost anything it touches. It even managed to burn through Sasuke's Susanoo ribcage.
 She also has the ability to alter the potency and acidity of the mist created by her Boil Release techniques, and is apparently not affected by the mist herself.

Part II

Five Kage Summit

Main article:
Five Kage Summit

When Mei leaves for the
Kage Summit
, the villagers of Kirigakure cheer for her. One of her bodyguards,
Chōjūrō
, expressed worry that he will not be able to protect her, so Mei cheered him up by voicing confidence in his abilities.
 She continued to speak kindly to Chōjūrō during their journey to the
Land of Iron
. Similarly, whenever
Ao
, her other bodyguard, tried to scold Chōjūrō for not acting like a man, Mei mistook his words and threatened to kill him.






The five Kage meeting.



When the Summit began, Mei proved to be more open-minded than the other Kage, as she had shown respect and was willing to listen to the
Fifth Kazekage
; even at one point defending him from the
Third Tsuchikage
's disrespectful behaviour. The
Fourth Raikage
 explained his suspicions of the other
Kage
, and stated that Mei and the rest of her village were the least trustworthy; as the Summit was being held to discuss
Akatsuki
, and Akatsuki is rumoured to have been created in Kirigakure, the village's actions made it suspect. Over Ao's objections, Mei admitted that many in Kirigakure believe
her predecessor
 to have been manipulated by someone. When
Tobi
's involvement with Akatsuki was brought to light, the Summit mediator,
Mifune
, suggested forming an alliance to be headed by
Danzō Shimura
. Although Mei does not object, Mifune explained that Akatsuki's supposed ties with Kirigakure left her unsuited to lead a task force meant to eliminate the organisation.

Ao soon afterwards exposed that Danzō's
manipulation
 of Mifune. Before he can be questioned about it,
Zetsu
 infiltrated the meeting and informed them of Sasuke Uchiha's presence. The Raikage broke Zetsu's neck while trying to learn Sasuke's whereabouts, prompting Mei to scold him for killing a potential information source. Mei and her escorts remained in the Summit room while the Fourth Raikage, and Fifth Kazekage, went to deal with Sasuke. Believing Danzō's mind-controlling dōjutsu may somehow be related to the manipulation of the Fourth Mizukage, she instructed Ao to not let Danzō out of his sight.






Mei confronts Sasuke.



Sasuke soon arrived in the Summit hall to kill Danzō who fled. Sasuke tried to follow him, but Mei uses her
Lava Release
 to block his path. She advised that the Tsuchikage should get out of the way if he was not intending to participate in the battle and attacks Sasuke again. Chōjūrō
forced
 Sasuke into an adjacent hall, where Mei sealed him in with her, intending to destroy him by filling the hall with a
corrosive mist
. As a weakened Sasuke began to feel the effects of her technique and the bones of Susanoo's ribcage visibly melting, Mei was caught in Zetsu's
Spore Technique
 before she can finish him, which transferred her chakra to Sasuke. As he broke back into the Summit hall, Mei neutralises her Boil Release so that it didn't harm anyone else. She returned to the hall once she had recovered and, finding Tobi, was told about his
Eye of the Moon Plan
. As he ended his explanation by requesting the Kage give him
Naruto
 and
Killer B
, Mei and the other Kage refuse, leading Tobi to declare the start of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

With the outbreak of war, Mei and the other Kage agree to form a
Shinobi Alliance
 to be led by the Raikage. Mei is the first to argue that Naruto and B should be protected from Akatsuki, which the other Kage agree to in the end before returning home. Mei and Chōjūrō take a detour to look for Ao, who had followed Danzō. They find him in time to stop him from decapitating himself. He explains that his body was being controlled by
another ninja
 and asks that Mei remove the seal protecting his
Byakugan
. Since Ao would never ask her to do so, Mei knows his body is still being controlled and she asks to borrow Chōjūrō's
Hiramekarei
. Ao calls her a hag before she can use it on him and she beats him up, unaware that he has finally been released. When they return to Kirigakure, they hear that the
daimyō
 have approved the formation of the Shinobi Alliance.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown






The heads of the Alliance meet.



A few days later, the Kage convene again to discuss war tactics, Ao accompanying Mei once again. Mei expresses relief that the
Fifth Hokage
 returned to her position. She then suggests the villages combine their intelligence networks in an effort to locate Akatsuki's base of operations.

After learning that information on the jinchūriki was leaked to Akatsuki, Mei comments that the enemy won't send a large number of soldiers. It was agreed on that the Tsuchikage will be going to the island as reinforcement.

When the Tsuchikage is returning from the island, she then meets the Tsuchikage and begins to discuss what went on at the island. After she is briefed then the last meeting is held in order to fully prepare for the war. Mei orders Chōjūrō to contact Ao in the
Sensor Division
 and tell him that they need to hurry.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

Main article:
Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation






Mei fighting Black Zetsu.



Mei was tasked with leading a team of elite shinobi tasked with guarding the daimyō and ensuring their safety from their homelands into protective custody. She explained to the
Frost Daimyō
 their defence plan, where the daimyō would travel between five separate hideouts at regular intervals as well as being guarded by some of the Shinobi Forces' most powerful ninja to keep them safe. When
Black Zetsu
 who was sent after the daimyō, found them, before he could launch an assault, he was confronted by Mei. Black Zetsu prepared to fight her but she told him that she's not the only one he will have to defeat, but her entire team as well. As the battle waged on,
Naruto
's
shadow clone
 eventually appeared on the battlefield and charged at Black Zetsu who simply sidestepped the attack. With this new addition to the battlefield, Mei looked on bewildered as to what was occurring (though, in the anime, she realised that it was Naruto who appeared). After
Raidō
 and
Genma
 merely confirmed that Naruto's rash nature had not changed in the slightest, Chōjūrō, who took advantage of Naruto's distraction, was finally able to land a hit on Black Zetsu and pin him down, ending the fight to everyone's amazement.

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax

Fourth Shinobi World War: Climax






The five Kage confront Madara.



At that point, Genma was notified by Shikaku of the reincarnation of the real
Madara Uchiha
. As Mei contemplated leaving to aid her fellow Kage, she was reassured by Chōjūrō that she could leave this battle to him, as he would protect it with his life — this caused Mei to marvel on how much personal growth he'd made since the war began. Using the combined abilities of Genma, Raidō and a third ninja from the
Hokage Guard Platoon
, Mei was teleported to the front-line via the
Flying Thunder God Technique
. Mei then stood alongside her fellow Kage as they confronted Madara.






Mei attacking Madara.



To buy Tsunade time to heal
Ōnoki
 and
Gaara
, Mei and A attacked Madara with a series of lava-based and lightning-enhanced physical attacks, forcing Madara to use his Susanoo. As he complimented their offence, Mei replied while she liked being complimented by men, she would hold off in Madara's case. Madara then attacked with his
Yasaka Magatama
 technique, which was blocked by Gaara and Ōnoki's combined defence. Mei assisted A and Ōnoki's assault on Madara by using the
Hiding in Mist Technique
 to obscure Madara's vision. Before Naruto's clone dispersed, she and the other Kage told him to defend the other battlefield and left him with one word: "
win
".

As the battle dragged on, Mei fell back to be healed by Tsunade while A and Ōnoki attacked Madara, who soon
created a forest
. As Mei warned the others not to inhale the pollen, Madara's
Susanoo
 ambushed and knocked them into the forest. Mei tried to counter Madara's subsequent
fire technique
, only to pass out with the other Kage from inhaling the surrounding pollen. They recovered after Ōnoki destroyed the forest in time to see the face formed from the
First Hokage
's DNA on a regenerating Madara's chest. When Madara decided to kill Tsunade first, Mei retorted that killing a platoon's medic was a basic strategy that he would not get away with. Madara corrected her, saying he was targeting Tsunade due to her
heritage
, not because she was a medic. She later smirked as Tsunade refuted Madara's claim she was a weak woman who inherited nothing from her grandfather.






Mei countering Madara's fire attack.



Somewhat shocked initially as Tsunade stepped forward to attack Madara, Mei interjected to counter Madara's
fire technique
 with a
large volume of water
 followed immediately by a
water dragon
, sending him flying into the air where he was attacked by Tsunade, A, and Ōnoki. Mei later stared in shock as Tsunade was impaled by Madara's
Susanoo Sword
, revealing they had sealed Madara's
wood clone
 instead of the real one. Tsunade quickly recovered and launched a counterattack alongside Ōnoki on Madara, to no avail. As Madara retorted Tsunade's mockery for his use of clones, Mei told Madara to not look down on them because they were fighting him altogether, but instead take it as an acknowledgement of his power. Madara created twenty-five wood clones to surround the five Kage, returning Mei's comment and asking them if they want the clones to use
Susanoo
 or not.






The five Kage stand against Madara's Susanoo army.



Mei became overwhelmed by five of the Susanoo-clad clones, but rallied to the side of the other Kage after once again being spurred on by Ōnoki to continue fighting. After Ōnoki destroyed all of the Susanoo-clad clones, Mei, A and Gaara attacked Madara with a
sand
 and
lightning
-
enhanced water dragon
 to prevent him from escaping. As the sealing nearly completed, Madara foiled their efforts by releasing his Complete Body — Susanoo, declaring that even the power of the five Kage was futile against his technique. Awestruck at the newly-formed giant construct, Mei was knocked off her feet along with the other Kage from a single swing of Madara's Susanoo sword. As she and the other Kage later stood to face Madara again, she listened on to the Ōnoki's words of encouragement. As Madara prepared another attack with his Susanoo sword, however, Mei remarked that it seemed like the end for them before being silenced by the still-defiant A.






Mei defeated by Madara.



Bewildered as a light suddenly surrounded Madara, Mei wondered what exactly was transpiring before being told that the Impure World Reincarnation technique had been cancelled. When Madara didn't disappear with the technique's deactivation, Mei questioned whether he had been restored. Madara responded by severing the Impure World Reincarnation's contract with the summoner, allowing him to remain in the living world with his reincarnation benefits. He criticised a horrified and shocked Mei for not understanding that, after fighting him, he was not one to let himself be under someone else's control. As Madara prepared to leave to capture Naruto, Mei urged a still defiant Ōnoki their opponent was too strong, to which Ōnoki responded that they needed stop Madara no matter what. Despite their attempt to stop Madara from leaving their battlefield, Mei and the other Kage were ultimately defeated and left severely wounded.






Mei and the other Kage healed.



Later, upon the arrival of
Karin
,
Suigetsu
 and
Orochimaru
 at the battlefield,
Tsunade
 was healed by Karin. After being considerably healed, she in turn helped in healing Mei and the other Kage. With no time to lose, they all made their way to the battlefield atop Gaara's
sand
. While closing in on the battlefield, the Kage noticed the tree form of
Ten-Tails
 in the distance and were updated by Katsuyu as to what was happening on the battlefield. They are later contacted by a
reincarnated

Hashirama Senju

telepathically
 to update all everyone on what he had uncovered during his battle with Madara. As Naruto's anger at the comrades he had fought so hard to protect grew, his emotions and memories were channelled to everyone within range of
Ino Yamanaka
's technique.

Birth of the Ten-Tails' Jinchūriki

The five Kage arrive on the battlefield.



Later when Hashirama — through the same medium — shared his own memories, Mei recognised the scene as the first Summit of the five Kage before arriving on the battlefield as Hashirama declared his wishes for the future of the world. After echoing A's sentiments that protecting their dreams was a moot point, Mei made her way to one corner of the battlefield. Rallying the troops there, Mei noted that it was unacceptable to be late to the battlefield as a woman before telling those around her that they were heading out.






Mei caught in the Infinite Tsukuyomi.



She later confronted
Tobi
 alongside A and Ōnoki. After being overwhelmed due to not being able to use jutsu because of her chakra level, she and the remainder of the Allied Forces were saved from Tobi's elemental attacks by the
Third Hokage
's
shadow clones
. Afterwards, she fell victim to Madara's
Infinite Tsukuyomi
 and was
bound
 by the holy tree afterwards. Inside of the genjutsu, she dreamed of finally getting married while the other Kage attended the ceremony.

Two years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, with the

 beginning to descend towards Earth, the five Kage band together once more to discuss their solution to this ongoing threat. Mei was later seen destroying meteorites with her
Water Release
 and
Lava Release
. When
Kakashi
 pleaded with A to halt blasting the moon due to
Naruto
 and the others being on there, Mei voiced her support, noting that Naruto, as the hero from the
previous war
, is one worth betting on.

Mei recruits the Lightning Gang into Kirigakure.



Mei watches as a ship with one hundred Kiri-nin sets sail for Kumo to take part in a joint training exercise. She marvels at how different things have become since the days of the "Bloody Mist", when Kiri's ninja knew constant violence, competition, and deceit. She knows that some will reject the village's new peace, but she believes it is worth fighting for.

The ship is intercepted and the Kiri-nin are
forced
 to take part in suicide attacks against the hidden villages. Because of Konoha's ninja, the attacks are repelled and many of the captured Kiri-nin are safely freed. Mei asks the Hokage to recruit those behind the attack -
Chino
,
Nowaki
, and
Amuda
 - to join Kirigakure in rooting out the injustices of the world that caused them to attack the hidden villages in the first place.

New Era

In the following years, Mei worked to continue modernising the village, both in its cultural design and of peaceful relationships between people. Eventually, Mei stepped down as Mizukage and passed on the title to Chōjūrō, who continued her work and succeeded in advancing the village. Twelve years after the war, she remained single, complaining about the scarcity of nice men in her life. On the day of the
Five Kage Summit
, she and the other retired Kage visit Ōnoki at the Tsuchikage's residence, where he remained living at.

School Trip Arc

Main article:
School Trip Arc

In the anime, to improve relationships with the two hidden villages, it was approved for Konohagakure's Academy class to visit Kirigakure. On the class' way to meet with Chōjūrō, Mei passed by, who was introduced to the class by
Kagura Karatachi
. While the Kiri representative praised Mei's reputation, the retired Kage humbly brushed it off, noting how her era of being in the spotlight was over.






Mei discussing Kiri's affairs with Shino and Anko.



Later, Mei met with
Anko Mitarashi
 and
Shino Aburame
 about the growing conflict between the Land of Water and neighbouring countries. As the Land of Water wishes to expand military power into the bordering seas, Mei feared that this could escalate into war again. Despite this, Mei assured them that Kirigakure was strongly against all this and that she with the Sixth Mizukage would work to prevent it all.

When it was learned that the Seven Mist Swordsmen blades were stolen by
Shizuma Hoshigaki
's
group
 thanks to Kagura's aid, Mei and Chōjūrō began discussing how to handle this. They were interrupted by
Boruto Uzumaki
 and
Sarada Uchiha
, the latter of which insisted that Kagura was only being manipulated. Boruto also insisted to treat this as a children's fight so as to not make a public scene. While Mei admired Boruto's cleverness on how to minimise the situation, she still had her doubts about this, until Boruto pointed out that as the Hokage's son, being injured by rebels could result in an international problem. Mei conceded to Boruto's boldness. Chōjūrō agreed to this on the condition that he join them in ending the revolt and if it was completed before curfew.

Later, Mei learned and gained proof that members of the Land of Water's forces were conspiring with the Land of Waves. With this, she quickly rounded up the traitors to interrogate them. Mei saw the Konoha class off as they returned home.

Creation and Conception

Masashi Kishimoto
 noted that in order to give the Mizukage a measure of attractiveness, he could not make her too young, and as such she is in her thirties. Her long hair, and elaborate hairstyle is also done to aid in this effect. Due to her age, he decided to make her eager to get married as well. Overall, he noted that it took great trial and error to get Mei to look the way he envisioned. In the earlier stages of her conception, she was drawn with high heels.

Trivia

Springtime of Youth

The
Springtime of Youth
 wiki
 has an article about this topic:

Mei Terumī

Mei as the Mizukage can be seen as a sign of change for the village as ninja with kekkei genkai were once feared and persecuted in this village. Mei herself has stated that the dark days of the village were over.

The kanji for "Terumī" means
"shining beauty"
. However, they are usually pronounced with a lengthened "I" sound. This, together with the fact that the furigana are written in katakana, suggests that her name is meant to invoke a different meaning.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3
, as seen in the mailing system in-game, Ao tells a tale of when he saw Mei without her make-up, making suggestions to how horrifying she looked, but breaking off mid-sentence. Also, as shown in several side quests, she enjoys being called "Miss" Mizukage by Naruto.

In
Tsunade
's Infinite Tsukuyomi dream, Mei, along with
A
 and
Ōnoki
, were killed and transformed into human puppets by
Sasori
.

According to
Kakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy Sky
, only families who were annexed into Kirigakure were to partake the Academy's death match graduation ritual.
 Mei, having participated in it, indicates her family was conquered by the village.
