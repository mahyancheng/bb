This is a technique used by the
Four Celestial Symbols Men
. Devised to counter
Gaara
's
sand
, the formation draws upon their weapons (
Weaknessless Soaring Shortswords
,
Garian Sword
 and
Hōki
's unnamed
fire-shooting sword
), arranged in a triangle with Gaara at the centre. The three members will use three underground waterways to connect their formation, which will converge under their target. With their weapons charged with their
chakra
, they will then activate the technique, sending a surge of power through the waterways to the central target. This will cause a water dragon to rise from the ground and envelop Gaara, soaking his sand and making it become much heavier. This causes it to clump and makes it near impossible to utilise.

Trivia

The usual pronunciation of 逆鱗 is "gekirin", when read as that, it means "imperial wrath".
