Nonota
 (
ノノタ
) is a
Sunagakure

shinobi
.

Personality

Nonota is rather prone to panicking, getting visibly distressed as
Musai
 described the nature of
Toroi
's techniques after being
magnetised
.

Appearance

Nonota's most noticeable feature were the green markings on his cheeks that ended with two spikes pointing towards his face. He wore the standard attire of the Suna shinobi complete with the ghutrah and the black
forehead protector
 of the Alliance.

Abilities

Like many Sunagakure shinobi, Nonota is capable of using the
Cloth Binding Technique
 and the
Sealing Tag
 to seal his opponents.
 He also has fast reflexes, being able to defend himself against Toroi's
shuriken
.

Part II

Fourth Shinobi World War: Confrontation

During the
Fourth Shinobi World War
, he and Musai were ambushed by a
reincarnated
 Toroi. Musai recognised Toroi, and began explaining his abilities to Nonota, but they're attacked before he can finished. After Nonota was magnetised, Musai finished explaining Toroi's abilities to an increasingly apprehensive Nonota. Both are saved by the arrival of
Naruto Uzumaki
 and
Killer B
, Naruto slamming Toroi with a
Rasengan
. As Toroi regenerated, Nonota proceeded to seal him.

In the anime, after they left, Nonota and Musai were briefly suspicious of the other being a transformed White Zetsu as well, before realising the enemy tried to kill them both, meaning they were both on the same side. They laughed it off, and then Musai joked, pretending to be a transformed White Zetsu, only for Nonota to slash his nose with a kunai in defence.

He and Musai later met up with their regiment while carrying Toroi, after explaining how Naruto and B had saved them,
Torune
 arrived and summoned a group of Kabuto's "failures" to retrieve Toroi and the Third Raikage.

Trivia

Though a nameless character in the manga, Nonota's name comes from the ending credits from the anime.
