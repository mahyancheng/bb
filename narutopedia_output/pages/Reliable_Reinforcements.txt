Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Despite her best efforts,
Chiyo
 can do nothing to help
Kankurō
. She suggests that only
Tsunade
 would be able to counteract
Sasori
's poison.
Team 7
 and
Temari
 arrive in
Sunagakure
 shortly afterwards and are informed of Kankurō's condition. Temari goes to see him and
Sakura
, Tsunade's disciple, offers to cure him. She removes the poison from his body and asks Chiyo to help her find ingredients for an antidote. Tsunade, meanwhile, is concerned that Team 7 may have difficulties with rescuing
Gaara
 so sends
Team Guy
 as backup.
