This technique enables the user to
sense
 hostility,
 hatred and other evil emotions within others.

Usage

The
tailed beast
 Kurama is able to sense emotions such as hatred and
killing intent
 in individuals around it. Kurama has used this ability to find Naruto Uzumaki's
inner hatred
,
 which has brought it close to breaking the
seal
 which contained it numerous times before Naruto took control of the fox's
chakra
 himself.

When Naruto achieved the
Nine-Tails Chakra Mode
, he in turn gained access to this ability, aptly displayed when he uncovered
Kisame Hoshigaki
 hiding within
Samehada
 — even though Kisame and the sword both shared the same chakra signature.

Trivia

In
Boruto
 episode 61
, Naruto appears to sense the arrival of the
Ōtsutsuki Clan
 members. It's unclear if he used this ability, since he had not entered his Chakra Mode.

Despite
Minato Namikaze
 having mastered full control of Yin-Kurama sealed inside of him, he didn't demonstrate access to this technique.

Thanks to this technique, Naruto was key in weeding out the transformed
White Zetsu Army
 clones that were wreaking havoc on the
Allied Shinobi Forces
 during the first night of the
Fourth Shinobi World War
.

In
Naruto the Movie: Blood Prison
,
Satori
 possessed a similar ability, though it could only sense fear.
