By interfering with the
natural energy
 using its immeasurable amount of chakra, the Ten-Tails is able to simultaneously create a variety of
natural disasters
 that devastate the surrounding area, with itself acting as their epicentre. The phenomena involved in this technique include: earthquakes, floods, thunderstorms, and tornadoes. These concurrent events result in a blast akin to a nuclear explosion, even forming a vast
mushroom cloud
.

Influence

Tenpenchii
 (
天変地異
) is a Japanese
four-character idiom
, comprised of two shorter words referring to natural disasters affecting the sky,
tenpen
 (
天変
), and the earth,
chii
 (
地異
). The idiom is often translated simply as "cataclysm".

Trivia

The
Demonic Statue of the Outer Path
 is shown producing individual disasters from its body: a lightning strike and a shockwave. In the manga, the shockwave resembles flames.

In a flashback during
chapter 670
,
Kaguya Ōtsutsuki
 is shown seemingly casting a lightning storm on the landscape, similar to the Tenpenchii.
Shibai
 can similarly create lightning storms with a wave of his hand through
shinjutsu
.

In
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution
 and
Naruto Shippūden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4
, the Ten-Tails is also capable of using Tenpenchii to cause fiery eruptions.
