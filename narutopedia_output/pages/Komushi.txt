Komushi
 (
コムシ
) was a young
shinobi
 from
Sunagakure
.

Background






Komushi infected by the poison in the puppet arm.



Komushi grew up during the tenure of the
Third Kazekage
, where he primarily worked as a messenger for
Chiyo
 to her grandson
Sasori
, with whom he had a friendly relationship. During a border-patrol mission Komushi was wounded and subsequently lost an arm. This was later replaced by Sasori with that of a
puppet
 as a
prosthetic limb
. Later he ingested some of Sasori's
poison
 by mistake and died while Chiyo tried to save him. Because he knew Sasori would be blamed, Komushi's last request was that Sasori would not be blamed for his own careless mistake. Due to his mother's pleading to bring Komushi back to her, Sasori later turned him into a
human puppet
.

Personality






Komushi observing Sasori working on his puppets.



Komushi was a friendly and eager shinobi, who craved recognition and admiration as a shinobi, akin to that which Sasori received for his outstanding puppets. He showed great care for his friend and confided in him his pains and goals; in his dying moments, he pleaded Chiyo to not blame Sasori for his death. Komushi also yearned not to be treated like a child by his mother.

Appearance

Komushi had chin-length brown hair, a square jaw and large green eyes. For an outfit he wore a green jacket with rolled up sleeves over a dark-grey under-shirt and dark shorts. He had a
shuriken
 holster was strapped to his right thigh. After an accident on a mission, he had a puppet arm surgically attached in place of his lost right arm.

Abilities






Komushi with his new puppet arm.



While seemingly unskilled, Komushi's attached puppet arm could extend a hidden blade from the palm to be used offensively, his puppet arm was coated in Sasori's special made poison. Komushi must have been able to use
chakra threads
 and the
Puppet Technique
 to be able to use this puppet arm.

He also seemed knowledgeable in herbs since he could distinguish the rarity of the herbs on Sasori's poison ingredients list.

Trivia

When written as 小虫, Komushi literally means "midge".
