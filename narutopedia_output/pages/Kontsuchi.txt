Mitsuki's Disappearance Arc

Kontsuchi was present when the
Fourth Tsuchikage
 received a phone call from
Seventh Hokage
. After Kurotsuchi promised Naruto about investigating matters and safely capturing and bringing three
Konoha

genin
 that unofficially were tracking the attackers in the goal of retrieving
Mitsuki
, Kontsuchi was also shown concerned.






Kontsuchi manipulated by Kirara's genjutsu.



Later, after checking on the elderly
Third Tsuchikage
's health, Kontsuchi talked with Kurotsuchi on how best to handle the situation without attracting too much attention. As he suggested talking to his
Anbu
 nephew, Kontsuchi was knocked out by
Kū
 and his artificial humans. Afterwards, Kontsuchi was placed under
genjutsu
 by
Kirara
, and was made to take all calls at the Tsuchikage's office, telling callers that Kurotsuchi was away on a private mission.

When Kirara's body began failing her, the genjutsu she placed on Kontsuchi faded, causing him to collapse and alerting other officials on something being off in the village. After coming to, Kontsuchi decided to call the other villages about recent events. Before he could do so, Kū and his army abducted him again and took over the entire village. While captured, he began planning with his fellow shinobi on how best to handle the situation without endangering the defenceless villagers. Kontsuchi and the others were later rescued by the Fourth Tsuchikage, who was freed by a
masked man
. Kontsuchi then joined the Tsuchikage with all other able shinobi to take down the
Akuta
. After the
Fabrications
' defeat, Kontsuchi attended the Third Tsuchikage's funeral with the Five Kage.
