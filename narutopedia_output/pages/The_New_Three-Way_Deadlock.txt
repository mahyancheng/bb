"
The New Three-Way Deadlock
" (
新たなる三竦み
,
Aratanaru Sansukumi
) is episode 374 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

To solve the main problems of the battle that
Sai
 mentioned earlier: they need to get past the Ten-Tails'
defence
 and heal the wounded on the front lines —
Naruto
,
Sasuke
 and
Sakura
 summon
Gamakichi
,
Aoda
, and
Katsuyu
 as solutions respectively.
Hiruzen
 remarks how the new trio remind him of the previous
three-way deadlock
. Naruto remarks his summoning's growth in body and attitude before the latter jumps high into the air over the beasts' guards and fends off attacks while Sakura uses her summoning to heal the wounded shinobi as an observing
Shizune
 silently praises the former's power.
 Meanwhile, Sasuke easily slips and cuts through all guards and defence with the aid of his summoning and
Susanoo
. Once he has a clear view of the
Ten-Tails
, he aims his
Amaterasu bow and arrow
 at the same time Naruto readies his
giant Rasenshuriken
 from above. Naruto recalls to the time of his Rasenshuriken training during which he stated to
Yamato
 that he and Sasuke are compatible not because his
wind
 beats the latter's
lightning
, but because his wind can power up the former's
fire
. As a result of the wind powering the flames, a
spiralling mass of black flames
 is created and hits the beast as a slightly tearful Sakura and their
classmates
 cheer them on.

Trivia

A small inconsistency occurs in the episode. In
episode 35
,
Jiraiya
 stated he nearly faced death twice and stated both times. Yet, in the flashback within this episode proved otherwise as
Orochimaru
 nearly slays an injured Jiraiya.

In one scene, the inner design Sasuke's Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan from Itachi was shown as red with a black outline, rather than be black entirely.
