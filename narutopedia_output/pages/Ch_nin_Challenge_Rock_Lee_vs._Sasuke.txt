Kiai Hyaku-Nijū Pāsento	Naude Rokku na Chōsenjō!
) is episode 22 of the original
Naruto
 anime.

Synopsis

Sasuke
 has attracted the attention of
Rock Lee
, who challenges him to a fight. Lee is not only interested in seeing how his skills match up against a descendant of the
Uchiha clan
, but he also has a crush on
Sakura
, much to her dismay. Feeling neglected in his teammates shadows,
Naruto
 offers to fight in Sasuke's place. Without wasting time, he charges at Lee, but is easily knocked unconscious. Lee explains they simply cannot beat him, as he is the strongest of the
Konohagakure
 genin right now.

Finally interested, Sasuke accepts his challenge, and attacks. He’s instantly met with Lee's
Leaf Whirlwind
 and goes flying backwards. Getting back up, Sasuke prepares, resorting to his
Sharingan
 to figure out Lee's technique this time. Again, this is futile and Lee explains it’s because his techniques are neither
ninjutsu
 or
genjutsu
, but mere
taijutsu
, also known as martial arts. With hand-to-hand combat, the Sharingan isn't helpful, even if he can see the techniques, one’s body cannot move fast enough to react. Lee uses the
Shadow of the Dancing Leaf
 to kick off his next move in order to finish off Sasuke, but a large
turtle
 stops him before he carries this out.

The turtle seemingly reprimands Lee for using a forbidden technique, leaving Naruto to think the turtle is Lee's sensei.
Might Guy
, his actual sensei, appears on top of the turtle and punches Lee across the face as punishment, proceeding to hug him, and cry afterward.
Team 7
 are dumbstruck, and Sasuke can't believe he was beaten by what he perceives as a freak. Guy asks the team how his eternal rival,
Kakashi
, is doing. He's ahead in their match record, which stands at 50 wins and 49 losses. Guy also says that he is much faster and stronger than Kakashi.

When Guy leaves, Lee confesses that he is not the strongest genin -
Neji Hyūga
, his teammate is. Naruto needles Sasuke, saying that Lee obviously trains harder than him. In the end, the team focuses their attention on the
Chūnin Exams
.
