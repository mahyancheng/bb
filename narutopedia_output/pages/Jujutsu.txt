Hidan using a Jujutsu.



Jujutsu
 (
呪術
,
Viz:
 Curse Jutsu,
literally meaning:
 Curse Technique) are a type of techniques that harm the enemy by cursing them. They work similar to
juinjutsu
, however, the user doesn't have to apply a seal on the enemy to curse them.

The two named techniques of this type are associated primarily with the deity
Jashin
 and his cult:
Hidan
's
Curse Technique: Death Controlling Possessed Blood
 and
Ryūki
's
Curse Technique: Body Controlling Manipulated Blood
, where both requires the enemy's blood to curse the victim. In
The Last: Naruto the Movie
, an unnamed jujutsu was applied to the
Tenseigan
 orb, making it impossible to be destroyed by anyone not part of
Hamura Ōtsutsuki
's lineage, instead draining them of their
chakra
.
Mitsuki
 is noted to be skilled in jujutsu.
