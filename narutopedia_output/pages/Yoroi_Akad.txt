Yoroi Akadō
 (
赤胴ヨロイ
,
Akadō Yoroi
) is a
Konohagakure

shinobi
 and a teammate of
Kabuto Yakushi
 and
Misumi Tsurugi
, who later defected and joined
Orochimaru
 and
Otogakure
.

Background

Yoroi was previously a shinobi of Konohagakure. For unknown reasons, he defected to Otogakure with his teammate, Misumi Tsurugi. He and his team were able to keep their defection a secret, and at some point, Orochimaru had them participate in the
Chūnin Exams
 to spy on the other participants.

Personality

Yoroi was a brash and strong-willed ninja who usually felt confident about fighting his opponents and would toy with his opponent frequently. He possessed a very arrogant side and loved to boast about his own abilities. Often times however his toying with opponents led to him losing his struggles rather than emerging with victory. He was also described as being greatly self-confident and unsociable.

Appearance






Yoroi after defecting.



Yoroi's appearance was greatly concealed by the mask he wore around his mouth that hung to around his neck, sunglasses that obscured his eyes and
forehead protector
 which he wore like a bandanna. He also wore what appears to be the standard attire of his team consisting of a high-collared, sleeveless, purple shirt with a short-sleeved, white one underneath, a simple obi around his waist, purple pants, blue sandals and purple fingerless gloves. After defecting from
Konohagakure
, he wore a simple shirt with the sleeves rolled up, pants and sandals. It was also revealed that he had black shoulder-length hair.

Abilities






Yoroi absorbing Sasuke's chakra.



Yoroi's most notable ability was his capacity to
absorb
 the physical and spiritual energy of an opponent by simply coming into physical contact with them. Yoroi was quite proficient with this technique, as he was able to drain
Sasuke
's chakra even by just slightly grazing his hair. This extra chakra could also be utilised by himself to perform chakra-taxing techniques.

In the anime, Yoroi demonstrates a greater assortment of techniques such as the
Demonic Illusion: Descending Hell Technique
, which creates an illusionary ball of fire in the sky to frighten his opponents. He also shows proficiency in water-based techniques, using both the
Water Clone Technique
 and the
Water Release: Great Waterfall Flow Technique
 against
Shino
. He also demonstrates a technique in which he strikes the ground with his fist and
creates a shockwave that paralyses Shino
 (who was actually an
insect clone
).

Sasuke defeating Yoroi.



Yoroi, who at the time was in
Kabuto's Genin Team
, participated in the
Chūnin Exams
 with a task given to him and his fellow teammates by
Orochimaru
. During the second round where all the students should enter the
Forest of Death
, Yoroi and Misumi managed to pass by reaching the exam hall and reunite with Kabuto.  Later they met with Orochimaru and told him the information they have got and were told to do as he says. During the preliminaries he is matched against
Sasuke Uchiha
. Yoroi utilised a very unique technique that allowed him to
absorb the chakra of his opponents
, making it very difficult for Sasuke to battle, let alone keep his
cursed seal
 under control. Despite this, Sasuke defeated Yoroi with his newly devised taijutsu, the
Lion Combo
. Yoroi was last seen being taken to the medical infirmary for treatment.

Shino stops Yoroi from attacking Ino.



Though Yoroi and Misumi are not reintroduced in the manga, they make a second appearance in the anime as research assistants and bodyguards to Orochimaru's former scientist,
Amachi
. He, like Misumi, has taken off the cloth covering his lower face and has completely changed his wardrobe. Yoroi, too, has displayed a variety of anime-exclusive techniques and different ways of manoeuvring his
Chakra Absorption Technique
. During the events of this arc, he fights
Shino Aburame
 twice; in the first battle, he is forced to retreat due to the fact that the cave the two were fighting in was collapsing. During the second battle, he is ultimately defeated and sinks beneath the water after a final attack by Shino's bugs. Currently, his status is unknown.

Trivia

"Akadō" literally means "red body", whereas "yoroi" (
鎧
) literally means "armour". Yoroi's name may be based on the
Sengoku period
 practice of wearing bright-red armour to instil fear upon the enemy. This tactic, called "akazonae" (
赤備え
,
literally meaning:
 to be armed with red), was most famously used by
Ii Naomasa
, one of the
Tokugawa Shitennō
, the four most trusted generals of
Tokugawa Ieyasu
, the first shōgun of the
Tokugawa Shogunate
. This tactic proved so succesful for Naomasa and his forces, that he soon earned the nickname
The Red Devil of the Ii
 (
井伊の赤鬼
,
Ii no Akaoni
).

"
Yoroi
" is the name for a samurai's armour. With his former teammates, Kabuto ("helmet") and Tsurugi ("sword"), they form an armour—helmet—sword trio.

According to the databook(s):

His favourite food is
unagi
