A special type of
taijutsu
 that uses the refined
chakra control
 and concentration required in
medical ninjutsu
 to enhance one's strength to monstrous levels. This is done by storing
chakra
 into one's hands or feet, and releasing it onto the target with pinpoint timing. With this strength, the user can decimate the ground or even kill opponents with a single strike.
 The training for this application is quite arduous, as Tsunade repeatedly came at
Sakura Haruno
 with full force to help her learn.

Trivia

It should be noted that
Tsunade
 already possesses incredible raw strength, capable of crushing stones in a single hand with nothing but pure muscle power.

In
Itachi Shinden: Book of Bright Light
, Itachi can enhance his strikes in a manner similar to this technique.

In
The Last: Naruto the Movie
,
Naruto Uzumaki
 was able to use a similar technique by transferring
Kurama
's
chakra
 to his arm.
