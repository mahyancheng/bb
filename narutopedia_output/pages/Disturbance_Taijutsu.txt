Disturbance Taijutsu
 (
攪乱体術
,
Kakuran Taijutsu
) refers to
Killer B
's unique fighting style.

Usage

Akin to a warrior's dance performance, B is able to rapidly and relentlessly bombard his target, with precision, at various angles and locations. This style, comprised of sheer unpredictable movements, can easily catch his opponents off-guard. Even those who wield the
Sharingan
 have shown to have had trouble keeping up with B's movements and were forced to go on the defensive or retreat.
 B is also able to employ this technique against multiple of opponents, as shown in his fight with
Taka
.

Combining this fighting style's wild nature with swords, B is able to increase the lethality of his attacks. B, using any number of swords can easily close in on and exploit an opponent's vital points.
 To maximise the style's killing potential, he could, in tandem with his seven
swords
, make use of his unique and peculiar
kenjutsu

Acrobat
