The
Rinha Clan
 (
Rinha Ichizoku
) was a clan with specialists in
medical ninjutsu
. They have performed admirably in the past wars. A survivor named
Malice
 was the best of the clan.

Abilities

The Rinha clan specialised in medical ninjutsu and were so proficient that they, during past wars, were targeted by
shinobi
 from other countries, seeking to obtain their techniques.

Kekkei Genkai

The clan also possessed a
Kekkei Genkai
 which enabled them to
absorb

chakra
 from people and
create perfect copies
 of them. They were capable of absorbing the chakra both by direct physical contact or from a distance. Malice showed herself to be capable of even doing this through a
puppet
.
