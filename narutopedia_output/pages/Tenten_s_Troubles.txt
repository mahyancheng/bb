"
Tenten's Troubles
" (
テンテンの悩み
,
Tenten no Nayami
) is episode 404 of the
Naruto: Shippūden
 anime.

Summary

Team Ajisai
 is confronted by
Team Komugi
, who insist to fight for their scroll. Not wanting to bother with a team beneath them,
Ajisai
 and her comrades flee. During the night, Ajisai recalls
Konan
 assigning them to partake the
Chūnin Exams
 in order to, if they are able, capture a
certain

jinchūriki
 and/or gain intel on skilled shinobi from other villages. Elsewhere,
Team Guy
 prepare dinner at nightfall. Unintentionally insulted by
Lee
 while complimenting her usefulness in
sealing items
,
Tenten
 walks off in a huff.
 Tenten thinks back to training with
Might Guy
, who also complimented her usefulness in her techniques, much to Tenten's annoyance, who wishes to have her own special technique. The next day, both the
Amegakure
 and
Konohagakure
 teams converge at the desert ruins and briefly clash. The Ame team again makes another escape, but is tracked by
Neji
's
Byakugan
, forcing them to continue the engagement. During the fight, Tenten and Ajisai are trapped deep beneath the ruins. Postponing their fight, both the teams separately search for their trapped team-mates. Tenten awakens to find herself and Ajisai trapped underground. Tenten walks up to a seemingly unconscious Ajisai to offer water, not knowing the Ame kunoichi plans to strike her with her guard down.
