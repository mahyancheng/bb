Personality

Tonbo, at first glance, gives off a very collected and cool personality. He is described as being very confident in his abilities, although not haughty enough to not acknowledge someone else's talent. He is also somewhat rash and quick-tempered by nature as witnessed when he roughed up
Komaza
 to get his point across.

Appearance

The upper half of his face is completely wrapped in bandages and his
forehead protector
 is drawn all the way over his eyes. He usually has a cigarette in his mouth and wears the standard uniform of the Intelligence Division, which comprises of a grey suit. He also wears bandages around his legs and the standard Konoha shinobi sandals.

Abilities






Tonbo assists Inoichi in extracting intel.



Not much has been seen in the way of Tonbo's abilities but he is skilled enough to aid Inoichi in
delving
 into the minds of the enemy in order to retrieve potentially valuable information. He is also very fast and strong, able to rush towards Komaza in the blink of an eye and easily restrains him with one single arm, stating that "elite" chūnin like him would not miss anything the genin would try.

Tonbo roughs up Komaza.



Tonbo took part in the written section of the
Chūnin Exams
 as one of the various shinobi looking out for cheaters. When he caught Komaza cheating five times, Komaza protested saying there it was impossible they could keep an eye on everyone and accurately keep track of the number of times they were caught. This caused Tonbo to knock him into a wall, telling him that the people there were "elite" chūnin chosen for this task specifically and that they wouldn't miss a single thing they did.

Trivia

"Tonbo" (
蜻蛉
) is Japanese for "dragonfly".
Dragonflies
 are famous for their 360° vision, which is ironic considering that Tonbo's eyes and upper face are covered with bandages. While "Tobitake" means "lying [through] the bamboo". A
taketonbo
 (
竹とんぼ
) is a small bamboo toy that flies when spun between the palms of your hands. So Tonbo's full name could also mean "flying taketonbo".

According to the databook(s):

His favourite food is
yakitori
 and grilled
onigiri
 while his least favourite food is
crème fraîche
.

He is
Mawashi Dokuraku
's junior.
