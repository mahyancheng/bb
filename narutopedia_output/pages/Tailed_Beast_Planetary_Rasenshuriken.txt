Naruto starts with a wind punch, sending the opponent into the air. He then transforms into his Kurama Mode and prepares a giant-sized Rasenshuriken and a Tailed Beast Ball. He throws the Rasenshuriken, then fires four satellite Tailed Beast Balls, circling around the shuriken. As the attack hits the opponent, it explodes, resulting in an enormous dome of blue chakra.
