Viz:
 No Forgiveness…!!) is chapter 158 of the original
Naruto
 manga.

Summary

Tsunade
 refuses to become
Hokage
.
Naruto
 does not care about her answer and suggests dragging her back to
Konoha
 so that she can heal
Kakashi
 and
Sasuke
. Tsunade observes to
Jiraiya
 that Naruto is more obnoxious than the
Fourth Hokage
, his previous disciple. Tsunade goes on to say that the Fourth needlessly gave his life for the village. With the
Third Hokage
 having now done the same, just as the
First Hokage
 and
Second Hokage
 did, Tsunade concludes that being Hokage is a joke. Naruto lashes out at her for insulting the previous Hokage. Tsunade agrees to fight him and, although he is out-classed, he continues trying to attack her. She asks why he cares, to which he responds being Hokage is his dream. Reminded of
Dan
 and
Nawaki
, Tsunade is distracted, giving Naruto a chance to attack with his incomplete
Rasengan
.
